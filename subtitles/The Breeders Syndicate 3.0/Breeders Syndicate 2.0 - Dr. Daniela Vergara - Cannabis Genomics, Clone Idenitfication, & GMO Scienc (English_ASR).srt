welcome to breeder Syndicate we're here

13
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,600
today with Dr Daniela Vergara she

19
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,920
Bloomington she is an emerging crop

20
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,080
specialist at Cornell University and a

21
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,140
research associate and lecturer at the

22
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:25,798
University and a postdoc at Colorado in

23
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:29,239
Boulder starting 2013 in cannabis is

24
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:32,939
that correct yeah I started as a postdoc

25
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:35,280
in um CU Boulder in 2013 and then I

26
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:37,019
became a research associate in 2018 but

27
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,900
yes I started researching kind of

28
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:43,500
business in 2013 at CU Boulder that's

29
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:46,500
perfect so I reached out to you because

30
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,060
you know going through looking at a lot

31
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,399
of the the science that's been done

32
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,859
whether it's by larger organizations

33
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,200
that have worked with breeders and and

34
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:57,478
collected you know DNA and data I've

35
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,820
noticed that there is a big falling out

36
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:02,039
or maybe a disconnecting communication

37
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:04,618
between maybe some of the people that

38
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,380
are more serious in the in the uh

39
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:10,080
traditional cannabis Market versus the

40
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:11,340
the academics uh cannabis world and

41
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,140
there's I feel like there's a big

42
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,300
disconnect so I reached out to you and I

43
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:16,919
was like hey let's talk like I don't

44
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,360
know that anybody's talking you seem

45
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:21,539
really super cool and you actually care

46
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,099
so like I I wanted to talk to you and I

47
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:25,318
thought what better way to do it here

48
00:02:23,098 --> 00:02:26,939
and like maybe record it and for

49
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:29,098
posterity and see if we can get anywhere

50
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:31,020
and what we can learn from each other so

51
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:32,519
so thank you so much for showing up and

52
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,800
sitting down and doing this most people

53
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,800
wouldn't you know not it's not a big

54
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,879
show yet oh thank you I appreciate it

55
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,519
and

56
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:43,739
you know to be honest I don't think that

57
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,039
there is a disconnect between the

58
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:50,519
academic world and the cat the act the

59
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:52,318
science academic cannabis world and the

60
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,120
Cannabis World in general I think that

61
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,518
academics are disconnected from the

62
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,980
world period you know like I think that

63
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:00,959
in general there is a disconnect between

64
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:02,759
what happens in Academia and what

65
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,300
happens in real life and what real life

66
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:08,878
people get so in general not just in

67
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,379
cannabis but overall so I think that you

68
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:12,719
are totally

69
00:03:10,378 --> 00:03:13,979
spot on on what you just said

70
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,620
so

71
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:18,439
one of the first things we talked about

72
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:22,019
was

73
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:25,079
how genetics work out what we see what

74
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:27,180
we don't see but I figured with our show

75
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,800
I wanted to Define some of these terms

76
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,659
that we're going to be using and who

77
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,280
better to to help me Define them than

78
00:03:30,658 --> 00:03:34,979
someone that's working with the breeding

79
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,860
program at Cornell so we we talk about

80
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:40,018
phenotypes a lot in cannabis

81
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,459
um and and generally using the term and

82
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:43,620
the way I learned the term was

83
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:45,479
phenotypes are like the observable

84
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,039
traits the physical observable traits

85
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:48,359
and genotypes are the genes that

86
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:50,939
underlie those physical observable

87
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,440
traits is that correct correct so when

88
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:55,318
we use the term phenotypes we are

89
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:57,060
referring to the observable traits and

90
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:59,158
and so people understand there are genes

91
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:02,158
underlying those observable traits which

92
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:03,120
are the actual genotypes am I

93
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,500
pronouncing correctly is there anything

94
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,900
I'm missing out though

95
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,878
so in general a phenotype you can

96
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,860
measure somehow so a phenotype could be

97
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:14,399
height that you can measure using a

98
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:16,500
meter stick yeah or weight or you know

99
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,340
in cannabis is cannabinoids that you can

100
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:23,459
measure using uh an hplc or a GC machine

101
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:28,319
right so a phenotype you can measure

102
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:31,079
somehow with a tool right yeah and genes

103
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:33,959
need a gene mapping tool of some sort or

104
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:36,478
measuring tool is there some sequence

105
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:38,698
right you need to sequence so to you for

106
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:41,758
you to see the letters of the DNA in

107
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:45,660
order to figure out the gene right so so

108
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:48,000
in general the DNA has four letters yes

109
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:50,759
but and those four letters are repeated

110
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,759
in the genome in different

111
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:55,919
you know different amounts Etc you can

112
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:59,100
quantify like there's a thing that you

113
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:01,978
can quantify that number of G's or C's

114
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:04,199
it's g c a and t so the number of GC is

115
00:05:01,978 --> 00:05:06,418
in your in your genomic content you can

116
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,580
quantify that but yes so you need in

117
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:10,500
order to figure out a gene you need to

118
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:12,959
sequence that Gene there's many

119
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,160
different ways in for you to be able to

120
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:16,799
sequence that it's kind of like

121
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,780
transcribe the gene in order to figure

122
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,939
out the specific

123
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:23,819
um letters of the gene but but you can

124
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:25,199
it's a much more complicated process you

125
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:28,019
know like I can measure your height

126
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:31,199
easily yeah and then if you are

127
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:34,319
measuring the height or the number of

128
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,900
leaves or the number of of nodes of a

129
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:39,779
plant you you can do that fairly

130
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:42,120
easily yeah but in order for you to take

131
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:43,679
the DNA out so you need to do a DNA

132
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,840
extraction and then you need to take

133
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,300
that DNA extraction into a facility that

134
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:50,399
sequence it for you and so it's a much

135
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,180
more complex

136
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,839
um

137
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:57,240
methodology yeah possible you know yeah

138
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:59,339
we do it but yeah

139
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,139
so is this what you do at Cornell are

140
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:04,019
you working at the gene level on the

141
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:06,180
plants no at Cornell I'm actually part

142
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:08,339
of the extension so I'm not for now

143
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:11,699
Cooperative Extension so I'm actually

144
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:13,560
working with farmers and the Cannabis

145
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:15,840
industry in general and the hemp

146
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:19,800
industry so cannabis at all levels right

147
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:22,019
so for mostly for for grain and for

148
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,199
fiber and for cannabinoids that are not

149
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:27,959
THC because THC it's still federally

150
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:32,699
regulated and as academic institutions

151
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:35,638
we cannot work with high THC but uh we

152
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:37,259
do work with other cannabinoids which is

153
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:40,319
kind of like a similar thing right what

154
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:45,000
you do to enhance CBD you do to enhance

155
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:47,939
THC so um so I do work with with I I do

156
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,899
go to to facilities and to work with

157
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:54,300
Growers and breeders and yeah so you're

158
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:56,279
you're from Colombia what was the

159
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,379
attitude in Colombia like growing up for

160
00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:00,239
a young lady you know just an average

161
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:02,339
young lady where you grew up was it was

162
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,538
it positive was it negative

163
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:05,538
when I grew up

164
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:12,660
so I grew up during a very violent time

165
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:15,959
I think that Colombia has never not had

166
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:18,860
a violent time yeah but I grew up during

167
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:20,399
the Narco time yeah um

168
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,580
and

169
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:26,219
um it was a very violent time

170
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:29,339
um and um

171
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:31,380
yeah so so that at that time they were

172
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:34,500
putting moms in

173
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:38,699
um discos and bars

174
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:43,860
um and uh my hometown Cali Colombia is

175
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:45,240
was the Hub of a Big Cartel yeah cartel

176
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:49,620
so

177
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:51,180
so it was I mean I I remember my teenage

178
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,598
years on

179
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:56,340
very fondly and um I had a lot of fun

180
00:07:54,598 --> 00:07:59,098
with friends and

181
00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:01,258
I would go out dancing but I do remember

182
00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:03,719
my parents my mom

183
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:07,080
my mom is kind of graphic with her

184
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:09,120
language so she would say things like I

185
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:11,219
don't care if you're with a guy

186
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,978
I just want to know where you are

187
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,900
because if there's a bomb I want to know

188
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:19,199
where I'm gonna pick up

189
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:21,779
The Leftovers of my daughter wow yes

190
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,699
that's real that's very real

191
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:26,219
yeah it was a little bit more

192
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:29,160
descriptive I'm sure more descriptive

193
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:32,099
than what I just said but yeah and there

194
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:34,139
were I mean I do have very graphic

195
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:38,158
gruesome memories

196
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:38,939
of what was ongoing in the country

197
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:42,599
um

198
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:47,339
so so that was you know I I did grow up

199
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:50,278
in a medium high income

200
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:53,279
a household my dad is a university

201
00:08:50,278 --> 00:08:57,240
Professor so my mom is an attorney

202
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:59,759
they're both the retired types now but

203
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:03,480
um but I did uh grew up in a very

204
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:06,480
intellectual type of family

205
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,639
um we still talk Politics on the table

206
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,580
yeah um

207
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:14,458
which coming to the US was weird for me

208
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:16,019
I'm sure I'm sure being able to like why

209
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:18,719
are you voting for that person you know

210
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:22,019
like asking like questions you know like

211
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,480
just right like not not not in a bad way

212
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:26,580
but tell me what is that person offering

213
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,339
that I should vote for that person sure

214
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:31,560
so yeah especially talking about

215
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:34,019
elections that are coming tomorrow yeah

216
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:35,458
it's very restrained here it's it's like

217
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:37,980
you have to be because you don't know

218
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:39,299
who's leaning which way and it's and

219
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,399
especially now the country is very

220
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:43,799
divided super divided

221
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:46,320
in Colombia as well especially with the

222
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:49,259
last president whom

223
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:52,820
I am kind of proud that that guy got

224
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:52,819
elected Gustavo Pedro

225
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:57,360
not because I think he's perfect like I

226
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:00,600
I don't think any politician is perfect

227
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,220
I disagree with 99 of everything I

228
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,940
disagree with the choices I made this

229
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:08,220
morning yeah right right yeah I am the

230
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,420
most intolerant person in this world you

231
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:13,160
know like

232
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:13,159
five feet two of intolerance

233
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:22,139
but um

234
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:25,139
but uh I I do think that Petro offers

235
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:27,600
a difference he offers something

236
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:29,338
that has never been in Colombia you know

237
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,560
Colombia has always been an oligarchy

238
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:34,800
Colombia has always been a minority that

239
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:37,859
has ruled the country and then after

240
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:42,439
particular presidents before now that

241
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:46,399
oligarchy is the owner of the

242
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:48,560
cocaine exports right like we have to be

243
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:53,759
honest

244
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:56,399
about it that coca is the biggest export

245
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:59,039
in Colombia right that's the country's

246
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:02,159
main export yeah yes right yeah it's

247
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,899
emeralds and bananas and yeah but

248
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:06,419
realistically we know where the majority

249
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:08,519
of the money's coming from yeah yeah and

250
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:09,419
we cannot just be you know like yeah

251
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:14,100
it's

252
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:16,139
it's real yeah yeah so so with that in

253
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,759
mind you know I think that Gustavo Pedro

254
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:19,679
comes with like hey the warring drugs

255
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:23,458
have not worked he gave a speech at the

256
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:25,679
United Nations a month ago or so that I

257
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:28,679
recommend for everyone like I almost

258
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:31,379
cried because he said it out loud like

259
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:32,819
hey this hasn't worked and we need to

260
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:34,439
change things and we need to try

261
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:37,320
something new I mean we already know

262
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:41,160
that the money that Americans have given

263
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:43,920
us to stop the the co-op plantations

264
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:45,719
that that has only brought violence and

265
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:47,399
it doesn't work so let's try to do

266
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,500
something new so I think that or

267
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:52,620
something different and and I think that

268
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:55,019
that that was really important and he is

269
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,659
now looking to I mean

270
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:59,100
medical marijuana has been legalized in

271
00:11:57,659 --> 00:12:03,179
Colombia and now they're looking for

272
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:06,240
recreational marijuana and to be honest

273
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:07,979
I think that all drugs quoting quote

274
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,959
should be legal I mean we still don't

275
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:12,560
have a clear definition of what is a

276
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:15,599
drug yeah you know chocolate is a drug

277
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:17,099
exactly drug yeah so

278
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,420
there are so many things that are drugs

279
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,579
that are intoxicants that could be

280
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:21,899
addicting and that even aren't that

281
00:12:20,578 --> 00:12:23,219
aren't even necessarily affecting your

282
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:24,659
central nervous system that could be

283
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,820
addicting in other ways you know what I

284
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:28,679
mean like so yeah that's not clearly

285
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:30,060
defined and I think people get that

286
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:32,338
pleasure hit from all kinds of different

287
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:33,599
things you know and they could drive all

288
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:36,000
kinds of factors in their life that

289
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,680
could be positive or negative so it's

290
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,059
really open-ended that they the way

291
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:41,759
they've left it and I think anybody

292
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:43,439
who's especially politicians any any

293
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:45,179
politician that's willing to look at the

294
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,160
the War on Drugs the negative effects

295
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:49,919
it's had on everyone

296
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:52,620
um the the way it's driven America's uh

297
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:55,620
like privatized prisons everything it's

298
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:58,919
crazy so yeah I I'm all for anybody

299
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:01,980
pushing for just total abolishment of

300
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:06,419
illegal like the idea of illegal drugs

301
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:09,200
the idea of it I completely agree now I

302
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:11,159
think that maybe you and I are being

303
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,040
utopic you know like I don't know

304
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:16,379
probably yeah probably you know we know

305
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:17,519
that Oregon for example has these laws

306
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:19,439
that

307
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,620
they they legalize a bunch of different

308
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,060
drugs Portugal right as a country did as

309
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:26,278
well

310
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:28,078
Colorado right now has seen the ballot

311
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:33,179
psilocybin

312
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:37,319
um so it is happening in some places but

313
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:38,838
I do think that um that I asking for for

314
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:43,800
total legalization

315
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:46,920
there are many big players that are

316
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:49,439
benefiting from mass incarceration for

317
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:52,679
sure the wars in drugs like the wars and

318
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,839
drugs have been very successful for some

319
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:58,319
people yeah right

320
00:13:54,839 --> 00:14:00,720
um military contracts Galore

321
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,660
so yeah yeah

322
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,540
so when you grew up I I assume because

323
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:08,278
it was like Narco Wars where he grew up

324
00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:10,740
was the attitude of your parents like

325
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:12,299
more down on cannabis like you cannot we

326
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:15,419
do not want to see you using cannabis or

327
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:18,838
were they more open-minded on it

328
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:23,159
so my parents have always been kind of

329
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:24,360
the hippies of their families in a way

330
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:27,240
um even though

331
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:31,079
you know I again I my family has always

332
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:33,600
been kind of in Academia and and

333
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:36,239
that stuff my dad is

334
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,399
um a physics professor and I grew up

335
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,240
going to his university

336
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,759
um

337
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,399
studying music I had music lessons there

338
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:46,980
when I was a child so I've always grown

339
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,019
up in a university environment like I've

340
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:51,120
never in my life ever left that

341
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:54,959
University could have really that that's

342
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:57,060
crazy it is crazy I've just changed you

343
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:59,759
know different University from different

344
00:14:57,059 --> 00:15:03,838
places in Colombia or in the US but I've

345
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:05,639
always been on a sort of Campus

346
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,160
um wow

347
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:09,839
that is wild I mean to surround yourself

348
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:13,379
with education like that though it's got

349
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:16,920
to be your passion to constantly learn

350
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:20,458
yeah but as I told you I'm an intolerant

351
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:23,159
human being and I have my big fights

352
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:25,679
with Academia every single day and with

353
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:28,620
bureaucracy every single day and with

354
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:32,278
you know like I have my big fights about

355
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:34,560
you I don't believe in the education

356
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:38,220
system I think that it's again

357
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:40,439
benefiting a tiny minority

358
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:42,839
um I don't think that this thing that

359
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,980
biting is proposing about about student

360
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:45,899
loan

361
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,759
I think it should pass don't get me

362
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:50,399
wrong but I think that that is just a

363
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:53,278
little Band-Aid right oh sure sure it's

364
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,799
better than nothing but it is not

365
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:58,620
solving the problem I think that all of

366
00:15:55,799 --> 00:16:01,319
these academic institutions some more

367
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:04,320
than others and because I've been in the

368
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:06,420
US I've been up in in three now I kind

369
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,399
of you know know a little bit about them

370
00:16:06,419 --> 00:16:12,179
and I have academic friends all over so

371
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:15,179
I I kind of know how they work but these

372
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:17,099
academic institutions are profiting out

373
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:18,958
of the most vulnerable side of the

374
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,159
population which are you know 20 year

375
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:24,659
olds

376
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:28,379
um they are benefiting uh minority of

377
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:31,980
Administrators uh who do not care about

378
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:33,958
the education and in general I feel that

379
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:36,240
professors especially those in tenure

380
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:38,278
track positions are just they're kind of

381
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,320
like oh well you know what can we do oh

382
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:42,419
well yeah you see a lot of that with

383
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,278
tenure like in any any sort of perfect

384
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:46,439
like teaching profession whether it's

385
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:48,000
like Elementary School all the way to

386
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,180
University it's the same thing once they

387
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,698
get that it's just like yeah exactly you

388
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:57,719
got there and you're sitting down no one

389
00:16:53,698 --> 00:17:00,719
can fire you yeah it takes an act of God

390
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:03,060
exactly that is that is a good

391
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:06,959
descriptor it takes an act of God to

392
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:09,240
fire a tenure track professor and they

393
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:12,298
can do Despicable things you know like

394
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:14,400
oh sure harassment sexual harassment and

395
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:17,099
they're still in this tenure track job

396
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:20,699
and so anything can happen they're not

397
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:22,379
gonna fight for their students or few of

398
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:24,959
them are gonna fight for the students I

399
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:27,600
there's some right like I cannot put all

400
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,980
of these people in the same bag but in

401
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,899
general they don't fight for the

402
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:33,120
students they don't fight for changes

403
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:35,280
they don't fight for

404
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:37,739
um you know more funding towards

405
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:40,019
benefiting their Labs whatever they're

406
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:42,359
just there and no one No One's Gonna

407
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:45,900
fire them and they have a secure pension

408
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:47,819
right yeah so so I I that's one of my

409
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,798
fights with Academia is kind of like

410
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:51,240
this

411
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:53,819
lethargic states of the tenure track

412
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,440
professors yeah I think that's a lot of

413
00:17:53,819 --> 00:17:57,298
people that are many of my friends in

414
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,860
Academia that's the one thing that they

415
00:17:57,298 --> 00:18:01,200
have the the most trouble with

416
00:17:58,859 --> 00:18:02,459
especially if they're vocal you know a

417
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,259
lot of people will take it on the chin

418
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:06,360
and just try to go with it and try to

419
00:18:04,259 --> 00:18:07,319
work within that system but like my

420
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:09,058
personality I'm one of those

421
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:11,460
personalities where like I I have no

422
00:18:09,058 --> 00:18:13,558
filter so it just comes out so I don't

423
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,298
know if I'd last in that and I see

424
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:16,798
you're kind of similar so I wonder how

425
00:18:15,298 --> 00:18:19,519
that goes for you

426
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:19,519
well

427
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,900
um

428
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,640
so when I was in CU Boulder I'm still at

429
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:29,460
CU Boulder as a lecturer and as a

430
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:33,780
researcher but when I was there

431
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:35,460
in Colorado that I was in Colorado for

432
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:38,220
eight years

433
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:41,579
um I was part of the Union

434
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:43,620
I am um total Union proponent I feel

435
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:45,899
that in a perfect world you shouldn't

436
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:48,538
have unions because people should not

437
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,980
need to unionize against right like yeah

438
00:18:48,538 --> 00:18:53,460
if people weren't greedy you wouldn't

439
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:56,519
need a union but people are yeah exactly

440
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:59,160
if people weren't yeah you know if there

441
00:18:56,519 --> 00:19:02,759
weren't like elams and Jeff's around

442
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:04,860
yeah exactly yeah yeah then then that

443
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:07,319
you should have Healthcare like you

444
00:19:04,859 --> 00:19:08,879
should have should be normal yeah yeah

445
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:11,519
it should be a given and you should have

446
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,500
parental leave you should right but

447
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,440
because these things are not the norm

448
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,880
then you should unionize and

449
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,340
unfortunately so I was part of the union

450
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,140
and I was very vocal about it and there

451
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:26,220
were some people that did not like it

452
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:28,440
and then you know like I am a very a big

453
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:31,798
proponent of free speech

454
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:33,600
um you can say whatever you want I also

455
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:37,019
have the right to not follow you on

456
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:39,839
Twitter right yeah totally I don't have

457
00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:42,000
the right to tell you Matthew shut up no

458
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:44,879
you can say it but I do have the right

459
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,679
to you know close my ears and yeah and

460
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,360
adults should be able to like make that

461
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:49,500
decision I don't like this you know what

462
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:51,538
I mean like that should be an easy

463
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:54,119
decision like I'm a big proponent of the

464
00:19:51,538 --> 00:19:56,160
block feature on all social media it

465
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:57,899
makes life so much better because like I

466
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,919
don't I don't if someone doesn't like me

467
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,120
and they're gonna say mean things about

468
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:01,559
me I'm not gonna sit there and like

469
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:03,058
dwell on it and I'm gonna be like well

470
00:20:01,558 --> 00:20:04,200
okay cool like now I don't have to see

471
00:20:03,058 --> 00:20:07,319
it ever again you don't have to see me

472
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:10,019
we're cool life goes on you know yeah

473
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:12,538
exactly like I can just mute you there's

474
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:15,000
that option for a reason yeah it's a

475
00:20:12,538 --> 00:20:18,660
great option I love it

476
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,700
but um but and also because

477
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:24,179
um of the Cannabis thing you know when I

478
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:26,819
for me cannabis happened

479
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:28,440
I mean I've always been a pothead we

480
00:20:26,819 --> 00:20:31,918
moved to Colorado

481
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:34,080
I'm out of that closet after women grow

482
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,840
you know after I was in a woman grow

483
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:39,659
event and I was in the first cohort of

484
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:43,319
women grow so I when women grow started

485
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:47,460
back in 2014 with Jane West and and

486
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:50,700
Julie bakewoods and hasmina and I I was

487
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:53,600
part of that and it completely opened my

488
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:57,779
head you know I was coming from my PhD

489
00:20:53,599 --> 00:21:01,740
which I was talking nerd to other nerds

490
00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:03,899
and then I went into a completely

491
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:05,339
different world in Canada for me when I

492
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,660
started working in cannabis it was a

493
00:21:05,339 --> 00:21:08,579
plant that I was going to be studying

494
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:10,440
the genome you know I was really

495
00:21:08,579 --> 00:21:13,139
interested in the male and female thing

496
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:15,000
in cannabis so I was gonna start you

497
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:18,840
know like very academic and then I get

498
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,660
into this industry that for me it was

499
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:23,279
like what the hell this is an industry

500
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:26,700
an entire industry where you have

501
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:29,879
lawyers and you have accountants and you

502
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:32,519
have designers and you have every and so

503
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,980
forth it was like what like what is this

504
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:37,259
a marketer like first time in my life

505
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:40,759
that I met a marketer like what do you

506
00:21:37,259 --> 00:21:43,259
what you know so it was completely

507
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:46,079
mind-blowing and

508
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:47,400
and then when I was in this woman grow

509
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:49,500
events

510
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,120
um I I'm a biology I was a field

511
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,400
biologist for a long time field

512
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:56,339
biologist robber boot type of field

513
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,900
technologist and so when I got there and

514
00:21:56,339 --> 00:22:00,779
I see all of these women you know

515
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:05,880
lipstick and high heels with a joint

516
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:08,639
yeah it I it blew my mind yeah oh I you

517
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,679
know I was a hippie kind of flip-flop

518
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,900
type of thing you know Robert Wood with

519
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:16,320
a joint and then you see these women

520
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:19,500
that are super accomplished oh sure

521
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:23,099
accomplished Economist Finance finite

522
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:26,880
Financial analysts and after that I was

523
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:29,639
I am leaving this closet yeah yeah

524
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,100
and um so

525
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:37,320
so yeah so so the Cannabis industry

526
00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:38,719
opened my scientific sphere and my I

527
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:40,558
guess my

528
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,600
my

529
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:45,538
professional and personal life

530
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:48,839
completely opened it yeah

531
00:22:45,538 --> 00:22:50,879
so when you first started smoking when

532
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:53,099
did you first start realizing that

533
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,360
because I mean the conversation is never

534
00:22:53,099 --> 00:22:57,119
going to go one place when did you first

535
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:59,399
start noticing that maybe like there was

536
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:02,699
there was inconsistency between what you

537
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:04,380
would get at a dispensary uh between

538
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,480
strains that they would assure you were

539
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:08,039
the same thing meaning you know you you

540
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,419
a lot of people go into dispensaries

541
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:11,279
they expect a certain medical effect

542
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:12,659
from whatever certain strain they buy

543
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:14,819
and they want to rely on that medical

544
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:16,620
effect for whatever reason when did you

545
00:23:14,819 --> 00:23:20,779
start noticing any kind of inconsistency

546
00:23:16,619 --> 00:23:20,779
or any of that in cannabis

547
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,460
I'm gonna be honest

548
00:23:24,298 --> 00:23:27,480
and I hope that your listeners do not

549
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,940
hate me

550
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:33,380
no no they won't they're good peeps

551
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:33,380
they're good people okay

552
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:39,780
my palette is either yes or no and it's

553
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:41,100
usually yes you know in general with

554
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:44,940
food

555
00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:47,459
um I am a very good eater I just

556
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:50,519
don't eat you know junk food but in

557
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:52,620
general everything tastes good except

558
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:56,158
for maybe cauliflower without cheese but

559
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:58,619
right for sure it cannabis is the same

560
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,780
thing for me you know like I'm higher

561
00:23:58,619 --> 00:24:04,259
not high there are differences between

562
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:06,859
oh this one really made it very cerebral

563
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:10,740
or this one really gave me a couch lock

564
00:24:06,859 --> 00:24:14,099
or this one just you know it made me

565
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:17,279
like I am completely doing stuff right

566
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:20,699
yeah very active so that is a difference

567
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:22,379
but in terms of anything else plus I

568
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:25,080
have a volcano on when you have a

569
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:27,240
volcano and you vaporize it that way

570
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:32,399
kind of like the smells and all of that

571
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:33,720
is lost yeah so I really

572
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,820
thought

573
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,339
that all of the cannabinoids and

574
00:24:35,819 --> 00:24:39,480
terpenes and all of this was

575
00:24:38,339 --> 00:24:43,439
um

576
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:44,579
just you know potheads saying stuff yeah

577
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,380
like like a lot of people look at

578
00:24:44,579 --> 00:24:50,240
winecon or whatever they call it

579
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:50,240
sommeliers sommeliers yeah yeah

580
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:58,159
I analyzed data for me it was data that

581
00:24:55,859 --> 00:25:00,959
changed my mind when I started analyzing

582
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:03,120
cannabinoid and terpenes and the amounts

583
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,519
and the distribution and the diversity

584
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:08,399
and this one has one another the other

585
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:10,980
then I was like oh this is for real like

586
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,659
this one this is for real and all of

587
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:14,779
these smells and so there's been

588
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:18,419
multiple studies throughout the years

589
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:20,759
that just corroborate that I just have a

590
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:22,320
terrible palette yeah and that's a for

591
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:24,658
real thing and what you're you're

592
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:26,460
describing to me is like with my wife

593
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:28,080
she smoked when she was young like a

594
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:29,220
bunch but she didn't really ever get

595
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:30,778
into like oh I'm gonna smoke this

596
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:32,100
strainer that she didn't care like she

597
00:25:30,778 --> 00:25:34,619
was just getting weed whatever you know

598
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:37,019
so once we got together

599
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:39,119
I you know like I'd say yeah this is you

600
00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:40,918
know X kind of blueberry it's this this

601
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:42,599
and this and she look at me she's like I

602
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:44,759
smell weed like what are you talking

603
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:47,399
about you know like and it took and it's

604
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:49,619
taken until probably the last year to

605
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:51,538
where her palette's finally getting oh I

606
00:25:49,619 --> 00:25:54,839
see what you're saying now like but it

607
00:25:51,538 --> 00:25:57,839
takes a long long time and constant

608
00:25:54,839 --> 00:26:00,480
really getting into it to develop that

609
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:03,119
and an effort right so now when I go to

610
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,038
grows for example I usually what I do is

611
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:07,500
that I rub the plant with my fingers and

612
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:11,900
then I smell my fingers yeah but there's

613
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:15,480
indeed some that smell like skunk

614
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:19,320
there's indeed some that smell like

615
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:21,960
lemon there are others that smell more

616
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:23,939
forestry right like more and there's

617
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,460
definitely the pine thing and then when

618
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,259
you look at the chemotypes in the

619
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:30,419
studies that I've done and then you see

620
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:32,158
oh there is indeed a terpene called

621
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:35,159
pinene and there's this other one better

622
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:38,340
feeling and there's okay so that makes

623
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:42,778
sense yeah so this is not a lie right

624
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:45,778
yeah yeah so so now and recently

625
00:26:42,778 --> 00:26:48,839
uh I got something that smelled really

626
00:26:45,778 --> 00:26:50,880
really skunky and I was like oh man this

627
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:53,819
is really skunky and there is a skunk

628
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:55,200
that lives around my house and I smelled

629
00:26:53,819 --> 00:26:58,558
it and I was like

630
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,419
I get it yeah like I got it we finally

631
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:02,220
made the the scent Connection in your

632
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:05,059
brain to the the smell and everything

633
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,058
yeah yeah

634
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:09,658
so in that sense but but yeah but in

635
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,940
terms of you know I really like there

636
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:13,860
was one strain that we could get in

637
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:17,640
Colorado a long time ago that was around

638
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:20,399
20 yeah 2013 14 15 which was this

639
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:22,740
Tangerine haste uh okay I know exactly

640
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,600
what you're talking about yeah yeah I

641
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:27,960
had friends in Colorado growing it so I

642
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:30,298
know exactly what it is yeah yeah

643
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:34,558
um but other than that

644
00:27:30,298 --> 00:27:37,440
I I also like Edibles so you like really

645
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:38,759
do you like the fact that I mean do you

646
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,440
like Edibles that are super strong and

647
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:43,379
will lay you out for hours or you like

648
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,058
the ones that are more calm and and not

649
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:49,640
as strong

650
00:27:45,058 --> 00:27:49,639
so I always have

651
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,860
right

652
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
right something that has

653
00:27:52,859 --> 00:27:58,259
but um

654
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,778
I like whatever gives me energy to do

655
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:04,859
house chores because I do not understand

656
00:28:00,778 --> 00:28:07,619
how people do house chores How do they

657
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:10,918

you gonna do today I'm gonna clean the

663
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:26,400
toilet like oh yeah exactly no I need

664
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:29,158
you know so I take that cookie and then

665
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:32,538
recently A friend of mine gave me these

666
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:35,580
cookies that have Delta eight okay yeah

667
00:28:32,538 --> 00:28:37,859
and this Delta 8 I love it you know and

668
00:28:35,579 --> 00:28:40,379
I love the chemistry behind it the

669
00:28:37,859 --> 00:28:42,599
biochemistry because all of these

670
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:45,778
compounds the differences where you have

671
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:48,298
these double bonds the carbon so Delta 9

672
00:28:45,778 --> 00:28:50,159
you have the double bond between two

673
00:28:48,298 --> 00:28:53,460
carbons between carbons

674
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:55,200
a eight or nine and then Delta eight you

675
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:58,740
have the double bond between carbon

676
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,840
seven and eight so it's I I like that

677
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:04,740
kind of like okay why is it called This

678
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:07,259
Way besides chemistry has always been

679
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:09,058
um difficult subject for me I you know

680
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:11,158
understand chemistry like

681
00:29:09,058 --> 00:29:13,619
yeah I get it that it doesn't come

682
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:16,799
naturally like I really have to read and

683
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:18,839
the same so um so that he gave me this

684
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:21,379
Delta eight cookies and for me those

685
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:25,939
Delta eat cookies I am super active for

686
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:28,740
three hours and then or four hours Max

687
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:30,840
and then I just fall asleep and it's

688
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:33,740
like falling asleep

689
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:37,158
I could be sitting in the table and then

690
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:40,440
and I just I'm done

691
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:42,299
it's so amazing how how different like

692
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,740
the the Cannabis chemistry affects

693
00:29:42,298 --> 00:29:45,418
everyone's different brain chemistry

694
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:48,359
like vastly different and it could even

695
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:50,278
be like beginning of the day smoking the

696
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:51,778
same exact strain the same amount you

697
00:29:50,278 --> 00:29:54,058
know like will make you feel completely

698
00:29:51,778 --> 00:29:57,058
different than at night sometimes it's

699
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:58,619
it's wild and it's taken me so many

700
00:29:57,058 --> 00:30:01,798
years to understand the variance even

701
00:29:58,619 --> 00:30:03,898
between clones like that that's

702
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:05,940
something a lot of breeders in cannabis

703
00:30:03,898 --> 00:30:07,379
like the past several years like I

704
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,659
haven't really even come to that

705
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:12,059
conclusion or understanding yet like

706
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:13,980
I'll often have people message me and be

707
00:30:12,058 --> 00:30:16,259
like hey I have this clone I bought it

708
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:17,819
at a dispensary I want to know if this

709
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:20,759
is the old clone that you and your group

710
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:23,819
remember from you know 20 years ago so

711
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:26,158
I'll say one I can't identify anything

712
00:30:23,819 --> 00:30:28,019
by pictures and they'll be like why I

713
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,580
don't get it well because it may grow

714
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:31,139
very differently in your room than it

715
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:33,298
does in the other room and people don't

716
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:35,640
get how vast that difference can be it

717
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:37,139
can be I tried to explain uh with the UK

718
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,778
cheese I've had it turn out super

719
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:41,880
blueberry fruity and look you know a

720
00:30:39,778 --> 00:30:44,220
little short and stout all the way to a

721
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:46,080
very lanky tall very what people would

722
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:49,259
consider typically sativa plant that's

723
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:51,058
foot Funk cheese and it's the same clone

724
00:30:49,259 --> 00:30:54,058
so can you talk about some of the the

725
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:55,379
the genetic reasons behind that variance

726
00:30:54,058 --> 00:30:57,678
yeah

727
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,679
um that's

728
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,159
which a physical characteristic is a

729
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:06,778
phenotype anything that you can measure

730
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:08,940
somehow

731
00:31:06,778 --> 00:31:11,579
um it's a product of genes and the

732
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:13,320
environment right there are some

733
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:15,599
physical traits that are more

734
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:17,398
genetically dependent there are others

735
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:20,339
that are more environmentally dependent

736
00:31:17,398 --> 00:31:22,739
and I'm gonna give you the same two

737
00:31:20,339 --> 00:31:24,599
examples that I always give and I hope

738
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:26,880
that if people have been in my talks

739
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:29,398
before I'm sorry

740
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:33,559
um for repeating myself but

741
00:31:29,398 --> 00:31:37,439
human height is highly genetically

742
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:39,119
a heritable right yes it's very genetic

743
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,679
so if your parents are tall it's likely

744
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:41,939
that you're going to be tall if your

745
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:43,820
parents are short it's likely that

746
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:47,220
you're going to be short it's 80

747
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:49,678
heritability so that 20 is environment

748
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:52,558
and that 20 is usually what you ate

749
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:55,740
while you were growing up right yeah you

750
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:58,558
had good nutrition you may achieve that

751
00:31:55,740 --> 00:32:01,159
potential height right yeah if you had

752
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:04,200
poor nutrition you may not but it's 80

753
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:08,278
genetics basically there are other

754
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:09,720
traits like weight which also has a

755
00:32:08,278 --> 00:32:12,119
genetic component there are some people

756
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,620
that are more prone to be you know a

757
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:18,000
little bit thicker than other people

758
00:32:13,619 --> 00:32:20,699
however if you eat a particular diet

759
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,038
you're more prone to have more weight or

760
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:27,058
less weight you can control the the

761
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:31,079
amount yes it's more environmental that

762
00:32:27,058 --> 00:32:33,359
right it's the same thing with um these

763
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:35,220
clones so if you're growing the same

764
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:36,778
clone in a completely different

765
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:39,480
environment

766
00:32:36,778 --> 00:32:41,778
you can have what you just said you can

767
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:44,399
have a completely different plant

768
00:32:41,778 --> 00:32:47,240
particularly because we know that

769
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:51,538
cannabis for example is very

770
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:54,960
photosensitive yes so if you have very

771
00:32:51,538 --> 00:32:56,759
good lights it's more likely that you're

772
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,200
gonna produce more cannabinoids and that

773
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:01,140
your plant is probably going to be

774
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:04,679
happier than if you have fewer lights

775
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:06,840
like if you put your your your plant in

776
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:10,860
a closet in the basement with no lights

777
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:15,119
yeah it probably it's gonna die yeah

778
00:33:10,859 --> 00:33:19,558
right so so all that environment is very

779
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:21,959
important what we don't know is of these

780
00:33:19,558 --> 00:33:24,778
cannabinoids and terpenes this this

781
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:27,360
complex it's a very complex phenotype

782
00:33:24,778 --> 00:33:30,058
yeah it's a very complex phenotype that

783
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:33,898
involves multiple genes acting in unison

784
00:33:30,058 --> 00:33:34,798
right so there's this um Jordan Sagar

785
00:33:33,898 --> 00:33:37,500
who's

786
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:40,558
um the CEO of Dewey scientific in

787
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:44,038
Washington state okay he has a paper

788
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:46,259
with who was his postdoc advisor Mark

789
00:33:44,038 --> 00:33:48,119
Lynch in in Washington state in Pullman

790
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:50,940
and they have this paper that I really

791
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:52,979
like where they talk about all of the

792
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:55,259
genes in related to cannabino and

793
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:57,419
terpene production as a network of genes

794
00:33:55,259 --> 00:33:59,579
kind of acting together and I think it's

795
00:33:57,419 --> 00:34:02,399
a really good description right so what

796
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:04,740
we in biology called epistasis which is

797
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:06,778
kind of like two genes acting on a

798
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:09,119
particular phenotype and pleiotropy

799
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:10,858
which is two different phenotypes that

800
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,599
are controlled one white by one gene so

801
00:34:10,858 --> 00:34:15,179
we have this play a chocolate pick and

802
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:17,760
this episodic effects acting in unison

803
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:21,000
for this very complex phenotype yeah

804
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:23,220
ever we don't know how much of it is

805
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:25,858
environmentally determined and how much

806
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:28,079
is uh is is

807
00:34:25,858 --> 00:34:30,719
um is genetics we know that there is a

808
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:32,159
genetic component for sure for sure but

809
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,838
we don't know how much we don't know if

810
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,940
it's going to be like weight or is it

811
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:39,719
going to be like heights in humans

812
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:42,300
waiting here right and the experiments

813
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:44,398
for you to figure that out are quote

814
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:47,280
unquote simple right you just need to

815
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:49,679
have several Generations or you can do

816
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,220
for example the same clone in different

817
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:55,440
environments and then yeah right right

818
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:57,539
and but yeah but but I I agree with what

819
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,838
you you said to your friend like is this

820
00:34:57,539 --> 00:35:04,320
is this you know blue cheese I don't

821
00:35:00,838 --> 00:35:06,539
know yeah maybe maybe it could be it

822
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:09,180
looks like it it could be it could be a

823
00:35:06,539 --> 00:35:10,500
mother to it it could be a hybrid of it

824
00:35:09,179 --> 00:35:12,118
or it could be something that just

825
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,260
totally expresses similar and not

826
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:15,900
related to it whatsoever because

827
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:19,260
cannabis is wild in plastic like that it

828
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:21,059
has plasticity and the other thing is

829
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:22,500
that we know

830
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:24,779
that

831
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,820
there is a lot of diversity there is a

832
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:29,760
lot of genomic diversity so in the

833
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:31,380
genome all of the conglomerate of DNA of

834
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,720
the plant right all of the letters of

835
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:35,280
the DNA we know that it's very diverse

836
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:38,459
it's

837
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:42,599
three to four times as diverse as humans

838
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:46,559
oh wow yeah it's it's very very diverse

839
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:49,200
so if you have that amount of diversity

840
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:53,759
you can have a lot of diversity in your

841
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:55,879
progeny right yes so full sibs may be

842
00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:00,300
completely different to each other yeah

843
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:02,160
and therefore you know probably this

844
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:05,099
chem dog number one and chem dog number

845
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:06,960
four which were probably full sibs

846
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:11,579
that's why they're completely different

847
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:14,220
phenotypes yes and reason why it makes

848
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:16,200
sense for you to clone the plants

849
00:36:14,219 --> 00:36:18,598
because when you're cloning them then

850
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:22,078
you're assuring that they're gonna be

851
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:25,440
more similar to the mother plant than if

852
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:28,079
you have seeds yes but that's why I

853
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,480
think that we need really good breeding

854
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,460
in in cannabis

855
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,920
um in marijuana right because in hemp

856
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:37,858
it's it's happening and and you know

857
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:41,220
cannabis is hemp and marijuana yeah but

858
00:36:37,858 --> 00:36:44,400
um in hemp it's happening for first for

859
00:36:41,219 --> 00:36:46,858
grain and for fiber and Europe has done

860
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:50,760
some good job at breeding and China know

861
00:36:46,858 --> 00:36:52,559
as well but um but for marijuana I think

862
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,420
that we need to have good breeding and

863
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:55,679
good breeding for particular locations

864
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,539
because especially if you're going

865
00:36:55,679 --> 00:37:00,199
Outdoors because Humboldt County

866
00:36:57,539 --> 00:37:03,739
California has a very different

867
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:06,000
environment than Upstate New York sure

868
00:37:03,739 --> 00:37:08,399
Colorado right so if you're going

869
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,500
outdoors I think that you need to have

870
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,559
really good breeding and I hope that

871
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:16,199
that happens in cannabis or I know that

872
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:18,599
it is happening right now sure yeah it's

873
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:20,578
it's been happening for years but the

874
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:22,260
the ratio of people doing that kind of

875
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:24,780
work to the people just putting

876
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:26,760
something on the market to make money is

877
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:28,500
it's very low like the amount of people

878
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:31,200
like doing serious breeding work versus

879
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:32,880
I'm gonna cross this to this and see

880
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:34,439
what happens because the names are cool

881
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,358
you know and putting it out on the

882
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:38,338
market there's a lot of that now and

883
00:37:36,358 --> 00:37:42,480
that's typically what we see in the

884
00:37:38,338 --> 00:37:44,759
breeding Market I I think so I think

885
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,940
that there are very reputable con a

886
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:50,640
companies in California I know one

887
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:52,500
company from Colorado like Trilogy and

888
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:55,858
seeds I think that they're they're good

889
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:59,159
at what they do for example as breeding

890
00:37:55,858 --> 00:38:01,679
um but um it is not easy it is time

891
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:04,019
consuming and I do agree with you that

892
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:07,858
the naming thing is well we know that

893
00:38:04,019 --> 00:38:09,780
the naming convention is is just BS

894
00:38:07,858 --> 00:38:13,559
right and we know that

895
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:16,019
sativa Indica hybrid they do not mean

896
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:18,299
much yes especially when you're trying

897
00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:21,059
to group trades like this is sativa

898
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:22,980
because it's lengthy and tall and then

899
00:38:21,059 --> 00:38:24,599
it has high THC like those traits are

900
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:27,539
completely different it's like me saying

901
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:30,359
like oh you are tall because you have

902
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:34,199
brown eyes like that it's not related

903
00:38:30,358 --> 00:38:37,559
whatsoever or a dog is tall because it's

904
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:39,239
white like that doesn't have any sort of

905
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:41,400
relationship

906
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:43,919
um and also we know for example that

907
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,660
they're strains that have nothing to do

908
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,720
with each other like Girl Scout cookies

909
00:38:45,659 --> 00:38:51,420
for example Girl Scout cookies

910
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:53,578
you can have two strange Girl Scout

911
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:55,858
cookies that are more closely related to

912
00:38:53,579 --> 00:39:00,960
something completely different except to

913
00:38:55,858 --> 00:39:02,338
each other yeah so when people ask me my

914
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:06,059
recommendation

915
00:39:02,338 --> 00:39:08,338
what I tell them is well you name this I

916
00:39:06,059 --> 00:39:09,838
don't know Blue Dream right your name is

917
00:39:08,338 --> 00:39:12,599
Blue Dream

918
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:17,400
um then and they got I don't know a

919
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:21,180
cannabis High Times cup yeah then rename

920
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:23,460
it next time and just call it I don't

921
00:39:21,179 --> 00:39:26,219
know dream blue yeah yeah that's

922
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:31,260
typically yeah it goes yeah yeah rename

923
00:39:26,219 --> 00:39:34,319
it or or then right or or then just this

924
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:36,180
blue dream got uh whatever the name

925
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,280
another strain Blue Dream as well like

926
00:39:36,179 --> 00:39:40,379
no one right so I and then when people

927
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:43,140
tell me like well but mine is the real

928
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:45,660
blue dream I don't know I can tell you

929
00:39:43,139 --> 00:39:48,598
whether your blue dream is related to

930
00:39:45,659 --> 00:39:51,480
other blue dreams but I cannot say who's

931
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:54,720
the real one like which one is the real

932
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:57,000
OG yeah I don't know see and that's

933
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:59,759
that's what's like the most fascinating

934
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,858
part of the topic to me is is what we

935
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,420
were talking about and my friend Matt

936
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:05,159
pointed out to me he's like it's

937
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:06,480
anthropology Matt like because I was

938
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:09,659
trying to explain to him like how do I

939
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:13,260
explain to a scientist what we do and

940
00:40:09,659 --> 00:40:15,059
why what we do is reliable most

941
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:17,339
importantly because like anybody can say

942
00:40:15,059 --> 00:40:19,199
like yeah I got this cut and yeah it's

943
00:40:17,338 --> 00:40:20,880
real because I said it's real or it's

944
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:23,159
real because this guy told me and he's

945
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,380
old like these are not good this is not

946
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:27,539
science right but there is anthropology

947
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:29,420
to it in the sense that uh you know

948
00:40:27,539 --> 00:40:32,460
there are people that have been alive

949
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:34,440
and in this in the scene

950
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:36,358
for x amount of years and we're there

951
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:38,519
when this strain first popped up watch

952
00:40:36,358 --> 00:40:39,838
where it came from already we're that

953
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:41,699
kind of person that would record that

954
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:43,199
kind of data you know and there are

955
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:45,719
these guys in the Cannabis world that

956
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:47,819
exist and have existed like total nerds

957
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:49,199
so there are these people that exist in

958
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:52,740
the Cannabis world that are kind of

959
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:54,960
reclusive but it's very it's been a task

960
00:40:52,739 --> 00:40:57,118
like that's what I've devoted my life to

961
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,639
is figuring out who these people are

962
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:02,099
where they're at and if I can shake down

963
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:04,858
their story and and really figure out is

964
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:08,760
this one is this provable is it

965
00:41:04,858 --> 00:41:10,380
plausible probable or total BS because

966
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,540
there's four answers you can get there

967
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:14,820
and and most of them are right in

968
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:16,199
between two and three you know there's

969
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:18,559
very little stuff that we can be like

970
00:41:16,199 --> 00:41:21,838
okay we know this came from for example

971
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:23,420
uh Dave Watson we know skunk one came

972
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:27,119
from Dave Watson

973
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:28,800
1975 roughly you know we know that for a

974
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,240
fact because it's well documented at the

975
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,940
time it was in books at the time

976
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:34,500
multiple different sources he's still

977
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:36,358
around can still give you know

978
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,739
statements that are all contemporaneous

979
00:41:36,358 --> 00:41:40,799
with what was going on at the time this

980
00:41:37,739 --> 00:41:43,858
story hasn't changed however then we

981
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,839
have stories like purple Urkel where we

982
00:41:43,858 --> 00:41:48,179
have nine to ten different claimants

983
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:49,440
none of them can show that they had any

984
00:41:48,179 --> 00:41:50,940
kind of Parental progeny or

985
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,059
documentation on it so it's one of those

986
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:55,920
stories that sits but oddly enough with

987
00:41:54,059 --> 00:41:57,659
things like Goji Kush we can we have

988
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,820
pretty good documentation of certain

989
00:41:57,659 --> 00:42:03,059
strains like that because enough people

990
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:04,320
were around it wasn't so long ago that a

991
00:42:03,059 --> 00:42:07,019
lot of people that were around then are

992
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:09,900
still around you know but it's debatable

993
00:42:07,019 --> 00:42:12,780
regardless yeah and I think that it

994
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:17,039
would be super cool to be able to do

995
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:19,680
some genetic study that may corroborate

996
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:22,858
all of these stories right yes that's

997
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:26,098
the most important yeah I right I I

998
00:42:22,858 --> 00:42:28,078
think that that could be super cool

999
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:30,660
um I would be a little hesitant because

1000
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:34,280
I have gotten a lot of

1001
00:42:30,659 --> 00:42:37,799
sometimes not a lot of no some negative

1002
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:41,220
vibes from certain people about genomics

1003
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:43,200
work and about right and these tools

1004
00:42:41,219 --> 00:42:47,039
that are super powerful and that are

1005
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:47,699
going to change the industry really sure

1006
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:51,000
um

1007
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:53,338
so that part I feel you know like saying

1008
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:55,500
kind of like hey this is really not blue

1009
00:42:53,338 --> 00:42:57,299
dream there may be someone that's not

1010
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,980
gonna like it right I've heard a lot of

1011
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:02,039
feelings in this industry that way

1012
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:04,500
exactly that you heard a lot of feelings

1013
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:05,818
so I I think that it would be a really

1014
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:09,559
cool

1015
00:43:05,818 --> 00:43:13,259
um genetic study that corroborates this

1016
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:15,480
anthropological study right exactly and

1017
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:17,880
we've done that with dogs we've done

1018
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:19,679
that with humans

1019
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:23,039
um you know we know for example that

1020
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:25,799
dogs were domesticated multiple times uh

1021
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:28,139
by multiple cultures yes it is pretty

1022
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:30,060
crazy but we also had anthropological

1023
00:43:28,139 --> 00:43:33,900
evidence that the Chinese for example

1024
00:43:30,059 --> 00:43:37,078
had dogs and that um there were also

1025
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:39,838
dogs in in Europe and in America in the

1026
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:42,000
Americas so so we know that dogs were

1027
00:43:39,838 --> 00:43:44,119
domesticated multiple times and we know

1028
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,639
for example in humans

1029
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:50,280
one really cool study that I remember

1030
00:43:47,639 --> 00:43:53,098
coming out you know we we know that

1031
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:55,140
when Christopher Columbus came to to

1032
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:57,180
America

1033
00:43:55,139 --> 00:43:59,818
um they basically

1034
00:43:57,179 --> 00:44:02,098
um the Spanish were different from the

1035
00:43:59,818 --> 00:44:05,940
British right the British kind of sent

1036
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:08,220
colonies in in North America the Spanish

1037
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:10,440
just took all of the gold and left like

1038
00:44:08,219 --> 00:44:13,259
they were not planning on really staying

1039
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:17,159
in South America yeah but they did you

1040
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:20,160
know rape women old men and then took

1041
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:23,940
the gold and left and now we have some

1042
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:27,838
evidence genetic evidence that many of

1043
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:30,179
the genes that are coming from Men Are

1044
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:32,940
from Spain and many of the genes that

1045
00:44:30,179 --> 00:44:35,098
are from women are from native women in

1046
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:36,900
South America and there was this

1047
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:39,059
beautiful study that was published in

1048
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:43,858
piano yes I'm gonna say that it was

1049
00:44:39,059 --> 00:44:47,039
probably around 2011 or 2012. that

1050
00:44:43,858 --> 00:44:49,679
took what we knew anthropologically and

1051
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:52,318
had this genetic study about the human

1052
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:54,299
mitochondria that is inherited through

1053
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:55,858
the mother and the Y chromosome that is

1054
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:59,220
inherited through the father and it was

1055
00:44:55,858 --> 00:45:02,098
so beautiful to see you know the

1056
00:44:59,219 --> 00:45:04,379
parallels between genetics you know

1057
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:07,740
genomics and anthropology and I think

1058
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:08,880
that in cannabis could be similar yeah I

1059
00:45:07,739 --> 00:45:11,459
mean I guess that's how you make

1060
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,079
anthropology scientific right is is you

1061
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:15,960
back up the data or you back it up with

1062
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:17,818
data and I yeah I know there was we had

1063
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,960
talked about this about 10 years ago we

1064
00:45:17,818 --> 00:45:21,300
were going to start doing it just

1065
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:25,139
specifically with the OG Kush

1066
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:26,579
um project and the problem was one of

1067
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:29,039
course you have to Source all of these

1068
00:45:26,579 --> 00:45:31,200
Cuts specifically from the most reliable

1069
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:33,119
sources and

1070
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:34,618
the most reliable sources in quotes

1071
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,358
because that's it's only going to be

1072
00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:37,920
what people tell you but if you get

1073
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:39,900
enough of them you can kind of get an

1074
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,519
idea a very good idea especially when

1075
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:43,200
you know multiple people confirm certain

1076
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:46,079
sources and we're going to do that but

1077
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:48,000
at the same time we didn't know of any

1078
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:51,000
reliable place except there was one

1079
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:54,500
company at the time called philos to

1080
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:57,119
even do the testing to tell us the the

1081
00:45:54,500 --> 00:46:00,358
matrilineal patrilineal relations any of

1082
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:01,740
that stuff and they any OG that was

1083
00:46:00,358 --> 00:46:03,779
submitted to them they all said was the

1084
00:46:01,739 --> 00:46:05,219
same clone they were not able to tell

1085
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:08,220
when it was obvious like when someone

1086
00:46:05,219 --> 00:46:09,719
was like giving a known self line like

1087
00:46:08,219 --> 00:46:11,159
saying I popped the seed from a known

1088
00:46:09,719 --> 00:46:13,019
self line from this clone I'll send you

1089
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:14,399
a clone of this and clone of this send

1090
00:46:13,019 --> 00:46:16,139
it to him and it was showing up as the

1091
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,460
exact same clone so we already knew it

1092
00:46:16,139 --> 00:46:19,019
wasn't going to be reliable from the

1093
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:23,639
jump you know

1094
00:46:19,019 --> 00:46:25,619
so philos they do have that Galaxy which

1095
00:46:23,639 --> 00:46:27,358
is trustworthy I think that they have

1096
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:30,780
done a good job at the Galaxy and they

1097
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:34,039
have all of the cushes right so so their

1098
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:37,019
their Galaxy I I know the tests behind

1099
00:46:34,039 --> 00:46:39,000
the algorithms behind that Galaxy and

1100
00:46:37,019 --> 00:46:41,579
the the cool thing is that you can shift

1101
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,318
it right and you can kind of zoom in to

1102
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:45,240
a particular point so I think that that

1103
00:46:43,318 --> 00:46:50,279
is pretty cool

1104
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:51,959
um and I disagree or I don't know what

1105
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:54,240
are they doing right now regarding their

1106
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:57,539
sequencing but I sure disagree with

1107
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:59,039
particular ways of sequencing The genome

1108
00:46:57,539 --> 00:47:00,960
um I think that there's other ways of

1109
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:03,000
sequencing where you can get a lot of

1110
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,559
information and you can also explore

1111
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:08,460
other things

1112
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:11,099
but if you have multiple individuals

1113
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:12,900
multiple cushes that are that may not be

1114
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:16,619
related to each other and they are all

1115
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:19,318
appearing as the same clone I would be

1116
00:47:16,619 --> 00:47:20,940
hesitant about those results and I think

1117
00:47:19,318 --> 00:47:23,460
that it may be the way that they're

1118
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:26,159
sequencing right so so there are for

1119
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:28,380
example for paternity tests so to figure

1120
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:31,078
out whether that is your child or not

1121
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:32,818
yeah there are particular genomic

1122
00:47:31,079 --> 00:47:35,160
regions that use sequence and not other

1123
00:47:32,818 --> 00:47:37,920
genomic regions right you sequence

1124
00:47:35,159 --> 00:47:40,259
genomic regions that are very varied

1125
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:42,539
between individuals because there are

1126
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:45,180
genes that are extremely conserved

1127
00:47:42,539 --> 00:47:47,279
between you and I that you know your

1128
00:47:45,179 --> 00:47:50,818
Mexican and Colombian they may not

1129
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:53,579
differ yeah yeah so but there are

1130
00:47:50,818 --> 00:47:56,279
reliable paternity tests so you need to

1131
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:59,700
figure out which region of the genome

1132
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:01,800
you're sequencing and I think that there

1133
00:47:59,699 --> 00:48:04,618
could have been a problem with philos

1134
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:07,380
doing that sure yeah I mean in a

1135
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:11,519
hypothetical situation I'll say it that

1136
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:14,300
way like we were taking a a clone mom

1137
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:20,099
like let's for example we'll call this

1138
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:23,880
Sendo stirps and a uh lubba Kush right

1139
00:48:20,099 --> 00:48:25,619
and we were taking that mother clone and

1140
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:28,140
the other mother clone submitting those

1141
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:30,960
to philos we cross them together

1142
00:48:28,139 --> 00:48:32,460
ran the progeny we know that one I mean

1143
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,500
the progenies all either Bubba Kush or

1144
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:36,659
mental purpose or a variance of it's

1145
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:38,519
very reliable in breeding sent them a

1146
00:48:36,659 --> 00:48:40,799
clone of that and none of them showed

1147
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:42,179
related at all between all three and

1148
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,460
that's when we were like okay so we have

1149
00:48:42,179 --> 00:48:46,019
the OG Kush data we have some pretty

1150
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:47,639
known data when it comes to cookies on

1151
00:48:46,019 --> 00:48:49,619
cookies parentage and it's not showing

1152
00:48:47,639 --> 00:48:52,440
up in philos data and then we did that

1153
00:48:49,619 --> 00:48:54,539
to kind of test and see how

1154
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:56,838
hypothetically we did that allegedly

1155
00:48:54,539 --> 00:48:59,519
that was done to see

1156
00:48:56,838 --> 00:49:01,799
how if if it would really show up like

1157
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:06,358
that and in one case there was like chem

1158
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:07,680
91 and chem 91 s1s self line scent and

1159
00:49:06,358 --> 00:49:09,900
they were able to tell this is a self

1160
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:11,460
version of that or really close relation

1161
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:13,079
to that

1162
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:14,579
um but in many cases they couldn't tell

1163
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:16,560
direct relations from each other so

1164
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:18,300
there was there was no consistency like

1165
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:20,039
sometimes it was right and sometimes it

1166
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:22,260
was just so off it was really confusing

1167
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:24,000
to me and I never knew why it never made

1168
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:25,920
any sense to me and I I don't understand

1169
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,920
the science behind how they collect the

1170
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:31,139
data where the error would have been but

1171
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:34,139
it's always fascinating me to no end

1172
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:37,078
so okay so I'm gonna explain something

1173
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:39,179
to you which I think could could be I

1174
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:42,240
don't know if it's for sure but it could

1175
00:49:39,179 --> 00:49:44,159
be one of the reasons so when you are

1176
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:46,919
sequencing a genome right you have all

1177
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:48,960
of the letters of the DNA

1178
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:50,818
there's multiple ways of sequencing the

1179
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,280
genome right

1180
00:49:50,818 --> 00:49:57,179
there's one way that it's called whole

1181
00:49:53,280 --> 00:50:00,180
genome shotgun okay where you take the

1182
00:49:57,179 --> 00:50:01,980
entire genome and you sequence it all

1183
00:50:00,179 --> 00:50:03,539
when you're sequencing whole genome

1184
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:07,500
shotgun there's something that it's

1185
00:50:03,539 --> 00:50:10,559
called the coverage so the coverage is

1186
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:13,500
the amount of times that on average each

1187
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:15,779
letter of the DNA is being sequenced so

1188
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:18,480
on average if you have one X on average

1189
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:20,819
each letter is sequenced one time if you

1190
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:23,280
have 10x on average each letter is

1191
00:50:20,818 --> 00:50:25,619
sequenced 10 times if you have a hundred

1192
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:28,619
X on average each letter is sequenced a

1193
00:50:25,619 --> 00:50:30,420
hundred times right okay so I really

1194
00:50:28,619 --> 00:50:33,358
like whole genome shotgun even if it's

1195
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:35,519
1X because you have the entire genome

1196
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:38,039
and you can look at different regions of

1197
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:40,980
the genome and at the end of the day it

1198
00:50:38,039 --> 00:50:43,019
is cheaper per letter to sequence the

1199
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:45,838
entire genome at a whole genome shotgun

1200
00:50:43,019 --> 00:50:48,300
okay there is another way of sequencing

1201
00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:51,299
the genome which is called genotyping by

1202
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:55,440
sequencing PBS

1203
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:57,839
in GBS what you do is that you take the

1204
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,838
genome and then you break it down into

1205
00:50:57,838 --> 00:51:02,219
pieces with these enzymes these proteins

1206
00:51:00,838 --> 00:51:04,799
that are kind of like these little

1207
00:51:02,219 --> 00:51:07,019
scissors yeah that they break the genome

1208
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:09,539
into pieces and then you end up

1209
00:51:07,019 --> 00:51:10,500
sequencing only one percent of the

1210
00:51:09,539 --> 00:51:12,900
genome

1211
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:14,039
approximately okay one two percent of

1212
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:18,119
the gene

1213
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:19,980
GBS helps you to figure out whether

1214
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:21,539
you're more closely related to me or

1215
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:23,219
whether you're more closely related to

1216
00:51:21,539 --> 00:51:28,679
your mom okay

1217
00:51:23,219 --> 00:51:30,899
so that is GBS however GBS has

1218
00:51:28,679 --> 00:51:34,919
a lot of problems one of the problem is

1219
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:37,200
repetition okay so even if you do it

1220
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:39,119
with the same restriction enzymes the

1221
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:41,279
same pair of scissors

1222
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:44,160
and even if you follow the same protocol

1223
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:46,680
repetition is not

1224
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:48,899
um consistent yeah um and there's a

1225
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:51,299
paper showing that the repetition in GBS

1226
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:53,039
is not consistent and in addition to

1227
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:54,359
that you know even though it's cheaper

1228
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:57,420
because you're only sequencing one

1229
00:51:54,358 --> 00:51:59,460
percent it's cheaper in general per

1230
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:03,059
letter it is not cheaper than whole

1231
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:04,440
genome shotgun okay and there are

1232
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:07,680
different pairs of scissors there's

1233
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:12,659
different restriction enzymes so I have

1234
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:16,259
this study um in 2016 that we compared

1235
00:52:12,659 --> 00:52:17,639
the the GBS data from one group to

1236
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:20,520
another and because they had used

1237
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:23,578
different restriction enzymes we could

1238
00:52:20,519 --> 00:52:25,079
not compare the data between them we

1239
00:52:23,579 --> 00:52:26,700
could just compare it to the whole

1240
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:28,200
genome shotgun so this one against the

1241
00:52:26,699 --> 00:52:29,759
whole genome shotgun this one against

1242
00:52:28,199 --> 00:52:31,679
the whole genome shotgun but we couldn't

1243
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:34,740
compare these two that makes sense

1244
00:52:31,679 --> 00:52:36,960
because there were no overlaps so

1245
00:52:34,739 --> 00:52:39,959
it is my understanding that filo

1246
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,818
sequencing sequences GBS I don't know if

1247
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:45,000
they still do but at least at some point

1248
00:52:41,818 --> 00:52:48,058
in their lives they did and I'm always

1249
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,139
questioning the reasoning whether it's

1250
00:52:48,059 --> 00:52:51,660
for

1251
00:52:49,139 --> 00:52:52,980
you know profits you know because you

1252
00:52:51,659 --> 00:52:55,679
don't want to spend more money or

1253
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:57,599
because the questions that you have

1254
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:59,219
you just need to know whether you're

1255
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:01,859
more closely related to your mom than to

1256
00:52:59,219 --> 00:53:04,139
me and that's it but you cannot look at

1257
00:53:01,858 --> 00:53:06,719
the repetitive content of the genome you

1258
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:09,299
know the junk DNA you cannot do that you

1259
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:11,879
cannot look at whole genes

1260
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:13,859
right you cannot look whether this

1261
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:17,338
entire genes

1262
00:53:13,858 --> 00:53:20,940
have different copies so I I question

1263
00:53:17,338 --> 00:53:23,099
GBS and and I think that that may be one

1264
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:25,380
of the reasons why

1265
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:28,859
um they got those results with you I

1266
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:30,480
would not be surprised with DBS yeah you

1267
00:53:28,858 --> 00:53:33,960
know and especially

1268
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:37,139
I I am really sloppy you know I bump

1269
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:39,960
things uh you know in the lab I like

1270
00:53:37,139 --> 00:53:41,460
there's a hair somewhere I'm the type of

1271
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:43,199
person that is trying to look neat and

1272
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:46,980
then you have you know toothpaste yeah

1273
00:53:43,199 --> 00:53:49,980
yeah that is me I have never been good

1274
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:52,079
at doing something more than DNA

1275
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:54,960
extractions my DNA extractions are fine

1276
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:57,720
but if you have to do something like GBS

1277
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:59,880
where you have to sonicate and then you

1278
00:53:57,719 --> 00:54:01,679
have to do the Restriction enzyme and

1279
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:05,640
then you have to do this other like that

1280
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:07,259
wouldn't work yeah yeah so if you you

1281
00:54:05,639 --> 00:54:08,578
need to have a really good technician

1282
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:12,000
and even then

1283
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:14,039
your results are not repetable and if

1284
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:16,920
they're not repeatable isn't that what

1285
00:54:14,039 --> 00:54:19,739
like science is like it to be able to

1286
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:21,720
show something is rep repeatable to have

1287
00:54:19,739 --> 00:54:24,299
repeatable results

1288
00:54:21,719 --> 00:54:26,578
to make a valid I mean I'm a Layman so

1289
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:28,318
like I'm good at like English and

1290
00:54:26,579 --> 00:54:30,480
history and stuff like that so if I'm

1291
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:32,759
wrong correct me but like that also

1292
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:34,199
makes me think like okay so if that data

1293
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:37,020
is incorrect with just those very few

1294
00:54:34,199 --> 00:54:39,358
examples that we noticed and we're one

1295
00:54:37,019 --> 00:54:42,239
out of tens of thousands of people who

1296
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:44,400
use this when they go to cell said data

1297
00:54:42,239 --> 00:54:46,078
if it doesn't merge well with other

1298
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:49,079
people's data sets

1299
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:51,420
said data might end up worthless so all

1300
00:54:49,079 --> 00:54:53,880
that investment and savings that they

1301
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:56,400
went to be cheaper to save whatever if

1302
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:59,579
that was the theory and it would end up

1303
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,539
not working out so well I would think I

1304
00:54:59,579 --> 00:55:02,880
mean it just

1305
00:55:00,539 --> 00:55:04,440
yeah from my from my point of view as

1306
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,240
someone who's who's like a history and

1307
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:08,358
not a math person or a science person it

1308
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:12,539
doesn't make much sense

1309
00:55:08,358 --> 00:55:14,818
I 100 agree with you and unfortunately

1310
00:55:12,539 --> 00:55:18,179
people in the world I'm gonna say

1311
00:55:14,818 --> 00:55:20,099
something that look we know that there's

1312
00:55:18,179 --> 00:55:22,679
a lot of science that it's not

1313
00:55:20,099 --> 00:55:25,260
repeatable for example

1314
00:55:22,679 --> 00:55:27,659
Excel spreadsheets right we know that

1315
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:29,760
Excel spreadsheets when you type one

1316
00:55:27,659 --> 00:55:34,578
whatever it translates it to January

1317
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:38,700
12th yeah yeah and it's like what so

1318
00:55:34,579 --> 00:55:41,818
that we know that Excel you know screws

1319
00:55:38,699 --> 00:55:44,098
things up yeah but we also know that

1320
00:55:41,818 --> 00:55:48,599
there's other science

1321
00:55:44,099 --> 00:55:52,019
old science that may not be repeatable

1322
00:55:48,599 --> 00:55:55,500
right now that at that time so so

1323
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:57,358
similar to GBS I think that GBS it's

1324
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:59,760
gonna be a few years until people stop

1325
00:55:57,358 --> 00:56:02,460
using it for these reasons and for other

1326
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:04,200
reasons yeah but um there's other

1327
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:06,539
techniques

1328
00:56:04,199 --> 00:56:09,299
um enzymatic techniques that people do

1329
00:56:06,539 --> 00:56:11,759
not use anymore I used all those times

1330
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:12,559
during my PhD that no one uses that

1331
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,660
anymore

1332
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:20,700
and just to give you another example

1333
00:56:15,659 --> 00:56:23,899
studies with mice we found out we in the

1334
00:56:20,699 --> 00:56:27,779
world I mean we found out that

1335
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:31,019
mice respond differently to humans

1336
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:32,880
whether it's a female that is treating

1337
00:56:31,019 --> 00:56:35,818
the mice or whether it's a male that's

1338
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:40,380
treating the mice so results with

1339
00:56:35,818 --> 00:56:42,960
experimental mice May differ whether the

1340
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:44,818
person conducting this experiment was a

1341
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:49,019
woman or a man is that like scent

1342
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:51,659
hormone or do I know I don't know but we

1343
00:56:49,019 --> 00:56:53,699
know that there is

1344
00:56:51,659 --> 00:56:55,259
we know that there is this Gap in

1345
00:56:53,699 --> 00:56:57,239
science we know that there's a lot of

1346
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:58,500
data sets that are not publicly

1347
00:56:57,239 --> 00:57:00,838
available

1348
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:05,460
including some from my papers one paper

1349
00:57:00,838 --> 00:57:07,259
because of some reasons but I try to

1350
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:09,480
make my data available because I think

1351
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:12,359
it's fair with the world and

1352
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:14,460
particularly because I don't know what's

1353
00:57:12,358 --> 00:57:17,159
going to happen I don't know whether my

1354
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:19,019
analysis was entirely correct I don't

1355
00:57:17,159 --> 00:57:21,480
know whether you analyze it differently

1356
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:24,239
and are gonna get a different result or

1357
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:27,420
right so I think that I should make all

1358
00:57:24,239 --> 00:57:29,879
of my data public for anyone here or in

1359
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:32,639
Patagonia Argentina or in Shanghai China

1360
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:35,940
to be able to analyze my data and tell

1361
00:57:32,639 --> 00:57:38,279
me hey I did get what you or or I

1362
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:41,460
disagree with you yeah right

1363
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:43,140
yeah and and I think that in many cases

1364
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:44,818
that's not the way with science that's

1365
00:57:43,139 --> 00:57:47,159
not the way with Excel spreadsheets so

1366
00:57:44,818 --> 00:57:49,500
it's not the way with and and I think

1367
00:57:47,159 --> 00:57:52,078
that with GPS data whenever I see GPS

1368
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:53,940
that I'm like I'm not like I'm not

1369
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:55,800
analyzing that yeah

1370
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:59,240
and and you know what's funny is because

1371
00:57:55,800 --> 00:58:01,800
philos was embedded in our our

1372
00:57:59,239 --> 00:58:03,479
subculture for so long I mean it was

1373
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:05,460
like a good I don't know eight years

1374
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:07,199
that people were taking their data and

1375
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:09,900
being like making conclusions from it

1376
00:58:07,199 --> 00:58:11,818
and making other conclusions from it

1377
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:14,460
based on those conclusions that philos

1378
00:58:11,818 --> 00:58:17,338
had made and it's it when we kind of

1379
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:19,318
realized how bad or inconsistent some of

1380
00:58:17,338 --> 00:58:21,420
the data was it was like slowly

1381
00:58:19,318 --> 00:58:22,739
unraveling stuff in our head like we

1382
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:24,300
always used to make these conclusions

1383
00:58:22,739 --> 00:58:26,639
based on that data but that's now

1384
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:29,640
invalid data and you actually have to go

1385
00:58:26,639 --> 00:58:31,739
through and like remove it from your

1386
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:33,118
brain scrub your brain from all this

1387
00:58:31,739 --> 00:58:35,039
thing so now when I see people with

1388
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:36,240
philos data I'm like I don't I don't

1389
00:58:35,039 --> 00:58:38,159
want to see it because it doesn't matter

1390
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:40,439
because it might be right but it might

1391
00:58:38,159 --> 00:58:43,019
not and that's an unreliable narrator I

1392
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:44,519
can't do it yeah I think that there's

1393
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:46,318
some things that are right you know I

1394
00:58:44,519 --> 00:58:48,179
think that they're gonna see that the

1395
00:58:46,318 --> 00:58:49,920
relationship between strings may be

1396
00:58:48,179 --> 00:58:53,219
right

1397
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:55,260
um but now that they're doing breeding I

1398
00:58:53,219 --> 00:58:58,739
don't know I honestly don't know I I

1399
00:58:55,260 --> 00:59:01,200
don't even I I I remember when all that

1400
00:58:58,739 --> 00:59:03,000
blew up and and a lot of people's anger

1401
00:59:01,199 --> 00:59:04,679
at it but for me like I was just more

1402
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,480
interested in like are you putting out

1403
00:59:04,679 --> 00:59:08,759
good data or bad data people are

1404
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:10,920
purchasing data this is my I don't care

1405
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:12,480
what you do with any of your breeding or

1406
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:14,700
any of that because they you know I mean

1407
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:17,338
until they started asking for whole

1408
00:59:14,699 --> 00:59:20,098
seeds and stuff like that that that's

1409
00:59:17,338 --> 00:59:21,838
when it became different but when it

1410
00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:23,880
came to the data is this data consistent

1411
00:59:21,838 --> 00:59:25,318
with what we're seeing no okay then why

1412
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:27,260
not and then when we start finding out

1413
00:59:25,318 --> 00:59:29,519
it's not well then what are you doing

1414
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:30,780
luckily I think they do no longer do

1415
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:32,519
data sequencing and they're just doing

1416
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:34,319
their breeding program now which is cool

1417
00:59:32,519 --> 00:59:36,239
props for them hope they have good luck

1418
00:59:34,318 --> 00:59:37,980
with it you know

1419
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:40,439
um one of the other things in cannabis

1420
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:43,019
that we ran into over the years that

1421
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:45,780
we've been trying to figure out is in

1422
00:59:43,019 --> 00:59:47,579
cannabis sex reversal uh ethylene plays

1423
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:50,519
a major role right

1424
00:59:47,579 --> 00:59:53,640
um a lot of times we're seeing a clone

1425
00:59:50,519 --> 00:59:56,039
like take a clone take 60 cuts off a

1426
00:59:53,639 --> 00:59:58,440
single mom they'll be in a tray 10 inch

1427
00:59:56,039 --> 01:00:01,558
by 20 inch tray 50 of them next to each

1428
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:03,960
other you'll get 30 percent distribution

1429
01:00:01,559 --> 01:00:07,319
that actually reverse really well 30

1430
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:09,119
that kind of do and 30 that won't at all

1431
01:00:07,318 --> 01:00:12,119
or it'll reverse and won't drop viable

1432
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:14,220
pollen and none of us know why and this

1433
01:00:12,119 --> 01:00:16,260
has been going on for decades and none

1434
01:00:14,219 --> 01:00:17,879
of us can figure it out

1435
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:20,000
so I'm interested to hear your take on

1436
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:20,000
it

1437
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:31,019
we know that

1438
01:00:28,019 --> 01:00:34,559
X and Y chromosomes right

1439
01:00:31,019 --> 01:00:36,599
so if you are an XX you're a female if

1440
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:38,839
you're on X Y you're a male kind of like

1441
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:42,298
us right yeah and then we have the

1442
01:00:38,838 --> 01:00:44,460
monishes which people in the industry

1443
01:00:42,298 --> 01:00:46,980
call the Hermes so let's call it Hermes

1444
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:50,579
although they're actually monishes yes

1445
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:52,798
so the Hermes we know that there are

1446
01:00:50,579 --> 01:00:55,380
particular regions of the chromosomes

1447
01:00:52,798 --> 01:00:58,219
that are very similar to the female

1448
01:00:55,380 --> 01:01:02,039
chromosomes however we don't know

1449
01:00:58,219 --> 01:01:03,899
exactly how different the municious

1450
01:01:02,039 --> 01:01:06,420
chromosomes are from those of the female

1451
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:08,700
chromosomes oh interesting we don't we

1452
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:11,760
don't know that entirely we know that

1453
01:01:08,699 --> 01:01:13,739
the Y chromosome in the males it's very

1454
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:15,059
big is the biggest of all of the

1455
01:01:13,739 --> 01:01:16,739
chromosomes

1456
01:01:15,059 --> 01:01:19,380
and

1457
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:21,058
so when you're sequencing a genome

1458
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:23,160
there's some there's something that is

1459
01:01:21,059 --> 01:01:24,660
called The genome assembly okay so an

1460
01:01:23,159 --> 01:01:26,039
assembly is when you you know you're

1461
01:01:24,659 --> 01:01:29,219
sequencing The genome and you have to

1462
01:01:26,039 --> 01:01:31,798
partition those regions into pieces yeah

1463
01:01:29,219 --> 01:01:33,838
and then you have to put them together

1464
01:01:31,798 --> 01:01:36,059
um that's when coverage comes really

1465
01:01:33,838 --> 01:01:38,578
handy because if you have something that

1466
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:41,339
is more than one X so if you have

1467
01:01:38,579 --> 01:01:43,500
something that is let's say 100x then

1468
01:01:41,338 --> 01:01:45,358
it's easier for you to put the puzzles

1469
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:46,858
together because then you have this

1470
01:01:45,358 --> 01:01:48,358
piece this piece then you have this

1471
01:01:46,858 --> 01:01:50,759
other one and then you know you're

1472
01:01:48,358 --> 01:01:53,940
starting to put your puzzle together and

1473
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:57,000
ideally you would have in cannabis you

1474
01:01:53,940 --> 01:02:00,059
would have 11 pieces right because it

1475
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:02,460
has nine autosomes so nine chromosomes

1476
01:02:00,059 --> 01:02:05,220
that are not related to sex okay nine

1477
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:08,099
then you have an X and then you have a y

1478
01:02:05,219 --> 01:02:11,098
right so you have 11 different pieces

1479
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:13,440
that it's your complete uh puzzle

1480
01:02:11,099 --> 01:02:15,000
there is a really good assembly that was

1481
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:17,639
produced by

1482
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:22,679
um Chris grassa and Chris grassa at all

1483
01:02:17,639 --> 01:02:24,000
2021 which is a female however we do not

1484
01:02:22,679 --> 01:02:26,818
have

1485
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:30,679
the puzzle for the white chromosome or

1486
01:02:26,818 --> 01:02:30,679
the puzzle for the municious chromosome

1487
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:37,619
we do know that if you have a y

1488
01:02:35,099 --> 01:02:39,900
chromosome you're very likely to produce

1489
01:02:37,619 --> 01:02:41,400
pollen yeah and if you have 2X

1490
01:02:39,900 --> 01:02:42,480
chromosomes you're very likely to

1491
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:45,240
produce

1492
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:48,260
female flowers yes there are some

1493
01:02:45,239 --> 01:02:50,459
varieties as you said that if you put

1494
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:52,619
ethylene or you know silver nitrate

1495
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:54,659
whatever they start producing flowers

1496
01:02:52,619 --> 01:02:57,420
from the opposite sex in males if you

1497
01:02:54,659 --> 01:02:59,818
put ethophan right you're producing

1498
01:02:57,420 --> 01:03:02,220
flowers female flowers there's some

1499
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:03,539
strains that are more prone than others

1500
01:03:02,219 --> 01:03:05,519
yes

1501
01:03:03,539 --> 01:03:08,338
we don't know why

1502
01:03:05,519 --> 01:03:10,920
uh we don't know which are the genes

1503
01:03:08,338 --> 01:03:12,599
that are turning on right

1504
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:16,139
we think

1505
01:03:12,599 --> 01:03:17,940
that those genes may not be related to

1506
01:03:16,139 --> 01:03:20,578
the X and the Y chromosomes we think

1507
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:22,159
that those genes may be somewhere else

1508
01:03:20,579 --> 01:03:26,460
in the genome

1509
01:03:22,159 --> 01:03:29,578
yeah B because if you have the X on the

1510
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:32,460
Y chromosome you still Express you know

1511
01:03:29,579 --> 01:03:34,318
whatever facts it is if you have X Y

1512
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:37,740
your male if you have x x you're female

1513
01:03:34,318 --> 01:03:40,380
but then if you like if you force them

1514
01:03:37,739 --> 01:03:42,539
to produce the other sex there are some

1515
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:45,119
that produce them and some not so maybe

1516
01:03:42,539 --> 01:03:48,420
it these genes are found somewhere else

1517
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:51,358
but we have some idea of some genes that

1518
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:53,940
are turned on and turned off

1519
01:03:51,358 --> 01:03:56,119
um and I think that that is a really

1520
01:03:53,940 --> 01:04:01,019
interesting question

1521
01:03:56,119 --> 01:04:03,119
why when how do you turn these jeans on

1522
01:04:01,019 --> 01:04:04,139
is it just that some individuals do not

1523
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:06,420
have them

1524
01:04:04,139 --> 01:04:07,980
and in like I said even if there are

1525
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:09,539
clones of each other in the same tray

1526
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:11,639
one inch apart meaning the angles of

1527
01:04:09,539 --> 01:04:14,880
light are very similar like how they're

1528
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:16,739
being fed is identical you'll see 30 in

1529
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:18,180
a random distribution not like in one

1530
01:04:16,739 --> 01:04:20,279
set next to each other they'll be

1531
01:04:18,179 --> 01:04:22,318
totally random and it's it blows my mind

1532
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:25,920
every time that we just can't figure it

1533
01:04:22,318 --> 01:04:27,838
out we just cannot I I would love to

1534
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:29,700
explore that that was what really caught

1535
01:04:27,838 --> 01:04:33,239
my attention and kind of is what was

1536
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:35,098
that sex part right yeah yeah yeah and

1537
01:04:33,239 --> 01:04:36,779
I've never so far worked you know I

1538
01:04:35,099 --> 01:04:38,880
worked in the cannabino genes I worked

1539
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:40,319
and at the beginning when I started

1540
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:43,079
working in the cannabinoid jeans it was

1541
01:04:40,318 --> 01:04:46,500
like oh why now I love them like I

1542
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:49,619
absolutely love them but um but that

1543
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:52,139
part of the sex is super interesting to

1544
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:54,059
me because the Y chromosome you know the

1545
01:04:52,139 --> 01:04:56,699
Y chromosome in humans is very very

1546
01:04:54,059 --> 01:04:58,859
small it's tiny okay

1547
01:04:56,699 --> 01:05:00,960
um and it basically has you know very

1548
01:04:58,858 --> 01:05:05,338
few genes and there's one gene that says

1549
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:06,900
hey everyone wake up you know Express

1550
01:05:05,338 --> 01:05:09,599
and that's why

1551
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:11,940
I have many of the genes that you have

1552
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:15,059
to produce beard to produce all of the

1553
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:17,039
yeah hormones that men produce but I

1554
01:05:15,059 --> 01:05:20,160
don't have that Gene that wakes everyone

1555
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:21,960
up right yeah and the Y chromosome is

1556
01:05:20,159 --> 01:05:23,879
Tiny basically has that one Gene and

1557
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:26,579
that's it in cannabis on the other hand

1558
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:28,318
the white chromosome is humongous and

1559
01:05:26,579 --> 01:05:30,359
one of the reasons why I think that we

1560
01:05:28,318 --> 01:05:32,699
do not have a proper assembly is because

1561
01:05:30,358 --> 01:05:35,699
it's so big and it's full with

1562
01:05:32,699 --> 01:05:38,460
repetitive elements junk DNA yeah and

1563
01:05:35,699 --> 01:05:40,980
the repetitive elements are repetitive

1564
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:43,858
so you have repetition repetition

1565
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:46,440
repetition how many do you have it's so

1566
01:05:43,858 --> 01:05:48,058
hard to tell it's so difficult to put

1567
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:49,920
together because it's repetitive and

1568
01:05:48,059 --> 01:05:52,500
repetitive and repetitive so it's very

1569
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:56,159
hard to know when it ends and when it

1570
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:58,199
starts right yeah and and so it's yeah

1571
01:05:56,159 --> 01:05:59,639
so so we don't know what's going on in

1572
01:05:58,199 --> 01:06:02,098
that in that Chrome

1573
01:05:59,639 --> 01:06:03,900
that that's like the one thing that's

1574
01:06:02,099 --> 01:06:06,539
driven me for a long time like we

1575
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:08,880
developed a spray that is a ready to mix

1576
01:06:06,539 --> 01:06:11,159
spray for people to that's uh silver

1577
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:14,640
nitrate sodium thiosulfate based you

1578
01:06:11,159 --> 01:06:16,078
know and um the one thing that me and a

1579
01:06:14,639 --> 01:06:17,578
few other people that are making femini

1580
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:19,260
seats longer than anyone else in the U.S

1581
01:06:17,579 --> 01:06:21,359
we've just never been able to figure out

1582
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:22,920
that one factor and when you sell the

1583
01:06:21,358 --> 01:06:24,480
spray people are always like well how do

1584
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:25,740
we know for sure and it's and and to

1585
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:29,400
tell them

1586
01:06:25,739 --> 01:06:31,019
I don't know just numbers bet on numbers

1587
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:32,519
always use high amounts of numbers

1588
01:06:31,019 --> 01:06:34,079
because odds are in your favor

1589
01:06:32,519 --> 01:06:36,358
eventually if you use enough numbers

1590
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:38,160
that you'll have successful not I mean

1591
01:06:36,358 --> 01:06:40,078
the one thing I've learned too when I

1592
01:06:38,159 --> 01:06:42,779
did a population of

1593
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:44,579
uh there were 16 000 plants three

1594
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:45,599
thousand of which I reversed and it was

1595
01:06:44,579 --> 01:06:48,180
hemp

1596
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:51,119
one thing I noticed with hemp is unlike

1597
01:06:48,179 --> 01:06:52,919
like high THC cannabis It reversed

1598
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:56,099
immediately usually there's like the

1599
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:57,659
Stagger period in cannabis uh high THC

1600
01:06:56,099 --> 01:07:00,180
cannabis where it takes two and a half

1601
01:06:57,659 --> 01:07:02,879
weeks to then show their sex as being a

1602
01:07:00,179 --> 01:07:04,618
male completely reversed in hemp it was

1603
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:07,260
like that and they were ready to drop

1604
01:07:04,619 --> 01:07:09,838
off for fiber or grain

1605
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:11,940
um this was hemp uh it was remedy hemp

1606
01:07:09,838 --> 01:07:15,719
Kush cross so it was more for CBD

1607
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:18,539
production okay so it was high c yeah

1608
01:07:15,719 --> 01:07:21,419
and it triggered immediately but in that

1609
01:07:18,539 --> 01:07:23,220
population of 16 or I'm sorry 3 000 that

1610
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:25,260
were reversed there was probably three

1611
01:07:23,219 --> 01:07:26,818
that didn't reverse at all stayed

1612
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:28,740
totally female no matter how much they

1613
01:07:26,818 --> 01:07:31,619
were sprayed with and I'd never seen

1614
01:07:28,739 --> 01:07:33,959
that in in high THC cannabis but I had

1615
01:07:31,619 --> 01:07:35,579
never ran that many plants and high THC

1616
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:37,740
cannabis so it was really interesting to

1617
01:07:35,579 --> 01:07:39,059
see stuff like that uh in sexual

1618
01:07:37,739 --> 01:07:41,639
reversals that there were even plants

1619
01:07:39,059 --> 01:07:43,079
that were totally resistant to uh that

1620
01:07:41,639 --> 01:07:45,659
kind of spray insect reversals

1621
01:07:43,079 --> 01:07:47,339
interesting thing yeah but it took

1622
01:07:45,659 --> 01:07:49,920
seeing a large population to even be

1623
01:07:47,338 --> 01:07:52,578
able to see three you know like mm-hmm

1624
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:52,579
yeah I

1625
01:07:55,980 --> 01:08:00,240
am turning on what jeans are you turning

1626
01:07:57,659 --> 01:08:02,519
off right I think that that's super

1627
01:08:00,239 --> 01:08:04,439
interesting yeah if you ever want to

1628
01:08:02,519 --> 01:08:06,298
work on anything I am more than happy to

1629
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:08,039
send you whatever you need we're always

1630
01:08:06,298 --> 01:08:10,920
doing all kinds of experiments using all

1631
01:08:08,039 --> 01:08:14,099
kinds of different ethylene blockers and

1632
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:17,579
all kinds of different stuff but yeah

1633
01:08:14,099 --> 01:08:19,199
um I I think that you should quantify

1634
01:08:17,579 --> 01:08:21,420
those things right of these however

1635
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:24,298
because I think that numbers are so

1636
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:26,940
powerful so of these 16

1637
01:08:24,298 --> 01:08:28,619
000 there were I don't know 11 000 and

1638
01:08:26,939 --> 01:08:30,059
then you quantify and then when you do

1639
01:08:28,619 --> 01:08:32,939
it again in

1640
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:35,400
I don't know 20 25 then you do it again

1641
01:08:32,939 --> 01:08:37,678
and you quantify and and then you have

1642
01:08:35,399 --> 01:08:40,019
numbers like what is the ratio what are

1643
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:42,420
the odds and then when you sell your

1644
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:45,480
product you can say like hey you know

1645
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:48,060
it works for 30 of the individuals when

1646
01:08:45,479 --> 01:08:51,599
you have 1600 you should do it when you

1647
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:53,100
have more than five or right you'll find

1648
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:54,359
that a lot of like

1649
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:56,460
um cannabis breeders that have been

1650
01:08:54,359 --> 01:08:58,620
doing it a long time they're off they

1651
01:08:56,460 --> 01:09:00,659
all fall on the autism spectrum hardcore

1652
01:08:58,619 --> 01:09:02,278
and most of them keep like refuse to

1653
01:09:00,659 --> 01:09:03,599
keep data written down and it's all up

1654
01:09:02,279 --> 01:09:06,120
here because they've lived with that

1655
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:07,620
idea that like if I get caught with any

1656
01:09:06,119 --> 01:09:08,519
kind of numbers or data I'm gonna get

1657
01:09:07,619 --> 01:09:10,198
busted and they're going to use it

1658
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:12,359
against me in a court of law so almost

1659
01:09:10,198 --> 01:09:14,519
everyone keeps every bit of data up it's

1660
01:09:12,359 --> 01:09:16,380
crazy some of the like I'm not that

1661
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:17,819
great at keeping data stored like my

1662
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:20,159
memory is not that great but some of my

1663
01:09:17,819 --> 01:09:23,279
friends I'm like how do you remember

1664
01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:25,439
like 25 years of data and they just

1665
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:27,299
magically do but yeah nothing's better

1666
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:30,358
than hard written data with you know

1667
01:09:27,298 --> 01:09:32,219
that you can compare and refer back to

1668
01:09:30,359 --> 01:09:35,100
yeah

1669
01:09:32,219 --> 01:09:36,719
so I want to talk and and of course this

1670
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:38,460
is what you refer to as you know

1671
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:40,560
something that probably people think is

1672
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:42,359
the most controversial topic that you're

1673
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:44,279
that you like talking about is GMO

1674
01:09:42,359 --> 01:09:45,719
science and cannabis and I want to talk

1675
01:09:44,279 --> 01:09:46,980
about the future of cannabis and where

1676
01:09:45,719 --> 01:09:49,020
you think it's going to go from here and

1677
01:09:46,979 --> 01:09:50,539
where we can go what what's what are

1678
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:54,560
some of the beautiful things that that

1679
01:09:50,539 --> 01:09:58,979
GMO science can bring to cannabis

1680
01:09:54,560 --> 01:10:00,420
well I mean GMO so I I have a

1681
01:09:58,979 --> 01:10:03,000
non-for-profit organization the

1682
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:04,859
agricultural genomics foundation and the

1683
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:09,300
aim of that non-for-profit and I hope

1684
01:10:04,859 --> 01:10:11,759
that I someday can fulfill that goal is

1685
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:15,420
to develop

1686
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:18,300
genetic tools for the use of the public

1687
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:22,260
these genetic tools include GMO so GMOs

1688
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:26,219
is genetically modified organism yes

1689
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:27,960
what classify as a GMO or not that's

1690
01:10:26,219 --> 01:10:32,219
very debatable

1691
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:35,760
but in general you know if you can if

1692
01:10:32,219 --> 01:10:38,819
you need to be in a lab

1693
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:41,340
space for you to

1694
01:10:38,819 --> 01:10:45,119
put the gene or take it out or Express

1695
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:46,679
whatever then it's probably a GMO right

1696
01:10:45,119 --> 01:10:47,640
yeah

1697
01:10:46,679 --> 01:10:52,199
um

1698
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:54,060
I think that GMOs are a very important

1699
01:10:52,198 --> 01:10:56,658
tool

1700
01:10:54,060 --> 01:11:00,000
um they

1701
01:10:56,658 --> 01:11:02,460
we have camels everywhere this big

1702
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:05,219
strawberries in the supermarket they're

1703
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:08,819
polyploid and they were

1704
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:12,179
you know many they are not existing

1705
01:11:08,819 --> 01:11:13,679
naturally it was humans that somehow

1706
01:11:12,179 --> 01:11:17,158
made that I mean yeah artificial

1707
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:20,039
selection is being done by humans but

1708
01:11:17,158 --> 01:11:22,559
there are a lot of GMOs in many things

1709
01:11:20,039 --> 01:11:25,079
that we eat in rice and a bunch of

1710
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:27,060
things I think GMOs could be super

1711
01:11:25,079 --> 01:11:29,640
useful for cannabis

1712
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:32,159
for marijuana for example

1713
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:34,980
to enhance maybe the production of

1714
01:11:32,158 --> 01:11:38,158
cannabinoids in hemp

1715
01:11:34,979 --> 01:11:41,819
to silence certain genes if you don't

1716
01:11:38,158 --> 01:11:44,339
want THC then that's been a big problem

1717
01:11:41,819 --> 01:11:47,340
for a lot of uh hemp producers is

1718
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:49,860
testing hot sure texting hot and

1719
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:52,819
especially if you're growing for fiber

1720
01:11:49,859 --> 01:11:55,619
for grain why do you care about THC

1721
01:11:52,819 --> 01:11:57,539
energy into it into it yeah and

1722
01:11:55,619 --> 01:12:00,479
sometimes some of these varieties for

1723
01:11:57,539 --> 01:12:03,600
grain over fiber go over 0.3 they have I

1724
01:12:00,479 --> 01:12:06,658
don't know 0.5 who cares if a grain

1725
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:09,719
variety has 0.8 the farmer because now

1726
01:12:06,658 --> 01:12:13,259
he's in he or she are in trouble exactly

1727
01:12:09,719 --> 01:12:16,158
it's serious at that point exactly so I

1728
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:18,420
I think that that for example in the sex

1729
01:12:16,158 --> 01:12:20,420
determination stuff I I think that that

1730
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:23,100
would be important to know exactly

1731
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:24,779
whether or not your plant is going to

1732
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:26,400
produce

1733
01:12:24,779 --> 01:12:29,819
um flowers of the opposite sex because

1734
01:12:26,399 --> 01:12:32,158
sometimes your plants just come out and

1735
01:12:29,819 --> 01:12:35,880
you then have seeds and it's like who

1736
01:12:32,158 --> 01:12:38,158
was the Hermie here yeah right so you I

1737
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:41,279
think that GMOs could be useful for that

1738
01:12:38,158 --> 01:12:43,920
and for hemp for fiber on for grain as

1739
01:12:41,279 --> 01:12:46,738
well to produce bigger grain or to

1740
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:49,560
produce plants that may be um this is

1741
01:12:46,738 --> 01:12:52,799
resistant to particular diseases right

1742
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:54,840
now with a changing environment due to

1743
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:57,239
you know the climate crisis I think that

1744
01:12:54,840 --> 01:13:00,000
those techniques are gonna come very

1745
01:12:57,238 --> 01:13:03,299
handy so in general I see a very bright

1746
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:06,420
future in that sense the issue for me

1747
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:08,640
these tools are happening in every

1748
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:11,100
single crop it's not just cannabis

1749
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:13,320
they're not happening yeah the issue for

1750
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:16,500
me is who owns

1751
01:13:13,319 --> 01:13:18,960
those tools absolutely who is able to

1752
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:21,238
access those tools and whether the

1753
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:24,960
access of that of those tools is going

1754
01:13:21,238 --> 01:13:28,019
to benefit the public the grower the

1755
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:30,480
consumer or if it's gonna benefit a

1756
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:34,260
corporation sure I think that's super

1757
01:13:30,479 --> 01:13:38,399
important the politics of it yeah that

1758
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:40,079
is my issue with those tools hence why I

1759
01:13:38,399 --> 01:13:42,420
have the non-profit organization which

1760
01:13:40,079 --> 01:13:46,019
at some point I hope that I can grow

1761
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:49,920
enough for I mean I I don't know if it's

1762
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:53,640
gonna be a big enough not for profit to

1763
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:57,319
combat you know big corporations

1764
01:13:53,640 --> 01:14:01,260
in bigag or big tobacco or big Pharma

1765
01:13:57,319 --> 01:14:03,479
but uh but maybe we can help the public

1766
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:06,239
somehow

1767
01:14:03,479 --> 01:14:08,819
what kind of funding would we need in

1768
01:14:06,238 --> 01:14:12,059
order to be able to to make any kind of

1769
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:15,179
difference in in being able to use this

1770
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:17,219
technology for people that that it could

1771
01:14:15,179 --> 01:14:18,539
benefit that that maybe aren't rich I

1772
01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:20,698
mean because I know this technology is

1773
01:14:18,539 --> 01:14:22,679
expensive that's that's one of the

1774
01:14:20,698 --> 01:14:24,238
prohibitive factors and why you would

1775
01:14:22,679 --> 01:14:25,560
have to establish a non-profit in order

1776
01:14:24,238 --> 01:14:27,419
to do this

1777
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:31,020
um it what kind of funding would we need

1778
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:33,239
like Elon Musk type funding or you know

1779
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:36,060
is it a few million

1780
01:14:33,238 --> 01:14:37,500
so yeah many of these companies many of

1781
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:38,219
this

1782
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:40,380
um

1783
01:14:38,219 --> 01:14:41,819
these companies in the khanabi space you

1784
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:43,920
know like the philosoph companies

1785
01:14:41,819 --> 01:14:47,219
medicinal genomics type companies they

1786
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:48,960
have raised in the millions like four

1787
01:14:47,219 --> 01:14:52,319
five six

1788
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:57,060
Max 10 less than 10 7 8 million dollars

1789
01:14:52,319 --> 01:14:58,559
I think that for us at agf agricultural

1790
01:14:57,060 --> 01:15:01,199
genomics Foundation is is a

1791
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:02,100
non-for-profit that that I run

1792
01:15:01,198 --> 01:15:05,519
um

1793
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:06,120
I am looking for a few

1794
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:09,420
um

1795
01:15:06,119 --> 01:15:12,300
thousand dollars to start public

1796
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:15,658
awareness and public education

1797
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:18,840
um and to teach people really how what

1798
01:15:15,658 --> 01:15:21,299
is a genome how do you how do you do

1799
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:24,000
these tools right and and for that you

1800
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:25,800
know a few hundred thousand dollars

1801
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,979
could

1802
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:31,260
go a long way or a few thousand dollars

1803
01:15:28,979 --> 01:15:32,939
you know less than a hundred thousand

1804
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:35,640
dollars like few thousand dollars could

1805
01:15:32,939 --> 01:15:37,859
go a long way on teaching people how to

1806
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:39,539
use this not not that any everyone is

1807
01:15:37,859 --> 01:15:43,198
going to become a genomicist or a

1808
01:15:39,539 --> 01:15:46,019
bioinformatician but but how to be

1809
01:15:43,198 --> 01:15:49,259
educated about it and that's what we're

1810
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:52,100
trying to do now is figuring out how to

1811
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:55,320
raise that funding to be able to start

1812
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:58,320
growing this and to start educating the

1813
01:15:55,319 --> 01:15:59,939
public and and um and making some of

1814
01:15:58,319 --> 01:16:02,579
these tools

1815
01:15:59,939 --> 01:16:05,639
um and then being able to

1816
01:16:02,579 --> 01:16:07,920
to get this yeah running basically

1817
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:10,280
so how far out do you think we are from

1818
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:10,279
say

1819
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:16,500
um turning on turning on or off the gene

1820
01:16:13,979 --> 01:16:19,259
that is responsible for like let's let's

1821
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:21,600
say hplv something like that a viroid

1822
01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:23,760
that's that's a ravaging cannabis right

1823
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:25,260
now how how far out would we be from

1824
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:27,960
being able to combat something like that

1825
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:30,780
GMO speaking so that's the Hop late

1826
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:33,300
Environ yes yeah is it really about in

1827
01:16:30,779 --> 01:16:35,698
California it's bad everywhere um

1828
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:38,699
because of the nurseries and how how

1829
01:16:35,698 --> 01:16:40,559
hype strains kind of were pushed in and

1830
01:16:38,698 --> 01:16:43,799
there were demands for specific strains

1831
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:46,440
it spread like wildfire wildfire and in

1832
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:49,020
Spain now too here we we don't have that

1833
01:16:46,439 --> 01:16:50,698
as much in New York state oh yeah a

1834
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:52,920
nurse State's not one of the big big

1835
01:16:50,698 --> 01:16:54,178
hubs of of growing with nurseries and

1836
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:55,980
stuff like that California Oregon

1837
01:16:54,179 --> 01:16:58,619
Colorado

1838
01:16:55,979 --> 01:17:00,959
um Washington Spain I know Amsterdam's

1839
01:16:58,619 --> 01:17:04,019
been ravaged recently

1840
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:06,779
um Belgium yeah it's all over now

1841
01:17:04,020 --> 01:17:09,719
oh wow so it's a matter of time it's a

1842
01:17:06,779 --> 01:17:12,719
matter of time yeah how long are we

1843
01:17:09,719 --> 01:17:14,340
gonna take I don't know you know

1844
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:17,039
it's just

1845
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:19,020
because the Seas evolves too right we

1846
01:17:17,039 --> 01:17:20,880
can see it in covet and then we have the

1847
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:23,219
Delta then we have the Omicron that we

1848
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:27,060
have right so it's it's also changing so

1849
01:17:23,219 --> 01:17:29,100
it's it's it's also you are changing and

1850
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:31,320
the virus is changing as well so that

1851
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:34,079
that one is hard what I would recommend

1852
01:17:31,319 --> 01:17:36,599
in the case is have a good tissue

1853
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:39,420
culture facility where you can do tissue

1854
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:42,539
culture and you can assure that your

1855
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:44,600
stock is clean yeah which is is hard

1856
01:17:42,539 --> 01:17:47,760
yeah um

1857
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:50,640
yeah I I think that breeding is a is

1858
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:52,440
another good thing when you have actual

1859
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:54,659
males and females that you're breeding

1860
01:17:52,439 --> 01:17:57,000
and then yes again you have to do the

1861
01:17:54,658 --> 01:17:58,319
final hunting and then it takes several

1862
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:00,179
generations and then you have two

1863
01:17:58,319 --> 01:18:02,279
siblings that are nothing alike and then

1864
01:18:00,179 --> 01:18:03,960
you have to grow however many hundreds

1865
01:18:02,279 --> 01:18:07,319
of thousands of seeds to look for that

1866
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:08,520
one that is the one that you like but as

1867
01:18:07,319 --> 01:18:10,799
you go

1868
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:13,980
and as you're doing inbreeding right

1869
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:16,739
parents and Offspring or full sibs then

1870
01:18:13,979 --> 01:18:18,479
you get better traits

1871
01:18:16,738 --> 01:18:21,000
um but um

1872
01:18:18,479 --> 01:18:22,678
but in terms of of disease I think that

1873
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:24,899
the best thing that you can have is

1874
01:18:22,679 --> 01:18:27,060
diversity is as much variation as

1875
01:18:24,899 --> 01:18:30,420
possible because then if you have full

1876
01:18:27,060 --> 01:18:32,520
sibs maybe these two are affected by the

1877
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:35,520
virus but maybe these two are not right

1878
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:37,080
exactly it's super important so that

1879
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:39,480
regarding disease but there's other

1880
01:18:37,079 --> 01:18:41,460
traits that I think cannabinoids maybe

1881
01:18:39,479 --> 01:18:43,500
terpenes there's other traits that I

1882
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:47,039
know that people are looking at

1883
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:50,219
flowering time jeans sure that that we

1884
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:52,380
may have genetic tools available sooner

1885
01:18:50,219 --> 01:18:53,760
oh interesting see that would that would

1886
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:55,199
be so cool because they're you know I

1887
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:58,560
mean flowering time is a serious

1888
01:18:55,198 --> 01:19:00,599
determiner of probably as best we can

1889
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:03,300
tell hi I mean there's certain highs

1890
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:05,579
that you can get from um a 18-week

1891
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:07,860
flowering plant from Colombia that you

1892
01:19:05,579 --> 01:19:10,679
can't get from a eight-week flowering

1893
01:19:07,859 --> 01:19:13,019
plant from Afghanistan so that's really

1894
01:19:10,679 --> 01:19:15,480
interesting yeah yeah I'd like to see

1895
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:17,699
that that played with a bunch is there

1896
01:19:15,479 --> 01:19:19,319
anything else in breeding in cannabis

1897
01:19:17,698 --> 01:19:21,539
that that has totally blown your mind

1898
01:19:19,319 --> 01:19:23,099
that you found like that was quite

1899
01:19:21,539 --> 01:19:24,539
unexpected once you started looking at

1900
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:26,940
the genes

1901
01:19:24,539 --> 01:19:29,279
that was quite unexpected once he

1902
01:19:26,939 --> 01:19:32,460
started looking at the gym

1903
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:35,219
well the cannabinoid jeans it was

1904
01:19:32,460 --> 01:19:37,619
you know it's so cool because at the

1905
01:19:35,219 --> 01:19:39,739
beginning we thought

1906
01:19:37,619 --> 01:19:42,479
that it was one gene

1907
01:19:39,738 --> 01:19:44,579
with two different alleles like with two

1908
01:19:42,479 --> 01:19:47,339
different forms of of a gene right yeah

1909
01:19:44,579 --> 01:19:50,460
so that if you were

1910
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:51,960
dominant for one then you produce CBD if

1911
01:19:50,460 --> 01:19:54,119
you were dominant for the other one that

1912
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:56,039
you produce THC and then if you were

1913
01:19:54,119 --> 01:19:58,679
heterozygous right so you were

1914
01:19:56,039 --> 01:20:00,779
homozygous you produce THC homozygous

1915
01:19:58,679 --> 01:20:02,640
for the other allele you produce CBD and

1916
01:20:00,779 --> 01:20:05,340
then if you were heterozygous then you

1917
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:08,280
produce both yeah but then we found out

1918
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:09,980
that there are multiple genes related to

1919
01:20:08,279 --> 01:20:13,920
cannabinoid production

1920
01:20:09,979 --> 01:20:16,979
multiple and that individuals differ in

1921
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:20,039
the number of genes so when we found

1922
01:20:16,979 --> 01:20:22,139
that out I remember I remember the day

1923
01:20:20,039 --> 01:20:24,119
that we found this out and I was doing

1924
01:20:22,140 --> 01:20:26,159
the genome alignments and I was looking

1925
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:29,399
at them and then

1926
01:20:26,158 --> 01:20:32,279
my lab mate at the time who's now a good

1927
01:20:29,399 --> 01:20:33,658
friend and collaborator Kyle he was the

1928
01:20:32,279 --> 01:20:35,759
one that was like this doesn't look

1929
01:20:33,658 --> 01:20:37,799
right look at this alignments it looks

1930
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:39,659
and then we found out that there were

1931
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:41,940
actually different genes and there were

1932
01:20:39,658 --> 01:20:44,219
multiple genes that were very similar to

1933
01:20:41,939 --> 01:20:46,139
each other and then we found out that

1934
01:20:44,219 --> 01:20:48,000
yes indeed there are different copies

1935
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:50,159
individuals differ in this different

1936
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:53,819
copies but these genes are in close

1937
01:20:50,158 --> 01:20:55,619
proximity and now I'm working on this

1938
01:20:53,819 --> 01:20:58,380
paper that I hope to have published by

1939
01:20:55,619 --> 01:21:02,760
2023

1940
01:20:58,380 --> 01:21:05,279
um that we now see that

1941
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:06,840
there are multiple genes for example for

1942
01:21:05,279 --> 01:21:09,059
CBC production

1943
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:12,239
right so there's a bunch of genes

1944
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:14,580
related to CBC production why is CBC

1945
01:21:12,238 --> 01:21:17,039
produced in such little quantities

1946
01:21:14,579 --> 01:21:18,658
why if there's so many genes related to

1947
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:22,738
CBC production like that is a question

1948
01:21:18,658 --> 01:21:25,259
that I'm like why and my hypothesis is

1949
01:21:22,738 --> 01:21:26,759
that you know like these enzymes we know

1950
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:28,380
that they're very similar they act on

1951
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:30,060
the same precursor molecule which is

1952
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:32,880
cbga

1953
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:36,659
um and they're sloppy because they

1954
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:39,539
produce each other's compounds and they

1955
01:21:36,658 --> 01:21:42,658
are promiscuous because they act on cbga

1956
01:21:39,539 --> 01:21:44,158
the same precursor molecule so they are

1957
01:21:42,658 --> 01:21:45,079
promiscuous they are sloppy they're

1958
01:21:44,158 --> 01:21:49,439
nothing

1959
01:21:45,079 --> 01:21:52,260
they're not very accurate at all yeah my

1960
01:21:49,439 --> 01:21:54,899
hypothesis is that cbca synthase so this

1961
01:21:52,260 --> 01:21:57,179
enzyme that is producing cbca

1962
01:21:54,899 --> 01:22:00,000
is producing everything else except for

1963
01:21:57,179 --> 01:22:02,699
CBC right it's producing everything else

1964
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:05,579
because the genes are so abundant

1965
01:22:02,698 --> 01:22:07,379
everyone independent if you're a hem for

1966
01:22:05,579 --> 01:22:09,840
fiber and grain or independent if you're

1967
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:12,840
a marijuana type or if you're a cbda

1968
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:16,440
type of plant independent of that

1969
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:19,020
everyone has a cbca gene what are those

1970
01:22:16,439 --> 01:22:21,899
guys doing they're partying what are

1971
01:22:19,020 --> 01:22:24,239
they doing yeah that's so fascinating

1972
01:22:21,899 --> 01:22:26,158
and are there other cannabinoids that

1973
01:22:24,238 --> 01:22:28,319
exist in cannabis that like we may not

1974
01:22:26,158 --> 01:22:30,059
even know about that may be more

1975
01:22:28,319 --> 01:22:32,579
important in the high factor than we

1976
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:36,239
even know or anything that exists like

1977
01:22:32,579 --> 01:22:38,219
that I don't know but you know the

1978
01:22:36,238 --> 01:22:40,019
terpenes are producing very low

1979
01:22:38,219 --> 01:22:44,100
quantities so you have for example that

1980
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:46,920
for THC you have 28 by dry weight or

1981
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:49,739
even 30 even 35 by dry weight while you

1982
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:53,460
see for example for mercy and it's like

1983
01:22:49,738 --> 01:22:56,339
five percent or three percent but it

1984
01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:58,679
still smells yeah yeah and there's some

1985
01:22:56,340 --> 01:23:01,260
things that are not even so that that

1986
01:22:58,679 --> 01:23:03,899
are even the part per million so they're

1987
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:08,820
really tiny amount whether or not that

1988
01:23:03,899 --> 01:23:10,738
affects your high I don't know right but

1989
01:23:08,819 --> 01:23:13,259
I think that's something that we do

1990
01:23:10,738 --> 01:23:16,158
desperately need to do in the hanabis

1991
01:23:13,260 --> 01:23:19,199
industry is to do

1992
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:22,619
controlled studies without you knowing

1993
01:23:19,198 --> 01:23:24,779
what you're consuming so we have this

1994
01:23:22,619 --> 01:23:27,359
joint we know the exact chemotype of

1995
01:23:24,779 --> 01:23:30,238
this joint or or whatever chemotype we

1996
01:23:27,359 --> 01:23:33,719
know because we're discovering like now

1997
01:23:30,238 --> 01:23:35,459
this thcp like yeah yeah it became a

1998
01:23:33,719 --> 01:23:38,100
thing so maybe there's another

1999
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:41,579
cannabinoid that we had not calibrated

2000
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:44,880
the PLC whatever chemists do not hate me

2001
01:23:41,579 --> 01:23:47,519
for the maybe what I just said was

2002
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:50,340
completely stupid but

2003
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:52,140
um but okay we measure the chemotype and

2004
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:54,900
then we give it to you and the Matthew

2005
01:23:52,140 --> 01:23:57,840
smoke this and tell me what you feel a

2006
01:23:54,899 --> 01:24:00,839
questionnaire maybe if we can we can

2007
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:04,079
take blood before and afterwards right

2008
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:06,179
yeah and then blinded study that you

2009
01:24:04,079 --> 01:24:09,000
don't know what you're getting and then

2010
01:24:06,179 --> 01:24:11,340
we can do it with however many hundreds

2011
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:14,158
of people different

2012
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:16,560
different joints with different uh

2013
01:24:14,158 --> 01:24:18,000
chemotypes yeah and that people do not

2014
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:19,860
know what they're getting and then they

2015
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:22,920
tell us okay this is what I felt on

2016
01:24:19,859 --> 01:24:25,859
Friday I exercise I ate I slept I am

2017
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:29,039
depressed right we know that for alcohol

2018
01:24:25,859 --> 01:24:31,559
if you're depressed or if you're

2019
01:24:29,039 --> 01:24:34,439
um if you ate we know that there's a

2020
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:36,659
difference in in how drunk you get oh

2021
01:24:34,439 --> 01:24:38,519
sure women and men we know that there's

2022
01:24:36,658 --> 01:24:41,639
a difference in alcohol in cannabis we

2023
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:43,560
we do have some suggestions that there

2024
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:46,500
are differences between women and men

2025
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:49,380
but we don't know if you ate if you

2026
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:51,238
slept if you exercise am I gonna feel

2027
01:24:49,380 --> 01:24:53,460
the same with this joint today then on

2028
01:24:51,238 --> 01:24:55,738
Friday I don't know yeah there's no way

2029
01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:58,560
to quantify it yeah yeah so we need

2030
01:24:55,738 --> 01:25:00,839
future studies I think and and with with

2031
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:03,420
the laws in place currently we we cannot

2032
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:06,300
do those studies federally

2033
01:25:03,420 --> 01:25:07,800
no federally we cannot but we could do I

2034
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:10,140
mean in

2035
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:13,320
in regulated States

2036
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:15,000
um and in Colorado one of my um I have

2037
01:25:13,319 --> 01:25:17,880
some papers with her cinnamon Bidwell

2038
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:21,300
collaborator of mine she has the canavan

2039
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:22,980
and in the Caravan she goes to places

2040
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:26,400
because she cannot bring people on

2041
01:25:22,979 --> 01:25:28,859
campus and have them go get high so she

2042
01:25:26,399 --> 01:25:31,079
goes in the van and then she takes up

2043
01:25:28,859 --> 01:25:32,698
blood before you consume it and after

2044
01:25:31,079 --> 01:25:34,800
you consume it and what she tells you is

2045
01:25:32,698 --> 01:25:38,099
just consume it as you were normally

2046
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:40,020
gonna consume cannabis sure and and then

2047
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:42,480
she takes blood and she does some sort

2048
01:25:40,020 --> 01:25:44,940
of cognitive tests can you really so we

2049
01:25:42,479 --> 01:25:46,799
know that there's short-term memory so

2050
01:25:44,939 --> 01:25:50,759
she does you know remember like try to

2051
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:52,860
memorize this grocery store list yeah um

2052
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:55,079
and things like that before and after so

2053
01:25:52,859 --> 01:25:57,599
so she has done something like that but

2054
01:25:55,079 --> 01:26:00,359
we don't know with particular chemotypes

2055
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:02,039
right yeah and then again for you to

2056
01:26:00,359 --> 01:26:05,219
measure those chemotypes you have to go

2057
01:26:02,039 --> 01:26:07,738
to a reputable lab there are some Labs

2058
01:26:05,219 --> 01:26:09,719
that are not that reputable yeah yeah

2059
01:26:07,738 --> 01:26:14,819
for sure but there are some that are

2060
01:26:09,719 --> 01:26:17,579
yeah so so those particular labs

2061
01:26:14,819 --> 01:26:18,719
yeah that's that's that's fascinating I

2062
01:26:17,579 --> 01:26:20,460
think I think you wouldn't find a

2063
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:22,500
shortage of people wanting to do that

2064
01:26:20,460 --> 01:26:25,020
like willing to give their blood to just

2065
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:28,198
go get baked and give results I'd be

2066
01:26:25,020 --> 01:26:31,080
down I mean that sounds like fun I think

2067
01:26:28,198 --> 01:26:33,599
fun science it would be super fun but

2068
01:26:31,079 --> 01:26:35,039
from the researchers perspective

2069
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:37,020
do need

2070
01:26:35,039 --> 01:26:38,579
a lot of paperwork in order to be able

2071
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:40,440
to do that even to give you a

2072
01:26:38,579 --> 01:26:42,420
questionnaire like even if I'm not

2073
01:26:40,439 --> 01:26:44,879
touching you just give you the

2074
01:26:42,420 --> 01:26:46,679
questionnaire there's a huge amount of

2075
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:48,900
paperwork and stuff that you have to do

2076
01:26:46,679 --> 01:26:50,639
yeah I can't imagine taking blood like

2077
01:26:48,899 --> 01:26:52,559
all that stuff would be so much

2078
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:54,779
paperwork to even be able to do that on

2079
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:55,920
people yeah and then it's like why are

2080
01:26:54,779 --> 01:26:58,319
you doing that no I'm getting people

2081
01:26:55,920 --> 01:27:01,199
high it's like yeah yeah

2082
01:26:58,319 --> 01:27:03,539
oh man well is there anything else you

2083
01:27:01,198 --> 01:27:05,099
want to talk about before we uh finish

2084
01:27:03,539 --> 01:27:06,539
up I I want to talk about your

2085
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:07,500
non-profit again can we mention what

2086
01:27:06,539 --> 01:27:11,100
it's called

2087
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:15,420
the agricultural genomics Foundation agf

2088
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:17,699
and the website can I put it here in the

2089
01:27:15,420 --> 01:27:18,658
in the chat uh what is it I'll type it

2090
01:27:17,698 --> 01:27:21,799
out right here yeah you can put it in

2091
01:27:18,658 --> 01:27:21,799
the chat and I can cut and paste it over

2092
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:26,719
let's see

2093
01:27:27,738 --> 01:27:35,638
agriculturalgenomics.org there we go and

2094
01:27:30,119 --> 01:27:37,800
I can paste it over let's see right here

2095
01:27:35,639 --> 01:27:41,460
so that is the name of the non-profit

2096
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:43,980
and I do a lot of public Outreach

2097
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:46,020
through it I'm trying to educate the

2098
01:27:43,979 --> 01:27:48,238
public through it

2099
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:51,060
um I also do Consulting

2100
01:27:48,238 --> 01:27:53,158
um as a side gig and

2101
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:56,820
um you can find me

2102
01:27:53,158 --> 01:27:58,198
on social media and what's your what's

2103
01:27:56,819 --> 01:28:03,420
your Twitter name

2104
01:27:58,198 --> 01:28:03,419
it's at Kana bakana

2105
01:28:03,479 --> 01:28:06,599
over here so we can get it on there

2106
01:28:05,340 --> 01:28:09,600
because I know everybody's going to be

2107
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:11,880
asking and Instagram as well

2108
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:14,719
I am then on LinkedIn I also use

2109
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:17,279
LinkedIn let me see my Google

2110
01:28:14,719 --> 01:28:20,819
profile because we don't know if Twitter

2111
01:28:17,279 --> 01:28:22,979
is gonna live yeah through Elon yeah

2112
01:28:20,819 --> 01:28:25,439
nobody knows yet yeah nobody knows

2113
01:28:22,979 --> 01:28:26,819
whether Twitter is gonna be a thing

2114
01:28:25,439 --> 01:28:29,519
anymore

2115
01:28:26,819 --> 01:28:32,519
so uh so I don't know I mean is that

2116
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:33,780
LinkedIn seems so boring sometimes I you

2117
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:36,239
know I've never even signed up for

2118
01:28:33,779 --> 01:28:38,698
LinkedIn in my life like

2119
01:28:36,238 --> 01:28:42,178
I I just never done it I don't even know

2120
01:28:38,698 --> 01:28:45,238
anything about it so it's supposed to be

2121
01:28:42,179 --> 01:28:46,440
a professional Facebook in my opinion

2122
01:28:45,238 --> 01:28:50,579
yeah

2123
01:28:46,439 --> 01:28:52,319
um and I have been I I accept everyone

2124
01:28:50,579 --> 01:28:56,399
on LinkedIn it's like do you want to be

2125
01:28:52,319 --> 01:28:59,939
my friends like sure but LinkedIn lately

2126
01:28:56,399 --> 01:29:01,979
has been good I I do Consulting and I

2127
01:28:59,939 --> 01:29:05,460
have found several gigs through Linkedin

2128
01:29:01,979 --> 01:29:06,299
lately so it's accomplished its job so

2129
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:08,219
yeah

2130
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:10,860
you know you never know but if you wanna

2131
01:29:08,219 --> 01:29:13,439
hear me run politically like I did to

2132
01:29:10,859 --> 01:29:16,738
Matthew today I love it

2133
01:29:13,439 --> 01:29:20,819
I I just cannot I do not understand how

2134
01:29:16,738 --> 01:29:23,218
can you not be political in this climate

2135
01:29:20,819 --> 01:29:26,460
right now yeah and my family was United

2136
01:29:23,219 --> 01:29:29,698
Farm Workers so I'm hardcore like you

2137
01:29:26,460 --> 01:29:33,000
know Union you know social programs I'm

2138
01:29:29,698 --> 01:29:34,198
all about it is that why

2139
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,639
why it is

2140
01:29:34,198 --> 01:29:37,919
um the the overall goal with the

2141
01:29:35,639 --> 01:29:40,319
Syndicate when I originally came up with

2142
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:42,840
it and it's like a pie in the sky idea

2143
01:29:40,319 --> 01:29:44,880
where I want to take it but a lot of

2144
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:46,739
these people that came before me don't

2145
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:48,480
like they we even me we don't have

2146
01:29:46,738 --> 01:29:50,399
retirement programs for any of them and

2147
01:29:48,479 --> 01:29:52,559
I've seen a lot of people that laid the

2148
01:29:50,399 --> 01:29:54,119
foundation for this industry just be run

2149
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:56,100
over and they're having the hardest time

2150
01:29:54,119 --> 01:29:58,260
they're having to find new jobs and

2151
01:29:56,100 --> 01:30:00,420
these are people who deserve recognition

2152
01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:02,880
and and have earned their place in our

2153
01:30:00,420 --> 01:30:05,158
society and and I'd love to make it some

2154
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:07,139
kind of Union kind of deal where it's

2155
01:30:05,158 --> 01:30:08,638
there's retirement plans medical plans

2156
01:30:07,139 --> 01:30:11,039
you know things like that for people in

2157
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:12,719
the future but it's justifying this guy

2158
01:30:11,039 --> 01:30:15,479
idea because I don't know a lot of

2159
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:18,359
people that would be into putting their

2160
01:30:15,479 --> 01:30:20,459
hard time working money into it but I'll

2161
01:30:18,359 --> 01:30:21,779
keep putting my work in you know

2162
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:24,539
I

2163
01:30:21,779 --> 01:30:28,579
I think so did you see

2164
01:30:24,539 --> 01:30:28,579
that there was a

2165
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:38,039
of me regarding the Cannabis industry in

2166
01:30:34,079 --> 01:30:41,100
California I don't know whether

2167
01:30:38,039 --> 01:30:44,219
whether you watched it let me let me see

2168
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:47,219
if I if I find it but um

2169
01:30:44,219 --> 01:30:48,119
but uh they they

2170
01:30:47,219 --> 01:30:51,480
um

2171
01:30:48,119 --> 01:30:53,460
they have Steve D'Angelo

2172
01:30:51,479 --> 01:30:56,399
um and

2173
01:30:53,460 --> 01:30:59,460
um I think it's super interesting

2174
01:30:56,399 --> 01:31:01,138
because I think that California

2175
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:05,658
kind of

2176
01:31:01,139 --> 01:31:05,659
did it wrong you know yeah yeah

2177
01:31:05,698 --> 01:31:10,919
so Steve D'Angelo's nobody's like at

2178
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:13,619
least from our point of view like the

2179
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:15,119
the hardcore people like Steve D'Angelo

2180
01:31:13,619 --> 01:31:16,679
has never been someone that any of us

2181
01:31:15,119 --> 01:31:18,840
are like yeah I want to see that dude do

2182
01:31:16,679 --> 01:31:20,819
well because he was the first to bring

2183
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:22,319
in corporate push it and when he found

2184
01:31:20,819 --> 01:31:23,880
out he wasn't Rich enough to play ball

2185
01:31:22,319 --> 01:31:26,399
with the big boys recently he's like

2186
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:27,539
yeah I shouldn't have done prop 64. and

2187
01:31:26,399 --> 01:31:28,259
it's like well then why'd you push it

2188
01:31:27,539 --> 01:31:30,060
bro

2189
01:31:28,260 --> 01:31:32,340
you ruined a lot of people's lives in my

2190
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:36,179
opinion my friends are now out of out of

2191
01:31:32,340 --> 01:31:39,360
work and hurt but but I think you should

2192
01:31:36,179 --> 01:31:42,899
watch that that YouTube video

2193
01:31:39,359 --> 01:31:44,880
because he does talk about that you know

2194
01:31:42,899 --> 01:31:50,039
like he does talk about

2195
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:54,179
prop 64 and and how California kind of

2196
01:31:50,039 --> 01:31:58,880
did it wrong in that in that way right

2197
01:31:54,179 --> 01:32:02,880
um let me see if I find it in

2198
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:06,600
it's such a good is that my kid watches

2199
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:08,880
videos also in my thing so then I get

2200
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:11,760
you know like I know what you mean yeah

2201
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:13,859
your history gets all twisted up yeah my

2202
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:17,639
history it's all all like my kid

2203
01:32:13,859 --> 01:32:19,198
watching us stupid toy video I think I

2204
01:32:17,639 --> 01:32:22,079
think the hardest part for me with Steve

2205
01:32:19,198 --> 01:32:23,519
D'Angelo is that we were the group like

2206
01:32:22,079 --> 01:32:25,619
our friends were the group that was

2207
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:27,540
pushing back against him when we were

2208
01:32:25,619 --> 01:32:29,340
saying hey guy this isn't gonna work

2209
01:32:27,539 --> 01:32:31,800
it's gonna screw a lot of people and he

2210
01:32:29,340 --> 01:32:34,980
put so much money and hate behind it to

2211
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:36,539
push back against us and at the end he

2212
01:32:34,979 --> 01:32:39,479
realized oh

2213
01:32:36,539 --> 01:32:41,399
I don't get to play ball I'm not I'm not

2214
01:32:39,479 --> 01:32:43,259
a multi-trillionaire like these people

2215
01:32:41,399 --> 01:32:44,879
that are going to own cannabis this

2216
01:32:43,260 --> 01:32:47,520
isn't fair and I don't like what I see

2217
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:49,380
but we all saw that long before he did

2218
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:51,000
and he fought against us so it's like

2219
01:32:49,380 --> 01:32:52,199
yeah we get you don't see it now but if

2220
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,760
they would let you play ball you

2221
01:32:52,198 --> 01:32:55,079
probably would have you know that's the

2222
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:57,539
way I look at it with him very

2223
01:32:55,079 --> 01:32:59,460
disingenuous fellow I just you know I've

2224
01:32:57,539 --> 01:33:01,738
never understood really California in

2225
01:32:59,460 --> 01:33:03,840
general because California

2226
01:33:01,738 --> 01:33:05,638
is as big as Colombia almost in

2227
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:09,000
population right California has I don't

2228
01:33:05,639 --> 01:33:12,600
know 45 million people Colombia has 50

2229
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:16,679
million people so it's an entire country

2230
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:18,900
um it's huge uh it has an ocean it has

2231
01:33:16,679 --> 01:33:20,880
mountains it has a desert I I don't

2232
01:33:18,899 --> 01:33:24,779
really understand why California doesn't

2233
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:27,719
secede from the US oh all about it right

2234
01:33:24,779 --> 01:33:31,439
which it's the fourth largest economy in

2235
01:33:27,719 --> 01:33:35,639
the world I think fourth or six but

2236
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:38,000
around there right so so the just the

2237
01:33:35,639 --> 01:33:42,600
state of California

2238
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:44,279
so I I don't it's it's huge right but

2239
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:46,079
it's going on in California when you

2240
01:33:44,279 --> 01:33:48,359
talk about Steve it's it's so different

2241
01:33:46,079 --> 01:33:51,719
from the information that we get around

2242
01:33:48,359 --> 01:33:54,539
here but it is okay so I found it it is

2243
01:33:51,719 --> 01:33:56,698
called it's a it's a Forbes documented

2244
01:33:54,539 --> 01:33:59,760
documentary so I'm gonna put it here in

2245
01:33:56,698 --> 01:34:01,198
the chat okay Forbes and it's called how

2246
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:03,000
America

2247
01:34:01,198 --> 01:34:06,000
botched

2248
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:06,000
gotcha

2249
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:13,980
see and it was it was released five days

2250
01:34:12,420 --> 01:34:16,619
ago so I watched it this week oh

2251
01:34:13,979 --> 01:34:18,959
interesting okay yeah

2252
01:34:16,619 --> 01:34:21,359
um and I think that it's an interesting

2253
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:24,439
take I don't think I think that the

2254
01:34:21,359 --> 01:34:28,079
documentary should be how California

2255
01:34:24,439 --> 01:34:29,879
right because what's going on in the

2256
01:34:28,079 --> 01:34:32,158
other states is completely different yes

2257
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:35,039
California is the biggest Market in the

2258
01:34:32,158 --> 01:34:37,079
entire us yes but what's going on here

2259
01:34:35,039 --> 01:34:39,179
in New York it's very different from

2260
01:34:37,079 --> 01:34:40,380
what happened in Colorado and it's very

2261
01:34:39,179 --> 01:34:43,800
different from what's going on in

2262
01:34:40,380 --> 01:34:45,480
California so so I think that that we

2263
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:48,539
have to keep that in mind but I totally

2264
01:34:45,479 --> 01:34:50,399
recommend this um documentary when I was

2265
01:34:48,539 --> 01:34:52,979
looking at like early on in California

2266
01:34:50,399 --> 01:34:55,259
when it's first going legal with 215 but

2267
01:34:52,979 --> 01:34:56,939
what I saw was like stuff in Amsterdam

2268
01:34:55,260 --> 01:34:58,440
where they had bedrockon like it started

2269
01:34:56,939 --> 01:34:59,638
out as like you know there were there

2270
01:34:58,439 --> 01:35:01,559
were shops all of a sudden you couldn't

2271
01:34:59,639 --> 01:35:04,139
grow now you can't sell seeds you can't

2272
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:06,000
make seeds but one Corporation was able

2273
01:35:04,139 --> 01:35:07,980
to take it over and get the the main

2274
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:09,960
thing then I saw in Israel you know like

2275
01:35:07,979 --> 01:35:12,299
the same kind of stuff happened I saw in

2276
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:14,698
Canada started going that way too and

2277
01:35:12,300 --> 01:35:16,440
then in California with the prop 64

2278
01:35:14,698 --> 01:35:18,000
everybody was kind of like well it's

2279
01:35:16,439 --> 01:35:20,039
looking like it's going to be too

2280
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:22,679
expensive for any of the Legacy Farmers

2281
01:35:20,039 --> 01:35:24,840
to own any licenses and we couldn't even

2282
01:35:22,679 --> 01:35:27,300
afford to buy the equipment to surveil

2283
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:28,739
ourselves with the cameras let alone you

2284
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:30,900
know afford to run a business and make

2285
01:35:28,738 --> 01:35:33,539
money off that when the guy down the

2286
01:35:30,899 --> 01:35:36,238
street is is quadrupling the production

2287
01:35:33,539 --> 01:35:39,238
on us and able to charge and and able to

2288
01:35:36,238 --> 01:35:40,859
run at a loss for 10 years whereas we're

2289
01:35:39,238 --> 01:35:42,899
small farmers we can't run in a loss for

2290
01:35:40,859 --> 01:35:44,339
a year let alone 10. and they know that

2291
01:35:42,899 --> 01:35:49,079
they can wipe out the market that way

2292
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:51,179
and and drive everyone out yes I agree I

2293
01:35:49,079 --> 01:35:53,698
mean I don't know honestly I know

2294
01:35:51,179 --> 01:35:55,380
I don't know I know that Israel is very

2295
01:35:53,698 --> 01:35:59,399
governmentally controlled isn't it yes

2296
01:35:55,380 --> 01:36:01,800
yes yes as well as the Netherlands yes

2297
01:35:59,399 --> 01:36:03,979
um so I think that here in the US it's

2298
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:07,139
different because you can get

2299
01:36:03,979 --> 01:36:09,718
corporations that are multi-billion

2300
01:36:07,139 --> 01:36:12,119
dollar corporations where you have you

2301
01:36:09,719 --> 01:36:14,399
know a guy just spend billions of

2302
01:36:12,119 --> 01:36:18,899
dollars in a social media yeah yeah

2303
01:36:14,399 --> 01:36:23,099
right right I think because there is no

2304
01:36:18,899 --> 01:36:27,679
the capitalism here is going to an

2305
01:36:23,100 --> 01:36:30,719
extreme yeah but I do think

2306
01:36:27,679 --> 01:36:33,719
that you need some sort of governmental

2307
01:36:30,719 --> 01:36:36,420
regulations in some sense

2308
01:36:33,719 --> 01:36:38,939
um and I think that the problem of

2309
01:36:36,420 --> 01:36:41,699
California was that there may have been

2310
01:36:38,939 --> 01:36:45,299
too much governmental regulations yeah

2311
01:36:41,698 --> 01:36:49,019
and that you're requiring the legal

2312
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:51,960
industry to operate at a loss compared

2313
01:36:49,020 --> 01:36:54,260
to the illicit a market right the

2314
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:57,960
enlisted Market must not

2315
01:36:54,260 --> 01:37:00,360
must not test as as thoroughly the

2316
01:36:57,960 --> 01:37:03,600
illicit Market does not have to have the

2317
01:37:00,359 --> 01:37:06,299
packaging that the so I think that

2318
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:08,400
you're operating at a loss due to those

2319
01:37:06,300 --> 01:37:10,139
particular laws and regulations which is

2320
01:37:08,399 --> 01:37:11,939
something that New York state for

2321
01:37:10,139 --> 01:37:15,000
example different from Colorado Colorado

2322
01:37:11,939 --> 01:37:16,738
is not as regulated as California or New

2323
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:19,439
York State and now in New York state

2324
01:37:16,738 --> 01:37:22,738
it's kind of like hey do not make people

2325
01:37:19,439 --> 01:37:25,079
test like make him test as you would

2326
01:37:22,738 --> 01:37:26,519
test for a tomato right yeah yeah if

2327
01:37:25,079 --> 01:37:29,639
you're going to consume the tomato and

2328
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:32,280
yeah yeah I want Apple speaking

2329
01:37:29,639 --> 01:37:35,279
three weeks ago two weeks ago and I took

2330
01:37:32,279 --> 01:37:37,859
an apple from the tree and I ate it I am

2331
01:37:35,279 --> 01:37:40,679
fine I am sure that there were some

2332
01:37:37,859 --> 01:37:43,979
living organism in that Apple I am sure

2333
01:37:40,679 --> 01:37:45,899
what it didn't kill me right had I

2334
01:37:43,979 --> 01:37:48,658
smoked that Apple I think that I would

2335
01:37:45,899 --> 01:37:51,420
still not be dead yeah same thing with

2336
01:37:48,658 --> 01:37:53,698
weed right yeah yeah right yeah I

2337
01:37:51,420 --> 01:37:57,658
totally agree I I just hope that there's

2338
01:37:53,698 --> 01:38:00,479
a time where anywhere in anywhere that

2339
01:37:57,658 --> 01:38:01,799
people just don't settle for like and I

2340
01:38:00,479 --> 01:38:04,019
feel like that was the attitude with

2341
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:06,119
with prop 64 and 215 for that matter

2342
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:07,679
like they're finally gonna give us a

2343
01:38:06,119 --> 01:38:09,479
little bit why don't we just take what

2344
01:38:07,679 --> 01:38:12,539
we can get now and maybe fight for more

2345
01:38:09,479 --> 01:38:14,459
later and what I've learned like just in

2346
01:38:12,539 --> 01:38:17,340
all laws is like they don't really give

2347
01:38:14,460 --> 01:38:18,539
you what they aren't willing to lose and

2348
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:20,039
if they're not willing to lose more than

2349
01:38:18,539 --> 01:38:22,198
that you're never going to get it it's

2350
01:38:20,039 --> 01:38:25,859
what what benefits whoever is in power

2351
01:38:22,198 --> 01:38:27,419
and can pay the pay the piper so but I

2352
01:38:25,859 --> 01:38:30,479
do think that there are some people that

2353
01:38:27,420 --> 01:38:33,060
are empowered that I are actually

2354
01:38:30,479 --> 01:38:35,698
looking for the best for their people

2355
01:38:33,060 --> 01:38:37,560
yes I do understand that some people are

2356
01:38:35,698 --> 01:38:39,419
in power and it's like I have the power

2357
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:40,560
and I'm the king but I definitely think

2358
01:38:39,420 --> 01:38:42,359
that there's some people who are in

2359
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:43,860
power that are kind of like hey let's

2360
01:38:42,359 --> 01:38:47,219
build something that's why I think

2361
01:38:43,859 --> 01:38:48,359
elections are so important but I also

2362
01:38:47,219 --> 01:38:50,219
think that many of the laws and

2363
01:38:48,359 --> 01:38:53,880
regulations for example regarding the

2364
01:38:50,219 --> 01:38:56,760
zero point three percent THC like I

2365
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:59,579
always why didn't they ask me about that

2366
01:38:56,760 --> 01:39:05,340
regulation which makes no sense like who

2367
01:38:59,579 --> 01:39:08,399
is going to get high on a 0.8 THC

2368
01:39:05,340 --> 01:39:12,239
fiber hemp when you go to a dispensary

2369
01:39:08,399 --> 01:39:15,000
and you have a 98 concentrate

2370
01:39:12,238 --> 01:39:18,599
it makes no sense at all who did they

2371
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:20,819
consult these kind of laws yeah but

2372
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:22,739
do we know who they consult for these

2373
01:39:20,819 --> 01:39:24,359
kind of laws

2374
01:39:22,738 --> 01:39:25,979
that's horrible I mean there's some

2375
01:39:24,359 --> 01:39:27,420
regulations here in New York state that

2376
01:39:25,979 --> 01:39:29,879
are kind of like dude you have never

2377
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:33,239
grown a plant before right like what

2378
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:36,239
you're limiting the acreage size and how

2379
01:39:33,238 --> 01:39:37,979
are you determining so you you have do

2380
01:39:36,238 --> 01:39:40,319
you have a house plant do you have a

2381
01:39:37,979 --> 01:39:42,059
plant living in your living room there's

2382
01:39:40,319 --> 01:39:46,198
some regulations that are just you know

2383
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:49,800
a guide decided and a lawyer that knew

2384
01:39:46,198 --> 01:39:52,799
how to write laws decided yeah

2385
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:54,600
it's uh yeah we've got a long way to go

2386
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:56,579
but I'm really excited about the future

2387
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:58,500
especially as it comes to science with

2388
01:39:56,579 --> 01:40:00,119
breeding because I'm such a I'm such a

2389
01:39:58,500 --> 01:40:02,279
nerd when it comes to breeding like I I

2390
01:40:00,119 --> 01:40:03,840
love the idea whether it's whether it's

2391
01:40:02,279 --> 01:40:05,698
through successful or successive

2392
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:07,800
generations and breeding in a trait or

2393
01:40:05,698 --> 01:40:09,599
whether it's being able to eliminate a

2394
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:10,739
trait completely that is has no

2395
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:13,199
beneficial

2396
01:40:10,738 --> 01:40:15,119
anything to what we're doing if that

2397
01:40:13,198 --> 01:40:17,579
helps that helps breeding that helps us

2398
01:40:15,119 --> 01:40:19,619
make our projects with successive

2399
01:40:17,579 --> 01:40:21,600
Generations even easier so I'm super

2400
01:40:19,619 --> 01:40:22,979
stoked to see what you do and I I'd be

2401
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:25,079
really excited to work with you on any

2402
01:40:22,979 --> 01:40:26,759
level in that in the future and I really

2403
01:40:25,079 --> 01:40:28,260
appreciate you taking your time tonight

2404
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:29,579
to come and hang out with me in a

2405
01:40:28,260 --> 01:40:31,880
conversation I want to have you back

2406
01:40:29,579 --> 01:40:31,880
soon

2407
01:40:32,698 --> 01:40:37,799
oh thank you thank you yeah I'm excited

2408
01:40:34,920 --> 01:40:40,920
to one because my job in extension in

2409
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:44,279
Cornell is very related to Farmers I

2410
01:40:40,920 --> 01:40:47,399
hope that I get to do that with on-site

2411
01:40:44,279 --> 01:40:49,619
with with with cannabis farmers and hemp

2412
01:40:47,399 --> 01:40:52,500
as well you know for grain and and

2413
01:40:49,619 --> 01:40:56,340
hopefully for grain I hope that I get to

2414
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:58,319
do that here as well and I think that

2415
01:40:56,340 --> 01:41:01,260
breeding that's going to be the key

2416
01:40:58,319 --> 01:41:03,420
right it's gonna be it I think

2417
01:41:01,260 --> 01:41:06,690
well I'm excited that we're also having

2418
01:41:03,420 --> 01:41:12,489
thank you very much for having me

2419
