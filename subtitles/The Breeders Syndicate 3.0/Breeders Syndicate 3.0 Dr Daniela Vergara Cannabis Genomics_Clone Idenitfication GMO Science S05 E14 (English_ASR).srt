12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,558
we're here today with Dr Daniela Vergara

13
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:03,839
uh she rece received her Bach in

14
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:07,000
microbiology from univers de los Andis

15
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,960
Colombia 2006 and her PhD in ecology

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,879
Evolution Behavior minor in genetics

17
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:15,039
from Indiana University Bloomington um

18
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:17,118
she is an emerging crop specialist at

19
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,840
Cornell University and a research

20
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:22,719
associate and lecturer at the University

21
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,719
and a postdoc at Colorado in Boulder

22
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:30,118
starting 2013 in cannabis is that

23
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:32,959
correct yeah I started as a post do in

24
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:35,438
um CU Boulder in 2013 and then I became

25
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:38,478
a research associate in 2018 but yes I

26
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:42,000
started researching cannabis in 2013 at

27
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:44,920
seeu Boulder that's perfect so I reached

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,959
out to you because you know going

29
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,118
through looking at a lot of the the

30
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,158
science that's been done whether it's by

31
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:53,519
larger organizations that have worked

32
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:55,840
with breeders and and collected you know

33
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:58,478
DNA and data I've I've noticed that

34
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,759
there is a big falling out or maybe a

35
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:02,200
disconnecting communication between

36
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:05,079
maybe some of the people that are more

37
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:08,719
serious in the in the uh traditional

38
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:10,639
cannabis Market versus the the academic

39
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:11,759
uh cannabis world and there's I feel

40
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,598
like there's a big disconnect so I

41
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,439
reached out to you and I was like hey

42
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:17,238
let's talk like I don't know that

43
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:19,840
anybody's talking you seem really super

44
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:22,080
cool and you actually care so like I I I

45
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,719
wanted to talk to you and I thought what

46
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,000
better way to do it here and like maybe

47
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:27,719
record it and for posterity and see if

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,639
we can get anywhere and what we can

49
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:31,439
learn from each other so thank you so

50
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:33,679
much for showing up and sitting down and

51
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:35,919
doing this most people wouldn't you know

52
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,239
not it's it's not a big show yet oh

53
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:41,598
thank you I appreciate it and you know

54
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:45,158
to be honest I don't think that there is

55
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:48,318
a disconnect between the academic world

56
00:02:45,158 --> 00:02:51,318
and the the the science academic

57
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:52,919
cannabis world and the Cannabis World in

58
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:54,919
general I think that academics are

59
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:57,679
disconnected from the world period you

60
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:59,878
know like I think that in general there

61
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,840
is a disconnect between what happens in

62
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:05,039
Academia and what happens in real life

63
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,878
and what real life people get yeah so in

64
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:11,039
general not just in cannabis but overall

65
00:03:07,878 --> 00:03:14,518
so I think that you are totally spoton

66
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:18,079
on what you just said so one of the

67
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:21,680
first things we talked about

68
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:24,719
was how genetics work out what we see

69
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,799
what we don't see but I figured with our

70
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,519
show I wanted to Define some of these

71
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,438
terms that we're going to be using and

72
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:31,799
who better to to help me Define them

73
00:03:30,438 --> 00:03:34,519
than someone that's working with the

74
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:37,519
breeding program at Cornell so we we

75
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:39,840
talk about phenotypes a lot in cannabis

76
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,560
um in in generally using the term and

77
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,519
the way I learned the term was

78
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,239
phenotypes are like the observable

79
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,280
traits the physical observable traits

80
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:48,878
and genotypes are the genes that underly

81
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,318
those physical observable traits is that

82
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:53,199
correct correct so when we use the term

83
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:55,958
phenotypes we are referring to the

84
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:57,560
observable traits and and so people

85
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:59,400
understand there are genes underlying

86
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,598
those observable traits which are the

87
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,599
actual

88
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:04,759
genotypes am I pronounce that correctly

89
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:06,639
is there anything I'm missing out though

90
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:08,679
so in general a phenotype you can

91
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,559
measure somehow so a phenotype could be

92
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:14,120
height that you can measure using a

93
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,280
meter stick yeah or weight or you know

94
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:20,478
in cannabis is cannabinoids that you can

95
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:23,319
measure using uh an hlc or a GC machine

96
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:28,039
right so a a phenotype you can measure

97
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:30,959
somehow with a tool right yeah and genes

98
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:34,120
need a gene mapping tool of some sort or

99
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:36,399
measuring tool or some sequence right

100
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,639
you need to sequence so to you for you

101
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:41,918
to see the letters of the DNA in order

102
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:46,199
to figure out the gene right so so in

103
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:48,000
general the DNA has four letters yes but

104
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:49,800
and those four letters are repeated in

105
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,120
the genome in

106
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,280
different you know different amounts Etc

107
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,360
you can quantify like there's a thing

108
00:04:55,279 --> 00:05:01,198
that you can quantify the number of G's

109
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,840
or C's it's GC a and t so the number of

110
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,199
GCS in your in your genomic content you

111
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:08,478
can quantify that but yes so you need in

112
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:10,400
order to figure out a gene you need to

113
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:12,758
sequence that Gene there's many

114
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:14,000
different ways in for you to be able to

115
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:16,680
sequence that it's kind of like

116
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,918
transcribe the gene in order to figure

117
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:22,439
out the specific um letters of the gene

118
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:24,198
but but you can it's a much more

119
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:27,120
complicated process you know like I can

120
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:30,319
measure your height easily yeah and then

121
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,120
if you are measuring the height or the

122
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:36,080
number of leaves or the number of of

123
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,120
nodes of a plant you you can do that

124
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:41,439
fairly easily yeah but in order for you

125
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,478
to take the DNA out so you need to do a

126
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:45,680
DNA extraction and then you need to take

127
00:05:43,478 --> 00:05:48,079
that DNA extraction into a facility that

128
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:53,199
sequence it for you and so it's a much

129
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:57,240
more complex um methodology yeah

130
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:59,120
possible you know yeah we do it but yeah

131
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,960
so is this what you do at Cornell are

132
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,800
you working at the gene level on the

133
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:06,000
plants no at Cornell I'm actually part

134
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,478
of the extension so I'm at Cornell

135
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,560
Cooperative Extension so I'm actually

136
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:13,318
working with farmers and the Cannabis

137
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,759
industry in general and the hemp

138
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:19,598
industry so cannabis at all levels right

139
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:21,840
so for mostly for for grain and for

140
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:25,159
fiber and for cannabinoids that are not

141
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:28,399
THC because THC it's still federally

142
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:32,360
regulated and as academic institutions

143
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:35,399
we cannot work with high THC but uh we

144
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:37,038
do work with other cannabinoids which is

145
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:40,159
kind of like a similar thing right what

146
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:44,240
you do to enhance dbd you do to enhance

147
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:47,479
DHC yeah so um so I do work with with I

148
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:51,439
I I do go to to facilities and to work

149
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:54,000
with Growers and breeders and yeah so

150
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:56,000
you're you're from Colombia what was the

151
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,279
attitude in Colombia like growing up for

152
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
a young lady you know just an average

153
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:01,399
young lady where you grew up was it was

154
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,240
it positive was it

155
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:09,758
negative when I grew

156
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:11,360
up huh so I grew up during a very

157
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,919
violent time I think that Colombia has

158
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:19,080
never not had a violent time yeah but I

159
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:22,000
grew up during the Narco time yeah um

160
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:25,519
and um it was a very violent

161
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,879
time um and

162
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:33,120
um yeah so so that at that time they

163
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:39,039
were putting bombs in um discos and

164
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:44,199
bars um and uh my hometown K Colombia is

165
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:48,878
was the Hub of a Big Cartel the C cartel

166
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:53,680

my parents my mom my mom is kind of

171
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:07,519
graphic with her language so she would

172
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,800
say things like I don't care if you're

173
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:13,560
with a guy I just want to know where you

174
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,158
are because if there's a bomb I want to

175
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:19,720

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,199
little bit more descriptive her more

179
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:30,918
descriptive than what I just said but

180
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:34,800
yeah and there were I mean I do have

181
00:08:30,918 --> 00:08:36,759
very graphic gruesome memories of what

182
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:41,718
was ongoing in the

183
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:44,278

190
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:07,920
very very intellectual type of family um

191
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:11,120
we still talk Politics on the table yeah

192
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:14,039

195
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:22,039

196
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,919
just right like not not not in a bad way

197

but just tell me what is that person

198
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:29,000

199
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:31,759
person sure so yeah especially talking

200
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,879
about C that are coming tomorrow yeah

201
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:35,278
it's very restrained here it's it's like

202
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:37,759
you have to be because you don't know

203
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,159
who's leaning which way and it's and

204
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:42,278
especially now the country is very

205
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:45,439
divided super divided in Colombia as

206
00:09:42,278 --> 00:09:49,039
well especially with the last president

207
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:52,240
whom I am kind of proud that the guy got

208
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:52,240
elected Gustavo

209
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:57,039
Pedro not because I think he's perfect

210
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,919
like I I don't think any politician is

211
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:01,599
perfect I disagree with 99 % of

212
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:05,278
everything I disagree with the choices I

213
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,519
made this morning yeah right right yeah

214
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:10,360
I am the most intolerant person in this

215
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,879
world you know like 5 feet2 of

216
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,839
intolerance

217
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:21,120
talking but

218
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:25,399
um but uh I I do think that Pro

219
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,519
offers a difference he offers something

220
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:29,320
that has never been in Colombia you know

221
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,360
Colombia has always been an oligarchy

222
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,920
Colombia has always been a minority that

223
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,680
has ruled the country and then after

224
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:41,439
particular presidents before now the

225
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:45,479
oligarchy is the owner of

226
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:52,000
the cocaine exports right like we have

227
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:55,519
to be honest as col about it that koca

228
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,440
is the biggest export in Colombia right

229
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,879
that's the country's main export yeah

230
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,680
yes right yeah it's Emerald

231
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:04,039
and bananas and yeah but realistically

232
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:06,838
we know where the majority of the money

233
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:09,759
is coming from yeah yeah and we cannot

234
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:14,320
just be you know like yeah it's it's

235
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:15,958
real yeah yeah so so with that in mind

236
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,480
you know I think that Gustavo Pedro

237
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:19,679
comes with like hey the Waring drugs

238
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:23,639
have not worked he gave a speech at the

239
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:25,638
United Nations a month ago or so that I

240
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:28,560
recommend for everyone like I almost

241
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:31,200
cried because he said it out loud like

242
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,719
hey this hasn't worked and we need to

243
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,360
change things and we need to try

244
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,040
something new I mean we already know

245
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:41,399
that the money that Americans have given

246
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:43,958
us to stop the the Coca plantations that

247
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:45,559
that has only brought violence and it

248
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:47,278
doesn't work so let's try to do

249
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:49,479
something new so I think that or

250
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:52,360
something different and and I think that

251
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:56,360
that that was really important and he is

252
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:58,079
now looking to I mean medical marijuana

253
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,278
has been legalized in Colombia and now

254
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:03,919
they're looking for recreational

255
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:06,720
marijuana and to be honest I think that

256
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:09,679
all drugs quote unquote should be legal

257
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,720
I mean we a clear definition of what is

258
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:16,278
a drug yeah you know chocolate is a drug

259
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,199
coffee a drug yeah so there are so many

260
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:19,360
things that are drugs that are

261
00:12:17,198 --> 00:12:20,879
intoxicants that could be addicting and

262
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,079
that even aren't that aren't even

263
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:23,559
necessarily affecting your central

264
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:25,039
nervous system that could be addicting

265
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:27,399
in other ways you know what I mean like

266
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:29,198
so yeah that's not clearly defined and

267
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:30,799
and I think people get that pleasure hit

268
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:32,479
from all kinds of different things you

269
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:33,759
know and that could drive all kinds of

270
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,079
factors in their life that could be

271
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,679
positive or negative so it's really

272
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:39,799
open-ended that they the way they've

273
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:41,638
left it and I think anybody who's

274
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:43,319
especially politicians any any

275
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:44,959
politician that's willing to look at the

276
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,959
the War on Drugs the negative effects

277
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:50,719
it's had on everyone um the the way it's

278
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:54,518
driven America uh like privatized

279
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,800
prisons everything it's crazy so yeah I

280
00:12:54,519 --> 00:13:00,120
I'm all for anybody pushing for just

281
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:02,319
total abolishment of illegal

282
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:06,360
like the idea of illegal drugs the idea

283
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:08,240
of it I completely agree now I think

284
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,159
that maybe you and are

285
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,919
being utopic you know like I don't know

286
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:16,799
probably yeah probably you know we know

287
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:19,120
that Oregon for example has these laws

288
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:21,519
that they they legalized a bunch of

289
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,159
different drugs Portugal right as a

290
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,720
country did as

291
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:30,919
well Colorado right now has in the

292
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:35,600
ballot syo cbin um so it is happening in

293
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:38,078
some places but I do think that um that

294
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,839
I asking for for total

295
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:45,559
legalization there are many big players

296
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:48,440
that are benefiting from mass

297
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:50,559
incarceration from the wars in drugs

298
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:55,120
like the wars in drugs have been very

299
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:57,439
successful for some people yeah sure um

300
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,799
military contracts

301
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:03,320
Galore so yeah

302
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:05,838
yeah so when you grew up I I assume

303
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,320
because it was like Narco Wars where

304
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,480
where you grew up was the attitude of

305
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,120
your parents like more down on cannabis

306
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,560
like you cannot we do not want to see

307
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,440
you using cannabis or were they more

308
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:18,278
open-minded on

309
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:22,759
it so my parents have always been kind

310
00:14:18,278 --> 00:14:25,759
of the heapes of their families in a way

311
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:28,519
um even though you know I again I my

312
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:33,720
family has always been kind of in

313
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:36,440
Academia and and that stuff my dad is um

314
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:40,440
a physics professor and I grew up going

315
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:42,279
to his university um studying music I

316
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,079
had music lessons there when I was a

317
00:14:42,278 --> 00:14:47,439
child so I've always grown up in a

318
00:14:45,078 --> 00:14:49,758
university environment like I've never

319
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,240
in my life ever left a university could

320
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:55,360
could you believe that that's crazy it

321
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,039
is crazy I just changed you know

322
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,639
different University from different

323
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:04,799
places in Colombia or in the US but I've

324
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:07,879
always been on a sort of Campus um

325
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:09,439
wow that is wild I mean to surround

326
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:10,679
yourself with education like that though

327
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,759
it's got to be your passion to

328
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:16,039
constantly

329
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:19,879
learn yeah but as I told you I am an

330
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:22,519
intolerant human being and I have my big

331
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:25,000
fights with Academia every single day

332
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:27,240
and with bureaucracy every single day

333
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,559
and with you know like I have my big

334
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:34,680
fights about you I don't believe in the

335
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:38,559
education system I think that it's again

336
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:40,799
benefiting a tiny minority um I don't

337
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:44,198
think that this thing that Biden is

338
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:46,198
proposing about about student loan I

339
00:15:44,198 --> 00:15:47,758
think it should pass don't get me wrong

340
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:50,479
but I think that that is just a little

341
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:54,000
Band-Aid right oh sure sure it's better

342
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,800
than nothing but it is not solving the

343
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,639
problem I think that all of these

344
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:59,838
academic institutions some more than

345
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,680
other

346
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,560
and because I've been in the US I've

347
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:06,679
been at in in three now I kind of you

348
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:08,638
know know a little bit about them and I

349
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:11,919
have academic friends all over so I I

350
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:14,839
kind of know how they work but these

351
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:16,919
academic institutions are profiting out

352
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:18,759
of the most vulnerable side of the

353
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:24,198
population which are you know 20 year

354
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:25,278
olds um they are benefiting uh minority

355
00:16:24,198 --> 00:16:28,278
of

356
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:29,799
Administrators uh who do not care about

357
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:32,679
the education

358
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:34,120
and in general I feel that professors

359
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:36,599
especially those in tenure track

360
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,959
positions are just there kind of like go

361
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,360
well you know what can we do oh well

362
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:42,679
yeah you see a lot of that with with

363
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,879
tenure like in any any sort of Prof like

364
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:46,239
teaching profession whether it's like

365
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,838
Elementary School all the way to

366
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,919
University it's the same thing once they

367
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:53,440
get that it's just like yeah exactly you

368
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:56,958
got there and you're sitting down no one

369
00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:00,519
can fire you yeah it takes an act of

370
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:02,719
God exactly that is that is a good

371
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:06,640
descriptor it takes an act of God to

372
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:09,480
fire a tenear track professor and they

373
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,038
can do Despicable things you know like

374
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,279
oh sure harassment sexual harassment and

375
00:17:12,038 --> 00:17:16,919
they're still in this tenure track job

376
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:19,959
and so anything can happen they're not

377
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:21,640
goingon to fight for their students or

378
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:23,880
few of them are gonna fight for the

379
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,959
students I there's some right like I

380
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,000
cannot put all of these millions people

381
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:29,600
in the same bag but in general they

382
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,679
don't fight for this students they don't

383
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:35,240
fight for changes they don't fight for

384
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:37,759
um you know more funding towards

385
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:40,160
benefiting their Labs what they're just

386
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:42,400
there and no one No One's Gonna fire

387
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,759
them and they have a secure pension

388
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,720
right yeah so so I I that's one of my

389
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:51,599
fights with Academia is kind of like

390
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:53,640
this lethargic state of the tenure track

391
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:55,359
professors yeah I think that's a lot of

392
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,080
people that many of my friends in

393
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:59,279
Academia that's the one thing that they

394
00:17:57,079 --> 00:18:01,279
have the most trouble with is especially

395
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:02,798
if they're vocal you know a lot of

396
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:04,678
people will take it on the chin and just

397
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:06,879
try to go with it and try to work within

398
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:08,519
that system but like my personality I'm

399
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,039
one of those personalities where like I

400
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:13,240
I have no filter so it just comes out so

401
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:15,079
I I don't know if I'd last in that and I

402
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:18,798
see you're kind of similar so I wonder

403
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:24,279
how that goes for you

404
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:26,200
well um so when I was in CU Boulder I'm

405
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:29,558
still at CU Boulder as a lecturer and as

406
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:33,600
a researcher but when I was there

407
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:37,440
in Colorado I was at in Colorado for

408
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:41,119
eight years um I was part of the

409
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:43,000
Union I am um total Union proponent I

410
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:45,279
feel that in a perfect world you

411
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,640
shouldn't have unions because people

412
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:49,240
should not need to unionize against

413
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,000
right like yeah if if people weren't

414
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,919
greedy you wouldn't need a union but

415
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,240
people are yeah exactly if people

416
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:59,640
weren't yeah you know if if there

417
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:03,038
weren't like Elon and Jeff's around yeah

418
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:05,038
exactly yeah yeah then then that you

419
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:07,440
should have Healthcare like you should

420
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:08,720
have should be normal yeah yeah it

421
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,480
should be a given you should have

422
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,759
parental leave you should right but

423
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,720
because these things are not the norm

424
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:17,960
then you should unionize and

425
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,000
unfortunately so I was part of the union

426
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,360
and I was very vocal about it and there

427
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,119
were some people that did not like it

428
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:28,719
and then you know like I am a very a big

429
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:32,119
proponent of free speech um you can say

430
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,400
say whatever you want I also have the

431
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:37,038
right to not follow you on Twitter yeah

432
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:40,120
right yeah totally I don't have the

433
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:42,519
right to tell you Matthew shut up no you

434
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:44,759
can say it but I do have the right to

435
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:46,519
you know close my ears and yeah and

436
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:47,960
adults should be able to like make that

437
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,119
decision I don't like this what the you

438
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:51,000
know what I mean like that should be an

439
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:53,839
easy decision like I'm a big proponent

440
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,798
of the block feature on all social media

441
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:57,480
it makes life so much better because

442
00:19:55,798 --> 00:19:58,440
like I don't I don't if someone doesn't

443
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,599
like me and they're going to say mean

444
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,038
things about me I'm not going to sit

445
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:02,599
there and like dwell on it and I'm going

446
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:03,720
be like well okay cool like now I don't

447
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:06,199
have to see it ever again you don't have

448
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:09,400
to see me we're cool life goes on you

449
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:11,840
know yeah exactly like I can just mute

450
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:14,320
you there's that option for a reason

451
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:18,839
yeah it's a great option I love

452
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:22,240
it but um but and also because um of the

453
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:24,918
Cannabis thing you know when I for me

454
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:29,079
cannabis happened I mean I've always

455
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:32,240
been a pad we moved to Colorado I out of

456
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:34,599
that closet after women grow you know

457
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,440
after I was in a women grow event and I

458
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:40,879
was in the first cohort of women grow so

459
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:44,640
I when women grow started back in 2014

460
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:48,520
with Jane West and and Julie btz and

461
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:51,159
hasard and uh I I was part of that and

462
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:55,319
it completely opened my head you know I

463
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:58,400
was coming from my PhD which I was

464
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:59,279
talking nerd to other nerds yeah and

465
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,400
then

466
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:03,839
I went into a completely different world

467
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,480
in cannabis and for me when I started

468
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:07,639
working in cannabis it was a plant that

469
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,319
I was going to be studying the genome

470
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:11,960
you know I was really interested in the

471
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:13,558
male and female thing in cannabis so I

472
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,038
was gonna start you know like very

473
00:21:13,558 --> 00:21:20,000
academic and then I get into this

474
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:22,079
industry that for me it was like what

475
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,038
the hell this is an industry an entire

476
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:27,720
industry where you have lawyers and you

477
00:21:24,038 --> 00:21:30,558
have accountants and you have designers

478
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:33,120
and you have every and so for it was

479
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:35,440
like what like what is this a marketer

480
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:38,199
like first time in my life that I met a

481
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,679
marketer like what do you what you know

482
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:44,440
so it was

483
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:48,159
completely mindblowing and and then when

484
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:50,120
I was in this women grow events um I am

485
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,600
a biologist I was a field biologist for

486
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:55,319
a long time field biologist robber boot

487
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:57,359
type of field biologist and so when I

488
00:21:55,319 --> 00:22:00,200
got there and I see all of these women

489
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:05,439
you know lipstick and high heels with a

490
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:07,798
joint yeah it I it blew my mind yeah oh

491
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,000
I you know I was a hippie kind of

492
00:22:07,798 --> 00:22:12,400
flipflop type of thing you know Rober

493
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,119
wood with a joint and then you see these

494
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:19,320
women that are super accomplished super

495
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:23,119
accomplished Economist Finance fin

496
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:27,960
Financial analysts and after that I was

497
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:31,519
I am leaving this closet yeah yeah and

498
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:36,079
um so so so yeah so so the Cannabis

499
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:37,960
industry opened my scientific sphere and

500
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:39,759
my I guess

501
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,919
my

502
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:46,558
my professional and personal life

503
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:49,120
completely opened it yeah so when you

504
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:52,079
first started smoking when did you first

505
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:53,439
start realizing that because I mean the

506
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:55,439
conversation is neverly going to go one

507
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,440
place when did you first start noticing

508
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,798
that maybe like there was there was

509
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,960
inconsistency between what you would get

510
00:22:59,798 --> 00:23:03,558
at a

511
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,000
dispensary uh between strains that they

512
00:23:03,558 --> 00:23:07,000
would assure you were the same thing

513
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,480
meaning you know you you a lot of people

514
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,240
go into dispensaries they expect a

515
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,720
certain medical effect from whatever

516
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,440
certain strain they buy and they want to

517
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,519
rely on that medical effect for whatever

518
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:20,159
reason when did you start noticing any

519
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:20,158
kind of inconsistency or any of that in

520
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:26,038
cannabis I'm gonna be

521
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:29,278
honest and I hope that your listeners do

522
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:32,679
not hate me no no well they're they're

523
00:23:29,278 --> 00:23:36,880
good peeps they're good people

524
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:39,440
okay my palette is either yes or no and

525
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:44,039
it's usually yes you know in general

526
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:47,360
with food um I am a very good eater I

527
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:50,359
just don't eat you know junk food but in

528
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:52,959
general everything tastes good except

529
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:55,678
for maybe cauliflower without cheese but

530
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,079
right with canab for sure cannabis is

531
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,400
the same thing for me you know like I'm

532
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:03,519
higher not high there are differences

533
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:06,000
between oh this one really made it very

534
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:10,119
cerebral or this one really gave me a

535
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:13,839
couch lock or this one just you know it

536
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:16,839
made me like I am completely doing stuff

537
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:19,879
right yeah very active so that is a

538
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:22,000
difference but in terms of anything else

539
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:25,278
plus I have a volcano and when you have

540
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,079
a volcano and you vaporize it that way

541
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:31,519
kind of like the smells and all of that

542
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:34,678
is is lost yeah so I

543
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:37,200
really thought that all of that

544
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:38,640
cannaboids and trines and all of this

545
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:43,399
was

546
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:44,840
um just you know pads saying stuff yeah

547
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:48,079
like like a lot of people look at wine

548
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:49,879
con or whatever they call Somali Somali

549
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:54,439
yeah yeah yeah so I thought that that

550
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:56,679
was kind of BS until I analyzed data for

551
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:59,120
me it was data that changed my mind when

552
00:24:56,679 --> 00:25:01,159
I started analyzing cannabinoid and

553
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:03,879
herpin and the amounts and the

554
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:06,360
distribution and the diversity and this

555
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:09,200
one has one and not the other then I was

556
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:11,439
like oh this is for real like this PL

557
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,399
this is for real and all of these smells

558
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,200
and so there's been multiple studies

559
00:25:13,398 --> 00:25:18,558
throughout the years that just

560
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,919
corroborate that I just have a terrible

561
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:23,158
pet yeah and and that's a for real thing

562
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:25,440
and what what your your describing to me

563
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:27,320
is like with my wife she smoked when she

564
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,558
was young like a bunch but she didn't

565
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:29,960
really ever get into like go I'm going

566
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:31,278
to smoke this strain or that she didn't

567
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,798
care like she was just getting weed

568
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:36,038
whatever you know so once we got

569
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:38,278
together I you know like I'd say yeah

570
00:25:36,038 --> 00:25:39,879
this is you know X kind of blueberry

571
00:25:38,278 --> 00:25:41,919
it's this this and this and she looking

572
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:43,760
at me she's like I smell weed like what

573
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:45,840
are you talking about you know like and

574
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:48,359
it took and it's taken until probably

575
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:50,678
the last year to where her Pet's finally

576
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:54,119
getting oh I see what you're saying now

577
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:57,159
like but it takes a long long time and

578
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:59,719
constant really getting into it to

579
00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:02,360
develop that and an effort right so now

580
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,240
when I go to grow for example I usually

581
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:06,319
what I do is that I rub the plant with

582
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:10,440
my fingers and then I smell my fingers

583
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:11,480
yep but there's indeed some that smell

584
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,960
like

585
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:18,720
skunk there's indeed some that smell

586
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:21,440
like lemon there are others that smell

587
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,278
more forestry right like more and

588
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,080
there's definitely the pine thing and

589
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:27,720
then when you look at the chemotypes in

590
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:30,319
the studies that I've done and then you

591
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:32,079
see oh there is indeed a tpine called

592
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:34,918
pining and there's this other one better

593
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:39,359
cophine and there's okay so that makes

594
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:42,159
sense yes so this is not a lie right

595
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:45,278
yeah so so now and

596
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:48,039
recently uh I got something that smelled

597
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:50,398
really really skunky and I was like oh

598
00:26:48,038 --> 00:26:53,240
man this is really skunky and there is a

599
00:26:50,398 --> 00:26:57,079
skunk that lives around my house and I

600
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:59,519
smelled it and I was like I get it yep

601
00:26:57,079 --> 00:27:01,439
like I get it made the the the scent

602
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:03,879
Connection in your brain to the the

603
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,480
smell and everything yeah yeah yeah I

604
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:08,559
get it and so so in that sense but but

605
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,200
yeah but in terms of you know I really

606
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:13,398
like there was one strain that we could

607
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:17,319
get in Colorado long time ago that was

608
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:20,278
around 20 yeah 2013 14 15 which was this

609
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:22,918
tendering haste um okay I know exactly

610
00:27:20,278 --> 00:27:24,960
you're talking about yeah yeah I friends

611
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:29,399
in Colorado growing it so I know exactly

612
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:32,360
what it is yeah yeah um but other than

613
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:35,119
that I I also like

614
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:37,359
Edibles so I so you like really do you

615
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:38,678
like the fact that I mean do do you like

616
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:40,359
Edibles that are super strong and will

617
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:44,120
lay you out for hours or do you like the

618
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:50,439
ones that are more calm and and not as

619
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:54,119
strong so I always have THC CBD together

620
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:58,278
right so something that has both but um

621
00:27:54,119 --> 00:28:01,278
I like whatever gives me energy to do

622
00:27:58,278 --> 00:28:04,798
house chores because I do not understand

623
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:07,798
how people do house chores How do they

624
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:10,759
vacuum and sweep and clean a bathroom

625
00:28:07,798 --> 00:28:12,879
while sober yeah I don't and you got me

626
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:15,038
on that one I'm right there with you

627
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:18,039
like to be motivated to do that while

628
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:20,038
you're sober yeah exactly like what are

629
00:28:18,038 --> 00:28:23,440
you gonna do today I'm gonna clean the

630
00:28:20,038 --> 00:28:26,000
toilet like woo yeah no exactly no I

631
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,480
need you know so I take that cookie and

632
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,599
then recently A friend of mine gave me

633
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:34,640
these cookies that have

634
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:37,038
delta8 okay yeah and this delta8 I love

635
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,600
it you know and I love the chemistry

636
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:41,640
behind it the biochemistry because all

637
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:43,839
of these compounds the difference is

638
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:47,240
where you have these double bonds the

639
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:49,678
carbon so Delta 9 you have the double

640
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:52,679
bond between two carbons between

641
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,559
carbons eight and nine and then Delta

642
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:58,159
eight you have the double bond between

643
00:28:54,558 --> 00:29:00,038
carbon seven and eight so it's I I I

644
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,200
like that kind of like okay why why is

645
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:03,079
it called This Way besides chemistry has

646
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,840
always

647
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:09,720
been um difficult subject for me I do

648
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:12,038
not understand chemistry like yeah I get

649
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:15,759
it like it doesn't come naturally like I

650
00:29:12,038 --> 00:29:17,440
really have to read and say so um so

651
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:19,278
that he gave me these Delta eight

652
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,558
cookies and for me those Delta eight

653
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:26,720
cookies I am super active for three

654
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:28,798
hours and then or four hours Max and

655
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,919
then I just fall asleep and it's like

656
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:32,720
falling

657
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:37,759
asleep I could be sitting in the table

658
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:40,600
and then and I just I'm done it's so

659
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:42,119
it's so amazing how how different like

660
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:43,719
the the Cannabis chemistry affects

661
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:45,678
everyone's different brain chemistry

662
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:48,159
like vastly different and it can even be

663
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:50,038
like beginning of the day smoking the

664
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,679
same exact strain the same amount you

665
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:53,960
know like will make you feel completely

666
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:56,679
different than at night sometimes it's

667
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:58,640
it's it's wild and and it's taken me so

668
00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:01,679
many years to understand the very even

669
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,880
between clones like that that's

670
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,200
something a lot of breeders in cannabis

671
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:08,039
like the past several years like haven't

672
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,360
really even come to that conclusion or

673
00:30:08,038 --> 00:30:12,720
understanding yet like I'll often have

674
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:15,199
people message me and be like hey I have

675
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,839
this clone I bought it at a dispensary I

676
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,679
want to know if this is the old clone

677
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:22,678
that you and your group remember from

678
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:24,679
you know 20 years ago so I'll say one I

679
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:26,919
can't identify anything by pictures and

680
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:28,679
they'll be like why I don't get it and

681
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:30,360
well because it may grow differently in

682
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:32,200
your room than it does in the other room

683
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:34,158
and people don't get how vast that

684
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:36,120
difference can be it can be I tried to

685
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,919
explain uh with the UK cheese I've had

686
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:40,759
it turn out super blueberry fruity and

687
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:43,480
look you know a little short and stout

688
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:44,879
all the way to a very lanky tall very

689
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:47,720
what people would consider typically

690
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,919
sativa plant that's foot Funk cheese and

691
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,759
it's the same clone so can you talk

692
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:53,360
about some of the the the genetic

693
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:56,079
reasons behind that

694
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:58,759
variance yeah um that's super

695
00:30:56,079 --> 00:31:01,759
interesting that you mentioned that so

696
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:03,759
any physical characteristic which a

697
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:06,798
physical characteristic is a phenotype

698
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:08,839
anything that you can measure somehow um

699
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:11,480
it's a product of genes and the

700
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:13,199
environment right there are some

701
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:15,360
physical traits that are more

702
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,360
genetically dependent there are others

703
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:20,319
that are more environmentally dependent

704
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:22,599
and I'm going to give you the same two

705
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:24,398
examples that I always give and I hope

706
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:27,959
that if people have been in my talks

707
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:32,839
before I'm sorry um for repeating my

708
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:36,440
myself but human height is highly

709
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:38,480
genetically a heritable right yes it's

710
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,159
very genetic so if your parents are tall

711
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,639
it's likely that you're going to be tall

712
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,080
if your parents are short it's likely

713
00:31:41,638 --> 00:31:47,240
that you're going to be short it's 80%

714
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:49,480
heritability so that 20% is environment

715
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:52,038
and that 20% is usually what you ate

716
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:55,079
while you were growing up right yeah if

717
00:31:52,038 --> 00:31:58,638
you had good nutrition you may achieve

718
00:31:55,079 --> 00:32:01,439
that potential height right you had poor

719
00:31:58,638 --> 00:32:04,000
nutrition you may not but it's 80%

720
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:08,000
genetics basically there are other

721
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,599
traits like weight which also has a

722
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,798
genetic component there's some people

723
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:14,278
that are more prone to be you know a

724
00:32:11,798 --> 00:32:18,119
little bit thicker than other people

725
00:32:14,278 --> 00:32:20,558
however if you eat a particular diet

726
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:23,239
you're more prone to have more weight or

727
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:26,678
less weight you can control the the

728
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:30,440
amount yes it's more environmental than

729
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:32,919
it right it's the same thing with um

730
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:35,960
these clones so if you're growing the

731
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:38,320
same clone in a completely different

732
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:40,919
environment you can have what you just

733
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:44,319
said you can have a completely different

734
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:47,559
plant particularly because we know that

735
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:51,359
cannabis for example is very

736
00:32:47,558 --> 00:32:54,759
photosensitive yes so if you have very

737
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:56,398
good lights it's more likely that you're

738
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:58,480
going to produce more cannabinoids and

739
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:01,199
that your plant is probably going to be

740
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:04,319
happier than if you have fewer lights

741
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:07,360
like if you put your your your plant in

742
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:11,038
a closet in the basement with no lights

743
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:15,000
yeah it probably it's gonna die yeah

744
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:19,440
right so so all that environment is very

745
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:22,480
important what we don't know is of these

746
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:25,159
cannabinoids and tpin this this complex

747
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,839
it's a very complex phenotype yeah it's

748
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:31,278
a very complex phenotype that involves

749
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:34,798
multiple genes acting in unison right so

750
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:37,720
there's this um Jordan sagger who's um

751
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:41,798
the CEO of Dy scientific in Washington

752
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:44,798
state okay he has a paper with who was

753
00:33:41,798 --> 00:33:46,839
his postdoc advisor Mark lanch in in

754
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:49,398
Washington state in pulman and they have

755
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:52,038
this paper that I really like where they

756
00:33:49,398 --> 00:33:53,879
talk about all of the genes in related

757
00:33:52,038 --> 00:33:56,599
to canabo and turpine production as a

758
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,960
network of genes kind of acting together

759
00:33:56,599 --> 00:34:00,240
and I think it's a really good

760
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:02,960
description right so what we in biology

761
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,919
called epistasis which is kind of like

762
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,840
two genes acting on a particular

763
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:09,358
phenotype and plot tropy which is two

764
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:12,000
different phenotypes that are controlled

765
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:14,358
one by by one gene so we have this playr

766
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,320
pick and this epistatic effects acting

767
00:34:14,358 --> 00:34:20,000
in unison for this very complex

768
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:22,399
phenotype yes however we don't know how

769
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,878
much of it is environmentally determined

770
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:28,199
and how much is uh is is um is genetics

771
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:30,799
we know that there is a genetic

772
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:32,158
component for sure for sure but we don't

773
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,720
know how much we don't know if it's

774
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,720
going to be like weight or is it going

775
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:40,319
to be like height in humans waiting you

776
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:43,039
right and the experiments for you to

777
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:45,480
figure that out are quote unquote simple

778
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:48,480
right you just need to have several

779
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:50,199
Generations or you can do for example

780
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,358
the same clone in different environments

781
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:55,598
and then measure it right like yep and

782
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:57,799
but yeah but but I I agree with what you

783
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:01,559
you said to your friend like is this is

784
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:04,280
this you know blue cheese I don't know

785
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:06,599
yeah maybe maybe it could be it looks

786
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:09,280
like it it could be it could be a mother

787
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:10,680
to it it could be a hybrid of it or it

788
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,359
could be something that just totally

789
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:14,118
expressed as similar and not related to

790
00:35:12,358 --> 00:35:17,078
it whatsoever because cannabis is wild

791
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:20,320
in plastic like that it has plasticity

792
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:24,119
and the other thing is that we

793
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:26,320
know that there is a lot of diversity

794
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:29,000
there is a lot of genomic diversity so

795
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,720
in the genome all of the conglomerate of

796
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,838
DNA of the plant right all of the

797
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:37,239
letters of the DNA we know that it's

798
00:35:32,838 --> 00:35:41,078
very diverse it's three to four times as

799
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:44,159
diverse as humans oh wow yeah it's it's

800
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:45,640
very very diverse so if you have that

801
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:48,039
amount of

802
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:51,679
diversity you can have a lot of

803
00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:54,559
diversity in your progeny right yes so

804
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:58,719
full sibs may be completely different to

805
00:35:54,559 --> 00:36:01,318
each other yeah and therefore you know

806
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:03,959
probably this chem dog number one and

807
00:36:01,318 --> 00:36:06,639
chem dog number four which were probably

808
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:10,920
full sibs that's why they're completely

809
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:13,598
different phenotypes yes and reason why

810
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:15,880
it makes sense for you to clone the

811
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,039
plants because when you're cloning them

812
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:20,960
then you're assuring that they're going

813
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:24,759
to be more similar to the mother plant

814
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:27,760
than if you have seeds yes but that's

815
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:31,400
why I think that we need really good bre

816
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:34,240
in in in cannabis um in marijuana right

817
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:35,880
because in hemp it's it's happening and

818
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:38,919
and you know cannabis is hemp and

819
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:41,760
marijuana yeah but um in hemp it's

820
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:45,000
happening for for for grain and for

821
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:49,240
fiber and Europe has done some good job

822
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,239
at breeding and China as well but um but

823
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:53,159
for marijuana I think that we need to

824
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:55,078
have good breeding and good breeding for

825
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:56,759
particular locations because especially

826
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:59,519
if you're growing Outdoors because

827
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:02,520
Humble County California has a very

828
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:05,559
different environment than Upstate New

829
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:07,599
York or than Colorado right so if you're

830
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:10,039
growing outdoors I think that you need

831
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:13,160
to have really good breeding and I hope

832
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:15,920
that that happens in cannabis or I know

833
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:18,279
that it is happening right now sure yeah

834
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,280
it's it's been happening for years but

835
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:22,440
the the ratio of people doing that kind

836
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:24,760
of work to the people just putting

837
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,800
something on the market to make money is

838
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:28,920
it's very low like the amount of people

839
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,000
like doing serious breeding work versus

840
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:33,200
I'm going to cross this to this and see

841
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,239
what happens because the names are cool

842
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:36,118
you know and putting it out on the

843
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:38,078
market there's a lot of that now and

844
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:42,358
that's typically what we see in the

845
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:44,920
breeding Market I I think so I think

846
00:37:42,358 --> 00:37:47,759
that there are very reputable a

847
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:50,280
companies in California I know one

848
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,280
company from Colorado like Trilogy and

849
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:55,280
seeds I think that they're they're good

850
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:59,119
at what they do for example as breeding

851
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:01,440
um but um it is not easy it is time

852
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:03,800
consuming and I do agree with you that

853
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:07,920
the naming thing is well we know that

854
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:11,599
the naming convention is is just BS

855
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:15,280
right and we know that sativa indicia

856
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:17,240
hybrid they do not mean much especially

857
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,880
when you're trying to group trades like

858
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:22,239
this is sativa because is lengthy and

859
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,640
tall and then it has high THC like those

860
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:26,559
traits are completely different it's

861
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:29,000
like me saying like oh you are tall

862
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:33,440
because you have brown eyes like that is

863
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:35,960
not related whatsoever or a dog is tall

864
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:39,358
because it's white like that doesn't

865
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:41,440
have any sort of relationship um and

866
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:43,960
also we know for example that they are

867
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,880
strains that have nothing to do with

868
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:48,159
each other like Girl Scout cookies for

869
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:50,960
example Girl Scout

870
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:52,719
cookies you can have two strange Girl

871
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,760
Scout cookies that are more closely

872
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:57,598
related to something completely

873
00:38:54,760 --> 00:39:01,400
different except to each other yeah so

874
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:04,519
so when people ask me my

875
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:07,519
recommendation what I tell them is well

876
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:10,800
you named this I don't know Blue Dream

877
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:13,280
right you named this blue dream um then

878
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:18,920
and they got a I don't know a cannabis

879
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:21,599
High Times cop yeah then rename it next

880
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:24,720
time and just call it I don't know dream

881
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:28,599
blue yeah yeah that's typically yeah how

882
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:31,799
it goes yeah yeah rename it or or then

883
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:34,960
right or or then just this blue dream

884
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:37,200
got uh whatever then name another strain

885
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:39,039
Blue Dream as well like no one right so

886
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:41,759
I and then when people tell me like well

887
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:44,400
but mine is the real blue dream I don't

888
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:46,440
know I can tell you whether your blue

889
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:50,440
dream is related to other blue dreams

890
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:53,280
but I cannot say who's the real one like

891
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:55,880
which one is the real OG yeah I don't

892
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,079
know see and that's that's what's like

893
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:00,400
the most fascinating part of the topic

894
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:02,760
to me is is what we were talking about

895
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,680
my friend U Matt pointed out to me he's

896
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,960
like it's anthropology Matt like because

897
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:09,199
I was trying to explain to him like how

898
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:13,039
do I explain to a scientist what we do

899
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:15,439
and why what we do is reliable most

900
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:17,119
importantly because like anybody can say

901
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,039
like yeah I got this cut and yeah it's

902
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:20,680
real because I said it's real or it's

903
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:23,079
real because this guy told me and he's

904
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:25,480
old like these are not good this is not

905
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:27,480
science right but there is anthropology

906
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:30,000
to it in the sense that uh you know know

907
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:33,159
there are people that have been alive

908
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,318
and in this in the scene for x amount of

909
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:36,879
years and were there when this strain

910
00:40:35,318 --> 00:40:38,880
first popped up watched where it came

911
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,559
from already were that kind of person

912
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,240
that would record that kind of data you

913
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:43,838
know and there are these guys in the

914
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:46,598
Cannabis world that exist and have

915
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:48,159
existed like total nerds so there are

916
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:50,880
these people that exist in the Cannabis

917
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:53,239
world that are kind of reclusive but

918
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,800
it's very it's been a task like that's

919
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:58,759
what I've devoted my life to is figuring

920
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:01,000
out who these people are where at and if

921
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:03,319
I can shake down their story and and

922
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:07,559
really figure out is this one is this

923
00:41:03,318 --> 00:41:09,519
provable is it plausible probable or

924
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:11,838
total BS because there's four answers

925
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:14,239
you can get there and and most of them

926
00:41:11,838 --> 00:41:15,639
are right in between two and three you

927
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:17,679
know there's very little stuff that we

928
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:21,279
can be like okay we know this came from

929
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:23,480
for example uh Dave Watson we know skunk

930
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:26,880
one came from Dave Watson

931
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:28,480
1975 roughly you know we know that for a

932
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,599
fact because it was well documented at

933
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,719
the time it was in books at the time

934
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:34,440
multiple different sources he's still

935
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:36,239
around can still give you know

936
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,559
statements that are all contemporaneous

937
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:40,598
with what was going on at the time the

938
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:43,719
story hasn't changed um however then we

939
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:46,359
have stories like purple kle where we

940
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:48,118
have nine to 10 different claimants none

941
00:41:46,358 --> 00:41:50,039
of them can show that they had any kind

942
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:51,680
of Parental progeny or documentation on

943
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:54,239
it so it's one of those stories that

944
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:56,399
sits but oddly enough with things like

945
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:58,118
Goji Kush we can we have pretty good

946
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,400
documentation of certain strains like

947
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:03,000
that because enough people were around

948
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,240
it wasn't so long ago that a lot of the

949
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,559
people that were around then are still

950
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:09,559
around you know but it's debatable

951
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:12,759
regardless yeah and I think that it

952
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:17,279
would be super cool to be able to do

953
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:19,440
some genetic study that may corroborate

954
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:23,079
all of these stories right yes that's

955
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:26,400
the most important like yeah I I I think

956
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:29,400
that that could be super cool um I would

957
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:33,559
be a little hent because I have gotten a

958
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:36,960
lot of sometimes not a lot of no some

959
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:40,519
negative vibes from certain people about

960
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:42,760
gomic work and about right and these

961
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:45,759
tools that are super powerful and that

962
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:50,119
are going to change the industry really

963
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:52,440
sure um so that part I feel you know

964
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:54,559
like saying kind of like hey this is

965
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:56,119
really not blue dream there may be

966
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:58,040
someone that's not going to like it

967
00:42:56,119 --> 00:43:01,160
right I've heard a lot of ings in this

968
00:42:58,039 --> 00:43:03,558
industry that way exactly that you hurt

969
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:07,838
a lot of feelings so I I think that it

970
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:09,960
would be a really cool um genetic study

971
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:13,159
that corroborates this

972
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:15,358
anthropological study right exactly and

973
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:18,920
we've done that with dogs we've done

974
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:20,799
that with humans um you know we know for

975
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:24,720
example that dogs were domesticated

976
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:27,240
multiple times uh by multiple cultures

977
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:28,879
yes it is pretty crazy but we also have

978
00:43:27,239 --> 00:43:32,919
anthropological evidence that the

979
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:36,440
Chinese for example had dogs and that um

980
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:39,400
there were also dogs in in Europe and in

981
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:41,599
in the Americas so so we know that dogs

982
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:43,160
were domesticated multiple times and we

983
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:46,640
know for example in

984
00:43:43,159 --> 00:43:49,279
humans one really cool study that I

985
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:52,679
remember coming up you know we we know

986
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:57,880
that when Christopher Columbus came to

987
00:43:52,679 --> 00:44:00,679
to America um they basically um the

988
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:03,079
Spanish were different from the British

989
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:06,519
right the British kind of sent colonies

990
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:08,160
in in North America the Spanish just

991
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:10,400
took all of the gold and left like they

992
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:13,239
were not planning on really staying in

993
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:17,079
South America yeah but they did you know

994
00:44:13,239 --> 00:44:20,000
rape women killed men and then took the

995
00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:23,720
gold and left and now we have some

996
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:27,599
evidence genetic evidence that many of

997
00:44:23,719 --> 00:44:30,039
the genes that are coming from Men are

998
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:32,599
from Spain and many of the genes that

999
00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:34,759
are from women are from native women in

1000
00:44:32,599 --> 00:44:36,760
South America and there was this

1001
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:39,240
beautiful study that was published in

1002
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:42,920
pnas I'm GNA say that it was probably

1003
00:44:39,239 --> 00:44:46,479
around 2011 or 2012

1004
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:49,280
that took what we knew anthropologically

1005
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,240
and had this genetic study about the

1006
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,160
human

1007
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:53,959
mitochondria that is inherited through

1008
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:55,480
the mother and the white chromosome that

1009
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:59,079
is inherited through the father and it

1010
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:01,960
was so beautiful to to see you know the

1011
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:04,318
parallels between genetics you know

1012
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:07,559
genomics and anthropology and I think

1013
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:08,880
that in cannabis could be similar yeah I

1014
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:11,319
mean I guess that's how you make

1015
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,920
anthropology scientific right is is you

1016
00:45:11,318 --> 00:45:15,800
back up the data or you back it up with

1017
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:17,639
data and I yeah I know there was we had

1018
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,800
talked about this about 10 years ago we

1019
00:45:17,639 --> 00:45:22,558
were going to start doing it just

1020
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:25,280
specifically with the OG Kush um project

1021
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:27,079
and the problem was one of course you

1022
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,920
have to Source all of these cuts

1023
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:30,240
specifically from the most reliable

1024
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:33,119
sources

1025
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:34,399
and the most reliable sources in quotes

1026
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,160
because that's it's only going to be

1027
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,720
what people tell you but if you get

1028
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:39,719
enough of them you can kind of get an

1029
00:45:37,719 --> 00:45:41,318
idea a very good idea especially when

1030
00:45:39,719 --> 00:45:43,039
you know multiple people confirm certain

1031
00:45:41,318 --> 00:45:45,960
sources and we were going to do that but

1032
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:47,838
at the same time we didn't know of any

1033
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:50,720
reliable place except there was one

1034
00:45:47,838 --> 00:45:54,440
company at the time called phos uh to

1035
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:56,598
even do the testing to tell us the the

1036
00:45:54,440 --> 00:46:00,159
the matrilineal patrilineal relations

1037
00:45:56,599 --> 00:46:01,519
any of stuff and they any OG that was

1038
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:03,759
submitted to them they all said was the

1039
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:05,199
same clone they were not able to tell

1040
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:08,079
when it was obvious like when someone

1041
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:09,838
was like giving a known self line like

1042
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:11,079
saying I po the seed from a known self

1043
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:12,799
line from this clone I'll send you a

1044
00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:14,200
clone of this and a clone of this sent

1045
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,960
it to him and it was showing up as the

1046
00:46:14,199 --> 00:46:17,239
exact same clone so he already knew it

1047
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:22,079
wasn't going to be reliable from the

1048
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:25,039
jump you know so phos they do have the

1049
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:26,760
Galaxy which is trustworthy I think that

1050
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:28,880
they have done a good job of the Galaxy

1051
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:32,559
and they have all of the the kushes

1052
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:35,960
right so so their their Galaxy I know

1053
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:37,920
the tests behind the algorithms behind

1054
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:40,280
that Galaxy and that the cool thing is

1055
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,519
that you can shift it right and you can

1056
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:46,319
kind of zoom in to a particular part so

1057
00:46:42,519 --> 00:46:50,239
I think that that is pretty cool um and

1058
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:51,800
I disagree or I don't know what are they

1059
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:54,118
doing right now regarding their

1060
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:57,280
sequencing but I disagree with

1061
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:58,838
particular ways of sequencing The genome

1062
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,839
um I think that there's other ways of

1063
00:46:58,838 --> 00:47:03,078
sequencing where you can get a lot of

1064
00:47:00,838 --> 00:47:07,599
information and you can also explore

1065
00:47:03,079 --> 00:47:10,160
other things but if you have multiple

1066
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:11,800
individuals multiple kushes that are

1067
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:13,598
that may not be related to each other

1068
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:15,720
and they are all appearing as the same

1069
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:18,920
clone I would

1070
00:47:15,719 --> 00:47:20,519
be hesitant about those results and I

1071
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:23,039
think that it may be the way that

1072
00:47:20,519 --> 00:47:25,800
they're sequencing right so so there are

1073
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:27,960
for example for paternity tests so to

1074
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:30,880
figure out whether that is your child or

1075
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:32,800
not yeah there are particular genomic

1076
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:35,240
regions that you sequence and not other

1077
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:37,720
genomic regions right you sequence

1078
00:47:35,239 --> 00:47:39,679
genomic regions that are very varied

1079
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:42,480
between individuals yeah because there

1080
00:47:39,679 --> 00:47:45,039
are genes that are extremely conserved

1081
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:47,199
between you and I that you know you're

1082
00:47:45,039 --> 00:47:50,880
Mexican and Colombian they may not

1083
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:53,480
differ yeah yeah so but there are

1084
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:56,119
reliable paternity tests so you need to

1085
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:59,519
figure out which region of the genome

1086
00:47:56,119 --> 00:48:01,960
you're sequencing and I think that there

1087
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:04,358
could have been a problem with phos

1088
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:07,079
doing that sure yeah I mean in a

1089
00:48:04,358 --> 00:48:11,119
hypothetical situation I I'll say it

1090
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:13,400
that way like we were taking a a clone

1091
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:19,800
mom like let's for for example we'll

1092
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:22,680
call this Sendo sturs and a uh laush

1093
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:24,920
right and we were taking that mother

1094
00:48:22,679 --> 00:48:27,118
clone and the other mother clone

1095
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:30,000
submitting those to phos we crossed them

1096
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:31,880
together ran the progyny we know that

1097
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,239
one I mean the progy all either Bubba

1098
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:36,440
Kush or M perss or a variance of it's

1099
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:38,318
very reliable in breeding sent them a

1100
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:40,639
clone of that and none of them showed

1101
00:48:38,318 --> 00:48:42,039
related at all between all three and

1102
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:44,279
that's when we were like okay so we have

1103
00:48:42,039 --> 00:48:45,838
the OG Kush data we have some pretty

1104
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:47,440
known data when it comes to cookies on

1105
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:49,798
cookies parentage and it's not showing

1106
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:53,280
up in phos data and then we did that to

1107
00:48:49,798 --> 00:48:55,559
kind of test and see how hypothetically

1108
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,280
we did that allegedly that was done to

1109
00:48:55,559 --> 00:48:59,359
see

1110
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:01,559
how if if it would really show up like

1111
00:48:59,358 --> 00:49:03,798
that and in one case there was like chem

1112
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:06,640
91 and chm91

1113
00:49:03,798 --> 00:49:08,838
s1s selfline scent and they were able to

1114
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:11,838
tell this as a self version of that or

1115
00:49:08,838 --> 00:49:13,318
really close relation to that um but in

1116
00:49:11,838 --> 00:49:14,920
many cases they couldn't tell direct

1117
00:49:13,318 --> 00:49:16,798
relations from each other so there was

1118
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:18,400
there was no consistency like sometimes

1119
00:49:16,798 --> 00:49:20,280
it was right and sometimes it was just

1120
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,440
so off it was really confusing to me and

1121
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:24,160
I never knew why it never made any sense

1122
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:26,960
to me and I I don't understand the

1123
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:28,719
science behind how they collect the data

1124
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:31,480
it where the error would have been but

1125
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:34,118
it's always fascinated me to no end so

1126
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:36,880
okay so I'm gonna explain something to

1127
00:49:34,119 --> 00:49:39,358
you which I think could could be I don't

1128
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,960
know if it's for sure but it could be

1129
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:43,920
one of the reasons so when you are

1130
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:46,000
sequencing a genome right you have all

1131
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:48,639
of the letters of the

1132
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:52,519
DNA there's multiple ways of sequencing

1133
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:55,519
The genome right there's one way that is

1134
00:49:52,519 --> 00:49:58,358
called whole genome shotgun okay where

1135
00:49:55,519 --> 00:50:01,119
you take the entire genome and you

1136
00:49:58,358 --> 00:50:02,920
sequence it all when you're sequencing

1137
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:05,838
whole genome shotgun there's something

1138
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:09,440
that it's called the coverage so the

1139
00:50:05,838 --> 00:50:12,159
coverage is the amount of times that on

1140
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:14,480
average each letter of the DNA is being

1141
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:16,558
sequenced okay so on average if you have

1142
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:19,519
one X on average each letter is

1143
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:22,160
sequenced one time if you have 10 X on

1144
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:24,759
average each letter is sequence 10 times

1145
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:28,239
if you have 100x on average each letter

1146
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:30,079
is sequence 100 times right okay so I

1147
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:32,798
really like whole genome shotgun even if

1148
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:34,920
it's One X because you have the entire

1149
00:50:32,798 --> 00:50:36,920
genome and you can look at different

1150
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:40,159
regions of the genome and at the end of

1151
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:42,079
the day it is cheaper per letter to

1152
00:50:40,159 --> 00:50:45,078
sequence the entire genome at a whole

1153
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:47,119
genome shotgun okay there is another way

1154
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:50,440
of sequencing The genome which is called

1155
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:54,960
genotyping by sequencing

1156
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:57,280
GBS in GBS what you do is that you take

1157
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:59,960
the genome and then you you break it

1158
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,640
down into pieces with these enzymes

1159
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:03,679
these proteins that are kind of like

1160
00:51:01,639 --> 00:51:06,279
these little scissors yeah that they

1161
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:09,719
break the genome into pieces and then

1162
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:12,720
you end up sequencing only 1% of the

1163
00:51:09,719 --> 00:51:17,719
genome approximately okay one two% of

1164
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:19,399
the genome GBS helps you to figure out

1165
00:51:17,719 --> 00:51:20,919
whether you're more closely related to

1166
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:23,720
me or whether you're more closely

1167
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:29,318
related to your mom okay right so that

1168
00:51:23,719 --> 00:51:31,279
is GBS however GBS s has a lot of

1169
00:51:29,318 --> 00:51:34,719
problems one of the problem is

1170
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:37,000
repetition okay so even if you do it

1171
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:38,239
with the same restriction enzymes the

1172
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,719
same pair of

1173
00:51:38,239 --> 00:51:45,239
scissors and even if you follow the same

1174
00:51:40,719 --> 00:51:47,358
protocol repetition is not um consistent

1175
00:51:45,239 --> 00:51:50,078
yeah um and there's a paper showing that

1176
00:51:47,358 --> 00:51:52,000
the repetition in GBS is not consistent

1177
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:53,440
and in addition to that you know even

1178
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,838
though it's cheaper because you're only

1179
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:59,400
sequencing 1% it's cheaper in general

1180
00:51:56,838 --> 00:52:02,838
per letter it is not cheaper than whole

1181
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:04,318
genome shotgun okay and there are

1182
00:52:02,838 --> 00:52:07,719
different pairs of scissors there's

1183
00:52:04,318 --> 00:52:09,838
different restriction enzymes so I have

1184
00:52:07,719 --> 00:52:14,959
this study um in

1185
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:16,838
2016 that we compared the the GBS data

1186
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:18,798
from one group to another and because

1187
00:52:16,838 --> 00:52:22,519
they had used different restriction

1188
00:52:18,798 --> 00:52:24,599
enzymes we could not compare the data

1189
00:52:22,519 --> 00:52:26,199
between them we could just compare it to

1190
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:27,720
the whole genome shotgun so this one

1191
00:52:26,199 --> 00:52:29,239
against the whole genome shotgun this

1192
00:52:27,719 --> 00:52:31,318
one against the whole genome shotgun but

1193
00:52:29,239 --> 00:52:34,879
we couldn't compare these two that makes

1194
00:52:31,318 --> 00:52:36,759
sense because there were no overlaps so

1195
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:39,798
it is my understanding that Pho

1196
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:41,680
sequencing sequences GBS I don't know if

1197
00:52:39,798 --> 00:52:44,480
they still do but at least at some point

1198
00:52:41,679 --> 00:52:47,358
in their lives they did okay and I'm

1199
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:50,519
always questioning that reasoning

1200
00:52:47,358 --> 00:52:51,960
whether it's for you know profits you

1201
00:52:50,519 --> 00:52:54,239
know because you don't want to spend

1202
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:57,039
more money or because the questions that

1203
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:58,719
you have you just need to know whether

1204
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:01,159
you're more closely related to your mom

1205
00:52:58,719 --> 00:53:03,480
them to me and that's it but you cannot

1206
00:53:01,159 --> 00:53:05,598
look at the repetitive content of the

1207
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:08,519
genome you know the junk DNA you cannot

1208
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:11,880
look at that you cannot look at whole

1209
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:16,440
genes right you cannot look whether this

1210
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:19,760
entire genes have different copies so I

1211
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:23,440
I question GBS and and I think that that

1212
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:25,599
may be one of the reasons why um they

1213
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:27,240
got those results with you I would not

1214
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:29,680
be surprised

1215
00:53:27,239 --> 00:53:32,919
with GBS yeah you know and

1216
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:35,798
especially like I am really sloppy you

1217
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:39,358
know I bump things uh you know in the

1218
00:53:35,798 --> 00:53:40,679
lab I like there's a hair somewhere I'm

1219
00:53:39,358 --> 00:53:42,119
the type of person that is trying to

1220
00:53:40,679 --> 00:53:45,838
look neat and then you have you know

1221
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:49,160
toothpaste yeah yeah that is me I have

1222
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:51,279
never been good at doing something more

1223
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:53,920
than DNA extractions my DNA extractions

1224
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:57,240
are fine but if you have to do something

1225
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:58,920
like GBS where you have to Sonic at and

1226
00:53:57,239 --> 00:54:00,598
then you have to do the Restriction

1227
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:04,159
enzyme and then you have to do this

1228
00:54:00,599 --> 00:54:06,640
other like that wouldn't work yeah yeah

1229
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:09,399
so if you you need to have a really good

1230
00:54:06,639 --> 00:54:12,118
technician and even then your results

1231
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:15,160
are not repeal and if they're not

1232
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:17,318
repeatable isn't that what like science

1233
00:54:15,159 --> 00:54:20,639
is like it to be able to show something

1234
00:54:17,318 --> 00:54:23,480
is rep repeatable to have repeatable

1235
00:54:20,639 --> 00:54:26,118
results to make a valid I mean I'm a

1236
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:28,000
Layman so like I'm good at like English

1237
00:54:26,119 --> 00:54:30,240
and history and stuff like that so if

1238
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,519
I'm wrong correct me but like that also

1239
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:34,039
makes me think like okay so if that data

1240
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:36,798
is incorrect with just those very few

1241
00:54:34,039 --> 00:54:39,119
examples that we noticed and we're one

1242
00:54:36,798 --> 00:54:42,480
out of tens of thousands of people who

1243
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:44,200
use this when they go to cell said data

1244
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,920
if it doesn't merge well with other

1245
00:54:44,199 --> 00:54:50,358
people's data sets said data might end

1246
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:52,318
up worthless so all that investment and

1247
00:54:50,358 --> 00:54:54,719
savings that they went to be cheaper to

1248
00:54:52,318 --> 00:54:58,440
save whatever if that was the theory in

1249
00:54:54,719 --> 00:55:01,279
it would end up not working out so well

1250
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:03,079
I would think I mean it just yeah from

1251
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,519
my from my point of view as someone

1252
00:55:03,079 --> 00:55:06,000
who's who's like a history and not a

1253
00:55:04,519 --> 00:55:07,639
math person or a science person it

1254
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:12,079
doesn't make much

1255
00:55:07,639 --> 00:55:14,159
sense I 100% agree with you and

1256
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:17,559
unfortunately people in the world I'm

1257
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:19,118
going to say something that look we know

1258
00:55:17,559 --> 00:55:23,319
that there's a lot of science that it's

1259
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:25,559
not repeatable for example Excel

1260
00:55:23,318 --> 00:55:28,079
spreadsheets right we know that Excel

1261
00:55:25,559 --> 00:55:31,480
spreadsheets when you type one whatever

1262
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:36,359
it translates it to January 12 yeah yeah

1263
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:40,358
and it's like what so that we know that

1264
00:55:36,358 --> 00:55:43,159
Excel you know screws things up yeah but

1265
00:55:40,358 --> 00:55:47,759
we also know that there's other

1266
00:55:43,159 --> 00:55:51,279
science old science that may not be

1267
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:55,079
repeatable right now that at that time

1268
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:56,839
so so similar to GBS I think that GBS

1269
00:55:55,079 --> 00:55:59,280
it's going to be a few years to people

1270
00:55:56,838 --> 00:56:02,798
stop using it for these reasons and for

1271
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:05,440
other reasons yeah but um there's other

1272
00:56:02,798 --> 00:56:08,519
techniques um and sematic techniques

1273
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:11,318
that people do not use anymore I used

1274
00:56:08,519 --> 00:56:14,759
alheim during my PhD that no one uses

1275
00:56:11,318 --> 00:56:18,798
that anymore and just to give you

1276
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:21,319
another example studies with mice we

1277
00:56:18,798 --> 00:56:23,000
found out we in the world I mean we

1278
00:56:21,318 --> 00:56:27,719
found out

1279
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:30,798
that mice respond differently to humans

1280
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:32,719
whether it's a female that is treating

1281
00:56:30,798 --> 00:56:35,960
the mice or whether it's a male that's

1282
00:56:32,719 --> 00:56:40,480
treating the mice so results with

1283
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:42,720
experimental mice May differ whether the

1284
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:45,679
person conducting the experiment was a

1285
00:56:42,719 --> 00:56:49,159
woman or a man is it like scent hormone

1286
00:56:45,679 --> 00:56:50,798
or they know I don't know but we know

1287
00:56:49,159 --> 00:56:53,519
that there

1288
00:56:50,798 --> 00:56:55,199
is we know that there is this Gap in

1289
00:56:53,519 --> 00:56:57,599
science we know that there's a lot of

1290
00:56:55,199 --> 00:57:00,159
data sets that are not publicly

1291
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:04,760
available including some from my papers

1292
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:06,920
one paper because of some reasons but I

1293
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:09,720
try to make my data available because I

1294
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:12,200
think it's fair with the world and

1295
00:57:09,719 --> 00:57:14,318
particularly because I don't know what's

1296
00:57:12,199 --> 00:57:16,960
going to happen I don't know whether my

1297
00:57:14,318 --> 00:57:19,119
analysis was entirely correct I don't

1298
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:21,119
know whether you analyze it differently

1299
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:23,838
and are going to get a different results

1300
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:27,079
or right so I think that I should make

1301
00:57:23,838 --> 00:57:29,400
all of my data public for anyone here or

1302
00:57:27,079 --> 00:57:32,039
in pagonia Argentina or in Shanghai

1303
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:35,639
China to be able to analyze my data and

1304
00:57:32,039 --> 00:57:39,680
tell me hey I did get what you or or I

1305
00:57:35,639 --> 00:57:41,639
disagree with you yeah right yeah and

1306
00:57:39,679 --> 00:57:43,199
and I think that in many cases that's

1307
00:57:41,639 --> 00:57:44,920
not the way with science that's not the

1308
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:47,358
way with Excel spreadsheets that's not

1309
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:50,000
the way with and and I think that with

1310
00:57:47,358 --> 00:57:53,078
GBS data whenever I see GBS data I'm

1311
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:55,559
like I'm not like I'm not analyzing that

1312
00:57:53,079 --> 00:57:59,519
yeah and and you know what's funny is

1313
00:57:55,559 --> 00:58:01,599
because f was embedded in our our our

1314
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:03,639
subculture for so long I mean it was

1315
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:05,079
like a good I don't know eight years

1316
00:58:03,639 --> 00:58:06,838
that that people were taking their data

1317
00:58:05,079 --> 00:58:09,760
and being like making conclusions from

1318
00:58:06,838 --> 00:58:11,798
it and making other conclusions from it

1319
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:14,200
based on those conclusions that phos had

1320
00:58:11,798 --> 00:58:17,119
made and it's it when we kind of

1321
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:19,159
realized how bad or inconsistent some of

1322
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:21,160
the data was it was like slowly

1323
00:58:19,159 --> 00:58:22,639
unraveling stuff in our head like we

1324
00:58:21,159 --> 00:58:24,358
always used to make these conclusions

1325
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:26,239
based on that data but that's now

1326
00:58:24,358 --> 00:58:29,078
invalid data and you actually have have

1327
00:58:26,239 --> 00:58:31,358
to go through and like remove it from

1328
00:58:29,079 --> 00:58:32,798
your brain scrub your brain from all

1329
00:58:31,358 --> 00:58:34,798
this things so now when I see people

1330
00:58:32,798 --> 00:58:36,519
with phos data I'm like I don't I don't

1331
00:58:34,798 --> 00:58:38,000
want to see it because it doesn't matter

1332
00:58:36,519 --> 00:58:40,199
because I it might be right but it might

1333
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,798
not and that's an unreliable narrator I

1334
00:58:40,199 --> 00:58:44,239
can't do it yeah I think that there's

1335
00:58:42,798 --> 00:58:45,960
some things that are right you know I

1336
00:58:44,239 --> 00:58:48,358
think that their Galaxy that the

1337
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:51,798
relationship between strange may be

1338
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:54,598
right um but now that they're doing

1339
00:58:51,798 --> 00:58:56,759
breeding I don't know I honestly don't

1340
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:59,400
know I don't even

1341
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:01,319
I I I I remember when all that blew up

1342
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:02,838
and and a lot of people's anger at it

1343
00:59:01,318 --> 00:59:04,558
but for me like I was just more

1344
00:59:02,838 --> 00:59:06,318
interested in like are you putting out

1345
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:08,680
good data or bad data people are

1346
00:59:06,318 --> 00:59:10,719
purchasing data this is my I don't care

1347
00:59:08,679 --> 00:59:12,798
what you do with any of your breeding or

1348
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:14,519
any of that because they you know I mean

1349
00:59:12,798 --> 00:59:17,239
until they started asking for whole

1350
00:59:14,519 --> 00:59:19,759
seeds and stuff like that that that's

1351
00:59:17,239 --> 00:59:21,719
when it became different but when it

1352
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:23,680
came to the data is this data consistent

1353
00:59:21,719 --> 00:59:25,118
with what we're seeing no okay then why

1354
00:59:23,679 --> 00:59:27,598
not and then when we start finding out

1355
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:29,318
it's not well then what are you doing

1356
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:30,680
luckily I think they do no longer do

1357
00:59:29,318 --> 00:59:32,519
data sequencing and they're just doing

1358
00:59:30,679 --> 00:59:34,199
their breeding program now which is cool

1359
00:59:32,519 --> 00:59:36,920
props to them hope they have good luck

1360
00:59:34,199 --> 00:59:39,879
with it you know um one of the other

1361
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:40,838
things in cannabis that we ran into over

1362
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:44,599
the years that we've been trying to

1363
00:59:40,838 --> 00:59:48,358
figure out is in cannabis sex reversal

1364
00:59:44,599 --> 00:59:50,559
uh ethylene plays a major role right um

1365
00:59:48,358 --> 00:59:53,440
a lot of times we're seeing uh clone

1366
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:56,079
like take a clone take 60 cuts off a

1367
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:58,920
single mom they'll be in a tray 10 in by

1368
00:59:56,079 --> 01:00:01,798
20in tray 50 of them next to each other

1369
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:05,079
you'll get 30% distribution that

1370
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:07,559
actually reverse really well 30% that

1371
01:00:05,079 --> 01:00:09,079
kind of do and 30% that won't at all or

1372
01:00:07,559 --> 01:00:11,960
it'll reverse and won't drop viable

1373
01:00:09,079 --> 01:00:14,079
pollen and none of us know why and this

1374
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:16,599
has been going on for decades and none

1375
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:19,280
of us can figure it out so I'm

1376
01:00:16,599 --> 01:00:23,599
interested to hear your take on

1377
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:28,119
it I don't know okay I'm gonna okay I'm

1378
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:31,519
gonna so okay we know that cannabis has

1379
01:00:28,119 --> 01:00:34,640
X and Y chromosomes right yes so if you

1380
01:00:31,519 --> 01:00:37,199
are an XX you're a female if you're an

1381
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:40,519
XY you're a male kind of like us right

1382
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:43,000
yeah and then we have the mishes which

1383
01:00:40,519 --> 01:00:45,239
people in the industry called the Hermes

1384
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:49,039
so let's call it Hermes although they're

1385
01:00:45,239 --> 01:00:51,598
actually monish yes so the Hermes we

1386
01:00:49,039 --> 01:00:54,119
know that they're are particular regions

1387
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:57,318
of the chromosomes that are very similar

1388
01:00:54,119 --> 01:01:01,318
to the female chromosomes however we

1389
01:00:57,318 --> 01:01:03,400
don't know exactly how different the

1390
01:01:01,318 --> 01:01:05,920
monious chromosomes are from those of

1391
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:08,000
the female chromosomes oh interesting we

1392
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:10,200
don't we don't know that entirely we

1393
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:13,039
know that the white chromosome in the

1394
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:14,439
males it's very big is the biggest of

1395
01:01:13,039 --> 01:01:17,280
all of the

1396
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:18,559
chromosomes and so when you're

1397
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:20,559
sequencing a

1398
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:22,839
genome that's some there's something

1399
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:24,440
that is called The genome assembly so an

1400
01:01:22,838 --> 01:01:25,960
assembly is when you you know you're

1401
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:29,159
sequencing The genome and you have to

1402
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:31,480
partition those regions into pieces yeah

1403
01:01:29,159 --> 01:01:33,879
and then you have to put them together

1404
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:35,798
um that's when coverage comes really

1405
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:38,480
handy because if you have something that

1406
01:01:35,798 --> 01:01:41,280
is more than one X so if you have

1407
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:43,559
something that is let's say 100x then

1408
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:45,240
it's easier for you to put the puzzles

1409
01:01:43,559 --> 01:01:46,720
together because then you have this

1410
01:01:45,239 --> 01:01:48,159
piece this piece then you have this

1411
01:01:46,719 --> 01:01:50,519
other one and then you know you're

1412
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:53,679
starting to put your puzzle together and

1413
01:01:50,519 --> 01:01:57,559
ideally you would have in cannabis you

1414
01:01:53,679 --> 01:01:59,960
would have 11 piece right because it has

1415
01:01:57,559 --> 01:02:02,798
nine autosomes so nine chromosomes that

1416
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:05,720
are not related to sex okay nine then

1417
01:02:02,798 --> 01:02:07,960
you have an X and then you have a y

1418
01:02:05,719 --> 01:02:11,598
right so you have 11 different pieces

1419
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:13,798
that is your complete uh puzzle there is

1420
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:17,960
a really good assembly that was produced

1421
01:02:13,798 --> 01:02:22,159
by um Chris graa and Chris graa at all

1422
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:25,920
2021 um which is a female however we do

1423
01:02:22,159 --> 01:02:28,038
not have the puzzle for the white

1424
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:30,559
chromosome or the puzzle for the monious

1425
01:02:28,039 --> 01:02:35,000
chromosome we

1426
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:37,519
do we do know that if you have a y

1427
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:39,880
chromosome you're very likely to produce

1428
01:02:37,519 --> 01:02:41,480
poen yeah and if you have two X

1429
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:44,720
chromosomes you're very likely to

1430
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:47,719
produce female flowers yes there are

1431
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:50,439
some varieties as you said that if you

1432
01:02:47,719 --> 01:02:52,519
put ethylene or you know silver nitrate

1433
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:54,400
whatever they start producing flowers

1434
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:57,759
from the opposite sex in males if you

1435
01:02:54,400 --> 01:03:00,200
put eopen right start producing flowers

1436
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:04,160
female flowers there's some strains that

1437
01:03:00,199 --> 01:03:07,719
are more prone than others yes we don't

1438
01:03:04,159 --> 01:03:11,759
know why uh we don't know which are the

1439
01:03:07,719 --> 01:03:15,278
genes that are turning on yeah right we

1440
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:17,319
think that those genes may not be

1441
01:03:15,278 --> 01:03:19,358
related to the X and the Y chromosomes

1442
01:03:17,318 --> 01:03:22,920
we think that those genes may be

1443
01:03:19,358 --> 01:03:26,920
somewhere else in the genome interesting

1444
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:29,440
yeah because if you have the X and the Y

1445
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:32,559
chromosome you still Express you know

1446
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:34,920
whatever sex it is if you have XY you're

1447
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:37,880
male if you have XX you're female but

1448
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:40,358
then if you like if you force them to

1449
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:43,079
produce the other sex there's some that

1450
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:45,838
produce them and some not so maybe it

1451
01:03:43,079 --> 01:03:48,318
these genes are found somewhere else but

1452
01:03:45,838 --> 01:03:52,358
we have some idea of some genes that are

1453
01:03:48,318 --> 01:03:54,599
turned on and turned off um and I think

1454
01:03:52,358 --> 01:03:56,199
that that is a really interesting

1455
01:03:54,599 --> 01:04:01,119
question

1456
01:03:56,199 --> 01:04:03,000
why when how do you turn these jeans on

1457
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:05,838
is it just that some individuals do not

1458
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,519
have them and and like I said even if

1459
01:04:05,838 --> 01:04:09,199
they're clones of each other in the same

1460
01:04:07,519 --> 01:04:11,318
tray one inch apart meaning the angles

1461
01:04:09,199 --> 01:04:13,399
of light are very similar like how

1462
01:04:11,318 --> 01:04:15,838
they're being fed is identical you'll

1463
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:17,639
see 30% in a random distribution not

1464
01:04:15,838 --> 01:04:19,400
like in one set next to each other

1465
01:04:17,639 --> 01:04:21,558
they'll be totally random and it's it

1466
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:24,559
blows my mind every time that we just

1467
01:04:21,559 --> 01:04:27,200
can't figure it out we just cannot I I

1468
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:29,000
would love to explore that that was what

1469
01:04:27,199 --> 01:04:32,639
really caught my attention in cannabis

1470
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:34,679
what was that sex part right the yeah

1471
01:04:32,639 --> 01:04:36,278
yeah and I've never so far worked you

1472
01:04:34,679 --> 01:04:38,318
know I worked in the canabo jeans I

1473
01:04:36,278 --> 01:04:39,880
worked in and at the beginning when I

1474
01:04:38,318 --> 01:04:42,759
started working in the canabo jeans it

1475
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:46,160
was like oh why now I love them like I

1476
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:49,278
absolutely love them but um but that

1477
01:04:46,159 --> 01:04:51,759
part of the sex is super interesting to

1478
01:04:49,278 --> 01:04:53,639
me because the white chromosome you know

1479
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:56,160
the white chromosome in humans is very

1480
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:58,679
very small it's tiny okay

1481
01:04:56,159 --> 01:05:01,399
um and it basically has you know very

1482
01:04:58,679 --> 01:05:05,480
few genes and there's one gene that says

1483
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:08,639
hey everyone wake up you know Express

1484
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:11,199
and that's why I have many of the genes

1485
01:05:08,639 --> 01:05:13,798
that you have to produce beer to produce

1486
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:16,199
all of the yeah hormones that men

1487
01:05:13,798 --> 01:05:19,159
produce but I don't have that Gene that

1488
01:05:16,199 --> 01:05:20,960
wakes everyone up right yeah and the

1489
01:05:19,159 --> 01:05:23,118
white chromosome is Tiny basically has

1490
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:24,679
that one Gene and that's it in cannabis

1491
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:26,160
on the other hand the white chromosome

1492
01:05:24,679 --> 01:05:28,000
is humongous

1493
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:30,038
and one of the reasons why I think that

1494
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,599
we do not have a proper assembly is

1495
01:05:30,039 --> 01:05:35,440
because it's so big and it's full with

1496
01:05:32,599 --> 01:05:38,720
repetitive elements junk DNA yeah and

1497
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:41,039
the repetitive elements are repetitive

1498
01:05:38,719 --> 01:05:43,719
so you have repetition repetition

1499
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:46,440
repetition how many do you have it's so

1500
01:05:43,719 --> 01:05:47,919
hard to tell it's so difficult to put

1501
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:49,798
together because it's repetitive and

1502
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:52,200
repetitive and repetitive so it's very

1503
01:05:49,798 --> 01:05:56,159
hard to know when it ends and when it

1504
01:05:52,199 --> 01:05:58,038
starts right yeah and and so it's yeah

1505
01:05:56,159 --> 01:06:01,078
so so we don't know what's going on in

1506
01:05:58,039 --> 01:06:02,559
that in that chromosome that that's like

1507
01:06:01,079 --> 01:06:05,480
the one thing that's driven me for a

1508
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:07,960
long time like we developed a spray that

1509
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:09,760
is a ready to mix spray for people to

1510
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:13,000
that's uh silver nitrate sodium thy

1511
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:15,000
sulfate based you know and um the one

1512
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,599
thing that me and a few other people

1513
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,239
that are making femin seeds longer than

1514
01:06:16,599 --> 01:06:20,480
anyone else in the US we've just never

1515
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:22,000
been able to figure out that one factor

1516
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:23,400
and when you sell the spray people are

1517
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:27,679
always like well how do we know for sure

1518
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:30,079
and and to tell them I don't know just

1519
01:06:27,679 --> 01:06:31,919
numbers bet on numbers always use high

1520
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:33,720
amounts of numbers because odds are in

1521
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:35,920
your favor eventually if you use enough

1522
01:06:33,719 --> 01:06:37,639
numbers that you'll have successful not

1523
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:40,798
I mean the one thing I've learned too

1524
01:06:37,639 --> 01:06:43,960
when I did a population of there was

1525
01:06:40,798 --> 01:06:46,599
16,000 plants 3,000 of which I reversed

1526
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:50,480
and it was hemp one thing I noticed with

1527
01:06:46,599 --> 01:06:52,400
hemp is unlike like high THC cannabis It

1528
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:55,599
reversed immediately usually there's

1529
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:57,440
like the Stagger period in cannabis uh

1530
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:59,680
THC cannabis where it takes two and a

1531
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:02,480
half weeks to then show their sex as

1532
01:06:59,679 --> 01:07:04,239
being a male completely reversed in hemp

1533
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:07,519
it was like that and they were ready to

1534
01:07:04,239 --> 01:07:10,318
drop hemp for fiber or grain um this was

1535
01:07:07,519 --> 01:07:13,440
hemp uh it was remedy hemp cush cross so

1536
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:15,278
it was more for CBD production okay so

1537
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:17,720
it was

1538
01:07:15,278 --> 01:07:20,318
high and it and it triggered immediately

1539
01:07:17,719 --> 01:07:22,480
but in that population of 16 or I'm

1540
01:07:20,318 --> 01:07:24,318
sorry 3,000 that were reversed there was

1541
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:26,358
probably three that didn't reverse at

1542
01:07:24,318 --> 01:07:28,159
all stayed totally fale no matter how

1543
01:07:26,358 --> 01:07:30,798
much they were sprayed with and I'd

1544
01:07:28,159 --> 01:07:33,239
never seen that in in high THC cannabis

1545
01:07:30,798 --> 01:07:34,798
but I'd never ran that many plants in

1546
01:07:33,239 --> 01:07:37,118
high TC cannabis so it was really

1547
01:07:34,798 --> 01:07:38,519
interesting to see stuff like that uh in

1548
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:41,240
sexual reversals that there were even

1549
01:07:38,519 --> 01:07:43,798
plants that were totally resistant to uh

1550
01:07:41,239 --> 01:07:45,759
that kind of spray in sex reversals H

1551
01:07:43,798 --> 01:07:47,480
interesting yeah but it took seeing a

1552
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:51,240
large population to even be able to see

1553
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:53,159
three you know like yeah I I would love

1554
01:07:51,239 --> 01:07:54,919
to do experiments with that and see

1555
01:07:53,159 --> 01:07:57,038
what's going on in the genome like what

1556
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:59,358
genes are you turning on what jeans are

1557
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:01,960
you turning off right I I think that

1558
01:07:59,358 --> 01:08:03,679
that's super interesting yeah if you

1559
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:05,798
ever want to work on anything I am more

1560
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:06,960
than happy to send you whatever you need

1561
01:08:05,798 --> 01:08:09,199
we're always doing all kinds of

1562
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:11,920
experiments using all kinds of different

1563
01:08:09,199 --> 01:08:15,239
um ethene blockers and all kinds of

1564
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:17,880
different stuff but yeah um I I think

1565
01:08:15,239 --> 01:08:19,798
that you should quantify those things

1566
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:22,440
right of these however make because I

1567
01:08:19,798 --> 01:08:23,759
think that numbers are so powerful so of

1568
01:08:22,439 --> 01:08:26,919
these

1569
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:28,560
16,000 there were know 11,000 and then

1570
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:32,399
you quantify and then when you do it

1571
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:34,880
again in I don't know 2025 then you do

1572
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:37,119
it again and you quantify and and then

1573
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:39,600
you have numbers like what is the ratio

1574
01:08:37,119 --> 01:08:41,599
what are the odds and then when you sell

1575
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:45,120
your product you can say like hey you

1576
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:46,159
know it works for 30% of the individuals

1577
01:08:45,119 --> 01:08:49,838
when you have

1578
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:52,759
1,600 do it when you have more than five

1579
01:08:49,838 --> 01:08:54,158
or right you'll find that a lot of like

1580
01:08:52,759 --> 01:08:56,238
um cannabis breeders that have been

1581
01:08:54,158 --> 01:08:58,798
doing it a long time they're all they

1582
01:08:56,238 --> 01:09:00,479
all fall on the autism spectrum hardcore

1583
01:08:58,798 --> 01:09:02,158
and most of them keep like refuse to

1584
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:03,479
keep data written down and it's all up

1585
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:05,960
here because they've lived with that

1586
01:09:03,479 --> 01:09:07,439
idea that like if I get caught with any

1587
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:08,359
kind of numbers or data I'm going to get

1588
01:09:07,439 --> 01:09:10,278
busted and they're going to use it

1589
01:09:08,359 --> 01:09:12,319
against me in a court of law so almost

1590
01:09:10,279 --> 01:09:14,480
everyone keeps every bit of data up it's

1591
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:16,159
crazy some of the like I'm not that

1592
01:09:14,479 --> 01:09:17,718
great at keeping data stored like my

1593
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:20,479
memory is not that great but some of my

1594
01:09:17,719 --> 01:09:23,520
friends I'm like how do you remember

1595
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:25,198
like 25 years of data and they just

1596
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:27,359
magically do but yeah nothing's better

1597
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:30,719
than hardw written data with a you know

1598
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:34,480
that you can compare and refer back to

1599
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:36,239
yeah yeah so I want to talk and and of

1600
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:38,000
course this is what you referred to is

1601
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:39,639
you know something that probably people

1602
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,479
think is the most controversial topic

1603
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:43,719
that that you're that you like talking

1604
01:09:41,479 --> 01:09:44,879
about is GMO science in cannabis and I

1605
01:09:43,719 --> 01:09:45,960
want to talk about the future of

1606
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,960
cannabis and where you think it's going

1607
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:49,560
to go from here and where we can go what

1608
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:51,719
what's what are some of the beautiful

1609
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:53,800
things that that that GMO science can

1610
01:09:51,719 --> 01:09:58,640
bring to

1611
01:09:53,800 --> 01:10:00,199
cannabis well I mean GMO so I I have a

1612
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:02,679
non-for-profit organization the

1613
01:10:00,198 --> 01:10:04,719
agricultural genomics foundation and the

1614
01:10:02,679 --> 01:10:09,199
aim of that non for-profit and I hope

1615
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:10,880
that I someday can fulfill that goal is

1616
01:10:09,198 --> 01:10:14,399
to

1617
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:17,359
develop genetic tools for the use of the

1618
01:10:14,399 --> 01:10:21,839
public these genetic tools include GMOs

1619
01:10:17,359 --> 01:10:26,039
so GMOs is genetically modified organism

1620
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:27,039
yes what classify as a GMO or not that's

1621
01:10:26,039 --> 01:10:30,880
very

1622
01:10:27,039 --> 01:10:34,840
debatable but in general you know if you

1623
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:40,000
can if you need to be in a

1624
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:42,719
lab space for you to put the gene or

1625
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:46,880
take it out or Express whatever then

1626
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:51,439
it's probably a GMO right yeah

1627
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:52,560
um I think that GMOs are a very

1628
01:10:51,439 --> 01:10:58,479
important

1629
01:10:52,560 --> 01:11:00,920
tool um they know toos we we have GMOs

1630
01:10:58,479 --> 01:11:04,319
everywhere these big strawberries in the

1631
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:08,600
supermarket they're polyploid and they

1632
01:11:04,319 --> 01:11:11,960
were you know many they are not existing

1633
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:13,960
naturally it was humans that somehow

1634
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:17,198
made that I mean yeah artificial

1635
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:20,000
selection is been done by humans but

1636
01:11:17,198 --> 01:11:22,359
there are a lot of GMOs in many things

1637
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,840
that we eat in rice and a bunch of

1638
01:11:22,359 --> 01:11:28,639
things I think GMOs could be super

1639
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:31,800
useful for cannabis or marijuana for

1640
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:37,039
example to enhance maybe the production

1641
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:40,199
of cannaboids in hemp to silence certain

1642
01:11:37,039 --> 01:11:42,039
genes if you don't want THC then it

1643
01:11:40,198 --> 01:11:44,719
could help that's been a big problem for

1644
01:11:42,039 --> 01:11:47,920
a lot of uh hemp producers is testing

1645
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:50,880
hot sure testing hot and especially if

1646
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:53,480
you're growing for fiber for grain why

1647
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:55,679
do you care about THC and why have put

1648
01:11:53,479 --> 01:11:57,359
energy into it into it yeah and

1649
01:11:55,679 --> 01:12:00,319
sometimes some of these varieties for

1650
01:11:57,359 --> 01:12:01,158
Grainer fiber go over 0.3 they have I

1651
01:12:00,319 --> 01:12:05,399
don't know

1652
01:12:01,158 --> 01:12:07,799
0.5 who cares if a grain variety has 0.8

1653
01:12:05,399 --> 01:12:10,599
the farmer because now he's in he or she

1654
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:14,239
are are in trouble exactly it's serious

1655
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:16,280
at that point exactly so I I think that

1656
01:12:14,238 --> 01:12:18,198
that for example in the sex

1657
01:12:16,279 --> 01:12:20,920
determination stuff I I think that that

1658
01:12:18,198 --> 01:12:23,399
would be important to know exactly

1659
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:26,079
whether or not your plant is going to

1660
01:12:23,399 --> 01:12:28,279
produce um flowers of the opposite sex

1661
01:12:26,079 --> 01:12:31,279
because sometimes your plants just Herm

1662
01:12:28,279 --> 01:12:34,238
out and you then have seeds and it's

1663
01:12:31,279 --> 01:12:37,599
like who was the hermy here yeah right

1664
01:12:34,238 --> 01:12:40,519
so you I think that GMOs could be useful

1665
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:43,480
for that and for hemp for fiber and for

1666
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:46,440
grain as well to produce bigger grain or

1667
01:12:43,479 --> 01:12:49,519
to produce plants that may be um this is

1668
01:12:46,439 --> 01:12:52,719
resistant to particular diseases right

1669
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:54,880
now with a changing environment due to

1670
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:57,158
you know the climate crisis I think that

1671
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:59,960
those techniques are going to come very

1672
01:12:57,158 --> 01:13:03,519
handy so in general I see a very bright

1673
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:06,239
future in that sense the issue for me

1674
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:08,560
these tools are happening in every

1675
01:13:06,238 --> 01:13:11,439
single crop it's not just cannabis they

1676
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:12,560
are happening yeah the issue for me is

1677
01:13:11,439 --> 01:13:15,879
who

1678
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:18,639
owns those tools absolutely who is able

1679
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:20,880
to access those tools and whether the

1680
01:13:18,639 --> 01:13:24,600
access of that of those tools is going

1681
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:28,079
to benefit the public the grower the

1682
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:30,400
consumer or if it's gonna benefit a

1683
01:13:28,079 --> 01:13:33,880
corporation sure I think that's super

1684
01:13:30,399 --> 01:13:38,079
important the politics of it yeah that

1685
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:40,039
is my issue with those tools hence why I

1686
01:13:38,079 --> 01:13:43,439
have the nonprofit organization which at

1687
01:13:40,039 --> 01:13:46,000
some point I hope that I can grow enough

1688
01:13:43,439 --> 01:13:50,079
for I mean I I don't know if it's going

1689
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:52,719
to be a big enough non-for-profit to

1690
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:56,158
combat you know big

1691
01:13:52,719 --> 01:14:00,560
corporations in bag or big tobacco or

1692
01:13:56,158 --> 01:14:02,519
big Pharma but uh but maybe we can help

1693
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:05,039
the public

1694
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:08,280
somehow what kind of funding would we

1695
01:14:05,039 --> 01:14:11,279
need in order to be able to to make any

1696
01:14:08,279 --> 01:14:14,519
kind of difference in in being able to

1697
01:14:11,279 --> 01:14:16,599
use this technology for people that that

1698
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:17,800
it could benefit that that maybe aren't

1699
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:19,960
rich I mean because I know this

1700
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:22,159
technology is expensive that's that's

1701
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:23,760
one of the prohibitive factors in why

1702
01:14:22,158 --> 01:14:26,119
you would have to establish a nonprofit

1703
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:28,679
in order to do this um what kind of

1704
01:14:26,119 --> 01:14:32,319
funding would we need like Elon Musk

1705
01:14:28,679 --> 01:14:35,399
type funding or you know is it a few

1706
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:39,198
million so yeah many of these companies

1707
01:14:35,399 --> 01:14:41,238
many of this um these companies in the

1708
01:14:39,198 --> 01:14:42,919
canab space you know like the phos to

1709
01:14:41,238 --> 01:14:45,279
companies medicinal genomics type

1710
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:48,158
companies they have raised in the

1711
01:14:45,279 --> 01:14:51,399
millions like four five

1712
01:14:48,158 --> 01:14:55,279
six Max 10 less than 10 seven eight

1713
01:14:51,399 --> 01:14:58,039
million dollars I think that for us at

1714
01:14:55,279 --> 01:15:02,319
agf agricultural genomics Foundation is

1715
01:14:58,039 --> 01:15:04,079
is a non for-profit that that I run um I

1716
01:15:02,319 --> 01:15:09,319
am looking for a

1717
01:15:04,079 --> 01:15:13,359
few um thousand doll to start public

1718
01:15:09,319 --> 01:15:16,238
awareness and public education um and to

1719
01:15:13,359 --> 01:15:19,599
teach people really how what is a genome

1720
01:15:16,238 --> 01:15:22,079
how do you how do you do this tools

1721
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:25,880
right and and for that you know few

1722
01:15:22,079 --> 01:15:29,399
hundred thousand dollars could

1723
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:31,880
go a long way or few thousand do you

1724
01:15:29,399 --> 01:15:34,000
know less than $100,000 like few

1725
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:36,560
thousand dollar could go a long way on

1726
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:38,319
teaching people how to use this not not

1727
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:41,639
that any everyone is going to become a

1728
01:15:38,319 --> 01:15:44,920
genome is toora bio informatician but

1729
01:15:41,639 --> 01:15:47,520
but how to be educated about it and

1730
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:50,440
that's what we're trying to do now is

1731
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:53,639
figuring out how to raise that funding

1732
01:15:50,439 --> 01:15:57,039
to be able to start growing this and to

1733
01:15:53,639 --> 01:16:00,159
start educating the public and and um

1734
01:15:57,039 --> 01:16:03,840
and making some of these tools um and

1735
01:16:00,158 --> 01:16:06,679
then being able to to get this yeah

1736
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:09,119
running basically so how far out do you

1737
01:16:06,679 --> 01:16:13,399
think we are from

1738
01:16:09,119 --> 01:16:16,319
say um turning on turning on or off the

1739
01:16:13,399 --> 01:16:18,638
gene that is responsible for like let's

1740
01:16:16,319 --> 01:16:21,319
let's say hplv something like that a

1741
01:16:18,639 --> 01:16:23,400
viroid that's that's ravaging cannabis

1742
01:16:21,319 --> 01:16:25,039
right now how how far out would we be

1743
01:16:23,399 --> 01:16:27,839
from being able to combat something like

1744
01:16:25,039 --> 01:16:30,760
that GMO speaking so that's the hotblade

1745
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:33,199
Environ yes yeah is it really bad in

1746
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:36,039
California it's bad everywhere um

1747
01:16:33,198 --> 01:16:38,678
because of the nurseries and how how

1748
01:16:36,039 --> 01:16:40,519
hype strains kind of were pushed in and

1749
01:16:38,679 --> 01:16:43,560
there were demands for specific strains

1750
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:46,360
it spread like wildfire wildfire and in

1751
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:49,360
Spain now too here we we don't have that

1752
01:16:46,359 --> 01:16:51,198
as much in New York state oh yeah nurse

1753
01:16:49,359 --> 01:16:53,000
State's not one of the big big hubs of

1754
01:16:51,198 --> 01:16:55,559
of growing with nurseries and stuff like

1755
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:58,399
that California Oregon Colorado

1756
01:16:55,560 --> 01:17:02,440
um Washington Spain I know Amsterdam's

1757
01:16:58,399 --> 01:17:05,238
been ravaged recently um Belgium yeah

1758
01:17:02,439 --> 01:17:08,119
it's all over now oh wow so it's a

1759
01:17:05,238 --> 01:17:10,359
matter of time it's a matter of time

1760
01:17:08,119 --> 01:17:13,439
yeah how long are we gonna take I don't

1761
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:16,599
know you and disease disease is

1762
01:17:13,439 --> 01:17:18,559
just because disease evolves too right

1763
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:20,159
we can see it in covid and then we have

1764
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:22,080
the Delta and then we have the Omicron

1765
01:17:20,158 --> 01:17:25,799
and then we have right so it's it's also

1766
01:17:22,079 --> 01:17:28,158
changing so it's it's it's ALS so you

1767
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:30,440
are changing and the virus is changing

1768
01:17:28,158 --> 01:17:33,238
as well so that that one is hard what I

1769
01:17:30,439 --> 01:17:35,279
would recommend in that case is have a

1770
01:17:33,238 --> 01:17:38,198
good tissue culture facility where you

1771
01:17:35,279 --> 01:17:41,759
can do tissue culture and you can assure

1772
01:17:38,198 --> 01:17:45,960
that your stock is clean yeah which is

1773
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:48,320
is hard yeah sure and expensive yeah I I

1774
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:51,079
think that breeding is a is another good

1775
01:17:48,319 --> 01:17:52,799
thing when you have actual males and

1776
01:17:51,079 --> 01:17:54,960
females that you're breeding and then

1777
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:56,840
yes again you have to do the phen

1778
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:58,198
hunting and then it takes several

1779
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:00,000
generations and then you have two

1780
01:17:58,198 --> 01:18:02,039
siblings that are nothing alike and then

1781
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,800
you have to grow however many hundreds

1782
01:18:02,039 --> 01:18:07,119
of thousands of seeds to look for that

1783
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:10,440
one that is the one that you like but as

1784
01:18:07,119 --> 01:18:13,519
you go and as you're doing in breeding

1785
01:18:10,439 --> 01:18:18,799
right parents and Offspring or full sibs

1786
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:21,080
then you get better traits um but um but

1787
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:22,560
in terms of of disease I think that the

1788
01:18:21,079 --> 01:18:24,559
best thing that you can have is

1789
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:26,360
diversity is as much variation as

1790
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:29,600
possible possible because then if you

1791
01:18:26,359 --> 01:18:31,158
have full sibs maybe these two are

1792
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:33,719
affected by the virus but maybe these

1793
01:18:31,158 --> 01:18:36,439
two are not right exactly it's super

1794
01:18:33,719 --> 01:18:38,198
important so that regarding disease but

1795
01:18:36,439 --> 01:18:40,638
there's other traits that I think

1796
01:18:38,198 --> 01:18:42,799
cannabinoids maybe tpin there's other

1797
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:45,880
traits that I know that people are

1798
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:48,239
looking at flowering time genes sure

1799
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:51,760
that that we may have genetic tools

1800
01:18:48,238 --> 01:18:52,959
available sooner oh interesting see that

1801
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:54,400
would that would be so cool because

1802
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:57,880
there you know I mean flowering time is

1803
01:18:54,399 --> 01:18:59,799
a ser ious determiner of of probably as

1804
01:18:57,880 --> 01:19:02,319
best we can tell High I mean there's

1805
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:05,239
certain highs that you can get from um

1806
01:19:02,319 --> 01:19:07,158
18 we flowering plant from Colombia that

1807
01:19:05,238 --> 01:19:10,279
you can't get from a eight-week

1808
01:19:07,158 --> 01:19:12,519
flowering plant from Afghanistan that's

1809
01:19:10,279 --> 01:19:15,079
really interestings yeah yeah I'd like

1810
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:17,080
to see that that played with a bunch is

1811
01:19:15,079 --> 01:19:18,840
there anything else in breeding in

1812
01:19:17,079 --> 01:19:21,158
cannabis that that has totally blown

1813
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:22,560
your mind that you found like that was

1814
01:19:21,158 --> 01:19:23,719
quite unexpected once you started

1815
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:26,520
looking at the

1816
01:19:23,719 --> 01:19:28,399
jeans I was quite unexpected once they

1817
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:33,320
started looking at the

1818
01:19:28,399 --> 01:19:36,679
je well the canabo genes it was you know

1819
01:19:33,319 --> 01:19:39,279
it's so cool because at the beginning we

1820
01:19:36,679 --> 01:19:42,119
thought that it was one

1821
01:19:39,279 --> 01:19:44,439
gene with two different alos like with

1822
01:19:42,119 --> 01:19:48,399
two different forms of a of a gene right

1823
01:19:44,439 --> 01:19:50,519
yeah so that if you were dominant for

1824
01:19:48,399 --> 01:19:51,920
one then you produced CBD if you were

1825
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:54,000
dominant for the other one that you

1826
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:55,199
produced THC and then if you were

1827
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,560
heterocyc

1828
01:19:55,198 --> 01:19:59,319
right so you were homozygous you

1829
01:19:56,560 --> 01:20:01,520
produced THC homozygous for the other Al

1830
01:19:59,319 --> 01:20:04,079
you produce CBD and then if you were

1831
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:06,639
heterozygous then you produced F yeah

1832
01:20:04,079 --> 01:20:09,119
but then we found out that there are

1833
01:20:06,639 --> 01:20:12,960
multiple genes related to cannaboid

1834
01:20:09,119 --> 01:20:16,399
production multiple and that individuals

1835
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:19,560
differ in the number of genes so when we

1836
01:20:16,399 --> 01:20:21,679
found that out I remember I remember the

1837
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:23,760
day that we found this out and I was

1838
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:27,359
doing the genome alignments and I was

1839
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:29,719
looking at them and then my labmate at

1840
01:20:27,359 --> 01:20:32,359
the time who's now a good friend and

1841
01:20:29,719 --> 01:20:34,198
collaborator Kyle he was the one that

1842
01:20:32,359 --> 01:20:36,319
was like this doesn't look right look at

1843
01:20:34,198 --> 01:20:38,119
these alignments it looks and then we

1844
01:20:36,319 --> 01:20:39,960
found out that there were actually

1845
01:20:38,119 --> 01:20:42,000
different genes and there were multiple

1846
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:44,319
genes that were very similar to each

1847
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,079
other and then we found out that yes

1848
01:20:44,319 --> 01:20:48,039
indeed there are different copies

1849
01:20:46,079 --> 01:20:50,279
individuals differ in this different

1850
01:20:48,039 --> 01:20:53,679
copies but these genes are in close

1851
01:20:50,279 --> 01:20:55,238
proximity and now I'm working on this

1852
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:56,880
paper that I hope to have have published

1853
01:20:55,238 --> 01:21:03,559
by

1854
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:06,039
2023 um that we now see that there are

1855
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:08,440
multiple genes for example for CBC

1856
01:21:06,039 --> 01:21:11,600
production right so there's a bunch of

1857
01:21:08,439 --> 01:21:13,919
genes related to CBC production why is

1858
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:16,480
CBC produced in so such little

1859
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:18,319
quantities why if there's so many genes

1860
01:21:16,479 --> 01:21:21,799
related to CBC production like that is a

1861
01:21:18,319 --> 01:21:23,880
question that I'm like why and my

1862
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:25,679
hypothesis is that you know like these

1863
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:27,319
enzymes we know that they're very

1864
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:28,760
similar they act on the same precursor

1865
01:21:27,319 --> 01:21:32,639
molecule which is

1866
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:34,119
cbga um and they're sloppy because they

1867
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:37,960
produce each other's

1868
01:21:34,119 --> 01:21:40,000
compounds and they are promiscuous

1869
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:42,359
because they act on cbga the same

1870
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:44,560
precursor molecule so they are

1871
01:21:42,359 --> 01:21:48,000
promiscuous they are sloppy they're

1872
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:51,480
nothing they're not very accurate at all

1873
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:54,960
yeah my hypothesis is that cbca synthes

1874
01:21:51,479 --> 01:21:56,799
so this enzyme that is producing cbca

1875
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:59,560
it's producing everything else except

1876
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:02,880
for CBC right it's producing everything

1877
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:05,320
else because the genes are so abundant

1878
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:07,119
everyone independent if you're a hemper

1879
01:22:05,319 --> 01:22:10,238
fiber and grain or independent if you're

1880
01:22:07,119 --> 01:22:13,039
a marijuana type or if you're a cbda

1881
01:22:10,238 --> 01:22:16,279
type of plant independent of that

1882
01:22:13,039 --> 01:22:18,800
everyone has a cbca gene what are those

1883
01:22:16,279 --> 01:22:21,800
guys doing they're partying what are

1884
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:24,000
they doing yeah that's so fascinating

1885
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:25,960
and are there other cannaboids that

1886
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,119
exist in cannabis that like we may not

1887
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:29,880
even know about that may be more

1888
01:22:28,119 --> 01:22:31,920
important in the high factor than we

1889
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:35,560
even know or are anything things that

1890
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:38,079
exist like that I don't know but you

1891
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:39,840
know the Tarpin are produced in very low

1892
01:22:38,079 --> 01:22:43,920
quantities so you have for example that

1893
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:46,679
for THC you have 28% by dry weight or

1894
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:49,960
even 30 even 35% by dry weight while you

1895
01:22:46,679 --> 01:22:55,399
see for example for mercy and it's like

1896
01:22:49,960 --> 01:22:57,119
5% or 3% but it still smells yeah yeah

1897
01:22:55,399 --> 01:22:59,638
and there's some things that are not

1898
01:22:57,119 --> 01:23:01,960
even so the that that are even the part

1899
01:22:59,639 --> 01:23:04,480
per million so they're really tiny

1900
01:23:01,960 --> 01:23:09,319
amount whether or not that affects your

1901
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:11,559
high I don't know yeah right but I think

1902
01:23:09,319 --> 01:23:13,920
that something that we do desperately

1903
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:15,120
need to do in the hannabis industry is

1904
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:18,560
to

1905
01:23:15,119 --> 01:23:21,639
do controlled studies without you

1906
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:23,760
knowing what you're consuming yes so we

1907
01:23:21,639 --> 01:23:26,480
have this joint we know the exact

1908
01:23:23,760 --> 01:23:28,520
chemotype of this joint or or whatever

1909
01:23:26,479 --> 01:23:31,959
chemotype we know because we're

1910
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:35,040
discovering like now this thcp

1911
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:37,359
like became a thing so maybe there's

1912
01:23:35,039 --> 01:23:40,719
another cannaboid that we had not

1913
01:23:37,359 --> 01:23:44,198
calibrated the lplc whatever chemist do

1914
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:48,399
not hate me for the maybe what I just

1915
01:23:44,198 --> 01:23:50,238
said was completely stupid but um but

1916
01:23:48,399 --> 01:23:52,599
okay we measure the chemotype and then

1917
01:23:50,238 --> 01:23:55,158
we give it to you and then Matthew smoke

1918
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:57,560
this and tell me what you feel

1919
01:23:55,158 --> 01:24:01,000
questionnaire maybe if we can we can

1920
01:23:57,560 --> 01:24:03,679
take blood before and afterwards right

1921
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:06,039
yeah and then blinded study that you

1922
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:08,679
don't know what you're getting and then

1923
01:24:06,039 --> 01:24:10,519
we can do it with however many hundreds

1924
01:24:08,679 --> 01:24:12,679
of people

1925
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:15,760
different different joints with

1926
01:24:12,679 --> 01:24:17,199
different a chemotypes yeah and that

1927
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:19,039
people do not know what they're getting

1928
01:24:17,198 --> 01:24:21,638
and then they tell us okay this is what

1929
01:24:19,039 --> 01:24:25,198
I felt on Friday I exercised I ate I

1930
01:24:21,639 --> 01:24:27,639
slept I am depressed right we know that

1931
01:24:25,198 --> 01:24:31,000
for alcohol if you're depressed or if

1932
01:24:27,639 --> 01:24:33,400
you're um if you ate we know that

1933
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:36,279
there's a difference in in how drunk you

1934
01:24:33,399 --> 01:24:37,638
get oh sure women and men we know that

1935
01:24:36,279 --> 01:24:40,960
there's a difference in alcohol in

1936
01:24:37,639 --> 01:24:43,039
cannabis we we do have some suggestions

1937
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:46,079
that there are differences between women

1938
01:24:43,039 --> 01:24:49,238
and men but we don't know if you ate if

1939
01:24:46,079 --> 01:24:51,000
you slept if you exercised am I GNA feel

1940
01:24:49,238 --> 01:24:53,158
the same with this joint today than on

1941
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:55,840
Friday I don't know yeah there's no way

1942
01:24:53,158 --> 01:24:58,519
to quantify it yet yeah so we need those

1943
01:24:55,840 --> 01:25:00,800
studies I think and and with with the

1944
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:02,560
laws in place currently we we cannot do

1945
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:05,440
those studies

1946
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:07,880
federally no federally we cannot but we

1947
01:25:05,439 --> 01:25:11,439
could do them in in in States in in

1948
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:14,000
regulated States um and in Colorado one

1949
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:16,238
of my um I have some papers with her

1950
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:19,960
cinnamon Bidwell collaborator of mine

1951
01:25:16,238 --> 01:25:22,039
she has the canavan and in the canavan

1952
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:24,439
she goes to places because she cannot

1953
01:25:22,039 --> 01:25:27,960
bring people on campus and have them go

1954
01:25:24,439 --> 01:25:30,559
get high so she goes in the van and then

1955
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:31,920
she takes a blood before you consume it

1956
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:34,239
and after you consume it and what she

1957
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:37,118
tells you is just consume it as you were

1958
01:25:34,238 --> 01:25:39,198
normally going to consume cannabis sure

1959
01:25:37,118 --> 01:25:41,799
and and then she takes that and she does

1960
01:25:39,198 --> 01:25:44,519
some sort of cognitive tests can you rem

1961
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:46,440
so we know that they're shortterm memory

1962
01:25:44,520 --> 01:25:50,040
so she does you know remember like try

1963
01:25:46,439 --> 01:25:52,158
to memorize this um grocery store list

1964
01:25:50,039 --> 01:25:54,639
yeah um and things like that before and

1965
01:25:52,158 --> 01:25:56,599
after so so she has done something like

1966
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:59,840
that but we don't know with particular

1967
01:25:56,600 --> 01:26:01,440
chemotypes right yeah and then again for

1968
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:04,560
you to measure those chemotypes you have

1969
01:26:01,439 --> 01:26:07,519
to go to a reputable lab there are some

1970
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:09,239
Labs that are not that reputable yeah

1971
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:14,080
yeah for sure but there are some that

1972
01:26:09,238 --> 01:26:16,678
are yeah so so those particular

1973
01:26:14,079 --> 01:26:18,158
Labs yeah that's that's that's

1974
01:26:16,679 --> 01:26:20,118
fascinating I think I think you wouldn't

1975
01:26:18,158 --> 01:26:22,158
find a shortage of people wanting to do

1976
01:26:20,118 --> 01:26:24,920
that like willing to give their blood to

1977
01:26:22,158 --> 01:26:26,679
just go get baked and give results i' be

1978
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:30,079
down I mean that sounds like

1979
01:26:26,679 --> 01:26:33,440
fun I think science it it would be super

1980
01:26:30,079 --> 01:26:36,319
fun but from the researchers perspective

1981
01:26:33,439 --> 01:26:38,238
you do need a lot of paperwork in order

1982
01:26:36,319 --> 01:26:40,279
to be able to do that even to give you a

1983
01:26:38,238 --> 01:26:42,319
questionnaire like even if I'm not

1984
01:26:40,279 --> 01:26:44,759
touching you just to give you the

1985
01:26:42,319 --> 01:26:46,840
questionnaire there's a huge amount of

1986
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:48,960
paperwork and stuff that you have to do

1987
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:50,600
yeah I can't imagine taking blood like

1988
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:52,600
all that stuff would be so much

1989
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:54,800
paperwork to even be able to do that on

1990
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:56,440
people yeah and then why are you doing

1991
01:26:54,800 --> 01:27:00,360

2029
01:28:42,158 --> 01:28:50,039

2041
01:29:16,359 --> 01:29:22,799
how can you not be political in this

2042
01:29:20,118 --> 01:29:26,039
climate right now yeah um my family was

2043
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:29,400
United Farm Workers so I'm hardcore like

2044
01:29:26,039 --> 01:29:31,840
you know Union you know social programs

2045
01:29:29,399 --> 01:29:34,519
I'm all about it is that why is called

2046
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:36,319
The Syndicate yeah it is um the the

2047
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:38,719
overall goal with the Syndicate when I

2048
01:29:36,319 --> 01:29:41,198
originally came up with it and it's like

2049
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:43,158
a pie in the sky idea where I want to

2050
01:29:41,198 --> 01:29:45,960
take it but a lot of these people that

2051
01:29:43,158 --> 01:29:47,799
came before me don't like they we even

2052
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:49,359
me we don't have retirement programs for

2053
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:51,039
any of them and I've seen a lot of

2054
01:29:49,359 --> 01:29:53,238
people that laid the foundation for this

2055
01:29:51,039 --> 01:29:54,359
industry just be run over and they're

2056
01:29:53,238 --> 01:29:56,559
having the hardest time they're having

2057
01:29:54,359 --> 01:29:59,158
to find new jobs and these are people

2058
01:29:56,560 --> 01:30:01,520
who deserve recognition and and have

2059
01:29:59,158 --> 01:30:02,960
earned their place in our society and

2060
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:05,320
and I'd love to make it some kind of

2061
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:07,520
Union kind of deal where it's there's

2062
01:30:05,319 --> 01:30:08,599
retirement plans medical plans you know

2063
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:10,960
things like that for people in the

2064
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:12,600
future but it's just a pie in this Sky

2065
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:15,319
idea because I don't know a lot of

2066
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:18,000
people that would be into putting their

2067
01:30:15,319 --> 01:30:22,000
hard time work and money into it but

2068
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:24,840
I'll keep putting my work in you know I

2069
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:29,679
I think so did you see

2070
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:33,480
that there was a video that came out

2071
01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:38,199
recently regarding the Cannabis industry

2072
01:30:33,479 --> 01:30:41,039
in California I don't know saw it

2073
01:30:38,198 --> 01:30:46,238
whether you watched it let me let me see

2074
01:30:41,039 --> 01:30:49,880
if I if I find it but um but uh they

2075
01:30:46,238 --> 01:30:55,718
they um they have Steve

2076
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:58,560
D'Angelo um and um I think it's super

2077
01:30:55,719 --> 01:31:02,760
interesting because I think that

2078
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:05,159
California kind of did it wrong you know

2079
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:07,880
yeah yeah

2080
01:31:05,158 --> 01:31:10,198
yeah yeah Steve D'Angelo is nobody's

2081
01:31:07,880 --> 01:31:12,960
like at least from our point of view

2082
01:31:10,198 --> 01:31:14,759
like the the hardcore people like Steve

2083
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:16,118
D'Angelo has never been someone that any

2084
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:18,440
of us are like yeah I want to see that

2085
01:31:16,118 --> 01:31:20,559
dude do well because he was the first to

2086
01:31:18,439 --> 01:31:22,039
bring in corporate push it and when he

2087
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:23,600
found out he wasn't Rich enough to play

2088
01:31:22,039 --> 01:31:26,158
ball with the big boys recently he's

2089
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:27,239
like yeah I shouldn't have done prop 64

2090
01:31:26,158 --> 01:31:29,158
and it's like well then why'd you push

2091
01:31:27,238 --> 01:31:31,039
it bro you ruined a lot of people's

2092
01:31:29,158 --> 01:31:35,118
lives in my opinion my friends are now

2093
01:31:31,039 --> 01:31:38,238
out of out of work and Hur but but I

2094
01:31:35,118 --> 01:31:42,479
think you should watch that that YouTube

2095
01:31:38,238 --> 01:31:45,919
video because he does talk about that

2096
01:31:42,479 --> 01:31:50,359
you know like he does talk about prop

2097
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:54,520
64 and and how California kind of did it

2098
01:31:50,359 --> 01:32:00,079
wrong in that in that way right um

2099
01:31:54,520 --> 01:32:04,159
let me see if I find it um it's such a

2100
01:32:00,079 --> 01:32:07,639
good is that my kid watches videos also

2101
01:32:04,158 --> 01:32:09,599
in my thing so then I get you know like

2102
01:32:07,639 --> 01:32:12,118
I know what you mean yeah your history

2103
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:15,360
gets all twisted up yeah my history it's

2104
01:32:12,118 --> 01:32:18,079
all all like my kid watching a stupid

2105
01:32:15,359 --> 01:32:20,639
toy video I think I think the hardest

2106
01:32:18,079 --> 01:32:22,679
part for me with Steve D'Angelo is that

2107
01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:24,480
we were the group like our friends were

2108
01:32:22,679 --> 01:32:26,719
the group that was pushing back against

2109
01:32:24,479 --> 01:32:28,198
him when we were saying hey guy this

2110
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:30,439
isn't going to work it's going to screw

2111
01:32:28,198 --> 01:32:33,039
a lot of people and he put so much money

2112
01:32:30,439 --> 01:32:36,960
and hate behind it to push back against

2113
01:32:33,039 --> 01:32:39,439
us and at the end he realized oh I don't

2114
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:41,198
get to play ball I I'm not I'm not a

2115
01:32:39,439 --> 01:32:43,039
multi trillionaire like these people

2116
01:32:41,198 --> 01:32:45,399
that are going to own cannabis this

2117
01:32:43,039 --> 01:32:47,479
isn't fair and I don't like what I see

2118
01:32:45,399 --> 01:32:49,359
but we all saw that long before he did

2119
01:32:47,479 --> 01:32:50,959
and he fought against us so it's like

2120
01:32:49,359 --> 01:32:52,118
yeah we get you don't see it now but if

2121
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:53,560
they would have let you play ball you

2122
01:32:52,118 --> 01:32:55,000
probably would have you know that's the

2123
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:57,360
way I look at it with him very

2124
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:59,238
disingenuous fellow I just you know I've

2125
01:32:57,359 --> 01:33:00,880
never understood really California in

2126
01:32:59,238 --> 01:33:03,439
general because

2127
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:05,199
California is as big as Colombia almost

2128
01:33:03,439 --> 01:33:07,919
in population right California has I

2129
01:33:05,198 --> 01:33:11,158
don't know 45 million people Colombia

2130
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:13,719
has 50 million people so it's an entire

2131
01:33:11,158 --> 01:33:17,198
country um it's

2132
01:33:13,719 --> 01:33:19,359
huge uh it has an ocean it has mountains

2133
01:33:17,198 --> 01:33:21,238
it has a desert I I don't really

2134
01:33:19,359 --> 01:33:24,519
understand why California doesn't secede

2135
01:33:21,238 --> 01:33:26,599
from the US oh all about

2136
01:33:24,520 --> 01:33:30,000
right which it's the fourth largest

2137
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:34,920
economy in the world I think fourth or

2138
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:37,000
sixth but around there right so so the

2139
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:41,920
just the state of

2140
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:43,679
California so I I don't it's it's huge

2141
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:45,679
right what is going on in California

2142
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:47,279
when you talk about St it's it's so

2143
01:33:45,679 --> 01:33:50,639
different from the information that we

2144
01:33:47,279 --> 01:33:52,960
get around here but it is okay so I

2145
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:55,760
found it it is called it's a it's a

2146
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:58,239
Forbes documentary documentary so I'm

2147
01:33:55,760 --> 01:34:02,199
going to put it here in the chat Forbes

2148
01:33:58,238 --> 01:34:05,919
and it's called how America

2149
01:34:02,198 --> 01:34:09,919
botched Canabis

2150
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:12,520
legalization and then gotcha let's see

2151
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:13,840
and it was it was released five days ago

2152
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:17,760
so I watched it this weekend Oh

2153
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:20,079
interesting okay yeah um and I think

2154
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:21,960
that it's an interesting take I don't

2155
01:34:20,079 --> 01:34:26,840
think I think that the documentary

2156
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:28,560
should be how California right because

2157
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:30,760
what's going on in the other states is

2158
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:33,840
completely different yes California is

2159
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:35,880
the biggest Market in the entire us yes

2160
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:37,319
but what's going on here in New York

2161
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:39,440
it's very different from what happened

2162
01:34:37,319 --> 01:34:42,319
in Colorado and it's very different from

2163
01:34:39,439 --> 01:34:44,238
what's going on in California yeah so so

2164
01:34:42,319 --> 01:34:46,880
I think that that we have to keep that

2165
01:34:44,238 --> 01:34:49,359
in mind but I totally recommend this um

2166
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:50,960
documentary when I was looking at like

2167
01:34:49,359 --> 01:34:54,118
early on in California when it was first

2168
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:56,239
going legal with 215 what I saw was like

2169
01:34:54,118 --> 01:34:57,799
stuff in Amsterdam where they had bedon

2170
01:34:56,238 --> 01:34:59,000
like it started out as like you know

2171
01:34:57,800 --> 01:35:00,520
there were there were shops all of a

2172
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:03,039
sudden you couldn't grow now you can't

2173
01:35:00,520 --> 01:35:04,960
sell seeds you can't make seeds but one

2174
01:35:03,039 --> 01:35:06,639
Corporation was able to take it over and

2175
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:08,600
get the the main thing then I saw in

2176
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:10,840
Israel you know like same kind of stuff

2177
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:13,679
happened I saw in Canada started going

2178
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:15,440
that way too and then in California with

2179
01:35:13,679 --> 01:35:17,440
the prop 64 everybody was kind of like

2180
01:35:15,439 --> 01:35:19,439
well it's looking like uh it's going to

2181
01:35:17,439 --> 01:35:21,960
be too expensive for any of the Legacy

2182
01:35:19,439 --> 01:35:24,279
Farmers to own any licenses and we

2183
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:26,118
couldn't even afford to buy equipment to

2184
01:35:24,279 --> 01:35:28,279
surveil ourselves with the cameras let

2185
01:35:26,118 --> 01:35:30,399
alone you know afford to run a business

2186
01:35:28,279 --> 01:35:33,079
and make money off that when the guy

2187
01:35:30,399 --> 01:35:35,519
down the street is is quadrupling the

2188
01:35:33,079 --> 01:35:38,600
production on us and able to charge and

2189
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:40,040
and able to run at a loss for 10 years

2190
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:42,280
whereas we're small farmers we can't run

2191
01:35:40,039 --> 01:35:43,479
in a loss for a year let alone 10 and

2192
01:35:42,279 --> 01:35:45,880
they know that they can wipe out the

2193
01:35:43,479 --> 01:35:49,638
market that way and and and drw everyone

2194
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:52,679
out yes I agree I mean I don't know

2195
01:35:49,639 --> 01:35:54,600
honestly I know I don't know I know that

2196
01:35:52,679 --> 01:35:57,199
Israel is very governmentally controlled

2197
01:35:54,600 --> 01:36:00,760
isn't it yes yes yes as well as the

2198
01:35:57,198 --> 01:36:03,439
Netherlands yes um so I think that here

2199
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:07,079
in the US is different because you can

2200
01:36:03,439 --> 01:36:09,399
get corporations that are multibillion

2201
01:36:07,079 --> 01:36:12,039
dollar corporations where you have you

2202
01:36:09,399 --> 01:36:14,359
know a guy just spend billions of

2203
01:36:12,039 --> 01:36:18,158
dollars in a social media yeah yeah

2204
01:36:14,359 --> 01:36:22,719
right I I think because there is

2205
01:36:18,158 --> 01:36:24,198
no the capitalism here is going to an

2206
01:36:22,719 --> 01:36:28,920
extreme

2207
01:36:24,198 --> 01:36:31,839
yeah uh but I do think that you need

2208
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:35,719
some sort of governmental regulations in

2209
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:38,239
some sense um and I think that the

2210
01:36:35,719 --> 01:36:40,600
problem of California was that there may

2211
01:36:38,238 --> 01:36:43,559
have been too much governmental

2212
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:46,960
regulations yeah and that you're

2213
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:50,840
requiring the legal industry to operate

2214
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:53,960
at a loss compared to the illicit a

2215
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:57,760
market right the illicit Market must not

2216
01:36:53,960 --> 01:37:00,359
but must not test as as thoroughly the

2217
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:03,239
ilicit market does not have to have the

2218
01:37:00,359 --> 01:37:05,759
packaging that the so I think that

2219
01:37:03,238 --> 01:37:07,959
you're operating at a loss be due to

2220
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:09,719
those particular laws and regulations

2221
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:11,560
which is something that New York state

2222
01:37:09,719 --> 01:37:13,639
for example different from Colorado

2223
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:16,039
Colorado is not as regulated as

2224
01:37:13,639 --> 01:37:18,279
California or New York State and now in

2225
01:37:16,039 --> 01:37:22,039
New York state it's kind of like hey do

2226
01:37:18,279 --> 01:37:24,118
not make people test like make him test

2227
01:37:22,039 --> 01:37:25,600
as you would test for a tomato right

2228
01:37:24,118 --> 01:37:28,679
yeah yeah if you're going to consume the

2229
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:31,360
tomato and yeah yeah I went Apple

2230
01:37:28,679 --> 01:37:33,440
peeking three weeks ago two weeks ago

2231
01:37:31,359 --> 01:37:37,000
and I took an apple from the tree and I

2232
01:37:33,439 --> 01:37:39,919
ate it I am fine I am sure that there

2233
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:43,439
were some living organism in that Apple

2234
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:45,440
I am sure what it didn't kill me right

2235
01:37:43,439 --> 01:37:48,319
had I smoked that Apple I think that I

2236
01:37:45,439 --> 01:37:51,158
would still not be dead yeah same thing

2237
01:37:48,319 --> 01:37:54,039
with weed right yeah yeah right yeah I

2238
01:37:51,158 --> 01:37:57,879
totally agree I I just hope that a time

2239
01:37:54,039 --> 01:38:00,399
where anywhere in anywhere that people

2240
01:37:57,880 --> 01:38:01,880
just don't settle for like and I feel

2241
01:38:00,399 --> 01:38:04,439
like that was the attitude with with

2242
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:05,840
prop 64 and 215 for that matter like

2243
01:38:04,439 --> 01:38:07,519
they're finally going to give us a

2244
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:09,400
little bit why don't we just take what

2245
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:12,280
we can get now and maybe fight for more

2246
01:38:09,399 --> 01:38:14,238
later and what I've learned like just in

2247
01:38:12,279 --> 01:38:17,118
all laws is like they don't really give

2248
01:38:14,238 --> 01:38:18,359
you what they aren't willing to lose and

2249
01:38:17,118 --> 01:38:19,960
if they're not willing to lose more than

2250
01:38:18,359 --> 01:38:21,799
that you're never going to get it it's

2251
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:25,198
it's what what benefits whoever is in

2252
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:26,800
power and can pay the pay the piper so

2253
01:38:25,198 --> 01:38:29,919
but I do think that there are some

2254
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:32,560
people that are in powered that are

2255
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:34,960
actually looking for the best for their

2256
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:36,880
people yes I do understand that some

2257
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:38,760
people are in power and it's like I have

2258
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:39,960
the power and I'm the king but I do

2259
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:41,920
actually think that there's some people

2260
01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:43,880
are in power that are kind of like hey

2261
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:47,039
let's build something that's why I think

2262
01:38:43,880 --> 01:38:48,199
elections are so important but I also

2263
01:38:47,039 --> 01:38:50,760
think that many of the laws and

2264
01:38:48,198 --> 01:38:55,319
regulations for example regarding the

2265
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:57,719
0.3% THC like I always why didn't they

2266
01:38:55,319 --> 01:39:01,399
ask me about that regulation which makes

2267
01:38:57,719 --> 01:39:02,639
no sense like who is going to get high

2268
01:39:01,399 --> 01:39:04,359
on a

2269
01:39:02,639 --> 01:39:07,599
0.8

2270
01:39:04,359 --> 01:39:11,399
THC fiber hemp when you go to a

2271
01:39:07,599 --> 01:39:14,239
dispensary and you have a 90 8%

2272
01:39:11,399 --> 01:39:15,879
concentrate it makes no sense at all who

2273
01:39:14,238 --> 01:39:17,638
did who did they consult for these kind

2274
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:20,480
of laws

2275
01:39:17,639 --> 01:39:21,880
yeah do we know who they consulted for

2276
01:39:20,479 --> 01:39:24,198
these kind of

2277
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:25,760
laws that's horrible I mean there's some

2278
01:39:24,198 --> 01:39:27,198
regulations here in New York state that

2279
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:29,719
are kind of like dude you have never

2280
01:39:27,198 --> 01:39:33,000
grown a plant before right like what

2281
01:39:29,719 --> 01:39:36,000
you're limiting the acreage size and how

2282
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:37,760
are you determining so you you have do

2283
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:40,079
you have a house plant do you have a

2284
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:41,920
plant living in your living room there's

2285
01:39:40,079 --> 01:39:45,800
some regulations that are just you know

2286
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:51,399
a guide decided and a lawyer that knew

2287
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:52,960
how to write laws decided yeah it's

2288
01:39:51,399 --> 01:39:54,598
we've got a long way to go but I'm

2289
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:56,359
really excited about the future

2290
01:39:54,599 --> 01:39:58,279
especially as it comes to science with

2291
01:39:56,359 --> 01:40:00,000
breeding because I'm such a I'm such a

2292
01:39:58,279 --> 01:40:02,000
nerd when it comes to breeding like I I

2293
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,679
love the idea whether it's whether it's

2294
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:05,520
through successful or successive

2295
01:40:03,679 --> 01:40:07,440
generations and breeding in a trait or

2296
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:09,920
or whether it's being able to eliminate

2297
01:40:07,439 --> 01:40:12,279
a trait completely that is has no

2298
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:14,480
beneficial anything to what we're doing

2299
01:40:12,279 --> 01:40:16,960
if that helps that helps breeding that

2300
01:40:14,479 --> 01:40:19,079
helps us make our projects with

2301
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:20,840
successive Generations even easier so

2302
01:40:19,079 --> 01:40:22,479
I'm super stoked to see what you do and

2303
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:24,800
I I'd be really excited to work with you

2304
01:40:22,479 --> 01:40:26,439
on any level in that in the future and I

2305
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:27,840
really appreciate you taking your time

2306
01:40:26,439 --> 01:40:31,479
tonight to come and hang out with me in

2307
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:31,480
a conversation I want to have you back

2308
01:40:31,880 --> 01:40:36,719
soon oh thank you thank you yeah I'm

2309
01:40:34,319 --> 01:40:39,920
excited too on because my job in

2310
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:42,359
extension in Cornell is very related to

2311
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:46,000
Farmers I hope that I get to do that

2312
01:40:42,359 --> 01:40:48,399
with on site with with with cannabis

2313
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:51,719
farmers and hemp as well you know for

2314
01:40:48,399 --> 01:40:55,679
grain and and hopefully for grain I hope

2315
01:40:51,719 --> 01:40:57,800
that I get to do that here as well and I

2316
01:40:55,679 --> 01:41:01,480
think that breeding that's going to be

2317
01:40:57,800 --> 01:41:03,039
the key right it's G to be it I think

2318
01:41:01,479 --> 01:41:06,679
well I I'm excited that we're also

2319
01:41:03,039 --> 01:41:12,479
having much for having me

2320
