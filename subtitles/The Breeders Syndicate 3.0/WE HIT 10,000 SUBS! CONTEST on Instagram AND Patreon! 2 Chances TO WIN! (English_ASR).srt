history and breeding science over time

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,560
it's evolved into something bigger

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,920
better and more of a team effort we will

9
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:22,599
be joined by members of the can

10

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,719
the underground We Are The

18
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:45,718
Syndicate what's up everyone we finally

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,480
hit 10,000 subscribers which is massive

20
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:52,079
for a a niche nerdy topic like this like

21
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:55,479
it's wasn't really thought possible by

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,520
anyone let alone me um with that said we

23
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:58,959
want to do a contest for everyone and it

24
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,320
also kind of coincides with our

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,799
Instagram page being totally knocked

26
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,599
down um so in or we decided we would do

27
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,280
like one for Instagram and one

28
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,640
separately for the patreon people and

29
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,159
that one will be a little bit bigger

30
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,118
because it's a paid membership uh first

31
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,040
for Instagram make sure you go follow

32
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:19,040
breeders.

33
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,079
syndicate.com and and how it treats

34
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,280
anything cannabis even history without

35
00:01:27,078 --> 00:01:30,519
any advertising for anything other than

36
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,079

37
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:34,840

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,760
poll from and we're going to randomize

57
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,719

58
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,878

59
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:24,000

60
00:02:21,878 --> 00:02:26,719
bottle of reversal spray which is huge

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
it's a big it's a big price and uh I

62
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:29,280
wanted to make it extra special I'll

63
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,800
probably throw in a little bit more for

64
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,598
the patreon people because they've done

65
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,760
so much to be a part of driving this

66
00:02:32,598 --> 00:02:38,839

68
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,759

69
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:45,439

00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:48,359
do that every three months but it's

71
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:53,479
filled with threee things I'll say you

72
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:55,519
know um yeah so a free pack from me a

from goat farm and uh yeah I'm stoked

75
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,959
for it thank you every everyone for

76
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,879
helping us make the 10K subscribers I do

77
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:08,158
owe a massive debt of gratitude to

78
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:10,199
thousandfold without him one there'd be

79
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:12,318
no show and I've said that before I

80
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:14,439
don't think people get that um I see a

81
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:16,439
lot of comments talking about how you

82
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:18,000
know they prefer one Coast over the

83
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:19,878
other because they got so used to it and

84
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,400
realistically if that was still going on

85
00:03:19,878 --> 00:03:22,919
there wouldn't be a show it just

86
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,840
wouldn't

87
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:29,079
um I didn't have that even mindset to

88
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,400
push to 10K I didn't think it was

89
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,879
possible

90
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,680
um it really wasn't a goal my goal was

91
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,759
just trying to keep myself interested

92
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,599
enough to keep doing the show and for a

93
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:42,759
while I wasn't a long while um so yeah

94
00:03:40,598 --> 00:03:44,560
it's it's it's special to me it's

95
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:47,359
special to him and we hope we can make

96

00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:13,318
revisiting an old episode I was really

104
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:15,878
not super stoked with um not just about

105
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:18,399
how it was produced by myself the actual

106
00:04:15,878 --> 00:04:21,959
content and where it led to some

107
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:24,039
misinformation and we've always said

108
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,360
like if anything changes if anything

109
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,120
comes to light we will update it and we

110
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,240
will make the information correct as

111
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:34,000
correct as we can um that happened and

112
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,160
I'm I'm first and foremost to push for

113
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,600
that just because I'm anal about that

114
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:43,360
kind of stuff so we go into breeding

115
