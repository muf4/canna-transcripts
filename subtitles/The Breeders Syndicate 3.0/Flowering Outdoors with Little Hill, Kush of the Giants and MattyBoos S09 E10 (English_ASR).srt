cannabis Show Breaking Down the myths

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,599
and history in cannabis I'm Matthew seed

4
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:12,439
maker for over a decade and a half and

5
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:15,160
this is my journey into finding my truth

6
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:18,278
in this wild world of cannabis I invite

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:20,600
you to join me and the can Illuminati by

8
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:22,960
strapping into the passenger seat but be

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,560
warned it's not always pretty with the

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,960
invasion of corporate culture into

11
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:28,518
cannabis it's getting even more muddy

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,359
which is why I've made it my mission to

13
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:32,519
have a permanent record before all the

14
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,160
history is lost and buried under a pile

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,359
of

16
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:39,039
cookies we are the traditional Market

17
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:40,600
The Syndicate is a collection of seed

18
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,479
makers that want to push back against

19
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,120
all the smok and mirrors in doing so we

20
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:47,238
will continue to ruffle the feathers of

21
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,839
those who oppose and my personal mission

22
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:52,358
has become much bigger than myself

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,050
welcome to the Cannabis underground this

24
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:58,920
is the

25
00:00:54,049 --> 00:01:01,919
[Music]

26
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,920
revolution

27
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:06,640
welcome to breeder Syndicate I'm Matthew

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,680
here with my co-host thousandfold and

29
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,200
today we're going to be talking about

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,040
outdoor growing from beginning to end

31
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,439
and go ahead

32
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:17,560
thousand yep uh specifically we're going

33
00:01:14,438 --> 00:01:21,959
to be talking about beginning to end of

34
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:24,118
flowering Matt so we welcome back booze

35
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:26,839
cush of the Giants little Hill um each

36
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:29,478
of them have featured before on various

37
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:31,280
respective episodes so I'll try to

38
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:33,959
remember to add links to each of those

39
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,280
in the description but yeah so today we

40
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:38,839
are talking about flowering outdoors and

41
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:41,719
of course we have uh Kush of the Giants

42
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,079
in little Hill um in California and

43
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:46,200
we've got booze actually from Australia

44
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:49,959
so that will be an interesting uh

45
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,478
contrast for one um but otherwise to

46
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:55,319
kick things off I thought we could just

47
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,799
go around and each of you give a brief

48
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:59,158
outline of like what your outdoor

49
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:03,280
growing situation is like uh you know

50
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,560
your respective area um and you know

51
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,920
what you're growing what you've grown

52
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,000
this season I should say um just to

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,120
start things off uh maybe we can start

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,959
with uh little

55
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:18,280
Hill okay great

56
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:20,519
um let's see what I'm growing this

57
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:25,199
season or where I'm growing I'm in

58
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:26,920
southern Trinity uh 3200 FT elevation

59
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:30,518
I'm in a mountain

60
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:32,518
valley um that's kind of a R thing up

61
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:34,360
here it's very mountainous territory and

62
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:38,560
there's not a whole lot of

63
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:42,280
Valley um flat sort of level Valley

64
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:45,519
areas up here so uh I'm kind of Lucky in

65
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:49,158
that aspect

66
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,759
um uh 3200 feet coastal range like deep

67
00:02:49,158 --> 00:02:52,840
deep in the Coastal

68
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:55,679
Range I

69
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:59,959
uh feel like my season's shorter than

70
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:03,000
most because of that um like we we get

71
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:06,000
freezes into June

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,759
sometimes uh we'll definitely start

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,039
freezing at some point in October

74
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:12,560
usually uh hasn't happened yet but we've

75
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:14,079
gotten close um and then that we

76
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,239
actually got some good weather right now

77
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,840
coming up on the forecast but we've

78
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,400
gotten a lot of rain this year so far

79
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,280
more than usual um which has we'll talk

80
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,280
about it but it's definitely had made me

81
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,680
speed things up a little bit um as far

82
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:30,560
as what I'm growing I think we covered a

83
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,080
lot of what I used to

84
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,680
Outdoors um in the last episode that I

85
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:38,640
was on Betsy and heart attack and

86
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,200
pineapple and stuff like that purple

87
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:43,318
wreck

88
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:46,000
um and then I kind of stopped growing

89
00:03:43,318 --> 00:03:47,399
outdoor for a few years as legalization

90
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,840
kind of moved in and I and I

91
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:54,879
transitioned to that um everything I had

92
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,840
was in green houses everything uh I was

93
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:58,959
depping everything basically and then

94
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,959
replanting for a second run usually

95
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,319
under like full-term

96
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,519
Sun um but now this this this past

97
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:08,158
season I've I've got to expand and and

98
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:10,519
the cheapest way to expand is just

99
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:14,438
building some outdoor beds so that's

100
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:17,439
what I did um they're they're only six

101
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:19,599
inches deep um and then the native soil

102
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:23,000
underneath them is all tilled and

103
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,720
amended so maybe I've got 10 inches of

104
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,800
like loose soil between like the native

105
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:30,080
soil on the bottom and potting soil on

106
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,840
top and then of course the potting soils

107
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:35,478
all amended with dry

108
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:36,758
amendments and uh I tried a bunch of

109
00:04:35,478 --> 00:04:38,639
different strains kind of like

110
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:41,840
everything every strain I had on the

111
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,800
farm I kind of gave it a bed just to see

112
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:46,119
what's what because this is all new

113
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,840
genetics for me in in the outdoor

114
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,840
environment in the in the green houses

115
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:52,918
like it's kind of controlled so some

116
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:55,560
things don't matter like finishing time

117
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:58,120
and stuff like that but on outdoor full

118
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,800
term it absolutely matters and what's

119
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,639
going to mold what can withstand the

120
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:05,240
rain what can withstand the cold um what

121
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,120
yields still like this what like what's

122
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:11,759
the final product look like and is it

123
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,800
marketable you know as an outdoor plant

124
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,400
um I

125
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:20,160
also planted very small plants like so

126
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:24,198
each 5 by 96 bed has is is a row of

127
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:27,000
three with like 50 to 55 rows of three

128
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:30,080
so there's like whatever that

129
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,478
is 70 plants in each bed or something

130
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:34,318
like that a give or take like the

131
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:37,959
numbers vary but it's about that so

132
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:41,600
they're only like at most say six foot

133
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:44,799
tall plants um single colas for the most

134
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,080
part uh very tightly T grown in very

135
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,439
tightly um so they're smaller plants

136
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:52,359
they're not Giants um because plant

137
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:54,038
numbers mean nothing at this point with

138
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,120
legalization

139
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:58,599
um uh so strains I'm running I'll just I

140
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,639
can kind of see my garden from the

141
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:05,199
window here

142
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:07,960
um I got some compound genetics uh none

143
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,520
of which I'm that stoked on Jokers

144
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:16,839
grapple pie and carbon

145
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:20,399
fiber um I've got my cut of uh T1000

146
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:23,439
triangle um from CSI uh that I selected

147
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:25,839
several years ago that's just gun killer

148
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:26,959
so far I've got a lot of that in there

149
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:30,119
ice cream

150
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:32,879
cake um papaya bomb

151
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:38,038
an OG Kush S1 from

152
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:45,439
CSI uh two different uh selected phenos

153
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:48,598
of uh 707 Kush and 707 OG from 707

154
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:51,439
Seedbank and I feel like I'm forgetting

155
00:06:48,598 --> 00:06:55,000
something but I can't think of it right

156
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:56,639
now um but so just a huge variety I

157
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,598
don't usually grow that many different

158
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,879
things next year it'll be like three or

159
00:06:58,598 --> 00:07:03,279
four strains in that whole area instead

160
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:06,479
of instead of the mish

161
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:08,519
mash no that's amazing and um you know

162
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:10,959
one of the reasons why I wanted to get

163
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:13,038
three of you specifically the three of

164
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:17,079
you is because each of you are actually

165
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:17,918
growing on um very different scale uh so

166
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:20,959
I think that's going to be really

167
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:23,639
interesting to get to later on and the

168
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:26,878
other reason that um I really wanted the

169
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:30,120
three of you on because each of you has

170
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:32,080
a great Instagram um in all honesty and

171
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,240
each of you are

172
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:36,598
actually in my opinion like really

173
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,319
really good archists and the way you

174
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:42,399
document your grow and all that is like

175
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:44,680
amazing like I love I think both little

176
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:46,719
Hill and booze you guys both do really

177
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,240
nice like running commentaries on what

178
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,759
you're doing like on on like audio and

179
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,800
then Kush does these really cool

180
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:56,639
writeups so anyway that's just kind of

181
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,439
extending the intro a bit but um yeah

182
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,439
thank you so much for that little Hill

183
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:03,719
uh maybe we go to Kush next you know

184
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,399
tell us about your general outdoor

185
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,960
growing situation and you know what

186
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:11,478
you've been growing yeah so for me it's

187
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:14,318
it's real similar to little Hill um just

188
00:08:11,478 --> 00:08:19,158
like opposite County of him across the

189
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:21,240
valley um about 3,400 elevation and uh

190
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:24,038
again similar with I have a little

191
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,038
Valley on the side of the mountain where

192
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:28,478
generally it we don't get a lot of flat

193
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:30,120
ground to grow in so the benefits of

194
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:32,879
that and being right next to a little

195
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,839
creek up in the mountain too um helps a

196
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:39,360
lot with with what I'm growing and my my

197
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:44,200
growing situation now is um you know it

198
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,839
started with wanting uh to get weed

199
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,519
without having to pay for it so when I

200
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:51,000
first started growing that was that was

201
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:53,560
my initial goal and then uh I eventually

202
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,480
got some customers and grew enough and

203
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:59,518
people wanted some so it turned into

204
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,560
growing weight and then around 2008 18

205
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,639
or

206
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:04,559
2019 um people just stopped buying

207
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:07,399
weight so much and so I I just started

208
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:09,439
turning to what I liked and not only

209
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:11,159
what I liked but started popping stuff

210
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,839
that I've never had the chance to grow

211
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:17,559
before and I just wanted to see what

212
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:21,519
what performed well out in my area and

213
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:23,239
uh it it's it's it's been an explorative

214
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,519
Journey since about

215
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:30,000
2018 um mostly popping stuff through CSI

216
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:31,480
and his unreal Vault um you know you

217
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,360
order a little bit of seeds from him and

218
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,920
you end up with more than you can pop

219
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,919
and that's that's kind of what I've been

220
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:41,879
doing now is just just going through old

221
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:43,599
populations of stuff that people talked

222
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:45,000
about in the past stuff that I used to

223
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,560
get but never got a chance to grow

224
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,600
myself and it's um it's been really fun

225
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:55,078
exploring and testing the the limits of

226
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,920
these strains especially in the uh mold

227
00:09:55,078 --> 00:10:00,958
and the mildew and the the late season

228
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:04,039
uh strength of of these these

229
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:08,399
plants and as far as what I'm growing

230
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:09,838
this year um it's the biggest variety of

231
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,639
plants that I've ever grown this year

232
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,720
and it's for more seed more guys from

233
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:16,600
The Syndicate and a wider variety of

234
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:21,720
breeders that I've ever messed with this

235
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:24,720
year um I got Pax atw hybrid that are

236
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:27,160
just absolutely gorgeous pure tealing

237
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,240
with all those berry flavors coming in

238
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:32,319
behind them which is which is really

239
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:34,879
cool for the tealing I like that a lot

240
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,320
um I got that blue resin Kush from Matt

241
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:41,159
going she's a little late but man she

242
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:43,839
smells amazing right now and growing

243
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:48,039
some uh what else are we growing pull up

244
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:50,839
this um oh yeah the sweet 16 hybrids so

245
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:53,199
like I don't know shoot it was late into

246
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:55,000
the season and CSI hit me up he's like

247
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,920
hey man I got some of these seeds we

248
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,839
grow these out for me I was like well

249
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:59,958
it's pretty late man but they look good

250
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,959
and

251
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:03,759
I tried the sweet 16 before so let's

252
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:07,359
give it a try and man I'm just blown

253
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:10,919
away I got six different um sweet 16

254
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:13,000
hybrids and each of them are completely

255
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:15,120
just just wonderful Frosty all the

256
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,600
unique smells T profiles that I've never

257
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,240
encountered before just just strange

258
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,040
stuff like just like the blackberry wine

259
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,919
had had its own uniqueness that you've

260
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:30,120
never never smel before in the the sweet

261
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:32,199
16 um doing some appy stuff from uh high

262
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,320
and Lonesome all the mangoe goodness

263
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,079
that comes from those I've been really

264
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,560
impressed with how those perform

265
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:42,399
Outdoors the structures there the the

266
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:43,759
resins there the outdoor hardiness is

267
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,440
there I'm seeing a lot of the Green

268
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:49,399
Crack influence from the uh Appalachia

269
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,920
that that just holds up those

270
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:53,600
plants um what else are we running this

271
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,958
year oh yeah some of the snitch free

272
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,639
sour d from our buddy Louch and and his

273
00:11:55,958 --> 00:12:02,518
buddy that plant just a a volatile

274
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:03,959
freaking chemical lime smell that that's

275
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:07,480
just beautiful I can't wait for her to

276
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:09,719
finish up and uh see what else we got on

277
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:14,278
Deck I got some of that cream some of

278
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:15,800
the 2016 bag Seed cream that she's uh

279
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:17,759
you know she's getting hit pretty hard

280
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:20,078
by the mold but it makes sense when her

281
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:22,639
buds are freaking the size of softballs

282
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:25,759
you know they look like old Salmon Creek

283
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:29,959
big bud stuff it's insane how big she's

284
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:31,799
getting um yeah other than that

285
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:35,078
not much else that's growing in the

286
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:38,479
garden this year um I got that Isn't She

287
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:41,078
Lovely from uh our buddy anaki genetics

288
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,800
up in Washington that it's a pretty

289
00:12:41,078 --> 00:12:44,919
impressive strain I I wasn't expecting

290
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:49,039
much out of it at first but she really

291
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:51,599
blew me away the uh the mixture of grape

292
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:53,198
and pining which I've always had the two

293
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,879
separated I've never had grape and

294
00:12:53,198 --> 00:12:58,838
pining uh Shar a a a compound before

295
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:01,679
which it's really really taken me back

296
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:04,639
by surprise I like that plant a

297
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:07,239
lot that sounds really interesting yeah

298
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,879
grape and pining together yeah yeah it's

299
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,120
Unique the first time I got my nose and

300
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:12,679
I was like what the that's those are two

301
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,679
two I haven't smelled before together I

302
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:18,239
really like that yeah that's unique very

303
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:19,719
cool that's cool also that you both you

304
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,240
and little Hill seem to be dealing with

305
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,680
more variety this season maybe than than

306
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,360
normal so maybe we'll touch on that

307
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:30,159
again later on right um yeah we can go

308
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,360
to booze so booze obvious in Australia

309
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:35,519
uh different timings um but yeah boo

310
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,120
tell us a bit about your your general

311
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,120
situation growing Outdoors there and

312
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,839
what you've uh this year I'm doing a

313
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,600
little bit of a scale back approach I'm

314
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,880
I'm planning on moving down south in

315
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,278
like five months or so so I didn't want

316
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:49,879
to go away with doing anything too crazy

317
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:51,639
um plan to move is to be able to do a

318
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:53,720
lot larger outdoor pops cuz somewhere

319
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:56,000
where land's a bit cheaper be able to

320
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,720
set up some poly tunnels and um get away

321
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,440
with that but yeah man I've pretty much

322
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,079
always grown Outdoors I only started

323
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,839
cultivating indoors last year with about

324
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:06,719
eight years of Outdoor Experience prior

325
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,120
to that so it's my love man I'm I'm

326
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,240
pretty tall dudes I don't like being

327
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,560
cramped inside a little small tent space

328
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,480

Lemon Thai and then jel onto that so I'm

348
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,440
getting some some really cool plants out

349
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,839
of that that just running clones I've

350
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:06,360
got a Jager S1 from CSI so I ran a pack

351
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,240
out of those last year and this is the

352
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,120
what I kept out of that man it's not the

353
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,600
most potent knock you on your ass thing

354
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,120
but it's flavor is phenomenal for me

355
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,720
it's really medicinal plants it's

356
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,159
helping a lot with nausea and stuff like

357
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,720
that indigestion Etc and just the flavor

358
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:22,679
on it man that like licorice mango

359
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,079
little bit of like rotten garlic sort of

360
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:27,519
smell it's it's really complex super

361
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:30,239
turpy um what else have I got I've

362
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,759
popped some a friend of mine from the uh

363
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,240
the forums back in the day so I didn't

364
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,519
know him there obviously I'm young dude

365
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,039
but from the Mr Nice forums bucket bong

366
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,759
he was a guy on there and I linked up

367
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:40,039
with him uh he got me in touch with a

368
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:43,120
few Aussie breeders who I've got on the

369
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:45,439
seed bank and I got some seeds of uh

370
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,440
Bazooka Joe which is like a face off

371
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:52,000
bubblegum thing cross to MOX which is

372
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:53,959
the malum Oaken nl5 Hayes so I've got

373
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,879
like five of them they're fem seeds so

374
00:15:53,958 --> 00:16:00,439
I've got uh five of them going got some

375
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:01,360
stoned AP from high l which is the gg4

376
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,279
cross to

377
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:07,240
appy uh what else have I got I got some

378
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:10,639
oh and I've just done a whole pack of A5

379
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:12,879
uh Blue Dream cross to A5 bc1 and that's

380
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,318
from doc d so I've got 12 of those so

381
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:16,360
it's as I said a bit of a scaleb

382
00:16:14,318 --> 00:16:19,360
approach usually I like to utilize my

383
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:21,600
long season so where I am I'm in uh

384
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,639
Queensland so pretty similar climate to

385
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,399
I guess parts of Hawaii like I'm fairly

386
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:29,159
Coastal a lot of humidity pretty much

387
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:32,240
just year round uh we have about an hour

388
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:34,919
and a half of Devy in um in daylight uh

389
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,198
Hours come summer so say like 14 and a

390
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:38,639
half in summer 11 and a half in winter

391
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:40,120
so there's a little bit of a variance

392
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,639
but for the most part man you can crop

393
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,919
like all year round like I've got clones

394
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:44,959
out there right now and it's starting to

395
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,519
you know obviously the Daylight's

396
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:49,000
changing daylight hour is getting longer

397
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:51,120
now and nothing's really revegging it'll

398
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,399
probably be able to run its course but

399
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,240
yeah like what little Hill was saying

400
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,120
with the light dep that's what I want to

401
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,639
get into in the future like I'm I'm too

402
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,278
sketched at the moment like [ __ ]

403
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:01,079
getting out there at night and pulling a

404
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:02,879
top like even when I was doing like

405
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:04,720
supplemental light in the greenhouse

406
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:07,000
it's just sketchy man [ __ ] neighbors

407
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,600
and [ __ ] I got like no fences um but

408
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,959
yeah one day like once I get my my

409
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:11,838
property what I'm aiming at down south

410
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:14,000
that's what I want to get into doing

411
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:15,558
full season and light dep because it's

412
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,880
not really nice flowering [ __ ] out in

413
00:17:15,558 --> 00:17:18,838
summer like unless I'm going to be doing

414
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,799
like some Colombians or like some of

415
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:22,838
this like Wally Wally duck gear or white

416
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:25,119
buffalo um flowering out like some

417
00:17:22,838 --> 00:17:27,599
indicas in s it's just [ __ ] mold man

418
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:29,519
mold City a lot of the time so I like to

419
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,719
get a run done in

420
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:33,599
um yes man so that's yeah mostly what

421
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,200
I'm I'm doing this year outside and my

422
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:39,319
little

423
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,600
situation nice man thank you um yeah

424
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:43,240
definitely we're definitely going to be

425
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:46,639
talking about mold today I'll say that

426
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:49,679
um but yeah thank you everyone for this

427
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,679
little intro little Icebreaker I thought

428
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:55,559
now we could kind of pivot towards the

429
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:57,320
topic and for me uh this episode like

430
00:17:55,558 --> 00:17:58,960
I'll be pretty light touch I kind of

431
00:17:57,319 --> 00:18:00,839
want to get you guys started but you

432
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,798
know I think feel free to start asking

433
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:07,240
each other questions as well but I'll P

434
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:09,000
you along uh so again today we're

435
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,759
talking about transitioning to flower

436
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,679
and and and really all of flowering uh

437
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:17,400
so maybe if we think about it from like

438
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,759
a chronological point of view so you

439
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,720
know you're at the end of veg you're

440
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:24,319
aware that like things are about to

441
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:27,240
season about to turn um where does your

442
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:28,918
mind go first in terms of like what

443
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,279
you're concerned about what you might

444
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:33,120
need to prepare you know at this like

445
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:35,839
late maybe at the point of like late veg

446
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:40,519
early stretch um can go back to little

447
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:43,879
Hill de side us off so that's like into

448
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:47,759
July moving into August your your plants

449
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:49,520
have been out for a month or two um by

450
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:54,319
that point you know if you're if you're

451
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:59,519
planning like early June give or take

452
00:18:54,319 --> 00:19:01,158
um so I mean just the way I grow

453
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:04,319
I don't really think too much about

454
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:06,000
nutrition because it's all in the soil

455
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,158
that I mixed in in the

456
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,400
spring um at least I shouldn't have to

457
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:13,360
think about nutrition um if something's

458
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:18,400
out of whack or something in in which

459
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:21,240
case yeah but um before that stretch

460
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,960
happens um if you're using trellis

461
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:27,000
netting for support um you got you got

462
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,759
to get it on early so that the plants

463
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,759
can kind of grow through

464
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:34,599
it you know as they begin to really I

465
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:37,558
mean they just explode in August between

466
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:39,879
you know August 1st and August 31st like

467
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:41,558
the amount of growth you get is is is

468
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:45,200
it's the most growth you're going to see

469
00:19:41,558 --> 00:19:47,079
in the whole season so um you got to

470
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,000
have your support ready so the plant can

471
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:49,759
grow through it you can't do it after

472
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,519
the

473
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:54,480
fact

474
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:56,319
um I mean or you're going to break stems

475
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,440
and it's just a hassle it takes

476
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:59,918
forever um and that and that goes for

477
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:03,558
any type of support whether it's like a

478
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:05,520
fence a fence or something a cage um or

479
00:20:03,558 --> 00:20:07,038
trellis netting or or whatever it's

480
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:09,558
going to be bamboo

481
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:11,319
steaks um I'd say that's the that's the

482
00:20:09,558 --> 00:20:12,759
one thing you need to you need to get on

483
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:15,119
if you haven't done it

484
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:17,919
already

485
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:20,558
um other than that

486
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:23,120
like if you want to boost them with

487
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:25,798
nutrients and and capture as much growth

488
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:29,279
as you can you can maybe supplement with

489
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:31,558
a little extra uh nit Esten to really

490
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:33,519
capture all that stretch and get all

491
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:36,000
that size you want to get on them

492
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:40,158
they'll eat it up um if you give it to

493
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,359
them and then at some point like back

494
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,799
off and and and and give them maybe a

495
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:49,000
boost of phosphorus towards the end of

496
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:51,839
August um I'm I'm I'm a big proponent of

497
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,960
giving if if your liquid feeding is is

498
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:58,480
high phosphorus early early on in flour

499
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:01,000
if not before right before flour and

500
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,919
then and then backing off and and

501
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,880
transitioning to something higher in

502
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:09,000
potassium um middle middle of

503
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:12,799
flour um just from everything I've

504
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:16,519
learned and been told and seen that's

505
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:19,200
that's how that's how you crank them uh

506
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:21,519
but many years I I won't feed anything

507
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,440
and I'll just adjust my soil mixes the

508
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:24,278
next year if I feel it needs a a

509
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,600
different

510
00:21:24,278 --> 00:21:28,720
mixture um everything's in the soil and

511
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:30,359
I just try to make it available te's and

512
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,159
whatnot but

513
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:36,599
uh I mean yeah that's that's August the

514
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:39,159
days are super hot

515
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:41,839
um you know making sure they're getting

516
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:46,679
watered they're they're going to be at

517
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:49,399
Peak water needs at that point um I'm

518
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:51,440
sure for one thing I did want to ask you

519
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,400
and this is kind of like even from your

520
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,640
episode with mat that I was like really

521
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:58,080
curious about what is like a typical day

522
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,640
for you um like you know what time do

523
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:02,599
you get up and like you know what is the

524
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:06,960
shape of a day and

525
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:09,599
is but yeah I mean in August like we're

526
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:13,720
talking outdoor but like I've got dep

527
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:15,759
green houses being harvested so um

528
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:18,880
usually maybe Harvest we like in the

529
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:21,759
middle of AEP Harvest um early early

530
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:25,000
August or or or at the tail end of it

531
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:29,000
maybe um so like if we're still pulling

532
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:33,798
tarps um it's day starts at 7 with ping

533
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,599
tarps um 700 a.m. and uh that's a great

534
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:38,639
time to start working because it's nice

535
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:40,399
and cool outside and so unless we're

536
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:46,000
doing like harvesting which might happen

537
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:47,320
all day um we we we work from like s to

538
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,440
to

539
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:52,599
lunchtime and you know we'll we'll get

540
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:56,000
in a good chunk of work in in the so

541
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:58,158
those morning hours and then um quit

542
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,679
quit at lunch take a long lunch just

543
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,000
take a break in the middle of the day

544
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,640
because unless there's stuff that

545
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,720
absolutely needs to happen or it can

546
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:08,278
happen indoors like it's just it's just

547
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,919
so hot that like you're just going to be

548
00:23:08,278 --> 00:23:12,400
spinning your wheels and it's hard to do

549
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,919
that every day to to work through

550
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,440
through midday what do you do on that

551
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:20,440
lunch break do you have a nap or

552
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:22,720
like if I need a nap I'll take a nap um

553
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:26,880
uh do something inside like with

554
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:29,400
legalization I have [ __ ] to do on the

555
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,080
computer

556
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:34,038
um you know sometimes people run to the

557
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:35,798
river and and go and just go to the

558
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:39,200
river for three four hours in the middle

559
00:23:35,798 --> 00:23:40,480
of the day which is great um it's really

560
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,360
refreshing

561
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,759
too

562
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:49,519
uh I mean just regular household chores

563
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:51,640
like doing laundry and [ __ ] like that

564
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:53,879
cleaning up

565
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:55,278
um like it's it's a good time in the

566
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,760
middle of the day to like take care of

567
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:59,960
your own personal

568
00:23:56,759 --> 00:24:02,879
stuff um um besides like eating or

569
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:05,640
something and and uh you know you want

570
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,240
to be inside or in the shade and and

571
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:10,200
like you know if we have to work through

572
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:12,240
the heat we will but um if you don't

573
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,080
have to and you can come back at like 3

574
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,679
or 4 o'clock and work for another three

575
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:20,000
hours or whatever I mean I think I just

576
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:23,240
think it's way more efficient

577
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,919
um to you know for it's a marathon it's

578
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:29,240
not it's not a Sprint so you got to like

579
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:31,720
not wear yourself out and yeah keep it

580
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,240
sustainable right so you know sometimes

581
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,440
there's indoor maybe you got bucking to

582
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:38,120
do inside and that's that's all air

583
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:41,038
conditions so so it's not as bad but uh

584
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:45,398
or or whatever the case may be you know

585
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:48,879
but uh um I would say that's sort of a

586
00:24:45,398 --> 00:24:51,038
typical day now on a you know if it's a

587
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,720
harvest day you know we'll just we'll

588
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:56,240
probably work and and maybe just take an

589
00:24:53,720 --> 00:25:00,319
hour lunch and just work through it just

590
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:02,480
to get it done um it just depends on

591
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:05,278
kind of what's going on if there is any

592
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:09,240
need to rush or anything like that or or

593
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:11,759
whatever the case may be but you know um

594
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:14,120
a lot of days I got to leave the farm

595
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:16,798
and go to town and do Logistics and get

596
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:20,319
supplies and I'm so far out that that

597
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:22,398
takes all day um to do that and other

598
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:26,960
times like maybe I'm running product to

599
00:25:22,398 --> 00:25:30,479
town to distribution or or picking up or

600
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:33,919
or whatever the case may be so

601
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:38,440
um you know it could it it it varies a

602
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:40,120
lot and other days is just uh like do a

603
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,840
morning walkthrough which is my favorite

604
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:44,558
thing to do and figure out like your

605
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:46,759
priorities for the day like is there a

606
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:50,759
big transplanting that needs to be

607
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:52,759
done um is there anything that need like

608
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:54,839
is immediate need like does Something In

609
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:56,000
The Water System need to get fixed you

610
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:58,359
know or plants aren't going to get

611
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,159
watered that would be like a higher

612
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:00,839
priority thing that needs to get fixed

613
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,320
right

614
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:05,158
away um but yeah I mean it's it's

615
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:07,759
farming so like I could be a plumber one

616
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:10,080
day in electrician the next day and you

617
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:12,759
know one day I might actually get to

618
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:15,879
like tend to my plants you know it's

619
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:19,558
it's always kind of like what needs to

620
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:21,720
happen first you know and then like if

621
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:24,480
there's nothing else like crazy going on

622
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,798
or nothing broke then you can actually

623
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,319
like tend to your plants and and and do

624
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:31,519
that that sort of stff stuff no that's

625
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:33,839
really cool I'm glad to hear about this

626
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:35,759
because I think sometimes we get into

627
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:38,599
these like uh you know more technical

628
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:41,278
discussions and it's easy to lose sight

629
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:43,439
of uh the more human side of it you know

630
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:44,839
what it's like to work on this stuff

631
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,600
throughout the day and like what it's

632
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:51,278
like to deal with human stuff life stuff

633
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:53,439
alongside it all um yeah so sorry not

634
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:55,240
I'm going off my own script really but I

635
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,360
I did that was that was cool to hear

636
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:00,960
about um kach how about you man like

637
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:04,918
where do your thoughts go when I say

638
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,720
transition to flower um you know just

639
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:08,360
initially and then maybe you could tell

640
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,960
us a bit about what a typical day looks

641
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:14,918
like for you too yeah yeah yeah so my

642
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:17,038
thoughts are when I so August 1st

643
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:20,159
generally everybody's thinking about you

644
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:23,038
know stretch is either in full swing or

645
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:25,320
your plants are are starting to push uh

646
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:28,640
push stretch you can see them see him

647
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:30,398
doing that and for me it's uh the first

648
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:34,120
thing I'm looking at is do I put up a

649
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:36,918
second cage um I always internal cage my

650
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:40,439
plants because if I don't um with like

651
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:43,679
two or 4 inch um gauge fencing with with

652
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:46,360
big big squares in it um and if I don't

653
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,120
my plants get eaten alive by a deer they

654
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:51,240
they will get chomped all the way down

655
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:53,479
to the stock and um so so when I'm

656
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,159
looking at that stretch phase about to

657
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:58,319
happen I'm looking at the plants that

658
00:27:55,159 --> 00:28:00,720
are going to grow out and wider than

659
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:03,879
those 65 gallon pots if they're going to

660
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:06,600
need that external arm structure because

661
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:09,679
their natural inclin is going to be to

662
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:12,519
go out and up and having that secondary

663
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:14,320
cage out for the plants that don't have

664
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:16,880
their own Vigor to hold up their weight

665
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:19,960
at the end of the season that cage makes

666
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:22,039
things so much easier um and and there

667
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:24,240
are some Tail taale Signs in in

668
00:28:22,038 --> 00:28:26,759
structure and in Branch Vigor that you

669
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:30,640
can tell if a plant is going to need

670
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:34,200
that that secondary set of support um

671
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:36,320
and once uh once stretch is in and it's

672
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:39,840
either going into one or two of the

673
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:42,439
cages my main goal is training and

674
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:44,519
personally what I like to do is uh the

675
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:47,320
branches natural in cinity will be to

676
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:49,759
pick a square of the cage to go through

677
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:52,720
and what I'll do is I'll work it either

678
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:55,000
one or two rungs lower than the hole

679
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,440
that that Branch wants to stick out of

680
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,159
and that that keeps everything down and

681
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:03,120
separated and allows for more

682
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:06,200
breathability and with that I do get a

683
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:08,879
little bit of rub the I I deal with 20

684
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,558
to 30 m hour winds on a on a weekly

685
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,399
basis at least once a week I get an

686
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:16,398
updraft up the mountain and so so with

687
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:19,119
the cages there's some downsides you get

688
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:22,639
a little bit of rubbage and anytime you

689
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:24,398
have necrotic or dead material it could

690
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:28,480
promote mold under the right right

691
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:30,359
conditions so um the cage is it's a it's

692
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,839
a musthave for me I've never tried the

693
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:35,119
trestling I've just I've been complacent

694
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:37,278
with what's worked for me in the past um

695
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:40,359
and yeah right after stretch I'm not

696
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:43,558
thinking about food um I'm practically

697
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:47,439
Just Add Water my soil has all my pre-

698
00:29:43,558 --> 00:29:49,879
amendments and if I if I see the ladies

699
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:53,880
asking for a little more nitrogen I just

700
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:55,440
I brew a tea and I I I reactivate what's

701
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,840
in the soil and make it more readily

702
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:01,080
available for them um so so

703
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:03,158
transitionally for me I'm not thinking

704
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:05,599
about anything different with food I'm

705
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:08,440
still just I'm still just adding water

706
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:12,558
and and playing playing water truck for

707
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:15,558
the plants um I think right around that

708
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:18,678
time I'm also and you guys have seen

709
00:30:15,558 --> 00:30:22,678
this if you you check out my Ig is I'm

710
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:26,320
balancing my uh my cropping method

711
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:28,600
between rocks and hay and trying to get

712
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:31,158
a decent medium to where the plants are

713
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:33,240
drinking the so the water out of the

714
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:36,919
pots at at a at a rate where they're not

715
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:39,159
being evaporated out of it and usually

716
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:40,720
end end of July through August and the

717
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:43,559
start of September is when my plants are

718
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:46,919
drinking the most I gotta if I don't get

719
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:48,558
out there and water them before like I

720
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:50,200
don't know like 9 or 10 a.m. they're

721
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:51,798
gonna I'm going to notice a little bit

722
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,000
of droop I'm going to notice them saying

723
00:30:51,798 --> 00:30:57,079
hey man I'm I'm [ __ ] thirsty you know

724
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,440
where's where's my water at um so and

725
00:30:57,079 --> 00:31:03,240
and that changes drastically too as we

726
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:05,639
as we move on further into flower to

727
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:08,038
where I mean I I'll have plants that

728
00:31:05,638 --> 00:31:09,918
won't drink for three to five days or if

729
00:31:08,038 --> 00:31:13,558
we have a heavy rainstorm it it feels

730
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:15,840
like even longer than that sometimes um

731
00:31:13,558 --> 00:31:17,319
yeah so I'm I'm paying right after

732
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:19,678
stretch is happening I'm paying

733
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:22,200
attention to the water retention how

734
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,919
much the plants are drinking um because

735
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:28,440
I I hand water everything each each each

736
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:30,799
pot is is hand watered with the hose um

737
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:34,440
and I I adjust a little bit here and

738
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:34,440
there to what to what everybody's asking

739
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:41,120
for nice yeah um in terms of like a

740
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:45,000
typical day for you what does that look

741
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:47,439
like yeah um early morning um it's two

742
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,240
it's a it's a two-day visit um I don't

743
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:53,360
grow at where I live I I have to drive

744
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:55,960
to the property where I grow um I have a

745
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:58,398
separate piece of property for it it was

746
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:00,600
tedious at first but the more I the more

747
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:03,398
I weigh the benefits of it I actually I

748
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:06,319
actually prefer doing it this way um and

749
00:32:03,398 --> 00:32:09,278
my indoor stuff I do at my house but uh

750
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:11,759
it um it's it's one visit in the morning

751
00:32:09,278 --> 00:32:13,119
and sometimes like uh when I know that

752
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:16,119
there's work that needs to be done I'll

753
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:18,918
do a visit in the evening usually two to

754
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:22,119
two three four hour visits in the garden

755
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:24,639
um spent time just you know it just just

756
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:26,798
like little Hill said um it's it's very

757
00:32:24,638 --> 00:32:29,119
subjective when I walk when I when I

758
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:31,359
take that quarter mile walk and not

759
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:33,119
quarter mile it's like eighth of a mile

760
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:35,519
walk down through the valley and into my

761
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:36,719
little jungle the first thing I do is I

762
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,399
look at the plants and say all right who

763
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,960
needs help who needs what you know it's

764
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:42,278
it's a general assessment it's an

765
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:44,360
open-ended question every time I walk

766
00:32:42,278 --> 00:32:45,519
into my little my little patch down in

767
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:49,759
the

768
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:52,359
valley I like that image a lot yeah walk

769
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:54,558
through the into the valley yeah yeah I

770
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:57,439
I could take the quad down sometimes but

771
00:32:54,558 --> 00:33:00,480
like I like walking it it's uh it's kind

772
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,120
of like a intuition from hunting my

773
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,679
whole life like looking at track and

774
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:05,638
seeing what's been walking through what

775
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:09,000
deer what bear have been coming through

776
00:33:05,638 --> 00:33:12,199
like getting boots on the ground is yeah

777
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,839
I like it's like yeah it's like a ritual

778
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:17,759
yeah yeah absolutely very very

779
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:19,678
ritualistic very very uh meditative each

780
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:21,359
morning walking down not just spending

781
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:25,120
time with the plants but the journey

782
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:28,319
that it takes to get to him it's uh yeah

783
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:29,678
it's a little bit of a remote hike

784
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:32,960
no that's really cool thank you for

785
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:35,480
sharing um NY

786
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,399
booze yeah I get jealous as [ __ ] looking

787
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:40,120
cush's

788
00:33:37,398 --> 00:33:42,158
feed man like this path and it looks

789
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:43,918
like there's a river and [ __ ] Serene I

790
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,399
got like three steps out my back door to

791
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:49,159
the shitty little plastic

792
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:51,319
greenout sitation like I'm going to get

793
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:54,639
into my current situation not not what's

794
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:55,798
ideal for me because obviously like my

795
00:33:54,638 --> 00:33:57,558
biggest concern right now is just

796
00:33:55,798 --> 00:34:00,079
running numbers and looking for for

797
00:33:57,558 --> 00:34:01,918
decent clones so I'm cropping is just

798
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:03,759
whatever like I've got a daytime job

799
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,240
like ideally one day I'd like to be able

800
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:09,639
to get into cultivating whatever but you

801
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,918
know legali is the way they are Etc um

802
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:14,599
so yeah like I grow everything in

803
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:16,158
[ __ ] 10 or 15 gallons or maybe even

804
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:18,079
fives if I'm trying to like cram a few

805
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:20,240
extra plant in there so I'll start

806
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,679
everything off in small pots um almost

807
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:24,118
let them get rootbound a little bit with

808
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,760
the more sativa stuff and then just

809
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:27,960
transplant them into like a two gallon

810
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,200
to start off with just until I can see

811
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,720
sex cuz you know I can't really be

812
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:33,598
putting in real estate like three or

813
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:35,519
four into a 15 gal and then get two

814
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:38,280
dudes or three dudes so I'm sex and

815
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:39,759
everything first similar to indoor um

816
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:42,240
and then I I'll transplant to my big

817
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,280
containers so I've got 15 gallon 20

818
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:47,638
gallons I I don't really have a set

819
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:49,359
method like uh deviate between using

820
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:51,679
like bagged soil that allowed amendments

821
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:53,639
and stuff to or just making my own [ __ ]

822
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,800
um big into making composts and stuff

823
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:57,039
like that as well so really when the

824
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,880
flowering starts I'm just got got to

825
00:34:57,039 --> 00:34:59,358
make sure that [ __ ] ain't going to

826
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,960
stretch out of the

827
00:34:59,358 --> 00:35:03,838
greenhouse sorry so when I was um

828
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,199
growing Outdoors so not in the

829
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:07,039
greenhouse just in the open air it

830
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:09,519
wasn't as much of a concern I pretty

831
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:11,239
much just transplant [ __ ] to the beds at

832
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:13,480
you know couple of nodes and then just

833
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:15,639
let it stretch out and sort of have fun

834
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:18,519
with it from there um but yeah at the

835
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:22,078
moment I I grow multiple plants in

836
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:23,759
single containers uh it's not ideal it's

837
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,920
sometimes uh can can lead to some pretty

838
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,520
shitty results um something will be

839
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,480
underwatered and over rewarded but for

840
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:31,400
the most part you know from the same

841
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:33,760
same packet of seed so it ends up like

842
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:36,280
not too bad um but yeah man that's the

843
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:39,960
ideal that's the current situation and

844
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:41,839
um yeah a day for me uh just getting up

845
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,159
my indoor [ __ ] because it's so hot I

846
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:45,679
pretty much run indoors just at

847
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:47,199
nighttime um so I'll get up at you know

848
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:48,919
5: sometimes when the lights are still

849
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:52,078
on get in there feed whatever needs to

850
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:53,318
be fed um and then get outdoors and I

851
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,640
love being out there in the early

852
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:57,279
morning or at night so I've got like in

853
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:59,279
my rental I've got fuckle f FES and I'm

854
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,880
back on to like a nature reserve so

855
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,880
there's like hiking trails and [ __ ] so

856
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,000
it's just sketchy so often I've been out

857
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,400
there at like you know 9 or 10 at night

858
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,880
doing fol year and stuff like that and W

859
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,440
it's when you know people can't see me

860
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,119
or just like bringing plants in and out

861
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:15,480
of the the greenhouse for pruning or

862
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:17,800
this that and the other whatever yeah so

863
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:19,519
um yeah I don't have as big of a sitch

864
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,200
as the boys obviously so it's it's not a

865
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:23,079
big part of my day growing in soil as

866
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:24,439
well sometimes I can go like a day or

867
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:25,760
two without even going in there you know

868
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,800
cuz I know nothing needs to be watered

869
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,079
and and that but yeah man that's mostly

870
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:33,760
it for

871
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:36,119
me that's cool man yeah

872
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,839
um so each of you actually touched on

873
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:39,920
like you know different aspects of

874
00:36:37,838 --> 00:36:42,039
growing and do you have any questions

875
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,920
for each other like regarding what you

876
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:46,920
just heard

877
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,920
like

878
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:56,000
um if not you know one thing I'd maybe

879
00:36:52,358 --> 00:36:58,679
extend to you all um is like in general

880
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,400
with flowering you know what do you what

881
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:04,318
do you like the most about this entire

882
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:08,480
stage relative to you know

883
00:37:04,318 --> 00:37:11,519
vegetation oh I I got one for that

884
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:16,119
um once the plants have resin they have

885
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:19,119
smells yeah you know so you can

886
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:21,358
start say what that's when you start

887
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:24,240
becoming like increasingly obsessed with

888
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:26,000
them at least for me right yeah

889
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:28,199
especially when you when you're growing

890
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,639
from seed you're growing a new strain or

891
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:32,799
something that you don't know quite what

892
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:34,838
it's going to smell like um and and

893
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,960
smell does change over time as it

894
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:39,799
develops but like for the most part like

895
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:42,960
you can start getting a picture of what

896
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:44,880
that plant is uh once it gets a little

897
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,920
bit of resin and the first resin is

898
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:51,200
usually on those pre flowers so I I'll

899
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:54,480
rub pre flowers you know waiting for to

900
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:57,679
get some type of smell that isn't just

901
00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:01,159
um chlorophyll or something

902
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:03,559
and uh that's I mean that's that's I

903
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:07,239
like I like that the most about them

904
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:09,440
starting to develop flowers it's uh is

905
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:11,759
is you get to smell them that's what

906
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,200
that's a huge part of it yeah same for

907
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,599
me I mean I follow my nose man my nose

908
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:19,039
has gotten me gotten gotten more things

909
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:21,480
right than it's gotten wrong and like

910
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:23,960
the first bit of identity that really

911
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:26,318
stands out amongst these plants post veg

912
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:28,720
is that that first bit of resin yeah

913
00:38:26,318 --> 00:38:31,318
there's structure but I mean when you

914
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:33,759
first get that introduction of of the

915
00:38:31,318 --> 00:38:36,559
compound and you start either relating

916
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:40,160
it to other plants or you relate it to

917
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:42,078
the the parents of the hybrid or or uh

918
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:44,039
you know you you just get a you get an

919
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:47,839
identity for it and that that to me is

920
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:47,838
like that's one of my favorite parts of

921
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:52,879
that yeah I think that's the magic of

922
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:55,799
growing these plants is that at it's at

923
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,720
that point where they stop becoming

924
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,440
sorry where they they're no longer as

925
00:38:57,719 --> 00:39:01,358
much of a black box and you're actually

926
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,559
starting to see like what they've got to

927
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:06,119
offer you

928
00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:07,880
um the puzzles start to come together

929
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:09,838
yeah it's beautiful cuz with a rose like

930
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:12,039
I've got I've got a bunch of roses as

931
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:13,519
well so you know when a new rose pops up

932
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:14,880
I always stick my nose in and it's

933
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:16,400
beautiful you know nice thing to start

934
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,079
the day but it's always the same that's

935
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,160
why with flowering plants man it's just

936
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:22,039
a mystery right every day it reveals

937
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:24,078
itself a little bit more and even like

938
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:25,358
the structure of the flower if you'll

939
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,119
grow a packet of seeds and you'll start

940
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:28,639
to see that diversity so oh okay this

941
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,680
thing stopping the stretch it's starting

942
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:32,719
to throw out some reasonable size

943
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:34,078
[ __ ] puff balls and then oh [ __ ] this

944
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:35,519
thing ain't even ticked over yet it's

945
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,680
still stretching it's barely even

946
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:39,039
throwing pistols like it's like I love

947
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:41,000
it and just every day they seem to

948
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:42,679
change at that stage too like Sun's

949
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,800
pretty intense here at that time of year

950
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:46,960
so watching everything transition and

951
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,960
and yeah all the Aromas man and watching

952
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,318
like trying to gauge what a flower is

953
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,480
going to smell like off the stem and

954
00:39:50,318 --> 00:39:53,719
stuff as well it's all fun especially

955
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,280
when it's like you know something you've

956
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:57,439
been passionate about a waiting all year

957
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,079
to pop just for that scenario like the

958
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,720
outdoor because I save a lot of things

959
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:03,039
just for outdoor in particular because

960
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:06,318
it's my preference

961
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:08,759
really yeah I think I said before like I

962
00:40:06,318 --> 00:40:11,759
I don't think I've encountered another

963
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:14,800
plant or any organic species that

964
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:19,839
carries as many smell profiles like in

965
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:22,560
one single species it has a an almost

966
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:24,440
uncountable amount of of compounds that

967
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:26,599
that and not only that but a lot of

968
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:29,240
those compounds are subjective to each

969
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:31,519
individual person like so when and that

970
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:33,838
was something that at the party man

971
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:35,239
we're passing around jars and people are

972
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:37,400
picking up different notes out of the

973
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:39,199
same jar and we're finding similarities

974
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:42,680
but we're also defining them by

975
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:44,078
completely different experiences it's um

976
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:46,719
I don't know I've I've never ran into

977
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:49,760
something so complex for for the old

978
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:52,039
factory um system and it it just adds to

979
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,400
the reason why I think some of us love

980
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:54,400
it so

981
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:58,760
much I I'll bring people down into the

982
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:01,318
garden and I'll be like man I smell I

983
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:03,400
smell Menthol and blueberries and and

984
00:41:01,318 --> 00:41:04,920
all this complexity and some people

985
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:07,240
would just go man I just smell weed and

986
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:10,039
I'm like well well then I you our noses

987
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:12,318
are different bro yeah I can I can hand

988
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:13,559
Brinn like straight up blueberry bud and

989
00:41:12,318 --> 00:41:16,119
have her smell it and she'll say oh

990
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:19,000
peppery you know just some people just

991
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:21,280
smell things totally different yeah yeah

992
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,679
I was that that actually leads me to

993
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,920
want to ask you guys another question

994
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:27,000
which is like and again this is more on

995
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:29,880
the human side of things but

996
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,719
how many people do you get to share this

997
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:36,680
with like how many people in your lives

998
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:39,799
get to witness you know what you doing

999
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:42,559
um uh too many I should be [ __ ] more

1000
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:45,839
tight lipped about it to be honest [ __ ]

1001
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:48,920
man like for all my friends it's a trip

1002
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:50,078
so I mean I keep a pretty low profile um

1003
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:52,318
I don't have like too many people in my

1004
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:53,760
circle or whatever but um for the most

1005
00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:55,400
part my friends haven't had exposure to

1006
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,599
this [ __ ] so like my one buddy that came

1007
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:59,480
to Amsterdam with me um that was his

1008
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:02,280
first time seeing anything except like

1009
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:04,880
you know compact [ __ ] the pgr the

1010
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:06,560
the the Brick sort of stuff um yeah so

1011
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,119
that was his first exposure to that and

1012
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:09,838
so every time I bring something new he's

1013
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:10,800
just stoked man and for most people you

1014
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:13,440
know you're showing them [ __ ] that

1015
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,280
they've never even seen or smelled so I

1016
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,720
I love variety so you know I'm not

1017
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,280
really cropping the same clones so every

1018
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:20,318
time it's something new and you know

1019
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,839
friends will get a couple bags of

1020
00:42:20,318 --> 00:42:23,960
different seed plants and stuff and it's

1021
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:26,838
just a trip and I love it it's it's fun

1022
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:28,800
and I love it when you can get um that

1023
00:42:26,838 --> 00:42:30,639
um correlation like if you smell

1024
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,920
something I like with my Ms I'll do it

1025
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:33,759
I'll always give her a bag and be like

1026
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,000
what do you smell and if she you know

1027
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,960
says the same thing as me it's always

1028
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:42,800
like [ __ ] yeah you know confirming it's

1029
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:44,000
cool I keep hearing uh boo about pgr and

1030
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,519
I feel

1031
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,239
like it's a it's it's so it sounds like

1032
00:42:46,519 --> 00:42:51,358
it's like a it's a pretty good issue

1033
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:53,919
down in Australia right now yeah man

1034
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:55,920
it's less now less of a concern like I'm

1035
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,800
not really for the medical Market but

1036
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,039
one thing that actually the good that's

1037
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,039
come of it is people are getting all

1038
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:02,960
this stuff from the chemists now so less

1039
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:05,400
people are having to go to the streets

1040
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:08,119
to get weed but man for the longest time

1041
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,920
like I don't know if it was a clone that

1042
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:11,720
was passed around like all of Australia

1043
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,480
like so the theory was most of it was

1044
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:16,519
grown by like Vietnamese gangs but I

1045
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,800
mean I saw a lot of it come from like um

1046
00:43:16,519 --> 00:43:20,679
biker sort of circles as well so I'm not

1047
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,559
sure where it was being cultivated but

1048
00:43:20,679 --> 00:43:24,480
yeah man it was a trip like for 10 15

1049
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:27,000
years you'd find the same weed like the

1050
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,639
same smell same look same like shitty

1051
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,880
effect everything and yeah it was just

1052
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:34,239
grown with these blood

1053
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:36,920
blusters yeah it seems like every

1054
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:39,159
developing cannabis Market goes through

1055
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:42,119
that phase for a while

1056
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:45,719
where you get maybe like the less

1057
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:47,000
scrupulous Growers um who are really

1058
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:51,279
just in it for the

1059
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:53,358
money uh kind of blowing it out and they

1060
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:56,599
of course they they pgr the [ __ ] out of

1061
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:59,279
everything so they can yield more and uh

1062
00:43:56,599 --> 00:44:01,519
it you know it's the quality is so bad

1063
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,519
and then the market sort of like we had

1064
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:07,400
Canada doing that and that all came down

1065
00:44:04,519 --> 00:44:10,519
this way and a lot of people were doing

1066
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:12,200
it here in probably the early 2000s into

1067
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:15,280
the

1068
00:44:12,199 --> 00:44:17,919
mid1 and then kind of like the market

1069
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:20,240
got well for one you had like you did

1070
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:22,159
have like the regulated market testing

1071
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:24,118
for it so that helped and you started

1072
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:27,358
having medical dispensaries testing for

1073
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:30,200
it so that kind of helped but like also

1074
00:44:27,358 --> 00:44:32,960
the market just realized that look with

1075
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:35,480
less resin but a huge Bud super dense it

1076
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:37,440
wasn't that great a weed like it looked

1077
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:40,400
better than the Mexican brick they were

1078
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:42,240
getting before but it's people just

1079
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,960
realized it wasn't that great and it

1080
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:47,159
started to not have the value for the

1081
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,760
people doing it and it seems like every

1082
00:44:47,159 --> 00:44:52,440
Market's kind of gone through that pgr

1083
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:54,119
phase and uh I don't know just it's just

1084
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:56,559
interesting to hear it down in Australia

1085
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:58,280
as well man I think the interesting

1086
00:44:56,559 --> 00:45:02,880
perspective

1087
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:04,920
yeah that it's like a um almost like a

1088
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,400
stepping stone for every developing

1089
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:08,920
Market sorry boo go for it no sorry

1090
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:10,559
brother I'm just say people are like

1091
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:12,800
apathetic towards it like I know people

1092
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:15,240
that actually like enjoy it like people

1093
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,760
that will still buy it week in week out

1094
00:45:15,239 --> 00:45:18,078
just because of the price because of the

1095
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,640
availability or it's what they're used

1096
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,880
to because most people like it's the

1097
00:45:19,639 --> 00:45:27,519
only weed they've ever smoked so that's

1098
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:29,720
the whole so depressing oh dude yeah and

1099
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:31,920
yeah yeah I mean then you can show them

1100
00:45:29,719 --> 00:45:35,118
some of yours and probably blow their

1101
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,680
mind yeah yeah yeah sometimes man

1102
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:38,640
sometimes it's yeah I don't know I think

1103
00:45:36,679 --> 00:45:40,318
people just get get used to that sort of

1104
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:42,440
effect it's weird I don't know

1105
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:45,599
interesting that effect what's that

1106
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:47,838
migrain I don't know man microl [ __ ]

little Hill it it looks like you know

1116

bad like it's all nothing but hair yeah

1118
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:19,879

1119
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:21,639
worse dude it looks like a Jim Henson

1120
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:23,760
puppet dud ites it literally it doesn't

1121

look like weed it does not look

1122
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:30,960
like that's that's not the beers we used

1123
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:33,400
to get that was super PG no no no this

1124
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:35,280
way different maybe in the private chat

1125

I can find a I'll find a picture for you

1126
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:40,359
little Hill later on like um as we go on

1127
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:42,400
there was certainly stages of it there

1128
00:46:40,358 --> 00:46:43,838
was stages cuz like I was getting some

1129
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,160
at some stage that was like little Hill

1130
00:46:43,838 --> 00:46:48,719
talks about just big old chunks like

1131
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:50,000
half ounce [ __ ] buds big compact

1132
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:52,399
things and they were less hairy but

1133
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,159
still they were like gray like [ __ ] all

1134
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,599
resin glands but then yeah there was

1135
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:57,639
like sometimes people would come around

1136
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:59,240
with the stuff that was full on like

1137
00:46:57,639 --> 00:47:02,159
yeah little dingleberries man like

1138
00:46:59,239 --> 00:47:05,239
little stamped on you know hairy [ __ ]

1139
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:06,598
red and gray balls like yeah was crazy

1140
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:08,399
I'm putting a link in the chat I don't

1141
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:09,599
know if you can oh no that's not a link

1142
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,920
that's a

1143
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:14,318
yeah that's not a link don't worry about

1144
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,680
that okay well I'll I'll try to get that

1145
00:47:14,318 --> 00:47:19,480
to you at some point in this chat but

1146
00:47:16,679 --> 00:47:22,078
Chris did you anything to add on the PGI

1147
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:25,960
note uh no no I don't have anything to

1148
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:27,160
add on to that okay okay well cuz the

1149
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:29,039
other thing I want to ask you guys again

1150
00:47:27,159 --> 00:47:30,480
broadly before we start like I'm going

1151
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:32,358
to start prompting you all to kind of

1152
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,960
start drilling into like mold and stuff

1153
00:47:32,358 --> 00:47:36,719
but before we get there and it's

1154
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:38,599
probably a natural segue to mold but

1155
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:42,000
what are the things that you all dislike

1156
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:43,800
about this stage or like what do you

1157
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,679
what concerns you or worries you or you

1158
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:48,039
know what are the downsides for you when

1159
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:51,879
you're getting into

1160
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:51,880
flowering um

1161
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:56,280
downsides jeez I don't know that there

1162
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:59,079
are any

1163
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:00,800
um maybe downsides is a bad term but

1164
00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:02,200
like yeah what things do you start to

1165
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:06,440
worry about

1166
00:48:02,199 --> 00:48:09,078
maybe smell for me so it's like I won't

1167
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:11,039
it I know was gonna stank like oh jeez I

1168
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:13,200
got a neighbor like two meters

1169
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:14,318
away yeah I don't I don't have those

1170
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:15,960
concerns

1171
00:48:14,318 --> 00:48:18,880
anymore

1172
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:21,960
um I'm I'm sort of like wrapped up in

1173
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:24,200
dep Harvest and that and that kind of

1174
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:26,880
takes priority and

1175
00:48:24,199 --> 00:48:30,879
attention um for things going on in the

1176
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:34,559
other Garden as far as like workload and

1177
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:36,200
stuff but I mean back in the day just

1178
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:38,400
the same [ __ ] like I still wasn't

1179
00:48:36,199 --> 00:48:42,159
worried about smell but I mean

1180
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:46,200
helicopters and and what's going on um

1181
00:48:42,159 --> 00:48:52,078
up here they they usually do bus in like

1182
00:48:46,199 --> 00:48:54,759
um Late July August um so sort of just

1183
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:56,160
like where they are that day where where

1184
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:58,599
the whatever the

1185
00:48:56,159 --> 00:49:01,598
um the task force or whoever it is

1186
00:48:58,599 --> 00:49:04,838
rolling around the Convoy um on the

1187
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:08,440
roads uh other than that

1188
00:49:04,838 --> 00:49:10,440
like I don't know it's just yeah I mean

1189
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:14,679
it just everything's fixing to get

1190
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:16,760
started and uh I know I know later on in

1191
00:49:14,679 --> 00:49:18,000
flower like when you get into like mid

1192
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:20,319
to late

1193
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,798
September um and everything's too early

1194
00:49:20,318 --> 00:49:25,679
to chop it's just like you're just like

1195
00:49:22,798 --> 00:49:28,079
hanging around there's almost nothing to

1196
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:30,679
do on the plants for the most part it's

1197
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:33,599
just hitting your watering but

1198
00:49:30,679 --> 00:49:36,598
like there's enough on the vine to like

1199
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:38,599
for thieves to come yeah and they'll

1200
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:40,359
still they'll still take it so it's like

1201
00:49:38,599 --> 00:49:43,079
you can't chop for like another three

1202
00:49:40,358 --> 00:49:45,480
weeks but you know there's nothing else

1203
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:48,079
you can do and it's like in September

1204
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:50,039
you got all this like I almost feel like

1205
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:52,960
there I always needed a September

1206
00:49:50,039 --> 00:49:54,838
project to do something to take up my

1207
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,318
time or at least to take up the cruise

1208
00:49:54,838 --> 00:49:58,838
time

1209
00:49:56,318 --> 00:50:01,880
because like there was really nothing to

1210
00:49:58,838 --> 00:50:03,960
do dep's already down and out the door

1211
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:05,599
um you can't start harvesting yet but

1212
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:07,760
you know you have this huge workload

1213
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:09,838
ahead but you can't you can't get

1214
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:12,559
started early on it so you just kind of

1215
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:15,199
nervously fidgeting before yeah deal

1216
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:18,160
with the paranoia and and just and just

1217
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:19,719
maybe do do a September project like

1218
00:50:18,159 --> 00:50:23,838
we've done things over the years like

1219
00:50:19,719 --> 00:50:26,358
build a treehouse or or uh maybe work on

1220
00:50:23,838 --> 00:50:30,759
a new space if we're EXP Bing the next

1221
00:50:26,358 --> 00:50:34,679
year working on a fence or something but

1222
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:37,520
like that's that's that's how I kind of

1223
00:50:34,679 --> 00:50:39,598
take up that extra time

1224
00:50:37,519 --> 00:50:41,318
yeah that's so interesting so yeah for

1225
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:43,160
you I guess one of the problems is also

1226
00:50:41,318 --> 00:50:48,679
just thinking what you would do with

1227
00:50:43,159 --> 00:50:48,679
that free time when you have it um yeah

1228
00:50:49,159 --> 00:50:53,920
it's are you guys lollipopping and [ __ ]

1229
00:50:52,199 --> 00:50:57,000
like are you stripping a lot of the lows

1230
00:50:53,920 --> 00:51:02,559
off not a lot lot

1231
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:05,400
um definitely lower branches for sure um

1232
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:08,839
but I don't I don't lollipop a whole lot

1233
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:13,760
one it it that the time it takes is

1234
00:51:08,838 --> 00:51:15,838
enormous at at this scale and yeah um I

1235
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,599
don't feel like I'm not totally

1236
00:51:15,838 --> 00:51:21,159
convinced and it varies strain to strain

1237
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:23,480
for sure um but I'm not totally

1238
00:51:21,159 --> 00:51:26,558
convinced how much it helps

1239
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:28,519
Outdoors because

1240
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:31,040
I don't know you know the sun moves over

1241
00:51:28,519 --> 00:51:34,239
the sky you know and hits the plants

1242
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:36,960
from both sides um over the course of

1243
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:39,639
the day and all those smaller buds at

1244
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:43,480
the bottom like I can sell those

1245
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:45,719
too um if they're dense at all like

1246
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:47,559
they're still they're still worth

1247
00:51:45,719 --> 00:51:50,439
something

1248
00:51:47,559 --> 00:51:52,280
so I mean as long as the the bottom

1249
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:54,880
branches aren't laying in the soil you

1250
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:56,319
know trim those up um make sure they're

1251
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,240
not in the way of like if I'm using

1252
00:51:56,318 --> 00:52:00,679
sprayers make sure nothing's in the way

1253
00:51:58,239 --> 00:52:03,318
of the sprayer spraying you know over

1254
00:52:00,679 --> 00:52:06,239
the circumference of the pot but

1255
00:52:03,318 --> 00:52:07,279
lollipop and just takes a ton of time um

1256
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:11,039
I do do

1257
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:13,400
leafing um in in my Depp green houses

1258
00:52:11,039 --> 00:52:15,798
and just to Deo filate as as they call

1259
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:18,400
it now but I just call it leafing or big

1260
00:52:15,798 --> 00:52:21,759
leafing um just to just to get better

1261
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:24,280
light penetration on certain strains but

1262
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:26,280
uh n not a whole lot of

1263
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:28,760
lollipopping yeah I'm I'm not

1264
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:30,798
lollipopping either like the most growth

1265
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:32,640
cleanup that I'll do is if I'm looking

1266
00:52:30,798 --> 00:52:35,440
through the internal structure of a

1267
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:37,440
plant and I can't like stick my hand

1268
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:40,519
through it without like it turning into

1269
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:42,838
a jungle or hitting every branch and

1270
00:52:40,519 --> 00:52:44,358
leaf on the way in then I'm going to do

1271
00:52:42,838 --> 00:52:46,159
a little bit of cleaning up in there but

1272
00:52:44,358 --> 00:52:47,719
if she's breathing just fine like if a

1273
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:50,358
big gust of wind comes through and I

1274
00:52:47,719 --> 00:52:52,439
could see that it exchanges air on every

1275
00:52:50,358 --> 00:52:53,960
node all the way up I'm not going to I'm

1276
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:56,079
not going to clean off any of the inner

1277
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:57,838
growth I'm not going to take what people

1278
00:52:56,079 --> 00:53:00,480
call the suckers or those little

1279
00:52:57,838 --> 00:53:02,199
branches um I I leave all that stuff but

1280
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:05,000
if I can if I can see a plant choking

1281
00:53:02,199 --> 00:53:07,159
itself out if I can see like actual fan

1282
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,239
leaves like decaying on the internal

1283
00:53:07,159 --> 00:53:11,679
growth because of partial

1284
00:53:09,239 --> 00:53:14,279
cannibalization but also a complete lack

1285
00:53:11,679 --> 00:53:17,318
of sunshine then I I'll clean up some of

1286
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:19,200
that inner stuff the uh the cream bag

1287
00:53:17,318 --> 00:53:22,199
seed that I popped this year had some

1288
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:24,078
inbred mutant stuff going on and she had

1289
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:26,639
some internal jungly growth that no

1290
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:28,039
matter how much I trained her outwards

1291
00:53:26,639 --> 00:53:31,879
there was still internal growth that was

1292
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:35,000
in shade almost all all day all day long

1293
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:36,559
so it's it's strain strain dependent on

1294
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,119
whether or not if I'm doing a bunch of

1295
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:40,760
cleaning up on the uh on the fan leafes

1296
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:42,960
or the internal

1297
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:44,359
growth cool yeah I'm pretty much the

1298
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,199
same I'll just open up the center of the

1299
00:53:44,358 --> 00:53:47,759
plant similar to like cherry tomatoes I

1300
00:53:46,199 --> 00:53:49,199
mean like you said as long as I've got I

1301
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,880
don't know if I've got four or five like

1302
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:53,039
main cers as long as there's a nice Gap

1303
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:56,079
in the center where air can sort of move

1304
00:53:53,039 --> 00:53:58,519
around I'm cool with that yeah

1305
00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:01,039
breathability yeah I w't grow something

1306
00:53:58,519 --> 00:54:02,599
like I've seen pictures of URL and like

1307
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:05,639
deep Chunk in Bubba where they grow like

1308
00:54:02,599 --> 00:54:07,359
a ball leaves everywhere so I won't grow

1309
00:54:05,639 --> 00:54:08,679
something like that I mostly just like

1310
00:54:07,358 --> 00:54:10,759
the long flower and [ __ ] in the

1311
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:12,838
greenhouse yeah don't top your deep

1312
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:15,440
chunk

1313
00:54:12,838 --> 00:54:18,039
plants those varieties you just named

1314
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:21,599
are are notorious for having just tons

1315
00:54:18,039 --> 00:54:24,480
of nodes and tons of lar on the inside

1316
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:26,519
and I'm not growing anything like that

1317
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:30,920
um besides maybe some poodle nuts which

1318
00:54:26,519 --> 00:54:33,039
is kind of similar but um if that was

1319
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:35,960
the case yeah I'd have to rethink it

1320
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:38,838
because they've just got you know a node

1321
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:41,720
every you know inch or so on the inside

1322
00:54:38,838 --> 00:54:45,039
and it's just so much extra foilage and

1323
00:54:41,719 --> 00:54:47,919
they lar up so bad and I I feel like

1324
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:51,558
that much extra is definitely going to

1325
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:52,960
rob from your your top buds but uh you

1326
00:54:51,559 --> 00:54:56,200
know when your when your nodes are

1327
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:59,000
further apart it man I I just look at it

1328
00:54:56,199 --> 00:55:00,919
as like I there's a whole Smalls market

1329
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:03,880
so everything that's not big enough to

1330
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:07,318
go in your bag of like a buds goes in

1331
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:08,599
the bbds or or Smalls and they're

1332
00:55:07,318 --> 00:55:13,039
there're you know they're easy to

1333
00:55:08,599 --> 00:55:14,838
machine trim and you know sell them for

1334
00:55:13,039 --> 00:55:17,199
you sell them for less but you can still

1335
00:55:14,838 --> 00:55:18,558
sell them so and you're machine trimming

1336
00:55:17,199 --> 00:55:21,480
so you're not really paying a trimming

1337
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:22,960
cost like like you are so you know I

1338
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:25,639
just look at it that

1339
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:28,159
way yeah I was so mad over here it's

1340
00:55:25,639 --> 00:55:31,000
like 2004 whatever in Cali like it'll

1341
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:32,879
all go all those tiny little buds on the

1342
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,559
bottom of the stem CL that off that'll

1343
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:38,160
go yeah yeah yeah that's man that's a

1344
00:55:35,559 --> 00:55:40,880
good ERA to be in right

1345
00:55:38,159 --> 00:55:44,838
now it's a good place to

1346
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:48,400
be it isn't it it' be nice

1347
00:55:44,838 --> 00:55:51,000
bro um we kind of got here I think we we

1348
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:53,760
talking about like uh light and air

1349
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:58,519
penetration all that um let's talk about

1350
00:55:53,760 --> 00:56:02,720
PM mold bet tritis all those things get

1351
00:55:58,519 --> 00:56:04,559
into it okay uh so I'm I'm guessing me

1352
00:56:02,719 --> 00:56:07,519
and and thousand full are kind of in the

1353
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:09,559
same boat where we have pretty dry dry

1354
00:56:07,519 --> 00:56:14,239
climates and good wind I I I've got

1355
00:56:09,559 --> 00:56:18,400
pretty good wind at my spot too and you

1356
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:21,798
mean oh yeah sorry kush yeah my bad uh

1357
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:26,240
and like it's pretty constant you know

1358
00:56:21,798 --> 00:56:28,519
uh a medium to heavy wind and yep and uh

1359
00:56:26,239 --> 00:56:31,679
I mean that's great for all those things

1360
00:56:28,519 --> 00:56:33,759
um I I know people closer to the coast

1361
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:36,919
um do do a bit more lollipopping and

1362
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:39,559
thinning in the inside of their plants I

1363
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:41,599
don't really get PM

1364
00:56:39,559 --> 00:56:44,079
Outdoors

1365
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:47,160
um you know something about the UV from

1366
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:49,079
the Sun really suppresses it what I will

1367
00:56:47,159 --> 00:56:51,838
see later on in the

1368
00:56:49,079 --> 00:56:54,480
season um on the north side of a plant

1369
00:56:51,838 --> 00:56:56,038
you might see some PM starting but by

1370
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:59,838
that point point you've you've usually

1371
00:56:56,039 --> 00:57:01,319
already started Harvest and you just see

1372
00:56:59,838 --> 00:57:04,159
it forming on a plant you're not going

1373
00:57:01,318 --> 00:57:06,639
to do anything else with at that point

1374
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:08,679
besides chop it down and and maybe chop

1375
00:57:06,639 --> 00:57:09,639
it up or burn it or or whatever you do

1376
00:57:08,679 --> 00:57:12,558
with your

1377
00:57:09,639 --> 00:57:15,519
stems um in the greenh houses for sure

1378
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:17,240
I'll see pm and and and and it's just

1379
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:21,318
part of our routine if you're foiler

1380
00:57:17,239 --> 00:57:24,159
feeding with minerals or or uh you know

1381
00:57:21,318 --> 00:57:25,519
some type of like zyme product or

1382
00:57:24,159 --> 00:57:28,759
phosphorus

1383
00:57:25,519 --> 00:57:31,318
product um that usually suppresses it

1384
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:33,760
pretty good for me um without like

1385
00:57:31,318 --> 00:57:35,279
specifically spraying for

1386
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,720
it

1387
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:40,400
um I found over the year just spraying

1388
00:57:37,719 --> 00:57:43,598
anything helps with PM

1389
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:46,039
honestly so um yeah I don't know

1390
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:48,680
something about the UV I think really

1391
00:57:46,039 --> 00:57:51,240
really does that work for you yeah I've

1392
00:57:48,679 --> 00:57:52,759
never and like I said we're not that far

1393
00:57:51,239 --> 00:57:54,199
we're basically just on the opposite

1394
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:58,200
side of the valleys of each other with

1395
00:57:54,199 --> 00:57:59,838
very similar similar locations um I I

1396
00:57:58,199 --> 00:58:04,439
the only time I've ever had to deal with

1397
00:57:59,838 --> 00:58:06,679
PM was because nearby uh wisteria bushes

1398
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:09,519
were like overhydrated and were just

1399
00:58:06,679 --> 00:58:12,199
dripping water on on my plants and had

1400
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:14,199
they not been overhung by them then

1401
00:58:12,199 --> 00:58:19,239
there wouldn't have been any pm to be

1402
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:22,798
created on them uh no yeah it it I I've

1403
00:58:19,239 --> 00:58:26,679
always described my area as like almost

1404
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:30,239
Desert High High desert like it's very

1405
00:58:26,679 --> 00:58:33,879
Aid very dry and very windy until it's

1406
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:37,118
not like the second mid September hits

1407
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:38,960
it just it comes it's it's almost always

1408
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:41,760
an in if there's a rainstorm there's a

1409
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:44,519
day where it's an inch of rain um my

1410
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:46,839
little my little side of the mountain up

1411
00:58:44,519 --> 00:58:48,358
here we have a a perfect little storm of

1412
00:58:46,838 --> 00:58:50,880
that

1413
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:53,719
southern the the southern cold winds

1414
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:55,680
blowing up the valley mixing or the the

1415
00:58:53,719 --> 00:58:57,358
hot southern winds blowing up the valley

1416
00:58:55,679 --> 00:58:59,519
mixing in with the cold air that comes

1417
00:58:57,358 --> 00:59:02,759
down off the Foothills and I live right

1418
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:06,838
at that congruence um it makes for

1419
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:09,240
amazing thunderstorms and 60c 120 second

1420
00:59:06,838 --> 00:59:11,838
long Rolling Thunder but it also brings

1421
00:59:09,239 --> 00:59:15,479
with it some crazy storms

1422
00:59:11,838 --> 00:59:18,880
so um yeah PM is not something that I

1423
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:21,280
battle with uh generally but the mold

1424
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:24,000
when when I'm start getting those days

1425
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:26,519
where you know plants have absorbed you

1426
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:29,599
know an of rain over like a 6 hour 8

1427
00:59:26,519 --> 00:59:31,159
Hour 12 hour period it's that's when I'm

1428
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:33,480
I'm going out the next day and I'm

1429
00:59:31,159 --> 00:59:35,759
shaking down every plant and trying to

1430
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:37,559
get as much moisture off of them as

1431
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,960
possible um because I because I know

1432
00:59:37,559 --> 00:59:42,519
what's going to come if you leave enough

1433
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:45,599
moisture and um I I'm no expert in

1434
00:59:42,519 --> 00:59:46,719
dealing with gry mold or or botis but

1435
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:51,119
from my

1436
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:54,000
observations I notice it grows best and

1437
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:57,318
initially off of necrotic material if

1438
00:59:54,000 --> 01:00:00,480
there is a a dead plant cell even if

1439
00:59:57,318 --> 01:00:04,599
it's tiny and the right moisture with

1440
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:07,240
the right um lack of of UV contact it

1441
01:00:04,599 --> 01:00:10,000
seems to just create itself

1442
01:00:07,239 --> 01:00:12,038
instantaneously and so in the last

1443
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,400
couple years I've tried changing

1444
01:00:12,039 --> 01:00:17,200
something because I notice um when I'm

1445
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:19,400
defoliating uh dead cannibalized fan

1446
01:00:17,199 --> 01:00:21,000
leaves normally I'll just hand pluck

1447
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:23,599
them I'll grab it by the leaf and I'll

1448
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,318
just rip down or I'll rip up and I'll

1449
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:27,838
pluck it right off the pl plant and then

1450
01:00:25,318 --> 01:00:30,358
I'll come back uh and late flower and

1451
01:00:27,838 --> 01:00:33,279
that exact node where I plucked off that

1452
01:00:30,358 --> 01:00:35,358
fan Leaf is right where the botis the

1453
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:38,400
gry mold has started is where where I

1454
01:00:35,358 --> 01:00:40,639
plucked that off and then two years ago

1455
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:42,639
instead of hand plucking I started

1456
01:00:40,639 --> 01:00:45,078
taking the scissors and just snipping

1457
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:47,480
the end of those those Leaf uh branches

1458
01:00:45,079 --> 01:00:50,400
off and stopped plucking and I noticed

1459
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:51,798
that those botis the grey mold areas

1460
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,480
where it would normally be attacked

1461
01:00:51,798 --> 01:00:56,199
where there was dead necrotic material

1462
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:59,000
it wasn't happening near nearly as often

1463
01:00:56,199 --> 01:01:01,558
so knowing or at least observing what

1464
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:03,159
I've seen in my garden um how it it

1465
01:01:01,559 --> 01:01:06,720
likes to attack the necrotic and dead

1466
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:09,038
material uh it's changed how I defoliate

1467
01:01:06,719 --> 01:01:11,838
um my

1468
01:01:09,039 --> 01:01:16,160
plants that's that's that's that's right

1469
01:01:11,838 --> 01:01:18,318
on um I I've noticed similar stuff too

1470
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:20,920
um and

1471
01:01:18,318 --> 01:01:24,038
uh it yeah it does like those Dead

1472
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:27,240
Leaves if you got a dead bud leaf for a

1473
01:01:24,039 --> 01:01:30,480
or a parched one devoided nutrients um

1474
01:01:27,239 --> 01:01:34,000
it'll like to start there

1475
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:36,920
um yeah I don't do a whole lot for mold

1476
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:41,239
besides try and grow strains that aren't

1477
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:45,159
going to mold before they finish yeah

1478
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:49,479
and um you like strains like sour diesel

1479
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:52,199
don't mold but they go so late that I

1480
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:54,480
feel like they can't finish very well

1481
01:01:52,199 --> 01:01:56,439
where I'm at I don't want to run

1482
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:59,440
something past Halloween or even up to

1483
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:01,960
Halloween uh October

1484
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:04,358
31st um it's just too late for me it's

1485
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:07,440
just too cold usually every day every

1486
01:02:04,358 --> 01:02:09,719
night for them really to finish up right

1487
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:12,639
right um but they don't mold I've done

1488
01:02:09,719 --> 01:02:14,639
it before and I mean they go through

1489
01:02:12,639 --> 01:02:18,759
storms and and they just don't freaking

1490
01:02:14,639 --> 01:02:20,838
mold which is awesome yeah um you know I

1491
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:23,799
I've never had a big mold problem up

1492
01:02:20,838 --> 01:02:26,078
here I've always ran strains that finish

1493
01:02:23,798 --> 01:02:28,559
up before mold's going to come in before

1494
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:30,640
the before that next storm comes in it

1495
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:32,039
seems like clockwork every year we get a

1496
01:02:30,639 --> 01:02:34,558
storm in late

1497
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:39,000
September um and it's and it's too early

1498
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:41,519
for for mold to really set in and that's

1499
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,559
fine you know it washes the plants off I

1500
01:02:41,519 --> 01:02:45,838
mean I like it honestly it keeps the

1501
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:47,640
dust down it you know it makes

1502
01:02:45,838 --> 01:02:49,278
everything smell fresh and new and it

1503
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:53,358
really feels like Harvest Time when that

1504
01:02:49,278 --> 01:02:54,880
happens but yeah um generally I I take

1505
01:02:53,358 --> 01:02:56,719
all my tops first

1506
01:02:54,880 --> 01:03:00,200
anyways

1507
01:02:56,719 --> 01:03:02,719
so you know once the that second growth

1508
01:03:00,199 --> 01:03:05,038
is it's not those fat colas like like

1509
01:03:02,719 --> 01:03:08,519
the top so they they don't they're not

1510
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:09,799
going to mold up as easy but um it just

1511
01:03:08,519 --> 01:03:12,239
depends like this year we're getting a

1512
01:03:09,798 --> 01:03:15,079
ton of rain for September and October

1513
01:03:12,239 --> 01:03:17,479
more than normal y so and I'm running

1514
01:03:15,079 --> 01:03:19,559
all new strains that I don't know what

1515
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:22,519
they do or how they perform or even when

1516
01:03:19,559 --> 01:03:24,920
they were going to finish so I I have

1517
01:03:22,519 --> 01:03:27,358
seen more mold than usual that's that's

1518
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:30,240
a combination of running strains that

1519
01:03:27,358 --> 01:03:32,920
aren't tried and true and more rain than

1520
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:34,759
usual like we had yeah I mean we've had

1521
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:36,720
more rain already in October than

1522
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:39,200
probably the last you know two three

1523
01:03:36,719 --> 01:03:42,759
years combined honestly at least for the

1524
01:03:39,199 --> 01:03:44,558
first half of October so you know I I

1525
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:47,119
kind of already decided what I didn't

1526
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:51,240
want to run and it was it was a lot of

1527
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:54,880
those super super center big giant

1528
01:03:51,239 --> 01:03:56,959
centerca fat buds but kind of just like

1529
01:03:54,880 --> 01:04:00,559
meh on the turps from

1530
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:03,679
compound um those things are breed those

1531
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:06,039
things are breed you know indoors

1532
01:04:03,679 --> 01:04:08,278
insults you know with probably with LED

1533
01:04:06,039 --> 01:04:11,000
lighting and it's just

1534
01:04:08,278 --> 01:04:13,119
not it like that kind of breeding

1535
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:15,440
constantly is just taking genetics a

1536
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:17,960
certain way where even though a lot of

1537
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:21,838
our genetics are were bred

1538
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:24,720
indoors um I feel like you do another

1539
01:04:21,838 --> 01:04:27,759
selection when you move Outdoors and so

1540
01:04:24,719 --> 01:04:30,078
you figure out okay this is what I like

1541
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:32,960
but let's see what works for me in this

1542
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:35,440
environment and you do selections off of

1543
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:37,559
that you might do breeding off of that

1544
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:41,079
other breeders up here especially like

1545
01:04:37,559 --> 01:04:42,720
707 Seedbank like he's really bred for

1546
01:04:41,079 --> 01:04:47,480
like NorCal

1547
01:04:42,719 --> 01:04:52,239
outdoor um climate and a lot of his

1548
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:56,480
strains um do well do well in that

1549
01:04:52,239 --> 01:04:58,479
situation um so so I I growing a lot of

1550
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:01,599
his strains but like I know he's done

1551
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:04,440
that and and uh I do my selections like

1552
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:05,960
I I I'd rather run run a bunch of clones

1553
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:08,599
and figure out which ones work for me

1554
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:11,199
and which ones don't and just select

1555
01:05:08,599 --> 01:05:14,000
select you know clones that

1556
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:17,078
way yeah I definitely want us to return

1557
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:19,880
to particular plants or indiv or you

1558
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:22,440
know lines or individuals that um have

1559
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:25,119
and have not done well for you guys um

1560
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:28,119
but maybe we'll let boo

1561
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:31,680
yeah Finish First about um whether he

1562
01:05:28,119 --> 01:05:33,920
has to deal with pm and molds so not pm

1563
01:05:31,679 --> 01:05:35,879
and I I may be off base but I think PM's

1564
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:37,960
more of like a cooler climate thing

1565
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:39,838
maybe like cool temperament Coastal cuz

1566
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:41,880
I'm in the subtropics so we don't have

1567
01:05:39,838 --> 01:05:44,159
those cool nights in summer I I don't

1568
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:46,240
think I've ever seen pm on cannabis

1569
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:48,519
except perhaps once when I was growing a

1570
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:50,399
cucumber in the same bed which I just I

1571
01:05:48,519 --> 01:05:52,000
w't make that mistake again but yeah as

1572
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:54,079
long as you're in veg super [ __ ] easy

1573
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,358
to De with just like lacto billus or

1574
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:58,160
like a milk spray or something like that

1575
01:05:56,358 --> 01:06:00,000
but um yeah boisterous is a big big

1576
01:05:58,159 --> 01:06:02,879
concern so like the photo that's in my

1577
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:05,039
little DP that was that year that we had

1578
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:06,680
monsoons um so the weather here is just

1579
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:09,200
[ __ ] man it'll be inconsistent

1580
01:06:06,679 --> 01:06:11,118
generally we can assume that in March um

1581
01:06:09,199 --> 01:06:12,838
which is I guess your September uh we're

1582
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:14,559
going to have so like Autumn you know

1583
01:06:12,838 --> 01:06:16,960
we're going to have a lot of rain so it

1584
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:19,119
always rains at Easter time um but this

1585
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:22,440
year was particularly bad so we had

1586
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:24,318
roughly 95% humidity and just torrential

1587
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:26,679
downpours for like two weeks straight

1588
01:06:24,318 --> 01:06:28,558
and that was about you know 2/3 of the

1589
01:06:26,679 --> 01:06:31,118
way through flower so you know big

1590
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:32,440
[ __ ] handr fun yeah it was [ __ ] out

1591
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:34,240
so there's like in that picture there

1592
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:36,119
there's a massive top over that and I

1593
01:06:34,239 --> 01:06:37,358
was out there most days or even when it

1594
01:06:36,119 --> 01:06:39,760
was raining really bad I was sort of

1595
01:06:37,358 --> 01:06:41,960
standing under there with like a broom

1596
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:45,119
every 20 minutes I just [ __ ] push the

1597
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:47,039
top up it was [ __ ] like never seen

1598
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:49,278
rain like that we had thousands of

1599
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:50,559
houses destroyed floods and [ __ ] yeah

1600
01:06:49,278 --> 01:06:52,079
but that year was cool man I only lost

1601
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:54,079
like a half a pound so that was like you

1602
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:55,960
know a tenth of that crop went to mold

1603
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:57,240
in the bin and the rest of it made it

1604
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:59,199
through which was good but that was the

1605
01:06:57,239 --> 01:07:03,318
genetics too that was like that sweet

1606
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:04,719
skunk uh S1 crossed jel so it was um

1607
01:07:03,318 --> 01:07:07,318
yeah it was good for the for the

1608
01:07:04,719 --> 01:07:09,038
conditions but yeah I've um one mistake

1609
01:07:07,318 --> 01:07:10,599
that I've made I always assume that our

1610
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:12,000
climate was the same as California but

1611
01:07:10,599 --> 01:07:14,079
you guys don't get a lot of rain in

1612
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,679
summer right it's it's mostly like

1613
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:19,160
winter time or fall we're a we're a

1614
01:07:16,679 --> 01:07:21,480
Mediterranean climate here in Northern

1615
01:07:19,159 --> 01:07:24,239
California well really all of California

1616
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:26,639
which is a a West Coast phenomenon so I

1617
01:07:24,239 --> 01:07:30,558
think you guys do have a mediter

1618
01:07:26,639 --> 01:07:33,199
Mediterranean climate in Perth yeah um

1619
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:34,720
but like that's you know the only places

1620
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:38,038
that happens

1621
01:07:34,719 --> 01:07:42,798
is on West Coast like west coast of

1622
01:07:38,039 --> 01:07:45,880
South America around Chile um Perth

1623
01:07:42,798 --> 01:07:47,960
Australia and then I forget where in

1624
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:49,880
Africa they get it but they Africa has

1625
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:52,199
that as well and then obviously the

1626
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:54,960
Mediterranean area up in

1627
01:07:52,199 --> 01:07:57,838
Europe but uh yeah that means warm warm

1628
01:07:54,960 --> 01:08:00,679
dry Summers and then mild

1629
01:07:57,838 --> 01:08:02,960
Winters so where could we have a similar

1630
01:08:00,679 --> 01:08:04,239
climate to in the states like orgon

1631
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:06,199
something like that do they get a little

1632
01:08:04,239 --> 01:08:08,439
rain in the summertime or still not

1633
01:08:06,199 --> 01:08:10,919
really yeah but they don't have they

1634
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:13,559
they don't h i mean maybe even further

1635
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:15,239
north um you might be more like an East

1636
01:08:13,559 --> 01:08:18,039
Coast climate

1637
01:08:15,239 --> 01:08:20,158
because they get they have a lot of

1638
01:08:18,039 --> 01:08:21,838
humidity and then they get it the

1639
01:08:20,158 --> 01:08:24,039
humidity just builds and builds and

1640
01:08:21,838 --> 01:08:25,600
builds and then they get a thunderstorm

1641
01:08:24,039 --> 01:08:28,679
like Florida or something like that

1642
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:30,319
probably even yeah maybe more like that

1643
01:08:28,679 --> 01:08:31,279
I've never lived out there so I don't

1644
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:34,359
know

1645
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:36,960
but if you're if you're humid and and

1646
01:08:34,359 --> 01:08:39,640
and and get a lot of rain in the in the

1647
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:43,158
summer like I think that's more of like

1648
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:45,079
an East Coast type thing yeah yeah it

1649
01:08:43,158 --> 01:08:46,798
can be rough at times some years we'll

1650
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:48,838
get a good year but yeah I I mostly

1651
01:08:46,798 --> 01:08:51,039
prefer like I'll start my [ __ ] later

1652
01:08:48,838 --> 01:08:53,119
like I love to have things finishing

1653
01:08:51,039 --> 01:08:54,719
around the May period so obviously for

1654
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:56,838
you guys it's too late snowing and [ __ ]

1655
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:59,000
by then but I yeah if I can stretch it

1656
01:08:56,838 --> 01:09:01,798
so starting things off say like November

1657
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,198
December instead of like September it

1658
01:09:01,798 --> 01:09:04,399
gives me just the extra few months so

1659
01:09:03,198 --> 01:09:06,079
I'm flowering when it's a little bit

1660
01:09:04,399 --> 01:09:08,000
drier and cooler and stuff like that

1661
01:09:06,079 --> 01:09:10,318
especially in the greenhouse wait so

1662
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:13,838
what would your may be equivalent to for

1663
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:14,880
them in terms of one before June so may

1664
01:09:13,838 --> 01:09:18,359
is like

1665
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:20,679
November yeah yeah yeah so that's like

1666
01:09:18,359 --> 01:09:22,679
the beginning of winter really for us

1667
01:09:20,679 --> 01:09:25,239
yeah too late see CU When I was buying

1668
01:09:22,679 --> 01:09:28,000
seeds ini I do have a few packs of stuff

1669
01:09:25,238 --> 01:09:30,399
from Sha I've got uh old Betsy cross to

1670
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,880
the Kush cleaner so I'm looking forward

1671
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:34,920
to them but I was man I've seen those

1672
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:37,119
grown out there's there's good stuff in

1673
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:39,039
there for sure fruit Jam yeah I got two

1674
01:09:37,119 --> 01:09:41,519
packs man so that's that's on top of the

1675
01:09:39,039 --> 01:09:43,158
list for when I get the new spot sorted

1676
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:45,279
it'll be cool I've got some Betsy across

1677
01:09:43,158 --> 01:09:47,439
to appy from um high and loansome as

1678
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:48,799
well so yeah be some cool [ __ ] I got

1679
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:51,519
some of that sitting in front of me

1680
01:09:48,798 --> 01:09:54,679
right now cured and ready to smoke oh

1681
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:57,880
man to burn down right after this damn

1682
01:09:54,679 --> 01:10:02,239
smell a vision yeah yeah what kind of

1683
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:04,840
nose you uh Pine Citrus a little bit of

1684
01:10:02,238 --> 01:10:06,919
mango not heavy mango and like a little

1685
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:10,079
cream little creaminess in it but lots

1686
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:11,679
of Pine and lots of mango damn CU yeah

1687
01:10:10,079 --> 01:10:15,399
that one sounds like it' be a mango bomb

1688
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:18,679
with the GC and the and the Betsy

1689
01:10:15,399 --> 01:10:21,799
yeah youna say something that have done

1690
01:10:18,679 --> 01:10:24,640
notoriously well in Northern California

1691
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:28,239
oh yeah the the the cush cleaner is well

1692
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:31,000
but um I don't know like tons of that's

1693
01:10:28,238 --> 01:10:33,639
been grown up here just the structure of

1694
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:36,359
the plants the finishing time the look

1695
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:39,400
of the nuggets the yield the quality of

1696
01:10:36,359 --> 01:10:42,479
the bud like those were big like popular

1697
01:10:39,399 --> 01:10:44,399
commercial producers up here I'm

1698
01:10:42,479 --> 01:10:47,759
thinking I GNA get me some skunk dog

1699
01:10:44,399 --> 01:10:49,238
because I've seen um gray skull in uh

1700
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:50,760
Hawaii with the skunk dog and that

1701
01:10:49,238 --> 01:10:53,079
apparently seems to do really well with

1702
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:56,440
humidity similar thing to the the bubble

1703
01:10:53,079 --> 01:10:58,439
gum oh oh yeah ABS absolutely they they

1704
01:10:56,439 --> 01:11:01,879
definitely have humidity out there that

1705
01:10:58,439 --> 01:11:03,919
would be a good thing to uh to look for

1706
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:05,880
is like so they're breeding for the most

1707
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:09,039
part they're breeding Outdoors out there

1708
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:11,039
I think like I I would assume most of

1709
01:11:09,039 --> 01:11:15,198
them are are are growing some type of

1710
01:11:11,039 --> 01:11:17,079
Depp or short season plant um so that

1711
01:11:15,198 --> 01:11:20,238
would be yeah sourcing some of their

1712
01:11:17,079 --> 01:11:24,679
genetics Joey weed or is is it

1713
01:11:20,238 --> 01:11:27,639
Joey P them yeah they be indoors as well

1714
01:11:24,679 --> 01:11:29,279
but I think yeah yeah totally totally

1715
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:31,920
that those would be good genetics to

1716
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:33,679
look into for for what might work well

1717
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:37,000
for you and they've got and dude and

1718
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:37,800
their weed out there is is tremendous

1719
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,279
they've

1720
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:42,639
got I mean you

1721
01:11:40,279 --> 01:11:45,079
know just the quality they're they're

1722
01:11:42,639 --> 01:11:47,159
growing and and and and what they're

1723
01:11:45,079 --> 01:11:49,960
doing out there especially those people

1724
01:11:47,158 --> 01:11:51,238
is it's it's it's the highest quality

1725
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:55,039
pot out

1726
01:11:51,238 --> 01:11:57,238
there even from the can like hp13 and

1727
01:11:55,039 --> 01:11:59,039
like the sour PE and stuff like that man

1728
01:11:57,238 --> 01:12:01,519
it always looked really good have to get

1729
01:11:59,039 --> 01:12:04,079
something like that going oh add some M

1730
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:06,880
Frost cost a TK man friend of mine gr

1731
01:12:04,079 --> 01:12:09,238
from Ochi um goat and monkey yeah it was

1732
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:11,039
the I think it was yeah reversed TK onto

1733
01:12:09,238 --> 01:12:13,319
that molai Frost and that was some good

1734
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:14,800
smoke man that was like yeah I wouldn't

1735
01:12:13,319 --> 01:12:16,639
say skunky but like certainly like

1736
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:19,239
rotten fruit I could get into it it was

1737
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:20,119
beautiful nice do you do you make your

1738
01:12:19,238 --> 01:12:23,559
own

1739
01:12:20,119 --> 01:12:25,158
seed not yet man hey I've um mostly just

1740
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:27,039
looking for clones I got some advice

1741
01:12:25,158 --> 01:12:30,279
early on like you know just get a bit of

1742
01:12:27,039 --> 01:12:31,800
a library going first which um okay yeah

1743
01:12:30,279 --> 01:12:33,158
so I will be once I've got the space

1744
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:35,039
definitely like doing more preservations

1745
01:12:33,158 --> 01:12:36,359
but I'm doing my first little project at

1746
01:12:35,039 --> 01:12:38,760
the moment I don't know if it's going to

1747
01:12:36,359 --> 01:12:41,759
work I did a I tried to reverse a clone

1748
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:45,079
I've got it's um thread cutter from CB

1749
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:48,360
so it's Rubber City chamd Afghani cross

1750
01:12:45,079 --> 01:12:50,639
to jel and so this one's pretty rank it

1751
01:12:48,359 --> 01:12:52,119
Stacks rather hard it's got a it's

1752
01:12:50,639 --> 01:12:53,440
pretty Hardy like it's been in the room

1753
01:12:52,119 --> 01:12:55,679
of things that have like got some might

1754
01:12:53,439 --> 01:12:57,439
damage and stuff and it just chugs along

1755
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:59,039
um yeah really ranked nose super

1756
01:12:57,439 --> 01:13:00,559
cerebral effect so I'm trying to reverse

1757
01:12:59,039 --> 01:13:02,399
that onto a couple of the sativas that

1758
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:04,320
I've got just to try and find a plant

1759
01:13:02,399 --> 01:13:06,000
that'll throw down some chunks outdoors

1760
01:13:04,319 --> 01:13:07,599
and have some nice stank to it so that's

1761
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,960
like my first little thing that I'm

1762
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:14,159
doing but never really made

1763
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:15,960
seed nice okay this is a perfect segue

1764
01:13:14,158 --> 01:13:18,479
by the way because I was going to prompt

1765
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:20,719
yall to talk about like yeah like I was

1766
01:13:18,479 --> 01:13:23,799
saying earlier lines or individual

1767
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:26,119
plants that have typically done well uh

1768
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:29,880
but also maybe you guys could talk about

1769
01:13:26,119 --> 01:13:33,399
individuals that did particularly poorly

1770
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:37,560
um yeah kind of already there so open

1771
01:13:33,399 --> 01:13:39,920
open to anyone so Kush I noticed you

1772
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:44,000
grew some some train wreck hybrids this

1773
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:47,920
year yes sir um I I've grown a few

1774
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:50,760
myself over the years and um the biggest

1775
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:54,000
yielding plant I've ever had is a train

1776
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:58,639
wreck to West Coast dog

1777
01:13:54,000 --> 01:14:01,319
and the the size of the colas were that

1778
01:13:58,639 --> 01:14:04,600
I mean they were as long as my arm just

1779
01:14:01,319 --> 01:14:06,639
dense all the way just the whole thing

1780
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:09,320
I've never had colas you can't see on

1781
01:14:06,639 --> 01:14:11,760
this the screen but like the length of

1782
01:14:09,319 --> 01:14:15,238
my arm is like the cola and then it

1783
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:17,039
branches off and goes into the plant um

1784
01:14:15,238 --> 01:14:21,519
by far the biggest yielding plants I've

1785
01:14:17,039 --> 01:14:24,399
ever had um the quality was just like me

1786
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:27,960
it it was like big dense

1787
01:14:24,399 --> 01:14:30,039
uh West Coast dog nugs not quite as

1788
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:32,639
dense as West Coast dog with like a

1789
01:14:30,039 --> 01:14:36,359
little bit of train wreck smell right um

1790
01:14:32,639 --> 01:14:41,560
so it was that terpinolene sort of smell

1791
01:14:36,359 --> 01:14:46,079
um super mids but total mold

1792
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:47,760
bomb uh like molded up like nobody's

1793
01:14:46,079 --> 01:14:50,719
business and I've grown West Coast dog

1794
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:54,039
out here um it finishes early so mold's

1795
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:58,279
not a problem and it it it smells like

1796
01:14:54,039 --> 01:14:59,679
hay but it looks beautiful in the bag so

1797
01:14:58,279 --> 01:15:01,479
you know it's just matter if you can

1798
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:03,520
sell it or not but

1799
01:15:01,479 --> 01:15:06,759
uh

1800
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:08,880
um that's that's something and I've

1801
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:10,719
grown train wreck and I've grown uh

1802
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:14,079
train rck backat crosses out here which

1803
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:15,520
all do great um they really need a lot

1804
01:15:14,079 --> 01:15:19,559
of support though because they're

1805
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:21,440
basically rubber um rubber stemmed um

1806
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:23,719
but uh yeah they bend over and twist

1807
01:15:21,439 --> 01:15:26,279
like without like like not

1808
01:15:23,719 --> 01:15:28,960
we five or six yeah but they're just

1809
01:15:26,279 --> 01:15:30,439
heavy you could be that's and I think

1810
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:31,760
that like honestly of all the train

1811
01:15:30,439 --> 01:15:33,799
wreck stories I don't know what's true

1812
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:37,239
or what's not true but like of all the

1813
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:39,119
train wreck stories I've heard um the

1814
01:15:37,238 --> 01:15:41,119
fact that you could grow a big plant

1815
01:15:39,119 --> 01:15:44,000
outdoors and have it just basically

1816
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:46,519
laying on the ground yeah looking like a

1817
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:48,279
mess like a train wreck basically I'm

1818
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:49,560
thinking that's where it got its name

1819
01:15:48,279 --> 01:15:52,079
because if you don't support those

1820
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:53,960
things and way back in the day like when

1821
01:15:52,079 --> 01:15:56,359
train wreck first came came around or at

1822
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:59,239
least first got out there that's like

1823
01:15:56,359 --> 01:16:02,319
you're talking like late 90s and nobody

1824
01:15:59,238 --> 01:16:05,238
was growing you know 99 in full sun at

1825
01:16:02,319 --> 01:16:06,319
that point and I'm thinking you know

1826
01:16:05,238 --> 01:16:09,319
they're they're growing them you know

1827
01:16:06,319 --> 01:16:11,799
under a tree somewhere and like not you

1828
01:16:09,319 --> 01:16:14,599
know setting up cages and trellis

1829
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:16,239
netting and all this stuff and it's like

1830
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:18,000
those plants are looking like absolute

1831
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:19,879
train wrecks because they're laying flat

1832
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,039
on the ground without a broken stem on

1833
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:24,840
them right but just laying basically

1834
01:16:22,039 --> 01:16:27,119
just laying on the ground growing like a

1835
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:28,960
like a ground cover I would assume and

1836
01:16:27,119 --> 01:16:31,800
that's how it's got its name that's my

1837
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:34,119
guess like it's it makes total sense I

1838
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:35,880
love that I would have to agree out of

1839
01:16:34,119 --> 01:16:37,679
all the names that or the reasons I've

1840
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:39,319
heard the names you know like people

1841
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:41,600
pick the names and all the wild [ __ ]

1842
01:16:39,319 --> 01:16:43,840
people said like it seems really obvious

1843
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:45,960
to me that that's probably the Genesis

1844
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:48,800
of at least that name for it because it

1845
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:51,000
does look like a mess like it's

1846
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:52,400
considered creeper style like if you see

1847
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:55,079
Neville's old catalog and he talks about

1848
01:16:52,399 --> 01:16:56,839
the creeper f types that's supposedly

1849
01:16:55,079 --> 01:17:00,119
what that look is where the apical Bud

1850
01:16:56,840 --> 01:17:02,279
grows like lower than the other buds you

1851
01:17:00,119 --> 01:17:04,039
know just kind of like that and and

1852
01:17:02,279 --> 01:17:06,279
that's kind of like that mother [ __ ]

1853
01:17:04,039 --> 01:17:08,920
NATO is talking about that they also

1854
01:17:06,279 --> 01:17:11,039
mention in the can Bible I never saw

1855
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:12,679
that I never saw that one but I was

1856
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:15,399
always interested to see it just because

1857
01:17:12,679 --> 01:17:18,359
of how it grows yeah yeah that always

1858
01:17:15,399 --> 01:17:19,960
held myh Fascination to no one knows

1859
01:17:18,359 --> 01:17:21,519
what the train wreck is right like I

1860
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:23,719
spoke to pack and he said he thinks it

1861
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:25,440
has Tai in it but would anyone have any

1862
01:17:23,719 --> 01:17:28,319
idea like just a Thai afghan that

1863
01:17:25,439 --> 01:17:29,759
someone kept or I figured if Caleb

1864
01:17:28,319 --> 01:17:31,599
doesn't know then probably no one's

1865
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:33,119
going to really have a good grasp on it

1866
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:35,120
because he's had it for so long and

1867
01:17:33,119 --> 01:17:36,599
really searched out the history and it

1868
01:17:35,119 --> 01:17:38,559
predate does it predate a lot of the

1869
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:40,920
seed bank [ __ ] because it's from like

1870
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:42,600
the 8S right or 90s we're not sure 90s

1871
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:44,960
or ' 80s I think we don't even know the

1872
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:47,600
the true Genesis of it but it's old than

1873
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:49,359
I don't think we know the I mean the

1874
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:53,440
first I heard of it was probably around

1875
01:17:49,359 --> 01:17:55,759
99 or 2000 yeah and so that means even

1876
01:17:53,439 --> 01:17:57,919
if it makes its way down to the Bay area

1877
01:17:55,760 --> 01:18:00,079
where I was just south of the Emerald

1878
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:03,319
Triangle that's like the first named

1879
01:18:00,079 --> 01:18:04,880
weed I ever knew and I loved it it was

1880
01:18:03,319 --> 01:18:06,920
it was awesome it was so much different

1881
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:08,319
than what else was out there and there

1882
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:10,319
was you know there was still good weed

1883
01:18:08,319 --> 01:18:13,279
out there but

1884
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:16,759
um so like if it took that long to get

1885
01:18:13,279 --> 01:18:18,840
to me like when I'm like 17 18 years old

1886
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:21,600
um I'm guessing I'm guessing it had been

1887
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:23,960
around since at least the mid90s but

1888
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:27,280
more likely before that even just before

1889
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:29,079
it like it gets released or gets off of

1890
01:18:27,279 --> 01:18:33,279
that Hill wherever it

1891
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:35,719
started um the the the TPS on it like

1892
01:18:33,279 --> 01:18:38,639
train wreck TPS or Jack TPS or

1893
01:18:35,719 --> 01:18:41,158
terpinolene or whatever that may be like

1894
01:18:38,639 --> 01:18:43,319
yeah that's super common for all those

1895
01:18:41,158 --> 01:18:46,479
sort of

1896
01:18:43,319 --> 01:18:48,840
like like narrow Leaf varieties maybe

1897
01:18:46,479 --> 01:18:50,678
not so much the tie but like definitely

1898
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:51,600
some of the Panama definitely some of

1899
01:18:50,679 --> 01:18:53,440
the

1900
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:56,679
Colombian um

1901
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:59,799
but like the look of it I haven't seen

1902
01:18:56,679 --> 01:19:03,039
anything that that looks quite like it

1903
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:05,639
yeah same pretty those those

1904
01:19:03,039 --> 01:19:08,198
specifically the large conical-shaped

1905
01:19:05,639 --> 01:19:10,159
buds the way that they they perect

1906
01:19:08,198 --> 01:19:12,799
they're not triangular but they have

1907
01:19:10,158 --> 01:19:15,119
cone they're almost a cone shape at the

1908
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:18,159
base that goes up it's um yeah it's

1909
01:19:15,119 --> 01:19:20,800
funny you mention that cuz the the

1910
01:19:18,158 --> 01:19:23,359
outcrosses of train wreck that I see

1911
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:26,520
seem to get like a gigantic

1912
01:19:23,359 --> 01:19:29,839
like when it uh the train wreck on its

1913
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:33,520
own it has decent it has decent sized

1914
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:36,679
buds but when I saw it cross to Calo um

1915
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:39,239
two years ago and when I saw it cross to

1916
01:19:36,679 --> 01:19:42,399
Salmon Creek big bud about five or six

1917
01:19:39,238 --> 01:19:45,158
years ago that I grew they both were

1918
01:19:42,399 --> 01:19:48,799
soda can like mad dog like 40 ounce soda

1919
01:19:45,158 --> 01:19:52,559
can colas that were were obnoxious and

1920
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:54,159
um I just it seems that when when you

1921
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:55,719
when you cross her out to something she

1922
01:19:54,158 --> 01:19:58,238
she just takes off with that that

1923
01:19:55,719 --> 01:20:00,399
genetic and you can see it in her you

1924
01:19:58,238 --> 01:20:02,718
can see it across multi like the second

1925
01:20:00,399 --> 01:20:05,198
I popped that Calo to train wreck from

1926
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:07,399
CSI I was looking at this and I was like

1927
01:20:05,198 --> 01:20:08,599
man my my brain says train wreck I'm

1928
01:20:07,399 --> 01:20:12,119
looking at the way these buds are

1929
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:15,039
forming and it uh it just like two a te

1930
01:20:12,119 --> 01:20:19,279
followed in with it and I I see those

1931
01:20:15,039 --> 01:20:22,960
same things um from P atw so through

1932
01:20:19,279 --> 01:20:26,158
csis hybrids and the S1 all the way over

1933
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:28,319
to what um what pack is is dealing with

1934
01:20:26,158 --> 01:20:32,198
there's there's the similarity of that

1935
01:20:28,319 --> 01:20:34,880
conical shaped um just like it it has it

1936
01:20:32,198 --> 01:20:36,960
has that that recognizable pattern to it

1937
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:40,800
that I don't see in a lot of other

1938
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:43,399
places is there any like sense that you

1939
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:44,840
guys associate with something that will

1940
01:20:43,399 --> 01:20:48,039
be mold

1941
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:50,199
resistant a s PM or mold resistant

1942
01:20:48,039 --> 01:20:51,719
either

1943
01:20:50,198 --> 01:20:54,719
order

1944
01:20:51,719 --> 01:20:54,719
uh

1945
01:20:55,279 --> 01:21:01,000
nah I think it's more like floral sh

1946
01:20:57,639 --> 01:21:02,880
definitely bud structure yeah so so the

1947
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,960
one thing i' that I've seen hold true so

1948
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:07,560
far is

1949
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:09,679
strawberry tends to like even stuff from

1950
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:12,120
erdbeer erdbeer is known to be super

1951
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:14,119
super uh mold and PM resistance and you

1952
01:21:12,119 --> 01:21:16,119
know it was built out in Switzerland

1953
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:19,599
where it's really really humid and it

1954
01:21:16,119 --> 01:21:21,439
needs to finish Fast um and uh you know

1955
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:23,239
all the way to Strawberry cost up it it

1956
01:21:21,439 --> 01:21:26,399
breeds true for

1957
01:21:23,238 --> 01:21:28,559
uh all sorts of PM and mold resistance

1958
01:21:26,399 --> 01:21:29,679
so I I always wondered if that was like

1959
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:31,800
because it carries so heavy with

1960
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:36,440
strawberry if there were other scents

1961
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:36,440
that may also kind of do that wasn't

1962
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:44,239
sure are there any I haven't noticed

1963
01:21:41,439 --> 01:21:46,000
anything scent related yeah I can't I

1964
01:21:44,238 --> 01:21:51,238
can't make correlations with I can make

1965
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:53,479
correlations with uh peppery and and uh

1966
01:21:51,238 --> 01:21:57,879
with uh really spicy spy plants that

1967
01:21:53,479 --> 01:22:00,319
have uh pest resistance uh I've grown a

1968
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:03,239
couple of different ones that smell like

1969
01:22:00,319 --> 01:22:06,399
black ground pepper or white pepper and

1970
01:22:03,238 --> 01:22:08,039
they are almost Untouched by by

1971
01:22:06,399 --> 01:22:10,119
insects

1972
01:22:08,039 --> 01:22:12,439
yeah that that's interesting I didn't

1973
01:22:10,119 --> 01:22:16,000
know that part um that That Girl Scout

1974
01:22:12,439 --> 01:22:18,519
cookie uh Savage purple that you and Bri

1975
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:21,319
uh Bren tried um that thing smelled like

1976
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:23,280
pepper and yeah when I microscop it and

1977
01:22:21,319 --> 01:22:26,439
when I'm I'm taking a closer look at it

1978
01:22:23,279 --> 01:22:30,639
I'm not seeing a a single bug no no uh

1979
01:22:26,439 --> 01:22:32,399
no exoskeletons no no FR you know Left

1980
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:33,960
Behind from any wings or anything it's

1981
01:22:32,399 --> 01:22:35,719
like they just don't don't even want to

1982
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:37,760
touch it that's

1983
01:22:35,719 --> 01:22:40,439
interesting I'm I'm trying to find

1984
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:43,600
something goer proof like I've been

1985
01:22:40,439 --> 01:22:45,960
fighting these things I got I got these

1986
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:47,520
this pole thing called a gopher Hawk you

1987
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:50,158
guys ever seen this

1988
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:51,920
sh yeah like it's I'm battling these

1989
01:22:50,158 --> 01:22:53,439
mother they're tearing my yard up and I

1990
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:55,800
want it plant

1991
01:22:53,439 --> 01:22:57,839
I can't dude I'm so catty Shack right

1992
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:59,719
now I love that Mt is like quietly

1993
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:01,639
growing Outdoors but no one really knows

1994
01:22:59,719 --> 01:23:03,319
that right now I was gonna say I saw

1995
01:23:01,639 --> 01:23:05,239
those cherry tomatoes you were growing

1996
01:23:03,319 --> 01:23:06,719
son put a auto out there or something

1997
01:23:05,238 --> 01:23:08,879
yeah I don't even I don't count my

1998
01:23:06,719 --> 01:23:10,560
outdoor because I suck at outdoor like

1999
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:12,319
I'm still learning so I don't count this

2000
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:16,039
as growing this is just learning it's

2001
01:23:12,319 --> 01:23:16,039
not my it's not my

2002
01:23:17,439 --> 01:23:21,919
specialty yeah fair

2003
01:23:19,399 --> 01:23:23,679
enough learning curves to everything

2004
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:26,319
especially in a brutal climate like

2005
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:28,000
Bakerfield bro and and you've even just

2006
01:23:26,319 --> 01:23:29,719
talking to little Hills taught me a lot

2007
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,359
like I was trying to bring in the indoor

2008
01:23:29,719 --> 01:23:32,520
method to outdoor and just like of

2009
01:23:31,359 --> 01:23:34,839
course I'm going to put it in a five

2010
01:23:32,520 --> 01:23:36,600
gallon why the [ __ ] wouldn't I but

2011
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:38,039
that's not like realistic if you're

2012
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:39,679
putting it out at the beginning of the

2013
01:23:38,039 --> 01:23:41,600
season in a five gallon pot and thinking

2014
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:43,000
you're G to get dank like and I'm bottle

2015
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:44,520
feeding out like there's so many things

2016
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:46,639
I'm doing backwards so it's been a

2017
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:49,520
learning learning cve for

2018
01:23:46,639 --> 01:23:51,560
sure especially trying to grow anything

2019
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:55,120
if you're putting in the black pot on

2020
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:57,960
cement or something it's just like yes

2021
01:23:55,119 --> 01:24:00,599
it's 150 degrees at the root ball I had

2022
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:02,480
him right next to a a brick wall too so

2023
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:04,880
my neighbor couldn't see anything on

2024
01:24:02,479 --> 01:24:06,479
cement so it's just cooking like there's

2025
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:08,800
so many common sense things I didn't

2026
01:24:06,479 --> 01:24:10,559
take into account that that that aren't

2027
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:13,159
common sense for indoor and I've been so

2028
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:15,520
indoor Centric for so long like none of

2029
01:24:13,158 --> 01:24:17,359
it was checking out until like after a

2030
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:20,040
season of it I'm going oh my God I'm

2031
01:24:17,359 --> 01:24:21,960
such an idiot so most of this episode

2032
01:24:20,039 --> 01:24:23,560
I'm just tuning in and listening because

2033
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:25,158
I don't really have much of a place to

2034
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:29,280
speak here I want to

2035
01:24:25,158 --> 01:24:31,559
learn yeah I I would plant late honestly

2036
01:24:29,279 --> 01:24:34,800
um put put them out at the beginning of

2037
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:36,480
August and and then pot them up into

2038
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:39,320
into whatever size you want them to

2039
01:24:36,479 --> 01:24:42,118
finish and so like if you veg them up in

2040
01:24:39,319 --> 01:24:44,679
six inch pots you know pot them up into

2041
01:24:42,118 --> 01:24:47,679
like a 10 gallon in August and that way

2042
01:24:44,679 --> 01:24:51,158
like it won't really get root bound too

2043
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:53,118
bad or or or if it does happen it'll be

2044
01:24:51,158 --> 01:24:54,439
you'll be well into FL already because

2045
01:24:53,118 --> 01:24:57,118
you want those roots to be able to

2046
01:24:54,439 --> 01:24:58,799
stretch as they as the plant stretches

2047
01:24:57,118 --> 01:25:02,238
you want the roots to be able to stretch

2048
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:04,039
as well yeah and uh so not not going too

2049
01:25:02,238 --> 01:25:05,519
small on pot size which also helps

2050
01:25:04,039 --> 01:25:08,319
regulate the

2051
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:11,440
temperature and not having it on cement

2052
01:25:08,319 --> 01:25:13,238
or or or uh shading the pot with

2053
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:16,118
something yeah like you were talking

2054
01:25:13,238 --> 01:25:18,559
about yeah putting a board just leaning

2055
01:25:16,118 --> 01:25:21,599
a board up against it um or against up

2056
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:23,960
all the pots or whatever uh but like I

2057
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:26,239
like the L the late planting like

2058
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:28,480
there's no reason to get out at like you

2059
01:25:26,238 --> 01:25:31,439
know Solstice or right before Solstice

2060
01:25:28,479 --> 01:25:32,718
in June um if you if you don't have to

2061
01:25:31,439 --> 01:25:34,519
like back in the day when we're trying

2062
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:36,920
to grow big plants up here because plant

2063
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:38,880
numbers was such an issue yeah like yeah

2064
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:41,560
you want to maximize all your veg time

2065
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:45,679
and try and get 10 pounds on on a plant

2066
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:48,119
but um nowadays like if it's a

2067
01:25:45,679 --> 01:25:51,560
misdemeanor regardless so put out a

2068
01:25:48,118 --> 01:25:53,599
thousand if you want like in a you know

2069
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:56,760
and you'll do fun or whatever the case

2070
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:58,639
may be like it's just so hard to keep it

2071
01:25:56,760 --> 01:26:01,159
happy that long and like if you're not

2072
01:25:58,639 --> 01:26:03,520
going to go all out and put it in a 300

2073
01:26:01,158 --> 01:26:05,079
gallon pot or something like that then

2074
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:06,880
yeah you might as well just wait till

2075
01:26:05,079 --> 01:26:08,439
later and like you're going to get like

2076
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:10,319
the quality of your Bud's going to be

2077
01:26:08,439 --> 01:26:12,039
way nicer than it would be off a 10

2078
01:26:10,319 --> 01:26:14,079
pound plant oh for sure you know if you

2079
01:26:12,039 --> 01:26:16,920
just throw a little half ounce plant or

2080
01:26:14,079 --> 01:26:19,519
excuse me a half pound P or whatever the

2081
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:23,520
case whatever the case may be that's why

2082
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:26,400
I'm growing like smaller plants in uh

2083
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:27,960
in my outdoor is is is one because I

2084
01:26:26,399 --> 01:26:30,960
want a smaller

2085
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:33,719
stem and I want it to look more like de

2086
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:36,600
or more like indoor ideally right yeah

2087
01:26:33,719 --> 01:26:39,079
but also like it just works perfectly

2088
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:42,280
with my system like we're busy planning

2089
01:26:39,079 --> 01:26:46,840
my green houses in April and

2090
01:26:42,279 --> 01:26:48,479
May and then like I guess even into June

2091
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:50,199
we're still planting green houses

2092
01:26:48,479 --> 01:26:52,678
sometimes and then once those are

2093
01:26:50,198 --> 01:26:54,759
planted then we can work on the outdoor

2094
01:26:52,679 --> 01:26:57,199
crop and get the next wave of plants

2095
01:26:54,760 --> 01:27:00,280
like cloned and grown up and plant the

2096
01:26:57,198 --> 01:27:02,399
outdoor and then I'm in no rush to get

2097
01:27:00,279 --> 01:27:04,479
in the outdoor like at the same time as

2098
01:27:02,399 --> 01:27:05,960
I'm trying to get into everything else

2099
01:27:04,479 --> 01:27:07,959
because I got to get into my green

2100
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:10,719
houses early to pull off two

2101
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:12,158
crops um and and take advantage of like

2102
01:27:10,719 --> 01:27:14,679
the sort of season extension a

2103
01:27:12,158 --> 01:27:16,920
greenhouse gives you and because I just

2104
01:27:14,679 --> 01:27:18,960
once you lose Sun it doesn't matter and

2105
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:22,000
then you know it just works perfectly

2106
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:23,800
into my system and then and then I kind

2107
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:27,198
of get the best of both worlds in a

2108
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:29,480
sense and uh I don't know just for me

2109
01:27:27,198 --> 01:27:31,839
that that's that works super well and

2110
01:27:29,479 --> 01:27:33,759
and honestly I'm sure people would have

2111
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:37,719
been growing like this a lot

2112
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:39,719
sooner um if plant numbers were never an

2113
01:27:37,719 --> 01:27:41,800
issue and that's the same reason I

2114
01:27:39,719 --> 01:27:44,359
didn't go super deep on my beds you know

2115
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:45,760
it's six inches of potting soil with

2116
01:27:44,359 --> 01:27:47,559
like another three or four inches of

2117
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:50,239
amended native soil

2118
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:52,719
underneath and like they don't they

2119
01:27:50,238 --> 01:27:55,000
don't need 18 in of soil

2120
01:27:52,719 --> 01:27:58,039
of potting soil to uh to stretch their

2121
01:27:55,000 --> 01:28:00,198
Roots out like they they they they do

2122
01:27:58,039 --> 01:28:01,880
fill those beds out by the end of it but

2123
01:28:00,198 --> 01:28:04,198
I want that and then the maybe the roots

2124
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:07,560
will start going deeper to find extra

2125
01:28:04,198 --> 01:28:10,319
water but uh I mean that's all they need

2126
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:12,159
I don't want them to well I guess the

2127
01:28:10,319 --> 01:28:13,479
other side of this is a rootbound

2128
01:28:12,158 --> 01:28:15,439
plant's going to trigger and start

2129
01:28:13,479 --> 01:28:18,599
flowering earlier and sometimes that can

2130
01:28:15,439 --> 01:28:20,319
be to your advantage but like usually

2131
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:21,840
usually not because you're you're

2132
01:28:20,319 --> 01:28:23,639
fighting this uphill battle at that

2133
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:26,400
point point to keep the plant with

2134
01:28:23,639 --> 01:28:28,480
enough nutrients and watering it four

2135
01:28:26,399 --> 01:28:31,279
times a day or whatever whatever even

2136
01:28:28,479 --> 01:28:35,799
more with like 114 yeah yeah it's gonna

2137
01:28:31,279 --> 01:28:38,479
be drying that pot out super fast so you

2138
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:40,279
know it's just like manipulating certain

2139
01:28:38,479 --> 01:28:42,198
things to to your advantage but not

2140
01:28:40,279 --> 01:28:45,359
letting them be the variable that really

2141
01:28:42,198 --> 01:28:48,118
like ruins your season like you know

2142
01:28:45,359 --> 01:28:49,719
trying to grow a a fullterm plant in a

2143
01:28:48,118 --> 01:28:51,799
five gallon pot it's just you're going

2144
01:28:49,719 --> 01:28:54,039
to be fighting uphill and I I see PE I

2145
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:56,800
mean people you you'd be surprised how

2146
01:28:54,039 --> 01:28:59,639
many people do this not really realizing

2147
01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:02,440
thinking that 45 gallon pot they planted

2148
01:28:59,639 --> 01:29:04,760
in June is g to be enough yeah and it's

2149
01:29:02,439 --> 01:29:07,238
it's not like unless you want to feed it

2150
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:09,920
four times a day and and have to pump it

2151
01:29:07,238 --> 01:29:12,118
full of salts because you know there's

2152
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:13,520
there's not enough there's there's not

2153
01:29:12,118 --> 01:29:17,399
enough nutrients in your soil there's

2154
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:20,159
not enough soil um you're not going to

2155
01:29:17,399 --> 01:29:22,879
have like all all all these things

2156
01:29:20,158 --> 01:29:24,599
together um I mean I've had friends do

2157
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:27,319
this over I've watched them and it's

2158
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:29,800
like they never listen to me and then

2159
01:29:27,319 --> 01:29:32,880
and then they go through one season you

2160
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:34,880
know on their backyard grow and they

2161
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:36,719
realized what I was talking about like

2162
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:40,159
don't veg your plants out to six feet

2163
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:44,000
tall in February and then put them out

2164
01:29:40,158 --> 01:29:46,000
in June in the 100 gallon pot thinking

2165
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:48,118
you're gonna end up with a 50 pound

2166
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:50,118
plant it's not going to happen you're G

2167
01:29:48,118 --> 01:29:53,158
to end up with a shitty ass plant that

2168
01:29:50,118 --> 01:29:55,799
grows ugly Bud because the plants sick

2169
01:29:53,158 --> 01:29:58,399
the whole time you'd be better off

2170
01:29:55,800 --> 01:30:01,279
waiting till June and put out like a one

2171
01:29:58,399 --> 01:30:04,198
foot tall plant you know that you veg

2172
01:30:01,279 --> 01:30:05,880
for a month or whatever or or maybe less

2173
01:30:04,198 --> 01:30:09,039
and you'll end up with more and it'll be

2174
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:10,880
better weed at the end of the day yeah I

2175
01:30:09,039 --> 01:30:12,760
was trying to play mostly the game that

2176
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:14,639
I have a Snoopy neighbor and like I

2177
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:17,280
wanted to be able to move the plants you

2178
01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:18,960
know move keep them moving essentially

2179
01:30:17,279 --> 01:30:20,679
so wherever like CU he likes to get up

2180
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:23,960
on ladders and look just be a little

2181
01:30:20,679 --> 01:30:25,560
[ __ ] so I like to keep them moving and

2182
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:27,279
you can't really do that in smaller pots

2183
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:29,360
so I was trying to play the indoor game

2184
01:30:27,279 --> 01:30:31,399
of being stealth outdoor when

2185
01:30:29,359 --> 01:30:34,599
realistically just the smells in the

2186
01:30:31,399 --> 01:30:36,559
morning alone like ruin all stale for me

2187
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:39,159
you know yeah and then if you got them

2188
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:41,520
vegged out all summer like that's more

2189
01:30:39,158 --> 01:30:44,238
time for for him to see him where if if

2190
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:46,239
like one like there's nothing until

2191
01:30:44,238 --> 01:30:49,238
August and then all of a sudden there's

2192
01:30:46,238 --> 01:30:52,599
like a little screen over your patio or

2193
01:30:49,238 --> 01:30:54,919
something come AUST like going to flower

2194
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:56,880
out and you're going to be you're G to

2195
01:30:54,920 --> 01:31:01,279
you know they're going to be done by by

2196
01:30:56,880 --> 01:31:04,400
then you know so yeah I like I I I heard

2197
01:31:01,279 --> 01:31:06,359
of a guy I've never seen it myself but

2198
01:31:04,399 --> 01:31:09,279
he told me about it a long time ago he

2199
01:31:06,359 --> 01:31:12,960
would root a clone upside

2200
01:31:09,279 --> 01:31:14,920
down so that the branch you know how the

2201
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:17,039
branches want to come up like this off

2202
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:19,719
the stem yeah but he would root it

2203
01:31:17,039 --> 01:31:22,039
upside down so he could so it would come

2204
01:31:19,719 --> 01:31:24,920
like this and he could bend it horizont

2205
01:31:22,039 --> 01:31:27,600
Al yeah that work yeah I know Mak sense

2206
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:30,319
it was rooted upside down and then it's

2207
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:32,320
easier to bend those branches and get

2208
01:31:30,319 --> 01:31:35,399
them going horizontally along a fence

2209
01:31:32,319 --> 01:31:38,279
and keep them low then to bend them you

2210
01:31:35,399 --> 01:31:40,039
know that way and have them split you

2211
01:31:38,279 --> 01:31:42,559
know what I mean how did the roots grow

2212
01:31:40,039 --> 01:31:44,359
that way done it did they try toow

2213
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:46,600
technique I heard about like did they

2214
01:31:44,359 --> 01:31:48,158
try to grow down and around the pl top

2215
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:49,719
of the plug when he was hanging did he

2216
01:31:48,158 --> 01:31:52,519
hang them upside down and have the tray

2217
01:31:49,719 --> 01:31:54,198
upside down to root them

2218
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:56,440
no I think he just turned the Clone

2219
01:31:54,198 --> 01:31:59,879
upside down to root instead of

2220
01:31:56,439 --> 01:32:03,158
rooting you know the like he didn't have

2221
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:04,840
a top on the he just branches yeah so

2222
01:32:03,158 --> 01:32:06,960
then he just turned it upside down left

2223
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:09,560
a l bunch of stem I guess it's hard to

2224
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:12,198
say left a bunch of stem on the top to

2225
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:14,080
root that yes and then the and then the

2226
01:32:12,198 --> 01:32:17,079
branches were already coming out this

2227
01:32:14,079 --> 01:32:20,559
way so then they easily go

2228
01:32:17,079 --> 01:32:21,880
horizontal instead of a a regular plant

2229
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:23,840
with the branches like this and then

2230
01:32:21,880 --> 01:32:26,880
trying to bend them back down where

2231
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:28,880
they'll split so and he he did all of

2232
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:30,719
that to Trellis it along a fence so his

2233
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:32,319
neighbors couldn't see so essentially

2234
01:32:30,719 --> 01:32:34,319
what you're saying is like it's a normal

2235
01:32:32,319 --> 01:32:36,799
growing plant like this he cuts the top

2236
01:32:34,319 --> 01:32:38,279
off Cuts this off right here flips that

2237
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:40,320
[ __ ] upside down and Roots this part

2238
01:32:38,279 --> 01:32:42,279
without the top Roots yeah Roots the top

2239
01:32:40,319 --> 01:32:44,719
stem with the two branches on it the two

2240
01:32:42,279 --> 01:32:46,800
branches over here fully leave yeah

2241
01:32:44,719 --> 01:32:49,439
that's wild wild man yeah yeah just to

2242
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:52,279
just to bend them horizontally

2243
01:32:49,439 --> 01:32:53,960
easier he said it worked I believe them

2244
01:32:52,279 --> 01:32:55,519
you know yeah I know I mean like it's

2245
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:58,359
it's a novel idea it's Unique it's out

2246
01:32:55,520 --> 01:33:00,400
of the box yeah I haven't seen that one

2247
01:32:58,359 --> 01:33:03,439
but I've seen like all that kind of [ __ ]

2248
01:33:00,399 --> 01:33:05,158
like my um mate's dad who was like one

2249
01:33:03,439 --> 01:33:07,279
of my best mates and taught me growing

2250
01:33:05,158 --> 01:33:09,719
and stuff um he used to grow a lot of

2251
01:33:07,279 --> 01:33:11,479
like Southeast Asian sort of weed so

2252
01:33:09,719 --> 01:33:14,439
nothing super crazy but it was just he

2253
01:33:11,479 --> 01:33:16,279
imported from you know 70s 80s 90s

2254
01:33:14,439 --> 01:33:18,238
because he's in his 60s um and then just

2255
01:33:16,279 --> 01:33:19,719
the remnant seed he just you know pull

2256
01:33:18,238 --> 01:33:21,839
seed out of each butt each year and just

2257
01:33:19,719 --> 01:33:23,520
keep it in a in a jar so it was

2258
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:25,920
basically like some sort of op but

2259
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:27,679
nothing too great but man because he had

2260
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:30,118
like pretty small fences he would do all

2261
01:33:27,679 --> 01:33:31,679
that [ __ ] so like layerage where you're

2262
01:33:30,118 --> 01:33:33,799
getting like branches and burying the

2263
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:35,520
branches in the ground to get like more

2264
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:37,320
um more roots and stuff on them so

2265
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:39,480
you're getting like more water he'd do

2266
01:33:37,319 --> 01:33:41,079
the almost grow it like a grape vine

2267
01:33:39,479 --> 01:33:42,678
have like a single stalk and then just

2268
01:33:41,079 --> 01:33:44,158
like grow it sideways so that would have

2269
01:33:42,679 --> 01:33:47,079
been an advantageous doing the Clones

2270
01:33:44,158 --> 01:33:48,759
like that like anelia yeah like yeah

2271
01:33:47,079 --> 01:33:50,479
yeah yeah similar to a grape vine you

2272
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:52,719
know you'll get like it'll be 3 m long

2273
01:33:50,479 --> 01:33:55,919
and only like a meter tall it's crazy

2274
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:58,880
that's that's also a giant pumpkin uh

2275
01:33:55,920 --> 01:34:02,079
technique to grow

2276
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:03,400
your grow your pumpkin plant you know

2277
01:34:02,079 --> 01:34:05,279
obviously you're chopping off all the

2278
01:34:03,399 --> 01:34:07,799
other pumpkins except your one but then

2279
01:34:05,279 --> 01:34:10,960
you bury the the vine again to grow

2280
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:13,000
roots and then let it come back up so

2281
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:15,760
that you've got this huge root system

2282
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:18,079
for this one pumpkin on this giant plant

2283
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:20,159
I mean the the pump the Big Pumpkin

2284
01:34:18,079 --> 01:34:23,039
Growers they have these plants that take

2285
01:34:20,158 --> 01:34:25,920
up like you know a th000 square feet or

2286
01:34:23,039 --> 01:34:27,399
2,000 square feet it's one pumpkin plant

2287
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:31,000
but it's got vines that have been

2288
01:34:27,399 --> 01:34:33,158
continuously buried to grow roots and

2289
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:36,039
all that energy just ends up at one

2290
01:34:33,158 --> 01:34:39,839
growth site that's so

2291
01:34:36,039 --> 01:34:43,399
crazy PP yeah CSI CSI wants to jump in

2292
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:44,920
on the pumpkin growing scenario has he

2293
01:34:43,399 --> 01:34:47,039
talk to you about

2294
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:48,800
that I know he's into it I've never

2295
01:34:47,039 --> 01:34:51,039
talked to him about it he used to do

2296
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:53,520
some some some funny games back in the

2297
01:34:51,039 --> 01:34:57,519
day with uh guess how much this bed will

2298
01:34:53,520 --> 01:35:00,560
weigh yeah bet I uh but I don't know

2299
01:34:57,520 --> 01:35:03,560
they just uh the record just got broken

2300
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:06,679
for uh for the giant pumpkin down in

2301
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:09,440
Half Moon Bay 2700

2302
01:35:06,679 --> 01:35:13,800
pounds saw that recently is insane and

2303
01:35:09,439 --> 01:35:15,799
it's uh it's it's just amazing it's it's

2304
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:18,039
and they're just it's just organic like

2305
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:20,520
super pumping their plants tons of

2306
01:35:18,039 --> 01:35:21,960
microbes tons of Rich Earth tons of

2307
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:23,360
compost

2308
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:24,880
um I I don't know what else they're

2309
01:35:23,359 --> 01:35:27,238
doing I mean I'm sure the guys have a

2310
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:29,800
lot of tricks but like that's that's one

2311
01:35:27,238 --> 01:35:32,678
of them that that is just super

2312
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:35,800
interesting gourd that's

2313
01:35:32,679 --> 01:35:35,800
interesting get

2314
01:35:37,439 --> 01:35:41,960
it one thing that booze did gesture

2315
01:35:40,158 --> 01:35:43,879
towards that I I wanted him to talk

2316
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:48,439
about a bit more is actually some of the

2317
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:51,039
nld Leaning stuff that he likes to

2318
01:35:48,439 --> 01:35:52,879
run yeah you tell us a bit more about

2319
01:35:51,039 --> 01:35:54,880
what you experiened so far with those

2320
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:56,920
outside yeah man it's more of just the

2321
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:59,159
climatic concern for me I mean I like I

2322
01:35:56,920 --> 01:36:00,920
appreciate the high more as well like I

2323
01:35:59,158 --> 01:36:02,559
um when I was in Amsterdam that was

2324
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:04,800
mostly what I was buying just like the

2325
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:06,880
sativas and the various Haze crosses and

2326
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:08,679
stuff like that so it's my preference in

2327
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:11,000
terms of smoke um and yeah it just

2328
01:36:08,679 --> 01:36:14,239
happens to grow well here as well so

2329
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:16,238
generally yeah man um my best success I

2330
01:36:14,238 --> 01:36:18,039
guess is probably that um the Death in

2331
01:36:16,238 --> 01:36:22,000
Venice that I did so that was the sweets

2332
01:36:18,039 --> 01:36:25,039
Gunk S1 cross to the jel um was that

2333
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:27,639
sort of super tendine bombs hazy effect

2334
01:36:25,039 --> 01:36:30,800
that I like um yeah aside from that man

2335
01:36:27,639 --> 01:36:33,079
I'm working on getting into some of the

2336
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:35,000
more nld stuff from White Buffalo like

2337
01:36:33,079 --> 01:36:36,519
I've got a shitload of packs they're one

2338
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:38,479
of the people that I distribute through

2339
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:40,600
the seed bank so I've got a shitload of

2340
01:36:38,479 --> 01:36:42,919
packs from them just like seeds man

2341
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:44,920
Hayes cross the Colombian black like

2342
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:47,158
bunch of nepes stuff all sorts of

2343
01:36:44,920 --> 01:36:48,719
different things like that so I've done

2344
01:36:47,158 --> 01:36:51,719
a few indoors like I grew a Band-Aid

2345
01:36:48,719 --> 01:36:54,079
Haze plant indoors and um a har dreams

2346
01:36:51,719 --> 01:36:56,560
as well which is like a 11 weaker it's

2347
01:36:54,079 --> 01:36:57,800
like blue dream cross to a pi S1 um and

2348
01:36:56,560 --> 01:37:00,199
they did pretty well indoors but

2349
01:36:57,800 --> 01:37:01,320
throwing them Outdoors Man you can see

2350
01:37:00,198 --> 01:37:03,319
that that's where they want to thrive

2351
01:37:01,319 --> 01:37:04,920
they'll just keep going and going so

2352
01:37:03,319 --> 01:37:06,920
yeah that's um going forward I want to

2353
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:08,840
try and move into like doing some

2354
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:10,118
outdoor breeding like I I don't really

2355
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:11,679
hear about it too much like the only

2356
01:37:10,118 --> 01:37:13,719
time I've heard anyone sort of talk

2357
01:37:11,679 --> 01:37:15,840
about it is breeder Steve said that he

2358
01:37:13,719 --> 01:37:17,639
used to do like a selection or two like

2359
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:19,360
a round or two of selection outdoors and

2360
01:37:17,639 --> 01:37:21,560
then bring them indoors so it's

2361
01:37:19,359 --> 01:37:23,118
something that I'm interested in because

2362
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:25,000
like um little Hill you mentioned that

2363
01:37:23,118 --> 01:37:27,238
sha does a lot of outdoor breeding and

2364
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:29,359
obviously um mean jeene as well does

2365
01:37:27,238 --> 01:37:32,079
like outdoor stuff but are there a lot

2366
01:37:29,359 --> 01:37:34,439
of breeders breeding outdoor seeds and

2367
01:37:32,079 --> 01:37:36,960
then people are taking them indoors like

2368
01:37:34,439 --> 01:37:39,198
is this a concern that indoor Growers

2369
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:42,800
have that people will breed their seeds

2370
01:37:39,198 --> 01:37:45,279
out like it is for me that's

2371
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:48,679
interesting you can do whatever you want

2372
01:37:45,279 --> 01:37:49,920
with the plant right and a lot of what

2373
01:37:48,679 --> 01:37:53,359
Growers are

2374
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:55,118
growing is is just if you're an outdoor

2375
01:37:53,359 --> 01:37:57,880
grower you're going to want to

2376
01:37:55,118 --> 01:37:59,479
make combined outdoor plants that you

2377
01:37:57,880 --> 01:38:02,560
think would go good together that work

2378
01:37:59,479 --> 01:38:05,678
for you if if both mothers or or both

2379
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:07,159
lines do well Outdoors then hey put them

2380
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:09,239
together and maybe something cool happen

2381
01:38:07,158 --> 01:38:11,559
out of that or maybe you want to take

2382
01:38:09,238 --> 01:38:14,479
like one strain that's like very hyped

2383
01:38:11,560 --> 01:38:16,320
up but it's like you know whatever the

2384
01:38:14,479 --> 01:38:18,678
Market's like really wanting like a

2385
01:38:16,319 --> 01:38:21,840
gelato or something and at least they

2386
01:38:18,679 --> 01:38:24,560
were wanting that um

2387
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:27,840
and then and then you know combining it

2388
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:29,639
with like blue dream or whatever outdoor

2389
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:32,039
strains you're running that that that

2390
01:38:29,639 --> 01:38:34,599
maybe breed good stuff for outdoors like

2391
01:38:32,039 --> 01:38:36,760
green crack or the Appalachia like

2392
01:38:34,599 --> 01:38:39,159
bubble gum those are just those are just

2393
01:38:36,760 --> 01:38:41,719
super winter outdoor plants and yeah you

2394
01:38:39,158 --> 01:38:44,559
can always take them back indoors but it

2395
01:38:41,719 --> 01:38:46,719
just seems like there's already like

2396
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:49,480
indoors is like controlled environment

2397
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:52,679
it's the same around the world so it's

2398
01:38:49,479 --> 01:38:55,678
not as necessary

2399
01:38:52,679 --> 01:38:57,960
and it seems easier to take breeders

2400
01:38:55,679 --> 01:39:02,399
that are exclusively breeding you know

2401
01:38:57,960 --> 01:39:04,920
IND out in rock wo under LEDs to just

2402
01:39:02,399 --> 01:39:08,638
run those genetics are probably going to

2403
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:11,399
do what you want as opposed

2404
01:39:08,639 --> 01:39:13,960
to you know

2405
01:39:11,399 --> 01:39:16,559
outdoor strains being bred for their

2406
01:39:13,960 --> 01:39:19,118
outdoor qualities doing what you want

2407
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:20,480
Outdoors but you can do both and and

2408
01:39:19,118 --> 01:39:22,198
it's not like you're not going to find

2409
01:39:20,479 --> 01:39:23,359
something from the outdoor varieties

2410
01:39:22,198 --> 01:39:25,039
that's going to work great for you

2411
01:39:23,359 --> 01:39:28,000
indoors because they were all outdoor

2412
01:39:25,039 --> 01:39:30,079
varieties eventually or originally and

2413
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:32,359
then they went indoors and indoors bred

2414
01:39:30,079 --> 01:39:34,960
for something specifically and then we

2415
01:39:32,359 --> 01:39:37,880
went back from indoors to outdoors and

2416
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:40,560
oh what works well Outdoors like you

2417
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:42,319
know it wasn't that Dutch stuff it was

2418
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:45,480
the stuff they already had growing in

2419
01:39:42,319 --> 01:39:47,439
the Hills here and you know people would

2420
01:39:45,479 --> 01:39:48,919
run the same strain indoors in their

2421
01:39:47,439 --> 01:39:51,439
warehouse that they were growing

2422
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:54,520
outdoors in under the trees and like

2423
01:39:51,439 --> 01:39:56,479
it's such a mix but like you just got to

2424
01:39:54,520 --> 01:39:58,840
figure it out and like if I was going to

2425
01:39:56,479 --> 01:40:02,039
look for strains to run in a warehouse

2426
01:39:58,840 --> 01:40:04,360
like I wouldn't necessarily go towards

2427
01:40:02,039 --> 01:40:06,760
my outdoor genetics I'd look for what's

2428
01:40:04,359 --> 01:40:09,719
like what the market wants out of out of

2429
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:11,360
that stuff and but if you know for my

2430
01:40:09,719 --> 01:40:13,840
environment if I'm looking for what's

2431
01:40:11,359 --> 01:40:15,799
going to work out there like I gotta

2432
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:18,639
remember what the market wants but like

2433
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:20,760
I also got to remember that like I just

2434
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:22,480
grew out a bunch of stuff from compound

2435
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:24,639
and none of it's impressive and these

2436
01:40:22,479 --> 01:40:26,638
are and these are pheno these aren't

2437
01:40:24,639 --> 01:40:29,840
like seeds I'm popping these are like

2438
01:40:26,639 --> 01:40:33,118
selected phenotypes that were selected

2439
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:34,960
in an outdoor dep or greenhouse and I'm

2440
01:40:33,118 --> 01:40:37,000
still not that high on them I'm still

2441
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:40,719
not stoked on them like I see I have

2442
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:42,800
other better stuff in my garden so you

2443
01:40:40,719 --> 01:40:44,079
can go either way I just think you know

2444
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:45,760
when you're selecting genetics you

2445
01:40:44,079 --> 01:40:47,599
should think about what your environment

2446
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:50,159
is and where these where these

2447
01:40:47,599 --> 01:40:52,199
selections came from I think that's one

2448
01:40:50,158 --> 01:40:53,839
of the most important things is like

2449
01:40:52,198 --> 01:40:56,198
looking at your environment and choosing

2450
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:58,119
genetics based on that uh perfect

2451
01:40:56,198 --> 01:41:01,759
example I'll cite CSI on this because

2452
01:40:58,118 --> 01:41:03,679
this is his more his uh area but when he

2453
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:06,239
was talking about the purple Hindu Kush

2454
01:41:03,679 --> 01:41:09,560
this is a plant grown exclusively mostly

2455
01:41:06,238 --> 01:41:11,079
out in Oregon or NorCal right and it um

2456
01:41:09,560 --> 01:41:12,960
does real well Outdoors doesn't have a

2457
01:41:11,079 --> 01:41:15,359
lot of interex traits however when you

2458
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:18,399
bring anything indoors and and breed

2459
01:41:15,359 --> 01:41:20,319
with it it's constant Herms indoors and

2460
01:41:18,399 --> 01:41:23,079
what he's been telling me is that you

2461
01:41:20,319 --> 01:41:24,639
can almost always take indoor stuff out

2462
01:41:23,079 --> 01:41:26,840
and if it's Herm prone it's it's going

2463
01:41:24,639 --> 01:41:28,880
to Herm less Outdoors it'll still might

2464
01:41:26,840 --> 01:41:31,719
Herm a little bit but when you bring

2465
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:33,319
outdoor bread Stu indoor it's a lot more

2466
01:41:31,719 --> 01:41:35,480
variable on how well it will take

2467
01:41:33,319 --> 01:41:36,880
sexually and stress wise um the other

2468
01:41:35,479 --> 01:41:39,319
consideration I take into outdoor

2469
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:40,719
breeding is depending on where you're at

2470
01:41:39,319 --> 01:41:43,880
if a lot of people around you like

2471
01:41:40,719 --> 01:41:45,800
mesino humble are also growing Outdoors

2472
01:41:43,880 --> 01:41:47,520
there's a it's a lot harder to control

2473
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:49,639
pollen contamination and po we've

2474
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:51,599
learned pollen travels miles if it wants

2475
01:41:49,639 --> 01:41:53,279
to it's lighter than air so that's the

2476
01:41:51,599 --> 01:41:55,119
only other things I I would take into

2477
01:41:53,279 --> 01:41:57,960
consideration but you're dead on bro

2478
01:41:55,118 --> 01:42:00,079
like people should really be considering

2479
01:41:57,960 --> 01:42:01,560
their environment and what genetics are

2480
01:42:00,079 --> 01:42:03,719
known to work best for their environment

2481
01:42:01,560 --> 01:42:06,280
instead of trying to force stuff into

2482
01:42:03,719 --> 01:42:07,760
holes that it doesn't necessarily fit in

2483
01:42:06,279 --> 01:42:11,039
right that that hermy thing is

2484
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:13,320
absolutely true um like poodle nuts is a

2485
01:42:11,039 --> 01:42:14,399
great example yeah that nuts all over

2486
01:42:13,319 --> 01:42:16,599
the place

2487
01:42:14,399 --> 01:42:18,598
indoors I mean it can be it can be

2488
01:42:16,599 --> 01:42:22,560
suppressed and and but it can get out of

2489
01:42:18,599 --> 01:42:25,760
control too I've I've had both sure and

2490
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:28,320
uh but like I've never seen one hermy

2491
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:29,760
pollen sack on a uh on a pood nut's

2492
01:42:28,319 --> 01:42:32,679
outdoors and I've grown it in green

2493
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:35,320
houses I've grown it in in uh full

2494
01:42:32,679 --> 01:42:37,920
full-term plants like nothing nothing

2495
01:42:35,319 --> 01:42:40,158
ever and so like yeah that is true like

2496
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:43,359
generally you can

2497
01:42:40,158 --> 01:42:45,479
take indoor genetics in that that might

2498
01:42:43,359 --> 01:42:48,519
have hermy issues or might

2499
01:42:45,479 --> 01:42:49,919
not and not you won't see them outside

2500
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:52,320
you won't see them under the sun really

2501
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:55,679
cuz even in death you won't see them

2502
01:42:52,319 --> 01:42:57,519
yeah but then if you do a selection out

2503
01:42:55,679 --> 01:42:59,079
there and then bring it inside you might

2504
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:01,400
have selected something that that

2505
01:42:59,079 --> 01:43:03,960
hermes's all over the place indoors for

2506
01:43:01,399 --> 01:43:07,279
whatever reason I don't know why but

2507
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:10,880
that's always held true yeah yeah that's

2508
01:43:07,279 --> 01:43:13,639
pretty significant my Jaga S1 does that

2509
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:15,440
[ __ ] throw down like it'll throw down

2510
01:43:13,639 --> 01:43:18,199
big chunks it's beautiful take that [ __ ]

2511
01:43:15,439 --> 01:43:20,079
indoors herm's like a [ __ ] like early

2512
01:43:18,198 --> 01:43:22,919
and late like week three and then again

2513
01:43:20,079 --> 01:43:25,840
at like week oh

2514
01:43:22,920 --> 01:43:28,279
no not you want to run with indoors

2515
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:31,800
don't don't blow out the whole tent on

2516
01:43:28,279 --> 01:43:33,759
theer definitely that's why I was

2517
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:36,039
outdoor bre we know genetics of joer

2518
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:37,400
joer is purple Hindu Kush isn't it

2519
01:43:36,039 --> 01:43:41,000
that's what they claim

2520
01:43:37,399 --> 01:43:43,920
yeah maybe we don't know anything

2521
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:46,719
about [ __ ] to me but um yeah the the

2522
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:49,319
Jagger as far as we know is Millerville

2523
01:43:46,719 --> 01:43:51,239
um uh prop Kos I think that's what's

2524
01:43:49,319 --> 01:43:53,960
supposed to be or what they say

2525
01:43:51,238 --> 01:43:56,638
okay yeah okay um no one's ever really

2526
01:43:53,960 --> 01:43:58,480
seen the Anis to even other than not so

2527
01:43:56,639 --> 01:44:00,079
and a few other people to to compare it

2528
01:43:58,479 --> 01:44:03,678
and I don't know that he's grown Jager

2529
01:44:00,079 --> 01:44:06,198
to compare it to say for sure yeah my

2530
01:44:03,679 --> 01:44:07,399
one's I love it as a smoke the S1 cuz

2531
01:44:06,198 --> 01:44:09,319
it's got like a little bit of a cushy

2532
01:44:07,399 --> 01:44:11,279
flavor to it too but mostly oh it's

2533
01:44:09,319 --> 01:44:13,198
multi fasted everyone that's got us been

2534
01:44:11,279 --> 01:44:16,238
like damn the nose interesting so it's a

2535
01:44:13,198 --> 01:44:17,719
unique one keep around ni ni and like I

2536
01:44:16,238 --> 01:44:19,238
wonder if you could like acclimate the

2537
01:44:17,719 --> 01:44:20,800
Clone indoor like if you have a

2538
01:44:19,238 --> 01:44:22,799
selection that does Herm if you can keep

2539
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:24,279
running indoor and in you know Time

2540
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:27,279
After Time After Time again if it will

2541
01:44:24,279 --> 01:44:28,880
ever acclimate to not I don't know maybe

2542
01:44:27,279 --> 01:44:30,319
sort of bond with your room over time

2543
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:31,639
and how you grow even the flower too

2544
01:44:30,319 --> 01:44:34,000
though like the flower threw out these

2545
01:44:31,639 --> 01:44:35,560
real spindly little buds like the most

2546
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:37,279
skinny buds I've ever seen like little

2547
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:38,960
[ __ ] pinkies but then outdoor it

2548
01:44:37,279 --> 01:44:40,639
throws like chunks like I got it that at

2549
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:43,599
the moment it's like these big you know

2550
01:44:40,639 --> 01:44:45,599
thumbs so I've seen that a lot bro I

2551
01:44:43,599 --> 01:44:47,880
remember I saw that a lot with um early

2552
01:44:45,599 --> 01:44:50,199
on when I was buying seeds from like

2553
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:51,480
like Canada when I'd see purple stuff

2554
01:44:50,198 --> 01:44:53,319
cuz it was at the time it was so rare

2555
01:44:51,479 --> 01:44:55,039
and I was like oh it is purple it may be

2556
01:44:53,319 --> 01:44:56,599
say may say that it's all like outdoor

2557
01:44:55,039 --> 01:44:58,880
but what the [ __ ] do I know so I'd order

2558
01:44:56,599 --> 01:45:01,679
it and indoor it would be complete trash

2559
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:03,880
like hermy trash it was all Airy but

2560
01:45:01,679 --> 01:45:05,560
outdoor it's solid just a rock and and

2561
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:07,599
beautiful and that was another thing

2562
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:10,599
that I experienced that like indoor

2563
01:45:07,599 --> 01:45:12,639
lights don't necessarily dense up lury

2564
01:45:10,599 --> 01:45:14,239
bud at all like sometimes it just does

2565
01:45:12,639 --> 01:45:16,679
the opposite for for certain strains

2566
01:45:14,238 --> 01:45:19,399
that are Gil geared to

2567
01:45:16,679 --> 01:45:21,319
Outdoors yeah yeah totally I don't I

2568
01:45:19,399 --> 01:45:24,638
don't know what the variable is like is

2569
01:45:21,319 --> 01:45:27,519
it intensity is it

2570
01:45:24,639 --> 01:45:29,960
Spectrum root temperatures like I have

2571
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:32,719
no idea what that variable is I'm sure

2572
01:45:29,960 --> 01:45:34,000
it's got it almost seems like indoors

2573
01:45:32,719 --> 01:45:36,639
it's like you've got someone that's like

2574
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,639
imuno

2575
01:45:36,880 --> 01:45:40,239
compromised and you take them outdoors

2576
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:42,880
and they're [ __ ] eating dirt and

2577
01:45:40,238 --> 01:45:46,279
worms and you know all

2578
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:48,319
that yeah I don't know there's a grower

2579
01:45:46,279 --> 01:45:51,198
out here that that has always and I've

2580
01:45:48,319 --> 01:45:53,079
kind of seen it myself um

2581
01:45:51,198 --> 01:45:55,839
he he kind of like preaches to take your

2582
01:45:53,079 --> 01:45:59,000
mom's outside and let him let him get

2583
01:45:55,840 --> 01:46:01,440
some of that Midsummer Sun yeah and T to

2584
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:04,158
sort of revitalize them before he take

2585
01:46:01,439 --> 01:46:05,519
him back indoors again um he's always

2586
01:46:04,158 --> 01:46:08,000
preached that and that makes perfect

2587
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:09,880
sense to me because I mean the plant

2588
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:12,000
really does want that full spectrum and

2589
01:46:09,880 --> 01:46:13,520
whatever it is in the sun you know

2590
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:16,439
that's not getting replicated well

2591
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:19,400
enough indoors like it really it really

2592
01:46:16,439 --> 01:46:21,079
cranks them and uh and can bring back

2593
01:46:19,399 --> 01:46:25,439
their health for sure

2594
01:46:21,079 --> 01:46:27,238
yeah outdoor some sunshine therapy right

2595
01:46:25,439 --> 01:46:29,319
it's I've always said it's like it's

2596
01:46:27,238 --> 01:46:30,598
impossible to match the the Spectrum

2597
01:46:29,319 --> 01:46:32,759
that's coming off of that burning ball

2598
01:46:30,599 --> 01:46:34,119
of helium there's there's probably

2599
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:36,599
factors there that we can't even

2600
01:46:34,118 --> 01:46:37,960
quantify that's happening I like how he

2601
01:46:36,599 --> 01:46:39,639
called it a burning ball of hel I didn't

2602
01:46:37,960 --> 01:46:43,158
even consider the sun was helium thank

2603
01:46:39,639 --> 01:46:43,159
you sir mostly mostly

2604
01:46:45,118 --> 01:46:50,559
helium just noticing that we maybe got

2605
01:46:48,439 --> 01:46:53,439
another like 15 20 minutes until we hit

2606
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:55,960
the 2hour mark and um one thing I wanted

2607
01:46:53,439 --> 01:46:58,000
to ask you all is does anything change

2608
01:46:55,960 --> 01:46:59,439
towards Light Flow because I think okay

2609
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:01,599
today we're probably not going to get to

2610
01:46:59,439 --> 01:47:03,678
like Harvest and post Harvest maybe that

2611
01:47:01,599 --> 01:47:06,880
would make a good next installment do

2612
01:47:03,679 --> 01:47:09,599
Harvest and post Harvest but um what

2613
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:11,599
about like late flour specifically were

2614
01:47:09,599 --> 01:47:13,000
there any other considerations or you

2615
01:47:11,599 --> 01:47:14,639
know changes in like what you guys have

2616
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:19,039
to do dayto

2617
01:47:14,639 --> 01:47:21,199
day I would say one one easy mistake is

2618
01:47:19,039 --> 01:47:25,599
if you use timers which I I've always

2619
01:47:21,198 --> 01:47:28,719
used timers and on valves to to do um

2620
01:47:25,599 --> 01:47:32,239
irrigation um at a certain point on my

2621
01:47:28,719 --> 01:47:33,719
outdoor it's on a timer and it's it's

2622
01:47:32,238 --> 01:47:35,198
whatever it is it's every other day

2623
01:47:33,719 --> 01:47:38,960
usually they get

2624
01:47:35,198 --> 01:47:41,399
watered um when the temperatures drop in

2625
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:44,679
whether it be September or October make

2626
01:47:41,399 --> 01:47:47,439
sure you reduce the watering and so

2627
01:47:44,679 --> 01:47:49,480
you're not overwatering plants now that

2628
01:47:47,439 --> 01:47:51,319
aren't using as much water because the

2629
01:47:49,479 --> 01:47:53,598
night temperatures usually cool down

2630
01:47:51,319 --> 01:47:55,198
first and then it takes you know it

2631
01:47:53,599 --> 01:47:56,560
takes more time in the middle of the day

2632
01:47:55,198 --> 01:47:59,079
for the plant to sort of wake up and

2633
01:47:56,560 --> 01:48:01,000
start drinking water again um that's

2634
01:47:59,079 --> 01:48:02,920
that's one thing I think mistakes people

2635
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:05,079
make and especially on those longer

2636
01:48:02,920 --> 01:48:08,599
flowering strains you you could end up

2637
01:48:05,079 --> 01:48:10,399
overwatering them all of October and I'm

2638
01:48:08,599 --> 01:48:13,159
I'm sure that just leads to petritis

2639
01:48:10,399 --> 01:48:16,279
issues and and and and just not not

2640
01:48:13,158 --> 01:48:18,479
capturing the the uh the best part or

2641
01:48:16,279 --> 01:48:21,920
the most important part of the flowering

2642
01:48:18,479 --> 01:48:26,598
cycle so that's that would be my little

2643
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:30,000
tip y very nice Kush anything about late

2644
01:48:26,599 --> 01:48:32,159
flowering comes to mind for you um man

2645
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:34,479
it it used to be a big concern for me

2646
01:48:32,158 --> 01:48:36,198
like you know super cropping the black

2647
01:48:34,479 --> 01:48:39,238
cherry soda where I was mostly worried

2648
01:48:36,198 --> 01:48:41,439
about weight but like the late SE it

2649
01:48:39,238 --> 01:48:43,598
like a lot of lot of big concerns don't

2650
01:48:41,439 --> 01:48:46,198
crop up for me anymore I mean if I get a

2651
01:48:43,599 --> 01:48:49,199
plant that I can see is susceptible to

2652
01:48:46,198 --> 01:48:51,399
mold and you know like five or seven or

2653
01:48:49,198 --> 01:48:53,238
eight of her colas are are being

2654
01:48:51,399 --> 01:48:55,279
attacked by it out of like you know 50

2655
01:48:53,238 --> 01:48:56,839
or 60 there was a point where I would

2656
01:48:55,279 --> 01:48:58,960
look at that and go [ __ ] you know I I

2657
01:48:56,840 --> 01:49:00,560
want to harvest this I want to stop it

2658
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:04,039
before it happens any further but you

2659
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:06,800
know as my as my goals change and as my

2660
01:49:04,039 --> 01:49:09,519
needs for for what I was growing changed

2661
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:11,039
uh to just supplying myself and having

2662
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:14,520
enough for some friends and some family

2663
01:49:11,039 --> 01:49:16,439
to hand out care packages um you know I

2664
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:18,320
look at those things and now I'm not so

2665
01:49:16,439 --> 01:49:20,319
concerned about it and now it's more

2666
01:49:18,319 --> 01:49:22,439
like well how much can I push this plan

2667
01:49:20,319 --> 01:49:25,559
or how like one of my favorite things to

2668
01:49:22,439 --> 01:49:28,359
do is after I harvest a plant I leave on

2669
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:30,960
about an ounce of mids and Littles uh

2670
01:49:28,359 --> 01:49:33,000
just left on the stem and I'll leave it

2671
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:35,198
out there all season until the Snows

2672
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:36,840
come and I'll check on it and I'll see

2673
01:49:35,198 --> 01:49:39,158
all right what got really attacked by

2674
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:41,480
mold what what what's out here Way

2675
01:49:39,158 --> 01:49:43,479
Beyond Amber tricomes where stuff will

2676
01:49:41,479 --> 01:49:47,039
naturally Decay and still doesn't have

2677
01:49:43,479 --> 01:49:49,198
mold on it um it it allows me to

2678
01:49:47,039 --> 01:49:51,000
experience harsher conditions with some

2679
01:49:49,198 --> 01:49:55,559
of these plants and and what they can

2680
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:59,279
really stand up to um I did a living

2681
01:49:55,560 --> 01:50:02,199
dead girl from CSI two years ago um

2682
01:49:59,279 --> 01:50:06,319
Pakistani chitrol Kush Urkel and Girl

2683
01:50:02,198 --> 01:50:08,118
Scout cookies um mixed together I left a

2684
01:50:06,319 --> 01:50:10,079
bunch of I bet I left some lar and some

2685
01:50:08,118 --> 01:50:12,118
Littles on it and I came out like a

2686
01:50:10,079 --> 01:50:14,479
month and a half later and I'm looking

2687
01:50:12,118 --> 01:50:17,679
at flowers that have no mold on them

2688
01:50:14,479 --> 01:50:19,638
whereas the other skeletal structures of

2689
01:50:17,679 --> 01:50:20,719
um some of the Urkel some of the the

2690
01:50:19,639 --> 01:50:23,560
more

2691
01:50:20,719 --> 01:50:26,800
half Urkle strains that had basically

2692
01:50:23,560 --> 01:50:28,599
baseball-sized Co baseball bat colas all

2693
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:30,840
of that stuff is moldy top to bottom

2694
01:50:28,599 --> 01:50:33,880
turning brown already decaying past the

2695
01:50:30,840 --> 01:50:35,159
point of of life being in it and you

2696
01:50:33,880 --> 01:50:36,800
know I'm looking at this other planet

2697
01:50:35,158 --> 01:50:38,399
it's like yeah bring on more what what's

2698
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:40,760
mold you know is it

2699
01:50:38,399 --> 01:50:45,198
terpinolene no no it was a it was

2700
01:50:40,760 --> 01:50:47,440
another um it was the pinear not pinear

2701
01:50:45,198 --> 01:50:51,118
the Living Dead Girl that specific one

2702
01:50:47,439 --> 01:50:53,319
was the peppery hashy one that um when

2703
01:50:51,118 --> 01:50:55,158
you ground it up once you got past the

2704
01:50:53,319 --> 01:50:58,118
the initial smells then a little bit of

2705
01:50:55,158 --> 01:51:00,920
fress came out in it but on the nose

2706
01:50:58,118 --> 01:51:03,598
pepper pepper like uh

2707
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:05,840
spices um that was the one that was very

2708
01:51:03,599 --> 01:51:08,199
um pest resistant as well it was mold as

2709
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:10,599
well as pest resistant um and she got

2710
01:51:08,198 --> 01:51:12,799
put to the test she was sitting in you

2711
01:51:10,599 --> 01:51:15,520
know she sat through a couple snowstorms

2712
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:17,679
um she you know she endured some stuff

2713
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:20,079
the another another really crazy one

2714
01:51:17,679 --> 01:51:22,000
that endured as much wet weather as

2715
01:51:20,078 --> 01:51:24,799
could have was the uh bubble gum to the

2716
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:28,039
Albert Walker makes sense she that

2717
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:30,079
bubble gum yeah after here in CSI talk

2718
01:51:28,039 --> 01:51:33,158
about his huge outdoor Bubble Run where

2719
01:51:30,078 --> 01:51:35,118
80% of it just endured those those

2720
01:51:33,158 --> 01:51:37,759
rainstorms it's like well [ __ ] I I'll

2721
01:51:35,118 --> 01:51:39,598
put it to the test and I Had It Outdoors

2722
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:42,239
last year till

2723
01:51:39,599 --> 01:51:44,078
October 9th and then we got hit with

2724
01:51:42,238 --> 01:51:46,759
five inches of snow and she was such a

2725
01:51:44,078 --> 01:51:49,279
big plant that every all like the way I

2726
01:51:46,760 --> 01:51:51,840
tie my branches to my cages it created

2727
01:51:49,279 --> 01:51:53,960
fulcrums and every Branch broke right

2728
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:55,239
where it was tied to the cage and I was

2729
01:51:53,960 --> 01:51:57,279
looking at I was like man I didn't want

2730
01:51:55,238 --> 01:51:59,039
to pull this plant down yet I wanted to

2731
01:51:57,279 --> 01:52:01,000
see how far she could really go in the

2732
01:51:59,039 --> 01:52:04,198
late season but you know she can't do

2733
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:06,198
nothing about snap branches like that so

2734
01:52:04,198 --> 01:52:08,479
the real quick the blue resins flowering

2735
01:52:06,198 --> 01:52:10,678
super late right like it started late it

2736
01:52:08,479 --> 01:52:12,559
is it started late and it's flowering

2737
01:52:10,679 --> 01:52:13,960
late and it's um I'm looking I was

2738
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:16,400
looking at it this morning and I'm

2739
01:52:13,960 --> 01:52:18,800
looking like at another another two two

2740
01:52:16,399 --> 01:52:21,039
and a half weeks before she's yeah it's

2741
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:22,800
crazy man she's she's taking her sweet

2742
01:52:21,039 --> 01:52:25,078
time why what do you what causes that

2743
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:27,400
late flowering trigger do we even know

2744
01:52:25,078 --> 01:52:30,759
it so it it's hard for me to nail it

2745
01:52:27,399 --> 01:52:33,799
down because I moved my garden from I

2746
01:52:30,760 --> 01:52:35,480
moved it like 150 yards down further

2747
01:52:33,800 --> 01:52:37,840
into a little bit so I have a little bit

2748
01:52:35,479 --> 01:52:39,238
light difference and uh it's a little

2749
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:41,679
bit more of a corridor and I'm not

2750
01:52:39,238 --> 01:52:44,399
getting as as full sunlight as I was in

2751
01:52:41,679 --> 01:52:47,078
the in the spot before yeah so I there

2752
01:52:44,399 --> 01:52:49,118
there's two or three plants that I'm I I

2753
01:52:47,078 --> 01:52:51,279
expect August 1st by August 1st or

2754
01:52:49,118 --> 01:52:52,880
August 7th I should see I'm expecting

2755
01:52:51,279 --> 01:52:54,880
plants that are I can obviously tell

2756
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:56,599
they're stretching this year some of

2757
01:52:54,880 --> 01:52:58,279
them it wasn't until the second or third

2758
01:52:56,599 --> 01:53:00,719
week of August where I was like oh yeah

2759
01:52:58,279 --> 01:53:03,000
this this lady is like really reaching

2760
01:53:00,719 --> 01:53:05,118
out there for the Sun so and that that

2761
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:06,840
was one of them I mean she's freaking I

2762
01:53:05,118 --> 01:53:08,000
was on top of a six foot tall lad the

2763
01:53:06,840 --> 01:53:10,400
other day and I still couldn't get to

2764
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:13,599
the top of her it's it's unreal how how

2765
01:53:10,399 --> 01:53:16,078
tall she is and just that skinny super

2766
01:53:13,599 --> 01:53:17,639
tall profile man I'm very interested in

2767
01:53:16,078 --> 01:53:20,078
the mold part of that too because the

2768
01:53:17,639 --> 01:53:24,800
bonnet's been extremely mold resistant

2769
01:53:20,078 --> 01:53:26,639
Kush is known for being a mold magnet uh

2770
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:29,719
I was just looking over this morning I

2771
01:53:26,639 --> 01:53:33,199
only saw one little bit of Decay and it

2772
01:53:29,719 --> 01:53:35,039
was on a lower nug and it was uh it was

2773
01:53:33,198 --> 01:53:37,399
basically the Sugar Leaf not even a fan

2774
01:53:35,039 --> 01:53:38,920
leaf or an internal it was just an

2775
01:53:37,399 --> 01:53:40,799
external little bit it probably came

2776
01:53:38,920 --> 01:53:43,078
from a caterpillar [ __ ] on it or

2777
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:46,239
some other it wasn't it wasn't like yeah

2778
01:53:43,078 --> 01:53:48,679
it wasn't actual mold created from PL

2779
01:53:46,238 --> 01:53:50,718
its own plant Decay on itself yeah I

2780
01:53:48,679 --> 01:53:52,719
think it was external this is a good

2781
01:53:50,719 --> 01:53:54,760
test for it too for me like to have it

2782
01:53:52,719 --> 01:53:56,439
be so late season up in your area to see

2783
01:53:54,760 --> 01:53:58,119
how it'll finish for mold I mean that's

2784
01:53:56,439 --> 01:53:59,598
killer yeah I mean if it was last year

2785
01:53:58,118 --> 01:54:01,238
the plant wouldn't have lasted it's

2786
01:53:59,599 --> 01:54:03,239
October 17th right now and I'm looking

2787
01:54:01,238 --> 01:54:04,959
at the weather and like we don't even

2788
01:54:03,238 --> 01:54:08,598
really have a big storm coming on the

2789
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:10,560
horizon in the next seven to 10 days so

2790
01:54:08,599 --> 01:54:11,760
it's it's all smooth sailing for for the

2791
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:14,719
rest of

2792
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:18,079
that yeah dude looking forward to it

2793
01:54:14,719 --> 01:54:20,880
yeah that bubble gum oh sorry to to get

2794
01:54:18,078 --> 01:54:22,639
back to that bubble gum um

2795
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:25,319
it was brought out to humble and it was

2796
01:54:22,639 --> 01:54:27,560
grown on the coast for years and if if

2797
01:54:25,319 --> 01:54:29,599
you can grow on the humble Coast like

2798
01:54:27,560 --> 01:54:32,199
you're definitely gonna be mold

2799
01:54:29,599 --> 01:54:33,840
resistant and it yeah and I guess it was

2800
01:54:32,198 --> 01:54:36,559
it was brought from like Indiana or

2801
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:38,159
Michigan or somewhere and yeah and uh

2802
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:40,039
those guys did great with it on the on

2803
01:54:38,158 --> 01:54:43,359
the coast which which just means it's

2804
01:54:40,039 --> 01:54:45,719
mold resistant and uh um it's it's

2805
01:54:43,359 --> 01:54:48,759
interesting to hear about it doing well

2806
01:54:45,719 --> 01:54:51,399
at higher elevation um I I already it

2807
01:54:48,760 --> 01:54:55,239
also finishes early that's another thing

2808
01:54:51,399 --> 01:54:57,719
fast um I've never grown it myself and I

2809
01:54:55,238 --> 01:55:01,000
haven't grown any hybrids of it

2810
01:54:57,719 --> 01:55:04,439
but um yeah all I hear is good things

2811
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:07,399
about it Outdoors for just a good yep

2812
01:55:04,439 --> 01:55:11,198
bulletproof plant abut somewhat early

2813
01:55:07,399 --> 01:55:11,198
finishing extreme mold

2814
01:55:11,479 --> 01:55:18,319
resistance flavor y yeah totally totally

2815
01:55:16,158 --> 01:55:21,319
what I'm really sad about is the bubble

2816
01:55:18,319 --> 01:55:23,479
gum those bulk parts bubblegum turps

2817
01:55:21,319 --> 01:55:25,519
rarely ever transfer over to the final

2818
01:55:23,479 --> 01:55:27,158
flower you'll smell it all the way

2819
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:29,560
through but when you go to smoke it it's

2820
01:55:27,158 --> 01:55:32,039
like dude I wish that Bazooka Bubble Gum

2821
01:55:29,560 --> 01:55:35,320
was still there and yeah yeah it's rough

2822
01:55:32,039 --> 01:55:38,840
on that part totally I got some of the

2823
01:55:35,319 --> 01:55:40,479
uh sweet 16 to bubblegum that I didn't

2824
01:55:38,840 --> 01:55:43,119
pop this year but I was given this year

2825
01:55:40,479 --> 01:55:47,118
from CSI and I think because all the

2826
01:55:43,118 --> 01:55:49,598
sweet 16 so far has this candy sweet

2827
01:55:47,118 --> 01:55:51,880
Rosy things I'm I'm wondering if that

2828
01:55:49,599 --> 01:55:54,360
bubble gum to the Sweet 16 doesn't

2829
01:55:51,880 --> 01:55:57,118
bolster those yeah lock it in and keep

2830
01:55:54,359 --> 01:55:58,719
it there cuz man all these sweet 16

2831
01:55:57,118 --> 01:56:00,118
hybrids dude it's just like it's like

2832
01:55:58,719 --> 01:56:01,960
walking into a candy shop it's

2833
01:56:00,118 --> 01:56:04,198
ridiculous how how good these plants

2834
01:56:01,960 --> 01:56:05,719
smell my money's on terpinolene turning

2835
01:56:04,198 --> 01:56:09,439
it up the only time I've ever experienc

2836
01:56:05,719 --> 01:56:12,239
pink bubblegum um flavors uh was with

2837
01:56:09,439 --> 01:56:13,919
the um old centi star the the Superstar

2838
01:56:12,238 --> 01:56:16,559
from Delta 9 Labs with they called the

2839
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:17,599
95 ceny star the there's a specific

2840
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:19,560
expression in there that's pink

2841
01:56:17,599 --> 01:56:21,078
Bubblegum and trinoline and for whatever

2842
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:22,960
reason it translates to flavor super

2843
01:56:21,078 --> 01:56:24,679
well so I do have a bunch of the Durban

2844
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:26,679
bubble gums from CSI that I'm probably

2845
01:56:24,679 --> 01:56:28,279
going to run this next year just to see

2846
01:56:26,679 --> 01:56:29,840
how that does you know how well that

2847
01:56:28,279 --> 01:56:31,319
translates out yeah a little bit of Anis

2848
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:33,480
little bit of terpinolene right on top

2849
01:56:31,319 --> 01:56:35,880
of it that'll be good

2850
01:56:33,479 --> 01:56:36,959
yep thousand you around the bubbleberry

2851
01:56:35,880 --> 01:56:40,078

right yeah I rent it over summer no

2853
01:56:40,078 --> 01:56:44,840
dehumidification it was great it was

2854
01:56:42,319 --> 01:56:48,559
great it was yeah I would normally have

2855
01:56:44,840 --> 01:56:50,319
expected some Bettis under those

2856
01:56:48,560 --> 01:56:53,360
conditions but it was was

2857
01:56:50,319 --> 01:56:56,118
Flawless pretty chunky right yeah it was

2858

2903
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:41,960
episode definitely got to be on the way

2904
01:58:38,639 --> 01:58:45,279
for sure right on yeah totally Harvest

2905
01:58:41,960 --> 01:58:47,560
Harvest post Harvest uh topics and that

2906
01:58:45,279 --> 01:58:50,599
and that works for indoors too

2907
01:58:47,560 --> 01:58:53,679
absolutely y that would be interesting

2908
01:58:50,599 --> 01:58:56,639
to uh to see how other people are doing

2909
01:58:53,679 --> 01:58:59,239
it but like dealing with dealing with a

2910
01:58:56,639 --> 01:59:01,840
lot of harvest at once is has always

2911
01:58:59,238 --> 01:59:03,559
been the outdoor thing of it's all I bet

2912
01:59:01,840 --> 01:59:07,199
you have some crazy

2913
01:59:03,560 --> 01:59:09,599
stories yeah I mean yeah

2914
01:59:07,198 --> 01:59:12,719
you one one thing is you learn to be

2915
01:59:09,599 --> 01:59:14,239
ready like I've seen people drop the

2916
01:59:12,719 --> 01:59:18,399
ball on getting their Harvest rooms

2917
01:59:14,238 --> 01:59:20,198
ready or setting up some giant legal

2918
01:59:18,399 --> 01:59:23,799
grow

2919
01:59:20,198 --> 01:59:27,279
with Consultants but then not

2920
01:59:23,800 --> 01:59:29,000
understanding that their their plants

2921
01:59:27,279 --> 01:59:30,880
are going to do a lot better in southern

2922
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:33,800
Oregon than they did in Colorado so

2923
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:35,679
you're gonna have 10 times as much weed

2924
01:59:33,800 --> 01:59:37,719
oh yeah you know and now you've got

2925
01:59:35,679 --> 01:59:39,599
nowhere to dry it so you grew all the

2926
01:59:37,719 --> 01:59:43,198
weed and and it basically just rots on

2927
01:59:39,599 --> 01:59:47,199
the vine because you got hor yeah [ __ ]

2928
01:59:43,198 --> 01:59:49,759

in and that's already not ideal yep yeah

2932
01:59:55,520 --> 01:59:59,520
it's just like what were you thinking

2933
01:59:57,078 --> 02:00:02,559
like how how do you not think about dry

2934
01:59:59,520 --> 02:00:04,079
