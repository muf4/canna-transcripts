00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:12,059
scene researching everything from

4
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:13,859
cannabis strain history old smuggling

interview other participants our goal is

13
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,140
to document this history before it's

14
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:32,339
written by corporations and others who

15
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,159
just weren't there

16
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:38,359
let's start writing some wrongs welcome

17
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:38,359
to the underground

18
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:44,820
all right all right welcome to radio

19
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:46,439
Syndicate I'm Matthew this is not so dog

20
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,140
today we're going to talk about the

21
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:50,640
state of cannabis uh we we try to do

22
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,920
this every now and then to kind of

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,239
update on what's going on not only with

24
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,698
the legal Market but how that's

25
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:58,378
affecting the uh traditional Market I

26
00:00:56,698 --> 00:01:00,718
believe is the proper term that the the

27
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:03,539
youngins are using these days

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,640
um so yeah let's kick it off lots of

29
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,519
dogs let's talk about some of the legal

30
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,760
things going on today uh cannabis and

31
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:14,640
how it's affecting uh everything and you

32
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,740
from your perspective

33
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,618
um well I mean I think

34
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:21,959
it it's affecting everything

35
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:25,259
certainly there's I don't think there is

36
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:27,899
a part of the Cannabis scene from

37
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:29,879
extracts to seeds to flower or anything

38
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,140
like that that hasn't been affected by

39
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:34,259
it

40
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:37,259
um and I think honestly it is

41
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:39,900
um it's been primarily negative yeah uh

42
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,599
you know maybe you could say especially

43
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,978
for California because you know some of

44
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:47,158
these other states it might be their

45
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:49,679
first time that they got like stores

46
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,299
um but you know California's had uh you

47
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,460
know medical shops and stuff like that

48
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,560
basically full-fledged dispensaries for

49
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:57,419
a long time well now when you say

50
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,519
negative who are we speaking about like

51
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,719
who is it affecting negatively is it

52
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,420
affecting

53
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,759
the consumer effect negatively right

54
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,459
this second is it gonna I actually think

55
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,080
it's affecting everyone negatively I I

56
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,378
think so too but I I don't know that

57
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,540
everyone will realize the effect so

58
00:02:13,378 --> 00:02:19,199
I mean I don't know if if you want to

59
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:21,900
start from the consumer and go up sure I

60
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:24,139
think for a lot of consumers

61
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,520
um Choice has gone down

62
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:28,619
quality has certainly dropped

63
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:33,000
significantly

64
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:35,099
um and uh price has gone up but bro I'm

65
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,659
getting my cookies but you think price

66
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:38,340
has gone up really though like hasn't

67
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:40,318
the price on the pounds dropped or is it

68
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,780
legal Market has it gone up first the

69
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:44,759
consumer yeah

70
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,080
you know what I'm saying like so we're

71
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:49,019
not that's what I said we'll start with

72
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,879
the consumer yeah like if if you go if

73
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:52,800
you're if you're uh if you if you're

74
00:02:50,878 --> 00:02:54,000
buying you know eighths and ounces or

75
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,319
something like that you know if you're

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,659
going into shopping paying the same

77
00:02:55,318 --> 00:02:59,579
price or more I think I think they're

78
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:00,900
paying more yeah I'm just so out of the

79
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,760
loop on that point well they're paying

80
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,439
more because when you go and you you

81
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:05,759
know there's all these built-in taxes

82
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:07,378
that they're getting used to be yeah

83
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,840
that's right before all the laws there's

84
00:03:07,378 --> 00:03:11,459
excise taxes there's these taxes there's

85
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,840
all these different things I mean people

86
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:18,180
sometimes on IG will post these receipts

87
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:20,939
and they'll show like three seventy

88
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,340
dollar eights and then you add up to

89
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:25,079
taxes and the excise and this and that

90
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,300
and everything else plus the sales and

91
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,219
it's like this crazy component of it

92
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,080
right yeah

93
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:33,259
um you know I also think too that like

94
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,360
all these mylars

95
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:37,500
that most and what I mean by mylar for

96
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,840
people listening I think most people

97
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,719
know but like a lot of a lot of cannabis

98
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,719
these days is sold in opaque mylar bags

99
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:47,280
yeah which means that you're looking at

100
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:48,780
it and you get to see what the strain

101
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,939
name is and you get to see what the

102
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,878
packaging and the art they chose is but

103
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:55,560
very often you don't even get to see the

104
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:58,679
Cannabis you're buying until you've left

105
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,000
the building definitely not smell so you

106
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,239
don't get to smell it you don't get to

107
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,878
touch it you don't get to view it yeah

108
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:08,280
and so it's sort of like uh you know you

109
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:10,079
you just get to see the art

110
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,219
and the things that they've done you

111
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,599
know there's some exceptions there's

112
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:14,098
people that are you know there's there's

113
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:15,298
some things where they're visible

114
00:04:14,098 --> 00:04:17,039
there's some people that are selling

115
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:18,298
them in jars and stuff like that but for

116
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,680
the most part you don't get to see it

117
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:24,478
sure you know and so I think the taxes

118
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,519
have made it

119
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,500
um to where I I would bet on average

120
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:32,279
people are paying more

121
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:35,939
at the shop than they are than they were

122
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:38,039
under 215. oh yeah I would bet here we

123
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:41,279
go you know and I don't think the

124
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,020
choices are as as

125
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:46,019
you know as diverse

126
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:48,959
I wouldn't think so I just wonder if if

127
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:50,459
they won if they care I guess they as

128
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,620
long as the prices are high they

129
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:54,000
probably do care I think the more prices

130
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,620
drop

131
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,120
um on the consumer end the less they

132
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,699
would care because the prices are lower

133
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,699
and I just don't know that they've been

134
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:03,960
top quality well it's it's I mean you

135
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:07,680
know you can say that people wouldn't

136
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:09,000
care you know but it's like I I mean I

137
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,620
guess you could walk like you know use

138
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,418
an alcohol perspective you could walk

139
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,280
into the store and be like I am glad

140
00:05:12,418 --> 00:05:16,978
that the Bud Light is getting Cheaper by

141
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:18,539
the case but I wish that there was maybe

142
00:05:16,978 --> 00:05:22,758
some other brands

143
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:25,580
sure yeah it makes sense you know and so

144
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:28,080
I you know I think what happened is

145
00:05:25,579 --> 00:05:29,639
personally is I think that when they

146
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,620
made these rules they looked at like

147
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:33,300
what the black market price or the

148
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,160
traditional market price or the medical

149
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:38,639
price or whatever you want whatever you

150
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:41,280
want to phrase it as was and they based

151
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:45,060
a bunch of taxes and fees off of that

152
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:48,119
price yeah not realizing that as soon as

153
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:50,038
you expanded Supply by a ton

154
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,918
you were going to change the pricing of

155
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:54,899
all that dramatically so taxes are too

156
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:56,939
high for the consumer taxes are too high

157
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:58,319
for the distro taxes are too high for

158
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:02,939
the

159
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:06,240
um you know for the uh uh for the farmer

160
00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:07,978
right yeah and I don't think that I

161
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,199
don't I don't think yet that the states

162
00:06:07,978 --> 00:06:12,418
care

163
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:14,400
you know because uh what's really

164
00:06:12,418 --> 00:06:16,579
happening is is they get so many taxes

165
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:19,500
and they get so much fees up front

166
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:21,478
especially local like municipalities and

167
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,459
counties and all that like they get so

168
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:25,019
many they get so much up front just for

169
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:27,659
the right to do it

170
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:30,418
that it's not like normal taxes should

171
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:35,039
be I'm making money off when you make a

172
00:06:30,418 --> 00:06:37,978
sale yeah not having to pay up front for

173
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:40,439
all the ability to surveil you and all

174
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:43,139
that stuff yeah so it's like you start

175
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:45,418
adding in all these you start adding in

176
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:49,139
all these fees and taxes and and revenue

177
00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:51,120
boosters into a new industry and what

178
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:54,060
it's basically done is it's made qual

179
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,180
it's made quality a lot harder to come

180
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,860
by oh for sure I mean for sure there's

181
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,478
I'm seeing stories you probably are too

182
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:04,620
Matt I'm seeing stories like in

183
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:06,538
California of just like how many

184
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:09,899
um cultivation licenses are not being

185
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:11,339
renewed for the 2023 season yeah that's

186
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:13,318
got to scare them a little bit you know

187
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:14,879
they may not have have seen the effect

188
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:18,300
immediately again because they were

189
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:20,579
getting the money from you know the the

190
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,860
right to be able to grow what are the

191
00:07:20,579 --> 00:07:24,598
licenses and all that [ __ ] well you can

192
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,000
look at it you can look at it in a

193
00:07:24,598 --> 00:07:29,219
different way I mean I think I'm not a

194
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,019
very big fan of proposition 64 for

195
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,000
California specifically and I don't want

196
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:34,318
to get two California specific because

197
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,639
I'm sure there's a bunch of people in

198
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,560
other states that like have different

199
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:39,900
rules but

200
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,339
one of the things that happened is you

201
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:43,138
know when we all voted on this thing

202
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:45,538
that we were supposed to they were

203
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:47,160
supposed to for the first five years you

204
00:07:45,538 --> 00:07:51,120
weren't supposed to grow more than an

205
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:55,380
acre or say 43 500 square feet for the

206
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:58,379
first from 2018 to 2023. yeah and that

207
00:07:55,379 --> 00:08:01,019
was supposed to allow Legacy Farmers

208
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:04,860
um a Toe Hold to have them have years to

209
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:06,719
establish distro and dispensary and all

210
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:10,620
these different relationships before big

211
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:13,139
companies came in that's right yeah well

212
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,319
Steve D'Angelo and Harborside and very

213
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:17,460
other lobbying groups

214
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:20,039
they didn't want to wait that long they

215
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:22,859
wanted to dominate and so

216
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:24,839
they got a workaround where you couldn't

217
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,840
have more than an acre

218
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:31,079
that's still true yeah because that's

219
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:34,500
part of the law but you can stack as

220
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:36,538
many 10 000 square foot licenses as your

221
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,479
county will allow you or your city will

222
00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:41,338
allow you to okay and so what happened

223
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:43,139
there is that what they would have found

224
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:45,720
in my opinion if they would have forced

225
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:47,879
it to just be an acre or less you would

226
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,560
have had all these Legacy Brands sure

227
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:51,838
and you would have discovered that with

228
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:55,018
the amount of stores that they have the

229
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:58,920
Legacy Brands were more than capable

230
00:08:55,019 --> 00:09:00,899
of filling the current demand yeah and

231
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:03,059
since all these Legacy Brands would have

232
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:05,278
been a lot more a lot smaller and a lot

233
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:07,259
more diverse in size

234
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,299
their quality probably would have been a

235
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:11,458
lot better hitting the shelves

236
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:13,620
but what they did is they allowed

237
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:15,838
certain counties like in Monterey and

238
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,659
Salinas and in Santa Barbara and

239
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,600
different areas to blow up and have

240
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:24,059
dozens or hundreds even of light of 10

241
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,220
000 square foot licenses yeah

242
00:09:24,059 --> 00:09:28,079
and they got you know and when you look

243
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,580
at the when you look at the fees for

244
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,860
some of these things some of these some

245
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,720
of these Farms are paying you know

246
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,899
hundreds of thousands of dollars to over

247
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:39,000
a million dollars a year just in just in

248
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:41,100
license fees

249
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,559
so the state and the counties they get

250
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:46,139
all that money up front yeah

251
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:48,419
and then there's way way too much weed

252
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:51,600
being produced

253
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:52,979
I had a good question yeah tangent but

254
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,560
quick question

255
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:58,139
how is Harborside producing all that

256
00:09:55,559 --> 00:10:00,119
stuff in Arizona for so long that

257
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:02,759
everybody knew about

258
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:06,060
was that I don't know they were moving

259
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:09,838
it in no I mean they as far as I know

260
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:11,458
Harborside had a uh I think it was like

261
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,500
you know 10 or 11 acres or something

262
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:15,719
like that it was a pretty big Greenhouse

263
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:19,039
facility I mean it's publicly known

264
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,940
right somewhere somewhere in Salinas

265
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:23,338
Arizona would you remember the Arizona

266
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:25,500
stuff I do but I don't I don't have any

267
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:27,540
inside information on that yeah I'm just

268
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,339
wondering yeah but you know there

269
00:10:27,539 --> 00:10:31,259
there's basically what what happened is

270
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:33,600
there was any number of rich people and

271
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:36,360
their children especially yeah who were

272
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,820
like oh this is a new massively

273
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:42,120
profitable industry and I'm going to

274
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,800
help my family dominate it yeah

275
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,539
and kind of what's happened this is

276
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:47,838
actually maybe this is like a little

277
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:51,000
subversive or for me to say or whatever

278
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,380
but but really what's happened

279
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,480
is

280
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:56,159
most of the biggest investors and the

281
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,278
biggest companies have just been

282
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:02,159
lighting a bunch of money on fire

283
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:04,019
um that's true like they thought they

284
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:06,360
were going to burn through all this

285
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:09,419
money but at the end of the day they

286
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,700
would have a dominant Market position

287
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:12,539
and then they would recoup that over

288
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:15,060
time

289
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:17,639
as a poor person I look at that and I

290
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:19,679
think oh those rich people thought they

291
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:20,519
were Rich enough to play with the Richer

292
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,379
people

293
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:25,259
well the other way you could look at it

294
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:26,879
and I'm not you know I'm no no yeah I'm

295
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:30,860
not playing their names or whatever but

296
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:33,299
you could say that there was a

297
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:34,860
industry-wide thing and this is not

298
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:36,719
everyone so don't take offense if you're

299
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,220
one of these people or maybe you should

300
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,120
I don't know it depends on who you are

301
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,480
but

302
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,278
when the money first came into cannabis

303
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:46,500
a lot of traditional cannabis people who

304
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:48,120
had had to hide for a long time and stay

305
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:51,299
low and they didn't really deal with

306
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:54,179
that type of Sharky rich person stayed

307
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:55,859
low yeah and a lot of the people that

308
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:58,739
were really interested in rep and

309
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:00,360
getting rich and being flashy they were

310
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,860
the first people to run towards the

311
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:05,519
money

312
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:08,159
for sure and so what happened is is a

313
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:11,399
lot of money made a lot of bad deals

314
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:12,899
with a lot of people that weren't able

315
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:14,039
to actually do what they said they were

316
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,778
going to do

317
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:17,219
yeah it was a bunch of people that acted

318
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:19,078
like they were connected and knew some

319
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,839
[ __ ] but weren't and didn't I mean that

320
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:23,939
we saw that non-stop in every single

321
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,800
facility we've ever been to yeah I mean

322
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,839
a lot of it when people people would

323
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:30,359
hire us to consult it would be to fix

324
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,740
the errors of the Knuckleheads that came

325
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,959
before us the Chads that came before us

326
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:37,320
that were like yeah we know what to do

327
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:40,500
you know so much and so you know you

328
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:42,360
have a situation now where

329
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,799
um it's like a state of the union or

330
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,440
whatever but you won't like if you're on

331
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:48,899
IG or you follow like uh marijuana news

332
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,000
or anything like that you're seeing

333
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:53,879
reports all the time of now of like

334
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,259
almost daily or weekly of pissed off

335
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:58,860
investors

336
00:12:55,259 --> 00:13:00,480
who all their all their investment money

337
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:02,039
has been blown

338
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,959
and they're wondering what the hell's

339
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:06,480
happening uh-huh

340
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:07,799
you know like in my neck of the woods I

341
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,800
mean it was this big thing where like

342
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:13,559
Flo Kana you know they raised 250

343
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:15,120
million dollars or something yeah and

344
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:16,939
then a few months ago they shuttered

345
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,679
operations

346
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:21,060
and so I think those guys they you know

347
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:23,638
they dealt with some pretty Sharky

348
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:25,739
investors yeah you know

349
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:27,600
um who were probably not the greatest

350
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,278
people to deal with but then the

351
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,659
investors are like okay well we're gonna

352
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:32,820
kick you out we're gonna take it all

353
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:34,620
over and then they're like here

354
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,959
like oh what are we taking over there's

355
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:39,659
no money yeah

356
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:41,219
you know and what it turns out is is

357
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:42,899
that as long as we're going to be this

358
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:46,139
situation where we're not federally

359
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:49,500
legal and we're only state legal then

360
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:51,899
every state technically legally is

361
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,839
supposed to be its own little island yes

362
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:58,860
which means that it can only you can't

363
00:13:54,839 --> 00:14:02,040
outs you can't send your excess

364
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:05,039
anywhere but these highly regulated

365
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:07,679
channels yeah and nobody ever figured

366
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:09,899
out like how much output or how to like

367
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:12,179
how to give out the you know how to give

368
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:14,639
out licenses and since licenses had a

369
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:17,578
ton of upfront money and fees and costs

370
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,778
involved they just granted them and took

371
00:14:17,578 --> 00:14:21,179
a bunch of the money

372
00:14:18,778 --> 00:14:22,980
yeah and they made it really really hard

373
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:24,719
for most of these piece places to

374
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,879
survive so what you have is you have the

375
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,278
people that are best at growing cannabis

376
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:31,019
say like the people in my area and Mendo

377
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:33,299
or you know southern people that have

378
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:35,879
been growing for a long time outdoor or

379
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:37,559
light depth or you have people that are

380
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:38,399
really quality Indoor Farmers or

381
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:40,138
whatever

382
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,000
and they're pushed

383
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:44,159
in all these different directions just

384
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,159
to survive so they can't actually bring

385
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:49,078
their full craft knowledge to bear

386
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:51,000
because they're having to make choices

387
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:53,458
based on Surviving

388
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,019
right yeah and then you've got these

389
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:57,479
huge companies that are just burning

390
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:59,759
through other people's money

391
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:02,459
that are producing B and C grade

392
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,379
cannabis and then dumping that

393
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:07,500
um anywhere they can

394
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:09,539
just to stay afloat

395
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,639
and how much do you think the uh hemp

396
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:14,219
Market played into it

397
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:16,440
the hemp Market the hemp Market played

398
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:19,379
into the THC Market in the over overflow

399
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:22,079
oh well I mean I I think that uh let's

400
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:24,720
talk I mean really I mean like

401
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:29,039
it's the state of [ __ ]

402
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:32,220
so before we get into hemp I'll just say

403
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:34,078
this what happened is is that

404
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,579
um there's way too much cannabis being

405
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:38,219
grown in California

406
00:15:35,578 --> 00:15:40,919
yeah way too much way too much outdoor

407
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:43,920
way too much there's there's so many 300

408
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:46,319
500 800 lighters you know all these huge

409
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:48,958
scenes that are banging stuff out and

410
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,959
there's and what's weird is that like

411
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:54,599
you look at Canada and Canada every year

412
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:58,198
destroys large amounts of unsold legal

413
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:00,440
cannabis yep so far in America all of

414
00:15:58,198 --> 00:16:02,399
ours just disappears

415
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,639
whatever

416
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:08,039
you know just disappear

417
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:10,198
so what happens is is that there's not

418
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:11,939
enough demand

419
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:13,620
to

420
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,600
um you know to you know there's way more

421
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:19,139
Supply than there is demand the state

422
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,899
doesn't want to admit failure yeah and

423
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:24,120
so you know there's a lot of but let's

424
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:25,320
just say that the line between the legal

425
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,379
Market

426
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:31,220
and the traditional Market is more of a

427
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:34,860
it's more of a shadow than a line yeah

428
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:36,959
I'd say it's very permeable yeah so we

429
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,778
got we got a brief technical difficulty

430
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:41,578
but um wherever I was talking about the

431
00:16:39,778 --> 00:16:44,759
line between

432
00:16:41,578 --> 00:16:48,359
legal and traditional is more of a it's

433
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:51,839
more of a shadow than a firm line

434
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,940
you know and so no one wants the the the

435
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:57,360
state doesn't want to address the fact

436
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:58,459
that they've way allowed over production

437
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,860
to

438
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:04,078
proliferate right yeah and so what

439
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:07,039
happens is is that a lot of this stuff

440
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:07,039
is getting diverted

441
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,939
but it is diverted

442
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:16,679
diverted into the traditional Market

443
00:17:15,058 --> 00:17:19,199
diverting the traditional Market is

444
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:22,019
flooding that and and

445
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,298
taking out what would be future

446
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:27,679
potential competitors

447
00:17:24,298 --> 00:17:27,679
for Rich Folk

448
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,120
is like when I'd Smoke Weed With Friends

449
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:38,759
and the dab Revolution was happening

450
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:42,239
I'm like you know this this torch thing

451
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:44,099
is really not relaxing it just took a

452
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,058
really nice hit you know and I'm like oh

453
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:47,058
happy and then it's all

454
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,740
it's too it was too Tweaky for me

455
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:54,480
because I remember back in the day like

456
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,160
Tweakers you used to have to make their

457
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,380
own pipes and stuff and they'd do that

458
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,058
with blow torches and [ __ ] and I used to

459
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,740
hate that like it would just be a nasty

460
00:18:00,058 --> 00:18:03,538
and so when I would see people like

461
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,640
light up dab rigs it would just bring

462
00:18:03,538 --> 00:18:07,200
back bad memories of that [ __ ] so of

463
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,419
course when we just start bullshitting

464
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,460
about nothing in particular it's come

465
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:13,559
coming through Crystal Clear yeah of

466
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,120
course yeah and then I start trying to

467
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:17,339
chat and then we like lose it or

468
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:19,079
whatever so that's that's fun well let's

469
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:21,240
go ahead and keep going

470
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:24,720
okay so I don't know exactly where we

471
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:27,538
got cut off but uh I I what I think is

472
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,960
happening is I think that the state

473
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:34,619
doesn't want to admit that it's allowed

474
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,480
far too much production to occur and

475
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:37,619
there's nowhere for that production to

476
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,279
go

477
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:42,479
within the regulated channels or not

478
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,460
enough of it

479
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,140
and they don't really know how to have a

480
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,940
system where people have poured in all

481
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:50,280
this money probably without getting sued

482
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:52,400
of how to pick and choose winners and

483
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:54,779
losers of who can continue and who can't

484
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,900
and they probably don't want to admit

485
00:18:54,779 --> 00:19:00,178
that they created a system that's failed

486
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:02,000
but what's happened is is because we're

487
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:04,860
not allowed to do interstate commerce

488
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,798
our over production

489
00:19:04,859 --> 00:19:10,558
isn't allowed to go anywhere yeah

490
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:13,619
legally that is

491
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:16,019
so what happened huh don't you I mean

492
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:17,699
from just from my point of view the way

493
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:21,058
I look at it and you know I have this

494
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:22,919
really like super nihilistic like point

495
00:19:21,058 --> 00:19:26,339
of view on everything that's very dark

496
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:27,480
maybe but like I I thought that was like

497
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:29,279
from my point of view all done

498
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,380
intentionally with the knowledge like

499
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:33,418
that they it's very easy for them to

500
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:36,120
predict how to crash a market and how to

501
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:37,799
like how to sync because they can afford

502
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:39,500
to lose money for x amount of years

503
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:42,179
because they're used

504
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,440
they is any any corporate entity of

505
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:46,798
these major corporate entities are

506
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:49,200
buying in no like uh W what's the one

507
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:51,720
that that UFC and all that stuff they've

508
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,400
got they've got interest in cannabis I

509
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:57,179
don't believe I don't believe that's

510
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:59,100
true I I agree with you okay and that I

511
00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:01,019
had my suspicions

512
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:04,439
and I do think that there are some

513
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:06,900
people out there glass house that

514
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:09,179
um is is

515
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:11,340
intending on burning through investor

516
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:12,360
money in the hopes that the Market opens

517
00:20:11,339 --> 00:20:15,058
up

518
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:17,219
and then they're positioned to service a

519
00:20:15,058 --> 00:20:19,200
much wider part of the American people

520
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,120
than they currently are

521
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:24,538
see the way I'm saying it is is not

522
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:28,139
necessarily so mysterious it's in

523
00:20:24,538 --> 00:20:30,058
business like the idea is the richest

524
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,380
people that are going into a business in

525
00:20:30,058 --> 00:20:34,798
a new commodity

526
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:37,380
they know that they can Outlast taking

527
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:38,579
losses longer than the other ones oh I

528
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,679
get what you're saying they drive the

529
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:42,538
price down or they dread the price up no

530
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:44,100
one can compete or drive it down no one

531
00:20:42,538 --> 00:20:45,298
can compete because they can't afford to

532
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:47,038
sell at that price then they

533
00:20:45,298 --> 00:20:50,339
artificially because it was artificially

534
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:52,200
driven down that is true the whole

535
00:20:50,339 --> 00:20:54,240
market and everybody's gone what they're

536
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,400
discovering is is that too many

537
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,558
different disparate rich people were

538
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,059
trying to do that yeah that's what I was

539
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:03,240
trying to get you really ended up doing

540
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:05,579
was lighting their money on fire that's

541
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,900
right they got too greedy and sometimes

542
00:21:05,579 --> 00:21:09,298
some of these people

543
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:11,160
like are now tired and like they're

544
00:21:09,298 --> 00:21:13,740
you're so look at it from like a rich

545
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:15,058
person's perspective right they want to

546
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:17,700
put their money into something that

547
00:21:15,058 --> 00:21:19,740
gives them a rate of return yeah and

548
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,720
they got Bamboozled into thinking that

549
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:23,279
like weed was going to be this oh my God

550
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,298
it's going to be three times the size of

551
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:26,099
alcohol this is going to be an 80

552
00:21:24,298 --> 00:21:28,019
billion dollar industry we're going to

553
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:29,639
get into the ground floor my son who's

554
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:32,220
kind of been a nerdo well his whole life

555
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:35,400
I'm going to be able to like gift him at

556
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:36,900
the ground level this amazing thing and

557
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,700
you know he's going to stop being a

558
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,798
disappointment

559
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,720
right yeah you know I think I think a

560
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:44,400
lot of it may be that sure but I think a

561
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,200
lot of people predicted there there was

562
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,298
going to be a lot of that well see here

563
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,779
so here's maybe we could maybe we could

564
00:21:48,298 --> 00:21:54,839
take a different step back sure because

565
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:56,460
this explains a lot of it where

566
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:59,459
um because it's because it's still

567
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:01,620
federally illegal the feds have decided

568
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:04,500
to some degree where

569
00:22:01,619 --> 00:22:06,959
if as long as it's within a state

570
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:09,058
they're not really going to apply it

571
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,579
because the state is Sovereign and can

572
00:22:09,058 --> 00:22:13,139
do what it wants yeah so that like I

573
00:22:11,579 --> 00:22:15,839
said that makes each state its own

574
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,280
little island yeah which makes it unique

575
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:20,699
in business because there's almost

576
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:22,500
nothing else in America where you're

577
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,440
confined by whatever business you're

578
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:26,640
doing to the state that you're in

579
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:28,259
fireworks and that's it I can think of

580
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,120
you know maybe like maybe you need to

581
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:31,740
get like a law license or like a real

582
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:34,319
estate license but when it comes to like

583
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,819
Goods for the most part there's nothing

584
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:37,859
where you're like oh this good can't

585
00:22:35,819 --> 00:22:39,899
cross state lines it can only be in

586
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:42,000
California or it can only be in Wyoming

587
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:45,960
or it can only be in Arizona

588
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,339
fireworks right so fireworks so down to

589
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,079
dude is you have to realize that like

590
00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:52,079
rich people want a rate of return on

591
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:53,879
their investment and so far cannabis has

592
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:57,740
been a terrible investment

593
00:22:53,880 --> 00:23:00,419
in which many many many big investors

594
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:03,538
are not even getting their principal

595
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:06,360
back yeah much less profit on their

596
00:23:03,538 --> 00:23:08,339
principle sure right so no rich people

597
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:10,199
want to like light their money on fire

598
00:23:08,339 --> 00:23:12,839
or like you know shoot it down a tube

599
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,640
and never see it again yeah so they got

600
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:16,379
into it where they thought oh I can get

601
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,059
into this industry I can get into this

602
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:20,580
Marketplace we can be in at the ground

603
00:23:18,058 --> 00:23:22,319
floor I can get a big amount of market

604
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:23,939
share and we can get in early and I'm

605
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:26,038
going to make gods of money

606
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:28,500
and this is where like I keep saying

607
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:32,879
like they treated it like any commodity

608
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:34,679
right but yeah commodity no it's it's me

609
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,720
it's a wild it's so unique and so

610
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:39,360
different it's not federally legal and

611
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,159
so that what that means is that like if

612
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:43,259
it was federally legal we could ship it

613
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:45,840
to whatever other states we wanted to

614
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:47,879
that wanted to allow it yeah

615
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:49,980
you know we could send our access to

616
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:52,740
places which means every single state

617
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:55,380
that's setting that's gotten set up has

618
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:57,960
gotten new investors jumping in

619
00:23:55,380 --> 00:24:00,960
hoping to make a bunch of money before

620
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,460
there's competition for them yeah and

621
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,319
they're all bumping into the same thing

622
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:06,480
I mean I was talking about it before

623
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:08,399
with flocona or whatever do you really

624
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,900
think those people wanted a light 250

625
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,659
million on fire

626
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:14,159
yeah I can't imagine that after you pour

627
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:16,500
that amount of money in anything you

628
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,539
decide to stop touching cannabis and you

629
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,099
shudder most of the operations as you

630
00:24:18,538 --> 00:24:22,140
try to retool and figure out what you

631
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:24,418
want to do yeah that's not a good look

632
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:26,880
did you see that thing like it was on it

633
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:28,259
was on IG and it was in the news

634
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,900
um you know where there's investors that

635
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:34,200
are hella angry at uh Emerald I think

636
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:37,200
it's Emerald Family Farms from from

637
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:40,140
Humble where they got an 18 or a 19

638
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,900
million dollar uh reinvestment

639
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:44,220
and the guy absconded and changed his

640
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,919
number and the investors haven't

641
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:49,440
received a penny of their principal back

642
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:52,440
shocking you know I mean I don't know

643
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,120
you went crypto with it I'm just well

644
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,620
you know I'm not there's like not like I

645
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:57,479
don't I don't know any details of it

646
00:24:55,619 --> 00:25:00,000
either but there's yeah there's

647
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:02,519
investors that are now suing various

648
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,720
Executives of cookie

649
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:09,240
oh angry angry at you know all kinds of

650
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,460
various practices but probably I saw

651
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,380
that I saw that what was the one that

652
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:15,058
they were saying it was something I mean

653
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:16,440
they're basically saying that they got

654
00:25:15,058 --> 00:25:19,440
deluded

655
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,900
okay and that certain Executives a

656
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:25,558
couple of them were pretty famous

657
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:27,120
um were getting Kickbacks side deals and

658
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:29,519
all that type of stuff and obviously

659
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:32,038
like if you're running on investor money

660
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:34,740
they don't want you making side deals

661
00:25:32,038 --> 00:25:37,740
yeah yeah I know because it's all you

662
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:39,839
know public and yeah I'll spend your

663
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:43,140
money yeah you can't be doing that yeah

664
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:45,298
yeah yeah you know and so and so who

665
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:47,940
knows if it's true or not but we've

666
00:25:45,298 --> 00:25:48,839
entered in like yeah that's not what I'm

667
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,400
saying and I don't have any inside

668
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:52,678
information on that but what I'm saying

669
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,360
is is that

670
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:55,798
you know you can look around at these

671
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:57,658
stories that are coming out whether it's

672
00:25:55,798 --> 00:25:59,819
Flo Connor Emerald County Farms or

673
00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:01,880
cookies or whatever where people that

674
00:25:59,819 --> 00:26:07,558
were investing a bunch of money in 2018

675
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:10,620
2019 2020 with big hopes and dreams

676
00:26:07,558 --> 00:26:12,839
of having a bunch of market share and

677
00:26:10,619 --> 00:26:13,859
and making a lot of money off their

678
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:15,599
investment

679
00:26:13,859 --> 00:26:17,819
are now worried that they're not even

680
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:21,980
going to get their investment money back

681
00:26:17,819 --> 00:26:21,980
yeah much less profit

682
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:25,740
and they said they were going to come in

683
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:27,900
swinging yeah they thought they were

684
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:29,400
going to take it over yeah and so one of

685
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,440
the things I was trying to say before we

686
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,900
had some technical glitches

687
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,278
is that because it's still federally

688
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:38,278
illegal

689
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:40,679
um you know most big banks are

690
00:26:38,278 --> 00:26:43,200
multinational Banks

691
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:44,820
you know or they operate and they don't

692
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,580
want big fines and they don't want

693
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:50,639
trouble with the federal government yeah

694
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:52,859
which means so far that cannabis

695
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,419
businesses have been they've had a

696
00:26:52,859 --> 00:26:56,699
cannabis businesses actually have a

697
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:58,860
really hard time even getting banking

698
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,360
you know I can't I can throw something

699
00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:01,439
in here that's very recent that I

700
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:03,899
learned

701
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,240
um uh with seed banks recently there's

702
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:08,278
uh Attitude Seed Bank opened up in the

703
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,720
USA a lot of people know about this and

704
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:11,519
they were able to secure credit card

705
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,798
processing however

706
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:17,158
um their competitors were trying to do

707
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:18,839
the same thing and they were told your

708
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:20,880
problems it's not even consistent

709
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:24,418
problems no well I mean typically what

710
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,520
happens too is you know like

711
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:27,840
um a bank will find out that a cannabis

712
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:29,460
company is a cannabis company because

713
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:31,259
they're not all named like Emerald

714
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:34,980
Emerald Farms or something some of them

715
00:27:31,259 --> 00:27:39,240
are named like the most benign sounding

716
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:41,519
LLC t-shirts yeah you know in order to

717
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,259
get around that yeah and then they

718
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:44,460
literally shut you down because they

719
00:27:43,259 --> 00:27:46,200
don't want fines from the federal

720
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:48,240
government they don't want because

721
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,440
they're federally they don't want any

722
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,419
trouble from the federal government

723
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,840
because they're trying to stay compliant

724
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:57,419
yes right so what that means is that

725
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:59,459
they're very intent upon not having a

726
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:02,759
bunch of traditional cannabis Black

727
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:04,919
Market money flow in to the legal system

728
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:07,200
they wanted to be above board and they

729
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:08,580
wanted to be legal the problem is is

730
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,440
that we don't have really government

731
00:28:08,579 --> 00:28:13,019
banks in this country all these banks

732
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,519
are private which means that like the

733
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:17,220
government can't of California or

734
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:19,980
whoever can't order the bank to treat

735
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:23,940
this industry like a normal business

736
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:26,940
if it sees liability for itself so you

737
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:28,679
and I can't go into a into a bank with a

738
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:30,480
business idea

739
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:33,840
and a prospectus

740
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:36,120
and uh you know and get a loan yeah we

741
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:39,480
can't go to AG credit we can't go to

742
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:41,459
Chase or or Wells Fargo or you know J

743
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:43,259
you know any of these big companies you

744
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:45,480
can't go to them and do that right but

745
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:47,579
they want you to use bank money

746
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,500
always so what does that mean

747
00:28:47,579 --> 00:28:51,839
that means that you're dealing with

748
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:54,900
private individuals

749
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:58,099
you know or funds that collect rich

750
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,100
people's banked money

751
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:05,520
that's why I always go back to no matter

752
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:06,720
if no matter what those people were

753
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:08,519
never going to win because they were

754
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,440
never Rich enough to compete with the

755
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:12,538
William Morris company and all these

756
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,519
other major organizations these major

757
00:29:12,538 --> 00:29:16,558
organizations they haven't even really

758
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:19,379
jumped in all that much yet

759
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:22,500
because it's not like they want to jump

760
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:24,299
in when it's when like I honestly think

761
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,919
that you can look around at some of

762
00:29:24,298 --> 00:29:28,918
these big companies

763
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:31,020
like you know whatever cookies or jungle

764
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:33,659
boys or somebody like that right they're

765
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:36,179
hoping when they go federally legal

766
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:39,299
I would guess that some big corporation

767
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:41,278
like Nabisco or William Morris or you

768
00:29:39,298 --> 00:29:44,158
know absolute some big company comes in

769
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:45,960
and just buys them I'm sure yeah that's

770
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:49,320
what they're hoping for because honestly

771
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:50,778
so far the super large companies that

772
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:54,480
can really throw their weight around

773
00:29:50,778 --> 00:29:56,460
cannabis is too small fry for them yet

774
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,200
it's not International there's too many

775
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:59,399
barriers to trade there's too many

776
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,919
regulations there's too many

777
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:04,139
restrictions it's too new they don't

778
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,940
want to throw math they might be

779
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:07,020
prepping for what's eventually going to

780
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,538
happen

781
00:30:07,019 --> 00:30:11,579
sure yeah we already know that but

782
00:30:09,538 --> 00:30:13,200
that doesn't mean that they would buy in

783
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:15,178
under their name they always buy in

784
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,340
under subsidiaries anyways we wouldn't

785
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:18,899
really have a very good idea of who's

786
00:30:17,339 --> 00:30:20,298
buying into what because they don't ever

787
00:30:18,898 --> 00:30:24,058
do that

788
00:30:20,298 --> 00:30:26,220
is their name you know so far they're

789
00:30:24,058 --> 00:30:27,960
all so smart right so what it looks like

790
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:29,759
is that a bunch of the private investors

791
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:33,058
so far looks like they're going to lose

792
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:35,398
their ass yes heavily they're gonna

793
00:30:33,058 --> 00:30:37,859
heavily lose their ax yeah you know and

794
00:30:35,398 --> 00:30:39,959
so they might be waiting for like it to

795
00:30:37,859 --> 00:30:41,879
actually go more legal

796
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:43,200
and then they can come in and buy things

797
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,360
for pennies that have a lot of

798
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,580
infrastructure in place

799
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:50,119
and I think some of these big people

800
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:53,460
call them msos multi-state organizations

801
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:55,319
I think a lot of these msos both the

802
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:57,659
executives and the private investors

803
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:59,579
that are involved in them their whole

804
00:30:57,659 --> 00:31:00,840
business model is to get big enough and

805
00:30:59,579 --> 00:31:03,119
attractive enough that someone

806
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:05,519
eventually comes along and gobbles them

807
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:08,219
up and everybody makes a bunch of money

808
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:11,220
based on their stock position

809
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:15,240
yeah I think that's that's the idea of

810
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:17,759
like a lot of like how I shouldn't say

811
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:20,579
the average person when they start a

812
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:22,558
business I think that's the mindset is

813
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:24,960
that they hope they get big enough to

814
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:26,339
get bought out by someone bigger

815
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,899
I think that's a lot of the small

816
00:31:26,339 --> 00:31:30,000
business mindset a lot of people don't

817
00:31:27,898 --> 00:31:33,719
have the mindset of the Long Camp

818
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,038
I mean you know it so

819
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,419
you know and I think that's the

820
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:37,740
investors thing you know they're looking

821
00:31:36,419 --> 00:31:40,380
at that's how they're going to get paid

822
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:42,179
back sure is this big buyout and

823
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,080
everybody gets a certain amount per

824
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:45,059
share

825
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:47,460
yeah and then it comes in a big chunk

826
00:31:45,058 --> 00:31:49,798
you know and so some of these investing

827
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:52,319
some of these businesses are always

828
00:31:49,798 --> 00:31:55,319
after fresh batches of private

829
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:56,939
investment and like the most devastating

830
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:58,200
thing for them ever would be the status

831
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:00,298
quo

832
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,860
it reminds me of the internet bubble so

833
00:32:00,298 --> 00:32:04,200
much just just the way we're speaking

834
00:32:01,859 --> 00:32:06,778
about it like the the the internet

835
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,538
bubble of the the 2000s you know oh yeah

836
00:32:06,778 --> 00:32:12,839
like this thing where it's like oh

837
00:32:08,538 --> 00:32:15,058
Yahoo's worth 480 480 bucks a year and

838
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:18,240
then eventually somebody goes well how

839
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:19,619
do they actually make money yep yeah and

840
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,960
someone's like where's all the money

841
00:32:19,619 --> 00:32:23,699
where is the revenue

842
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:26,460
you know and it's like you can have

843
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:29,278
certain businesses strangely enough for

844
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:31,200
market share that keep losing money but

845
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:33,119
gaining market share

846
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,120
like you know Amazon would be the

847
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:38,398
primary example oh yeah where they grew

848
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:40,199
themselves with losses

849
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:42,778
but they were actually gobbling up

850
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:47,220
market share and and destroying local

851
00:32:42,778 --> 00:32:49,200
malls and changing how consumers shopped

852
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:51,480
yeah they changed how business was done

853
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,340
in that in that way they changed how

854
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:55,500
they changed literally and the internet

855
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:57,199
came along with them and people could

856
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:59,940
all of a sudden shop in their underwear

857
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,519
and you know so that model can't that

858
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:05,038
model can work

859
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:06,298
you know but it's not working for weed

860
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:08,099
and so I think now you're in this

861
00:33:06,298 --> 00:33:10,859
position where we're in California we're

862
00:33:08,099 --> 00:33:12,538
five years into legalization and all of

863
00:33:10,859 --> 00:33:15,058
a sudden the stuff you start to see a

864
00:33:12,538 --> 00:33:18,119
lot of is anger and lawsuits and

865
00:33:15,058 --> 00:33:20,639
recriminations and firing of Executives

866
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:23,278
and all these different things going on

867
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:26,100
because where's the money

868
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:29,038
yeah who's making money

869
00:33:26,099 --> 00:33:30,839
no one nothing like when you when you

870
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:33,179
talk to people and you and I both talk

871
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:34,678
to a lot of people all up and down you

872
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:36,298
want to call it the industry on both

873
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:38,580
sides yeah

874
00:33:36,298 --> 00:33:39,720
you know who tells you you know you

875
00:33:38,579 --> 00:33:41,158
don't even necessarily who they are is

876
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,440
anyone telling you oh we're making money

877
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:45,240
hand over fist couldn't be happier no

878
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,519
and it seems like the only people that

879
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:50,399
could be making money are the the is the

880
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:52,319
taxes making money which and I don't see

881
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:55,439
that necessarily I don't see like public

882
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:57,178
social stuff benefiting widely from well

883
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,519
taxes aren't making money

884
00:33:57,179 --> 00:34:00,778
taxes are skimming off other people's

885
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,399
money well that's what I'm saying but

886
00:34:00,778 --> 00:34:05,460
it's the only guaranteed money that that

887
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:06,898
has come in are the taxes you know taxes

888
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,720
and fees and all this different stuff

889
00:34:06,898 --> 00:34:11,699
and so a lot of times these investors

890
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:13,799
were promised whatever they needed to

891
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:15,960
get promised so that these people could

892
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,760
get the money yeah

893
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,199
and they'd figure it out later and then

894
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,599
there's some of these people some of the

895
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:23,158
people that are winning is like some of

896
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:25,080
these Executives that borrow that

897
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:26,220
borrowed a bunch of money had that last

898
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:27,898
test I don't know we've had enough

899
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:30,299
technical difficulties this week now

900
00:34:27,898 --> 00:34:33,299
that I do feel a little thrown off my my

901
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:36,659
jibber jabber game yeah for sure

902
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:38,580
um so on top of all the legal stuff

903
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:40,820
there was some news today that kind of

904
00:34:38,579 --> 00:34:44,639
Hit the scene that that was a little

905
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:47,940
wacky and I the general consensus when I

906
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:50,460
posted the the article was uh not not

907
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:51,960
positive from our community the the

908
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:53,699
traditional Market I would say that

909
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:56,579
generally speaking that responds to what

910
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:58,618
I post and it was about California

911
00:34:56,579 --> 00:34:59,400
giving 22 million dollars I believe it

912
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:02,820
was

913
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:07,200
or their thereabouts to

914
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:08,480
um it was either 6 or 16 universities

915
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:13,799
um

916
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:15,420
to conduct research on Legacy strings

917
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:18,240
and

918
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:20,480
the response from

919
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:22,919
pretty much everyone was resoundingly

920
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,619
like how

921
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,119
what how are they gonna do Legacy

922
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:28,619
anything when they haven't you know

923
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,140
talked to anyone in the community I know

924
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:33,059
my I'm I'm super biased and opinionated

925
00:35:31,139 --> 00:35:35,098
about this but I'm really interested

926
00:35:33,059 --> 00:35:38,639
since since you hadn't heard about it or

927
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:42,960
seen it yet to hear your thoughts

928
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:44,759
uh well I don't you know I didn't

929
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,760
actually hear about it because I was

930
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,380
otherwise occupied today until you told

931
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,160
me right before we kind of started the

932
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,720
show

933
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:54,358
I do think

934
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:57,059
you know it's a needed thing

935
00:35:54,358 --> 00:36:00,358
uh in the sense that they should start

936
00:35:57,059 --> 00:36:01,920
taking interest into the genetic history

937
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:04,019
and the diversity and the different

938
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,760
types of plants that are out there

939
00:36:04,019 --> 00:36:08,880
a problem that they're going to face

940
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:11,099
probably is what the same problem that

941
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,300
they face like with making things legal

942
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:13,500
is like

943
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,240
since we don't have any like

944
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:19,079
accreditation and there's no way for

945
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:21,598
them to like vet us yeah how do they

946
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:23,880
choose who should be on the board

947
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:26,579
because as you as you as I and I know

948
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:28,079
right like without naming any names and

949
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:29,700
getting anybody mad at us or anything

950
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,039
like that

951
00:36:29,699 --> 00:36:34,199
um you know there is a lot of popular

952
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:36,059
people that actually

953
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:39,539
aren't that

954
00:36:36,059 --> 00:36:41,639
in depth yeah and so you start talking

955
00:36:39,539 --> 00:36:44,338
about like well who should be the people

956
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:46,920
talking about history oh my gosh would

957
00:36:44,338 --> 00:36:50,099
you probably get a big debate

958
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:52,500
on who's allowed in and who people trust

959
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:53,700
and who people don't trust okay let me

960
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,019
read this to you real quick so you can

961
00:36:53,699 --> 00:36:57,899
get a better idea

962
00:36:55,019 --> 00:36:59,099
me getting closer because I am blind the

963
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:02,099
California Department of cannabis

964
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:03,960
control the DCC awarded 20 million in

965
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:05,880
research grants to 16 academic

966
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,559
institutions the funds will support

967
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,300
scientific research on the impact of

968
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:12,480
cannabis on the mental health of young

969
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:14,880
people novel cannabinoids and Delta 8

970
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,679
and Delta 10 THC and the first of its

971
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,380
kind study of California's Legacy

972
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:21,480
cannabis genetics intended to preserve

973
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:24,300
the history value and diversity of the

974
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,740
communities that Steward them it is the

975
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:27,119
Department's aspiration that these

976
00:37:25,739 --> 00:37:29,159
studies will advance the body of

977
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,858
scientific research further our

978
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:33,539
understanding of cannabis and age

979
00:37:30,858 --> 00:37:36,659
continued development and refinement at

980
00:37:33,539 --> 00:37:40,699
the legal framework said Rasha Salama

981
00:37:36,659 --> 00:37:43,078
chief deputy director at DCC call me

982
00:37:40,699 --> 00:37:44,819
these studies will provide valuable

983
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:47,160
insights on topics of interest to

984
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:48,838
California's consumers businesses and

985
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:50,399
policy makers and the department looks

986
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:52,320
forward to sharing them once they are

987
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,059
completed researchers at the University

988
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,880
of California San Diego will build on

989
00:37:54,059 --> 00:37:58,440
the existing federally funded project to

990
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,880
provide California specific data on the

991
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:02,400
impact of cannabinoids on mental health

992
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:06,079
physical health during adolescence yada

993
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:08,519
yada I was more interested in the um

994
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:12,539
in the Legacy part but they don't really

995
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:14,400
go much more into that and yeah so after

996
00:38:12,539 --> 00:38:16,920
hearing more

997
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,900
anything change there

998
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,480
well

999
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:25,740
it's about as vague as humanly possible

1000
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:27,240
sure yeah except for the fact that

1001
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:30,899
um you know they're going to look at

1002
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:32,399
effects on children yes and which makes

1003
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:35,160
them

1004
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,440
well that that makes sense to me yeah

1005
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:40,379
because

1006
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:42,240
um you know anytime you make rules

1007
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:43,619
there's obviously going to be a series

1008
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:46,679
of people that are going to try to work

1009
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:49,260
their way around rules yeah sure and I

1010
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:51,419
don't think they anticipated when they

1011
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:54,119
passed the farm bill that had the hemp

1012
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:56,700
part to it that people were going to

1013
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:59,300
extract these things Delta eight and

1014
00:38:56,699 --> 00:39:03,500
Delta 10 because they only had

1015
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:06,119
regulations Banning Delta 9 THC yeah

1016
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:09,239
Delta what happens a specific kind of

1017
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:11,760
Delta 9 THC at that yes so what happens

1018
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:14,219
is is is is various entrepreneurs

1019
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:17,339
discovered that they can pull out these

1020
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:20,039
possibly psychoactive chemicals or you

1021
00:39:17,338 --> 00:39:23,159
know or compounds or whatever from hemp

1022
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:24,960
right and hemp isn't regulated that way

1023
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:26,578
and neither of these compounds and all

1024
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,539
of a sudden it appears at your local gas

1025
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:28,980
station

1026
00:39:27,539 --> 00:39:31,619
yeah

1027
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:33,780
right it's way Delta eight and Delta 10

1028
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:35,180
probably have way more places that

1029
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:38,880
they're sold

1030
00:39:35,179 --> 00:39:41,399
everywhere here yeah then then cannabis

1031
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,559
because cannabis so far they've created

1032
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:45,599
so many rules and regulations it's like

1033
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:47,338
it it costs an arm and a leg just to

1034
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,960
have a store and there's zero

1035
00:39:47,338 --> 00:39:51,539
regulations on this stuff right now and

1036
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,059
there's zero regulations and so I'm sure

1037
00:39:51,539 --> 00:39:59,099
with zero regulations that's giving kids

1038
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:59,759
a lot more access to it I do fear the

1039
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:01,500
um

1040
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,720
the kid thing

1041
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:08,219
yeah specifically because typically kids

1042
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:11,399
are very sympathetic right and uh nobody

1043
00:40:08,219 --> 00:40:13,799
in the legal Market or traditional

1044
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:17,940
Market is really advocating for a bunch

1045
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:19,740
of kid use yeah no not right

1046
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:21,179
um whatsoever so

1047
00:40:19,739 --> 00:40:23,759
you know

1048
00:40:21,179 --> 00:40:27,480
um I do think that I don't think you

1049
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:29,579
should ban things that adults enjoy in

1050
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,838
order to protect children

1051
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:33,780
I agree

1052
00:40:30,838 --> 00:40:36,779
you know but all you know the way that

1053
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:38,400
things that could hurt children

1054
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:41,339
um possibly or could have a negative

1055
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,260
impact on them don't get regulated is

1056
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:44,880
the industry as big and powerful and

1057
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:46,380
Rich and has a bunch of lobbyists and

1058
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,720
they make sure that they keep their

1059
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:51,119
grubby hands off their stuff

1060
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:52,679
cannabis doesn't have that

1061
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,640
cannabis doesn't actually have big

1062
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:56,819
business

1063
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:59,338
but to me like the the Legacy strain

1064
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:02,880
part is the part that really like grinds

1065
00:40:59,338 --> 00:41:06,059
my gears because like like just even

1066
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:08,099
looking at the idea of it is like now

1067
00:41:06,059 --> 00:41:09,539
they want to take a look at the Legacy

1068
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:11,220
streets hey let's get let's get a hold

1069
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:13,320
of some of these stewards over in some

1070
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:15,179
of these uh locations in California Oh

1071
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:17,338
you mean the ones that don't [ __ ]

1072
00:41:15,179 --> 00:41:19,500
grow anymore because they can't afford

1073
00:41:17,338 --> 00:41:22,019
to they had to toss out their mother

1074
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:24,119
room because they were driven out by the

1075
00:41:22,019 --> 00:41:25,619
corporate [ __ ] these guys are all

1076
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:27,539
supporting that's the way I look at it

1077
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:29,460
Matt didn't want me to talk about this

1078
00:41:27,539 --> 00:41:32,639
because he says we talk about it all the

1079
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:36,179
time uh but I'll bring it up again yeah

1080
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:38,819
do it fine fine you must is is that you

1081
00:41:36,179 --> 00:41:40,019
know I am quite fear fearful of Legacy

1082
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:43,200
strains

1083
00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:45,539
both in seed and clone form surviving

1084
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:47,519
because it was always a small group of

1085
00:41:45,539 --> 00:41:49,039
people that cared about holding on to

1086
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:52,259
things that weren't currently popular

1087
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:54,179
yeah right the vast majority of the

1088
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:57,060
Cannabis industry only wants to grow

1089
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:59,159
things that people want in the moment

1090
00:41:57,059 --> 00:42:02,099
most people even within our community

1091
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:04,500
don't care very much about Legacy unless

1092
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:07,740
that Legacy makes them money

1093
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:10,500
so it was already a a small subset of a

1094
00:42:07,739 --> 00:42:12,659
small subset right and the issue is is

1095
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:15,059
that that small subset used to be able

1096
00:42:12,659 --> 00:42:17,879
to use what was a fairly lucrative

1097
00:42:15,059 --> 00:42:19,739
industry to fund their little passion

1098
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:22,800
project

1099
00:42:19,739 --> 00:42:24,659
which might be keeping rare clones from

1100
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,760
back in the day that had a popularity

1101
00:42:24,659 --> 00:42:29,940
once that aren't very popular right now

1102
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:31,740
or rare seed lines or you know I mean

1103
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:35,159
Matt can talk about you know like our

1104
00:42:31,739 --> 00:42:36,899
buddy CSI or him or others where they

1105
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:39,719
make things that are commercially viable

1106
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:41,460
but then they also have passion projects

1107
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:44,279
on the side where they might get some

1108
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:46,740
old lines or some rare stuff or some

1109
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:49,320
weird sativas that probably aren't

1110
00:42:46,739 --> 00:42:51,118
commercially viable yeah but they might

1111
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:53,160
do an open pollination or they might do

1112
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,720
a preservation project just to keep

1113
00:42:53,159 --> 00:42:57,239
those seeds fresh

1114
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:59,759
yeah and see what's going on with them

1115
00:42:57,239 --> 00:43:01,318
and but what that takes is that takes

1116
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,720
someone caring

1117
00:43:01,318 --> 00:43:05,519
and having enough time and excess money

1118
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:08,159
to be able to

1119
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:09,599
fund that little passion project

1120
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:11,219
yeah so if they're going to stretch

1121
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:13,440
everybody out and everyone's going to be

1122
00:43:11,219 --> 00:43:15,358
hanging on by a thread

1123
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,099
it's going to make those little passion

1124
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:20,159
projects it's going to make things that

1125
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:21,240
aren't currently feasible much harder to

1126
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:22,559
achieve

1127
00:43:21,239 --> 00:43:23,759
yeah

1128
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:26,578
I think

1129
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,280
um this it sounds like resoundingly

1130
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:31,680
after talking to not just our you know

1131
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:34,140
our friends but people at other seed

1132
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:37,379
banks and around the the community it

1133
00:43:34,139 --> 00:43:39,838
sounds like this uh 420 was pretty

1134
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:42,780
miserable sales wise in the seed Market

1135
00:43:39,838 --> 00:43:45,659
more probably the worst one yet

1136
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:48,599
um in the years that it passed so yeah

1137
00:43:45,659 --> 00:43:50,338
definitely like the Legacy the Legacy

1138
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:52,318
stuff's going to be growing Tighter and

1139
00:43:50,338 --> 00:43:54,119
Tighter and Tighter because it was the

1140
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:57,119
that kind of stuff that was not moving

1141
00:43:54,119 --> 00:44:00,059
at all I mean Matt can talk about this

1142
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:02,900
more than I can but you know we used to

1143
00:44:00,059 --> 00:44:05,639
have like a lot of times the emerald cup

1144
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:07,680
or like the High Times cups or these

1145
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:10,259
various Gatherings

1146
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:12,779
um not only they were nominally uh an

1147
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:14,160
awards ceremony and it but really what

1148
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:16,260
they kind of were

1149
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:18,480
they were a way to sell hundreds of

1150
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:21,839
booths to all kinds of different vendors

1151
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:23,818
yeah and those vendors could come and

1152
00:44:21,838 --> 00:44:25,559
with a fee and Booth space and whatever

1153
00:44:23,818 --> 00:44:28,259
else they could Hawk their Wares

1154
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:30,000
whatever those wears might be yeah um

1155
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:32,460
and that was actually probably the

1156
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,440
economic driver that pushed most of

1157
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:36,539
these events

1158
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:38,700
big time right for a long time yeah

1159
00:44:36,539 --> 00:44:42,059
because the same thing because it was a

1160
00:44:38,699 --> 00:44:45,299
it was a way for you know producers of

1161
00:44:42,059 --> 00:44:48,059
seeds or flowers or topicals or extracts

1162
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:49,680
or you know what or whatever edible

1163
00:44:48,059 --> 00:44:52,500
whatever the case may be to get in front

1164
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:54,239
of customers yeah and you could go see

1165
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:56,460
and you could maybe even talk to your

1166
00:44:54,239 --> 00:45:00,838
heroes or you could complain to someone

1167
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:05,159
in person or whatever it might be and

1168
00:45:00,838 --> 00:45:08,039
um you know that fueled a lot of small

1169
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:11,940
businesses that had a very wide and very

1170
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:14,519
diverse interest range yeah so you could

1171
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:17,818
go and talk to Matt and you know he's

1172
00:45:14,519 --> 00:45:20,219
interested in you know uh you know blue

1173
00:45:17,818 --> 00:45:21,659
lines and weird Afghans and different

1174
00:45:20,219 --> 00:45:22,980
types of stuff like that and you could

1175
00:45:21,659 --> 00:45:25,078
go talk to somebody else that was

1176
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:27,119
interested in mostly in Old School

1177
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:28,380
Humboldt and Mendo genetics and you

1178
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:30,720
could talk to somebody else that was

1179
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:34,019
mostly interested in purples or yeah you

1180
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:36,059
know that one year in uh emerald cut me

1181
00:45:34,019 --> 00:45:40,259
and CSI I were literally

1182
00:45:36,059 --> 00:45:42,000
Booth to Booth with NCGA right next to

1183
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:43,980
me it was a really weird situation you

1184
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,380
could talk to three of the the older

1185
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:48,659
guys right there right there yeah people

1186
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:50,700
can get and a lot of times it was like

1187
00:45:48,659 --> 00:45:52,259
people wanted to buy seed and so you

1188
00:45:50,699 --> 00:45:54,719
know when when the industry had more

1189
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:56,220
money sloshing around in it a bunch of

1190
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:58,379
people would come to those events with

1191
00:45:56,219 --> 00:46:00,899
with cash in their pocket intending on

1192
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:03,539
talking to people directly which wasn't

1193
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:06,599
always easy and then making purchasing

1194
00:46:03,539 --> 00:46:08,519
decisions after those chats it was a

1195
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:11,039
traditionally outlawed Market it was it

1196
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:13,139
like I mean that was a uh uh started out

1197
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:14,940
as a Harvest Festival so it was a lot of

1198
00:46:13,139 --> 00:46:17,460
the The Outlaw Market that would bring

1199
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:20,159
their Outlaw money you know like this

1200
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:22,679
was how it ran and they would buy their

1201
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:25,500
seats for that whole next year that they

1202
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:27,899
wanted to run and it was a it was

1203
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:30,838
something that happened and it it fueled

1204
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:33,660
a it fueled a lot of what was the

1205
00:46:30,838 --> 00:46:36,000
Emerald Triangle at that time yeah and

1206
00:46:33,659 --> 00:46:38,039
it fueled a lot of individuality it fuel

1207
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,579
build a lot of you know it basically

1208
00:46:38,039 --> 00:46:43,679
made the scene very diffuse and I was

1209
00:46:41,579 --> 00:46:45,599
able to grow some chocolate ties and

1210
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:47,098
grow those lines you could you could

1211
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:49,500
there would you know all of a sudden and

1212
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:51,660
you know Matt will joke you know that

1213
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:53,940
like you know we talked about it how

1214
00:46:51,659 --> 00:46:55,920
like 90 of the seed companies probably

1215
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:59,039
have sprung up within the last 10 years

1216
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:01,380
oh yeah in that environment that allowed

1217
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:04,619
them to do a bunch of shows and IG

1218
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:06,780
allowing them to like announce drops and

1219
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:09,119
do business through there allowed them

1220
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:12,240
to communicate with a lot of various

1221
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:14,880
weed people small and large and connect

1222
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:17,399
to their customers and it developed a

1223
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:19,858
pretty robust thing yeah and the more

1224
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:22,920
robust it became the more people got

1225
00:47:19,858 --> 00:47:24,480
interested in jumping into it

1226
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:26,099
right

1227
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,780
um and it's kind of like one of those

1228
00:47:26,099 --> 00:47:30,180
things where like you get into real

1229
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:32,040
estate or something during a boom time

1230
00:47:30,179 --> 00:47:33,899
and you've never experienced High

1231
00:47:32,039 --> 00:47:35,338
interest rates or depression

1232
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:37,260
so the whole time you've been in

1233
00:47:35,338 --> 00:47:39,480
business it's just booming

1234
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:42,180
and there's a lot of people right with

1235
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:44,219
seeds with seeds like it's everybody can

1236
00:47:42,179 --> 00:47:48,299
make seeds it's not hard to make seeds

1237
00:47:44,219 --> 00:47:50,279
it's it's hard to do Selections in in do

1238
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:52,619
predictive breeding you know but it's

1239
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:54,599
not hard to make seeds so it's like it

1240
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:57,240
is kind of hard to sell a house in that

1241
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:59,160
way like it's not easy to sell anybody

1242
00:47:57,239 --> 00:48:00,598
can make seeds like anybody do it their

1243
00:47:59,159 --> 00:48:03,779
first time super easy with the male or

1244
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:06,059
female and so anybody small people to

1245
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:08,519
like dabble in it as an excess stream of

1246
00:48:06,059 --> 00:48:11,039
income yeah but that also allowed some

1247
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:14,159
people to pursue their passions or their

1248
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:16,079
interests yep and then find people that

1249
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:18,358
shared those interests and sell beans to

1250
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:20,460
them yeah well now what's happened with

1251
00:48:18,358 --> 00:48:22,139
the legality of everything is that all

1252
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:24,000
those booths there they all have to be

1253
00:48:22,139 --> 00:48:26,699
licensed people

1254
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,838
it's now they've now now but before the

1255
00:48:26,699 --> 00:48:30,480
whole thing was sort of like some kind

1256
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:32,219
of like gray area swap meet now they

1257
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:35,039
have little segments of like oh here's

1258
00:48:32,219 --> 00:48:37,439
the Legacy Brands yeah here's the little

1259
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:39,900
section of people that probably can't

1260
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:42,420
afford to be here but it's use it used

1261
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:43,920
to be all the people you came to see so

1262
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:45,358
we'll like we'll like make this little

1263
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,099
section for them and we'll make them

1264
00:48:45,358 --> 00:48:49,199
have a space because you're tired of

1265
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:52,440
going and seeing all of the big

1266
00:48:49,199 --> 00:48:54,358
corporate funded Brands yeah that have a

1267
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:55,740
bunch of money behind them and none of

1268
00:48:54,358 --> 00:48:57,420
them really have any little passion

1269
00:48:55,739 --> 00:48:58,679
projects what they want is like market

1270
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:01,139
share and money

1271
00:48:58,679 --> 00:49:03,480
it's a lot of those in the Legacy Brands

1272
00:49:01,139 --> 00:49:05,338
you would go in there you'd see they'd

1273
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:07,260
have like a plant there and you could

1274
00:49:05,338 --> 00:49:09,299
talk to them but there was Zero seed

1275
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:12,119
cells they were not allowed to do any

1276
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:14,760
seed cells if they weren't licensed by

1277
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:17,338
the state so I mean I remember yeah

1278
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:19,260
there was people there was times when uh

1279
00:49:17,338 --> 00:49:21,599
you know I would do random stuff like I

1280
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:23,339
would go to like you know I'll just just

1281
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:25,440
off the top of my head I went to like

1282
00:49:23,338 --> 00:49:28,858
the the swamp boys once you know yeah

1283
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:31,440
and I I smelled their mojito and I was

1284
00:49:28,858 --> 00:49:33,299
like oh that was a cool jar I'll take a

1285
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,039
pack yeah there was there was there

1286
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:37,440
there was some nose in there that I was

1287
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:39,480
like oh well okay it was like you know

1288
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,400
but it's like unless you have unless you

1289
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:43,440
have samples unless you have herb and

1290
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:46,440
unless you have people that can like you

1291
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:48,539
know smell it or smoke it or see it or

1292
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:50,280
talk to the person they might not know

1293
00:49:48,539 --> 00:49:53,699
it exists or might not know it cares

1294
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:55,859
yeah you know and so what happens is is

1295
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:57,480
that a lot of the people that started

1296
00:49:55,858 --> 00:49:58,980
making seeds and started making names

1297
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:01,920
and started making companies for

1298
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:04,019
themselves are locked out of that

1299
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:06,240
yeah so it's like the very people that

1300
00:50:04,019 --> 00:50:08,519
built those scenes up into making people

1301
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:11,159
willing to buy expensive tickets and

1302
00:50:08,519 --> 00:50:14,338
bring money in their pocket to drop and

1303
00:50:11,159 --> 00:50:16,379
allow those those you know those uh you

1304
00:50:14,338 --> 00:50:18,299
know those uh High Times or Emerald cup

1305
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:19,680
or whatever to sell expensive Booth

1306
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:21,900
space

1307
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:24,239
right like that all collapses because

1308
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:26,940
you need people with money you know the

1309
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:29,219
last year the very last year that I went

1310
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:30,300
to emerald cut the only way I was

1311
00:50:29,219 --> 00:50:35,039
allowed

1312
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:37,800
to go there was to go there via a seed

1313
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:40,619
bank that was registered right like and

1314
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:43,380
and had licenses somehow all that crap

1315
00:50:40,619 --> 00:50:45,180
and um I was allowed to interact with

1316
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:46,800
the customers but I wasn't allowed to do

1317
00:50:45,179 --> 00:50:48,838
any direct seed sales so they'd come to

1318
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,300
me excited to buy these packs for me and

1319
00:50:48,838 --> 00:50:53,099
I'd be like

1320
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:54,780
gotta go there sorry and it would just

1321
00:50:53,099 --> 00:50:56,460
yeah it would have said people so much

1322
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:59,220
that they couldn't just do that they

1323
00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:01,220
have that exchange you had to it's

1324
00:50:59,219 --> 00:51:03,598
almost like you were there to promote

1325
00:51:01,219 --> 00:51:05,338
but like you had to have a seed bank

1326
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:07,140
there that had all the proper licensing

1327
00:51:05,338 --> 00:51:09,900
and all the proper hoops and all the

1328
00:51:07,139 --> 00:51:12,480
proper everything and you know before at

1329
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:14,160
some place like that you know Matt or

1330
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,619
any number of our buddies would show up

1331
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:19,078
with a trunk full of seeds and brochures

1332
00:51:16,619 --> 00:51:21,119
and all kinds of stuff and in the new

1333
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:23,880
rules it's like the distributor has to

1334
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:25,920
bring it all yeah I suppose to show up

1335
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:27,720
with stuff piles of stuff to give away

1336
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,220
and I couldn't even do that you know

1337
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:31,679
what I mean I wasn't even a lot of give

1338
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:33,239
stuff away so they created all these new

1339
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:34,799
rules and they created all these

1340
00:51:33,239 --> 00:51:37,799
regulations and they created all these

1341
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:41,220
fees and taxes and it made them a good

1342
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:43,740
it made revenue and and in terms of like

1343
00:51:41,219 --> 00:51:44,699
you know State fees and taxes that they

1344
00:51:43,739 --> 00:51:47,219
got

1345
00:51:44,699 --> 00:51:48,179
but then a few years went by and now who

1346
00:51:47,219 --> 00:51:50,399
knows what they're going to think

1347
00:51:48,179 --> 00:51:52,259
because all of a sudden they're like

1348
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,818
reaping what they sowed

1349
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:55,859
and they're realizing they didn't

1350
00:51:53,818 --> 00:51:58,139
actually set up an industry that's

1351
00:51:55,858 --> 00:51:59,759
thriving yeah

1352
00:51:58,139 --> 00:52:01,379
you can't have an industry that's

1353
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,940
thriving that the only way it's thriving

1354
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:05,099
is you give away more of your business

1355
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:07,200
to more investors to stay afloat for

1356
00:52:05,099 --> 00:52:09,180
longer

1357
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:11,299
that's not

1358
00:52:09,179 --> 00:52:13,259
and so what happens is when that happens

1359
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:15,780
you know especially when you get

1360
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:18,059
investors in there the problem is since

1361
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:20,040
investors don't come from weed all of

1362
00:52:18,059 --> 00:52:22,500
the cool little side projects all of the

1363
00:52:20,039 --> 00:52:24,119
neat little stuff all of the ways that

1364
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:26,460
you would treat cannabis in order to

1365
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:28,079
make it really really high quality they

1366
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:29,220
start looking at that as costly and

1367
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:31,559
inefficient

1368
00:52:29,219 --> 00:52:32,699
yeah and they want to return on their

1369
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:34,140
investment

1370
00:52:32,699 --> 00:52:35,639
and then you're not going to make any

1371
00:52:34,139 --> 00:52:38,039
money at your company unless you give

1372
00:52:35,639 --> 00:52:40,078
them a return like you have to pay out

1373
00:52:38,039 --> 00:52:42,599
all this money and if you want money

1374
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:44,280
left over for you people start trying to

1375
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:46,140
figure out like it's what happened in

1376
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:47,640
Colorado when like everyone was like oh

1377
00:52:46,139 --> 00:52:50,879
I need to get three or four pounds of

1378
00:52:47,639 --> 00:52:52,199
light yeah the most important thing is

1379
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,400
getting three or four pounds of light

1380
00:52:52,199 --> 00:52:55,259
because that's the only way I'm going to

1381
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,460
get a paycheck and that's the only way

1382
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:59,520
the investors are going to start

1383
00:52:56,460 --> 00:53:03,119
breathing off you know stop stop hunting

1384
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:05,579
me and what that meant is that all these

1385
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:07,619
consumers then are going to get all

1386
00:53:05,579 --> 00:53:09,240
these strains that yield that much and

1387
00:53:07,619 --> 00:53:12,599
we're pumped that much and we're grown

1388
00:53:09,239 --> 00:53:14,818
at super high EC and super high CO2 and

1389
00:53:12,599 --> 00:53:17,400
super everything to like make them

1390
00:53:14,818 --> 00:53:20,400
yields like crazy and they're like man

1391
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:23,760
this isn't as nice yeah

1392
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:25,380
but you know the economic model is like

1393
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,819
we want we want to return on our

1394
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:28,559
investment

1395
00:53:26,818 --> 00:53:31,259
and the people that took the investment

1396
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:34,319
money are like I need to get paid

1397
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:36,000
and so what's happened is is you took a

1398
00:53:34,318 --> 00:53:37,739
sort of like I mean what's funny is like

1399
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,900
Dennis perone made the made the first

1400
00:53:37,739 --> 00:53:43,318
you know medical law in the country with

1401
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:46,019
215 in California and it was very loose

1402
00:53:43,318 --> 00:53:48,119
and it was very gray area and you know

1403
00:53:46,019 --> 00:53:52,199
what can we can we just say thank you

1404
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:56,039
Dennis Barone like oh 100 dude what an

1405
00:53:52,199 --> 00:53:57,719
awesome dude he made it for those great

1406
00:53:56,039 --> 00:54:00,838
well a great representative of the gay

1407
00:53:57,719 --> 00:54:03,000
community for cannabis too he made it

1408
00:54:00,838 --> 00:54:05,639
for the consumers he made it for the

1409
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,318
sick patients he made it for people that

1410
00:54:05,639 --> 00:54:09,239
need you know especially people you know

1411
00:54:07,318 --> 00:54:11,460
in his community that were you know HIV

1412
00:54:09,239 --> 00:54:13,979
positive and struggling with all of the

1413
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:16,318
various uh ailments that come along with

1414
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:18,358
that especially in an era and you know

1415
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:21,058
when he was pushing for it before they

1416
00:54:18,358 --> 00:54:23,219
really even had effective medicines uh

1417
00:54:21,059 --> 00:54:24,839
to treat it like they do today and he

1418
00:54:23,219 --> 00:54:26,818
made it very loose and sort of Gray

1419
00:54:24,838 --> 00:54:31,858
area-ish

1420
00:54:26,818 --> 00:54:35,239
and out of that came a 20-year boom yeah

1421
00:54:31,858 --> 00:54:39,539
of economic activity that revolutionized

1422
00:54:35,239 --> 00:54:41,879
the state and in a large way and spread

1423
00:54:39,539 --> 00:54:43,920
all across the country I wish I had the

1424
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:46,318
picture ready right now maybe I can find

1425
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:50,338
it but I have a picture of Dennis farone

1426
00:54:46,318 --> 00:54:52,380
in the late 70s and just for the strain

1427
00:54:50,338 --> 00:54:54,960
nerds that watch this like that really

1428
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:57,900
really didn't know this he's sitting

1429
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:59,699
there with bowls of like every exotic

1430
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:02,639
cannabis string you could imagine from

1431
00:54:59,699 --> 00:55:06,000
around the world in 1978 like the

1432
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:08,759
biggest G on Earth had somehow like he

1433
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:11,039
had access to what we have today like

1434
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:12,960
somehow back then in 1978 sitting there

1435
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:14,818
in his little San Francisco shop you

1436
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:18,059
know all the different Thai sticks and

1437
00:55:14,818 --> 00:55:19,619
Afghans it was wild so yeah the man

1438
00:55:18,059 --> 00:55:22,200
amazes me and I'd like to do an episode

1439
00:55:19,619 --> 00:55:25,079
I mean he's definitely um

1440
00:55:22,199 --> 00:55:26,578
and so you take him who basically did

1441
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:27,780
this thing that not only helped a bunch

1442
00:55:26,579 --> 00:55:30,900
of sick people

1443
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:32,400
but also began to change America's

1444
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:35,099
viewpoint

1445
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:37,260
on what they thought was both harmful

1446
00:55:35,099 --> 00:55:39,300
and dangerous

1447
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:42,240
you know into something that people now

1448
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:45,539
mostly think is fairly benign and

1449
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:48,779
actually positive and kind yeah and then

1450
00:55:45,539 --> 00:55:51,058
you know we make proposition 64 and five

1451
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:52,019
years into it uh the whole thing is in

1452
00:55:51,059 --> 00:55:54,660
crisis

1453
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:56,460
my arm yeah it's just the weirdest in

1454
00:55:54,659 --> 00:55:59,279
total crisis there's nobody in any

1455
00:55:56,460 --> 00:56:01,500
aspect of the of the weed game

1456
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:03,359
that's particularly happy

1457
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:04,619
yeah

1458
00:56:03,358 --> 00:56:06,420
you know

1459
00:56:04,619 --> 00:56:09,660
um where I mean yeah we even we even

1460
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:12,900
have D'Angelo upset about 64 now which

1461
00:56:09,659 --> 00:56:15,239
is uh really ironic well I don't think

1462
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:17,280
he was like he was one of the to me

1463
00:56:15,239 --> 00:56:19,318
again I keep going back to this and I

1464
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:21,300
know I'm gonna sound like I'm ranting a

1465
00:56:19,318 --> 00:56:22,858
little bit but I go back to the he was

1466
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:24,539
one of the people that thought hey I'm

1467
00:56:22,858 --> 00:56:26,578
freaking wealthy I'm richer than all

1468
00:56:24,539 --> 00:56:28,079
these dope heads I'll come here and take

1469
00:56:26,579 --> 00:56:30,660
this I you know a little bit of a

1470
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:33,059
culture vulture in my opinion just my

1471
00:56:30,659 --> 00:56:34,199
opinion allegedly a culture vulture you

1472
00:56:33,059 --> 00:56:36,359
know he thought he was rich enough and

1473
00:56:34,199 --> 00:56:39,659
then he found ah [ __ ] I'm not rich

1474
00:56:36,358 --> 00:56:41,639
enough everybody I mean I I have a I

1475
00:56:39,659 --> 00:56:43,818
have you know

1476
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:47,400
I don't usually talk poorly about people

1477
00:56:43,818 --> 00:56:50,519
Matt always tries me to get me to do so

1478
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:53,160
um but even even back in the day in the

1479
00:56:50,519 --> 00:56:56,400
height of the 215 era

1480
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:59,879
um he wanted the most important part of

1481
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:02,579
the Cannabis chain to be the stores yeah

1482
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:05,160
he wanted the most profitable place to

1483
00:57:02,579 --> 00:57:07,559
be the stores he was always trying to

1484
00:57:05,159 --> 00:57:10,739
cut off Growers and producers and

1485
00:57:07,559 --> 00:57:13,019
hashmakers at the knees yeah um he

1486
00:57:10,739 --> 00:57:15,659
wanted to buy what he could from them as

1487
00:57:13,019 --> 00:57:18,358
cheap as possible and he wanted to be

1488
00:57:15,659 --> 00:57:21,420
the central player and he is not the

1489
00:57:18,358 --> 00:57:25,460
only person but he is a large reason

1490
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:28,200
um he pushed proposition 64 very hard

1491
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:30,358
and he was very big on being the father

1492
00:57:28,199 --> 00:57:31,919
of legal cannabis and all this that and

1493
00:57:30,358 --> 00:57:34,259
everything else and the reason why he's

1494
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:36,059
changed his tune now is because he

1495
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:38,460
realizes I think that the thing that he

1496
00:57:36,059 --> 00:57:40,619
pushed for is a disaster in a large

1497
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:42,420
amount of times and he doesn't want to

1498
00:57:40,619 --> 00:57:44,460
get blamed for it

1499
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:46,380
and he didn't and he even I think he

1500
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:50,699
even got pushed out from his own company

1501
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:52,559
eventually he did uh over time and that

1502
00:57:50,699 --> 00:57:53,939
wasn't what he was intending on either I

1503
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:56,640
think he was intending on ending up

1504
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:59,280
being very rich and also getting to do

1505
00:57:56,639 --> 00:58:02,578
nice Time Magazine pieces on being the

1506
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:03,960
father of modern cannabis he thought he

1507
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:07,079
was going to be some combination of

1508
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:09,659
Dennis perone Bob Marley Willie Nelson

1509
00:58:07,079 --> 00:58:11,818
he was going to be a dog yeah he was

1510
00:58:09,659 --> 00:58:13,980
going to be an old well-regarded Legend

1511
00:58:11,818 --> 00:58:15,900
people were gonna stand up and clap when

1512
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:18,659
he went into the room he was going to

1513
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:20,099
weed for warriors he was gonna you know

1514
00:58:18,659 --> 00:58:21,420
do that same thing when you're a

1515
00:58:20,099 --> 00:58:23,400
corporate Raider where you do a little

1516
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:24,720
bit of Charity so people can pay to talk

1517
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:27,720
good about you

1518
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:30,299
and you know he ended up just killing

1519
00:58:27,719 --> 00:58:32,219
the goose with the golden egg you know

1520
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:33,660
um this is one thing I've noticed in the

1521
00:58:32,219 --> 00:58:35,578
Discord with a lot of the people because

1522
00:58:33,659 --> 00:58:37,618
we're starting to get like a big

1523
00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:40,140
community in our in our patreon Discord

1524
00:58:37,619 --> 00:58:41,818
right like it started very small and

1525
00:58:40,139 --> 00:58:43,318
kind of cozy and there are a lot of

1526
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:45,000
people really tight it started getting

1527
00:58:43,318 --> 00:58:46,679
you know a little bit bigger and bigger

1528
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:48,780
and as more people come in we start

1529
00:58:46,679 --> 00:58:50,460
getting a newer crowd people knew we

1530
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:52,619
were growing a little bit on the outside

1531
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:54,539
reach just getting into growing and

1532
00:58:52,619 --> 00:58:57,000
somehow they're finding out about us

1533
00:58:54,539 --> 00:58:58,440
and they get really really shocked when

1534
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,579
they hear that you know like certain

1535
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:03,298
people like

1536
00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:07,740
Steve D'Angelo may not grow in his

1537
00:59:03,298 --> 00:59:11,579
basement or Snoop Dogg doesn't have all

1538
00:59:07,739 --> 00:59:14,279
these grows and tables in his rooms

1539
00:59:11,579 --> 00:59:16,318
pumping bubble gum cookies right like

1540
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:18,780
this isn't happening and it really this

1541
00:59:16,318 --> 00:59:21,239
but it's not common sense to everyone

1542
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:22,500
it's it's common sense to us as Growers

1543
00:59:21,239 --> 00:59:24,239
that of course of course these people

1544
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:25,920
that travel around to do all this [ __ ]

1545
00:59:24,239 --> 00:59:27,719
aren't growing and don't have mobs why

1546
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:29,460
would they they can't I mean people

1547
00:59:27,719 --> 00:59:32,399
might think this is funny but Matt and I

1548
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:33,900
talk all the time about like what to

1549
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:36,059
talk about

1550
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:37,980
because some stuff might be like in our

1551
00:59:36,059 --> 00:59:42,720
in our mind might be beaten to death by

1552
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:45,838
us oh yeah but might not be well known

1553
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:48,298
or understood by the larger populace yet

1554
00:59:45,838 --> 00:59:50,880
or might just be important enough like

1555
00:59:48,298 --> 00:59:52,880
the state of the Cannabis spot that you

1556
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:55,559
kind of periodically just talk about it

1557
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:58,858
because you've got to keep battering it

1558
00:59:55,559 --> 01:00:02,760
in and you know eventually what happens

1559
00:59:58,858 --> 01:00:05,400
is is that you know consumers

1560
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:07,680
need to force choice

1561
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:09,240
and what large companies want to do is

1562
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:11,159
they want to give you the illusion of

1563
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:12,779
choice while making a ton of money off

1564
01:00:11,159 --> 01:00:16,798
you yeah

1565
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:19,019
right and cannabis is very unique in

1566
01:00:16,798 --> 01:00:20,880
that like if we were going to I use this

1567
01:00:19,019 --> 01:00:24,179
analogy a lot but if we were going to go

1568
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:26,880
into say like the supermarket almost

1569
01:00:24,179 --> 01:00:28,858
everything you buy in the supermarket

1570
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,838
um

1571
01:00:28,858 --> 01:00:33,239
if the vegetable or the fruit doesn't

1572
01:00:30,838 --> 01:00:37,558
meet the production model

1573
01:00:33,239 --> 01:00:40,078
it doesn't get grown yeah right like you

1574
01:00:37,559 --> 01:00:42,599
know Tomatoes aren't rated based on

1575
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:45,359
their flavor and their texture

1576
01:00:42,599 --> 01:00:47,760
they're rated based on weight and color

1577
01:00:45,358 --> 01:00:50,880
and does their skin split and do they

1578
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:53,339
rot and can I pick it green weeks early

1579
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:55,920
and ship it across the country and then

1580
01:00:53,338 --> 01:00:58,619
ripen it and then sell it yeah so like

1581
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:02,159
the consumer is way far down the list

1582
01:00:58,619 --> 01:01:04,798
and cannabis is unique in that no one

1583
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:07,618
ever would choose to grow OG Kush in a

1584
01:01:04,798 --> 01:01:09,719
production model yeah no they just

1585
01:01:07,619 --> 01:01:12,358
wouldn't no one would choose to grow OG

1586
01:01:09,719 --> 01:01:14,519
KB or cookies in a production model

1587
01:01:12,358 --> 01:01:16,858
you know there's lots of strains that

1588
01:01:14,519 --> 01:01:18,780
have gotten famous that from a

1589
01:01:16,858 --> 01:01:21,358
production standpoint and from an ease

1590
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:23,460
of growth standpoint aren't very

1591
01:01:21,358 --> 01:01:26,279
desirable but maybe their flavor their

1592
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:29,940
effect or just the customers like them

1593
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:31,440
yeah right and so as a result of that

1594
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:33,480
you know

1595
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:35,639
um you know people are getting into this

1596
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:38,639
business and they're like well

1597
01:01:35,639 --> 01:01:40,440
I want to grow you know we think you

1598
01:01:38,639 --> 01:01:42,058
know like they want to grow something

1599
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:43,380
that just knocks it out of the park they

1600
01:01:42,059 --> 01:01:46,079
want it to be the biggest they want it

1601
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:49,140
to be fastest they want more more crops

1602
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:52,440
a year they want more yield and if they

1603
01:01:49,139 --> 01:01:54,420
can just force consumers to take

1604
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:56,220
the things that fit within their

1605
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:59,338
production model they will

1606
01:01:56,219 --> 01:02:00,659
yeah and so consumers have to fight for

1607
01:01:59,338 --> 01:02:04,739
choices

1608
01:02:00,659 --> 01:02:06,298
right and right now consumers aren't

1609
01:02:04,739 --> 01:02:08,519
educated about their choices in the

1610
01:02:06,298 --> 01:02:10,980
first place like what's out there

1611
01:02:08,519 --> 01:02:14,880
then that's how stuff gets lost in my

1612
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:18,179
opinion sure and it's super hard to edgy

1613
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:21,240
to educate people just coming in how do

1614
01:02:18,179 --> 01:02:22,739
you ever get past the initial a lot of

1615
01:02:21,239 --> 01:02:25,558
those people's initial Point are the

1616
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:27,838
Snoop Dogg are the Steve D'Angelo the

1617
01:02:25,559 --> 01:02:30,480
Jim Belushi show or any of those things

1618
01:02:27,838 --> 01:02:32,639
that's it well these things what's

1619
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:34,260
happened is with you know Mike Tyson I'm

1620
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:35,460
not even dissing the only person I'm

1621
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:38,160
dissing that you just mentioned is

1622
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:39,179
probably is uh Steve D'Angelo but uh the

1623
01:02:38,159 --> 01:02:41,338
rest of them it's like they're just

1624
01:02:39,179 --> 01:02:43,558
famous in other aspects of their life

1625
01:02:41,338 --> 01:02:46,679
maybe if you're an actor maybe you're a

1626
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:48,240
musician maybe you're a a famous boxer

1627
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:50,578
maybe you're whatever and you already

1628
01:02:48,239 --> 01:02:52,500
have people that think well of you

1629
01:02:50,579 --> 01:02:54,960
and so often what they do is they

1630
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:56,338
license their name and their image and

1631
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:58,139
they kick them some money and some

1632
01:02:56,338 --> 01:03:00,058
whatever for doing it

1633
01:02:58,139 --> 01:03:02,279
and then they're trying to make a brand

1634
01:03:00,059 --> 01:03:04,440
they're trying to make familiarity with

1635
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:06,420
people out there yeah but what most

1636
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:09,240
people are realizing is that most of

1637
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:11,039
these brands are really just buying from

1638
01:03:09,239 --> 01:03:13,979
third parties

1639
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:15,960
yeah it's a it might they might be all

1640
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:17,818
the same thing I mean I don't know I

1641
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:20,579
don't most people probably don't know

1642
01:03:17,818 --> 01:03:24,440
that for all the cookie stores cookies

1643
01:03:20,579 --> 01:03:24,440
barely doesn't touch weed

1644
01:03:25,699 --> 01:03:30,598
and they make clothing and they and

1645
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:32,579
almost all of their growing is third

1646
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:33,900
party grows that they make contracts

1647
01:03:32,579 --> 01:03:35,039
with and they get a right of first

1648
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:38,039
refusal

1649
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:39,900
yeah right they can choose whether or

1650
01:03:38,039 --> 01:03:42,298
not they want to buy it or you know or

1651
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:44,099
not based on whatever contract they

1652
01:03:42,298 --> 01:03:46,380
arrange with that person

1653
01:03:44,099 --> 01:03:47,818
but people think that like burner is out

1654
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:49,858
there and like they've got a team of

1655
01:03:47,818 --> 01:03:52,079
like excellent Growers that have been

1656
01:03:49,858 --> 01:03:54,900
knocking this stuff out and refining

1657
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:56,880
their craft for the last 15 years they

1658
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:59,160
really do but they don't that's what

1659
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:01,380
they do they do not have that that's not

1660
01:03:59,159 --> 01:04:03,899
what they do that's not their model at

1661
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:06,059
all you know their model is to get third

1662
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:07,619
parties to I mean even when it comes to

1663
01:04:06,059 --> 01:04:10,260
breeding and stuff like that you know

1664
01:04:07,619 --> 01:04:12,000
they worked with jbz for a while they

1665
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:15,480
worked with Chris compound they were

1666
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:18,059
they they hire out they Farm out almost

1667
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:20,639
all of their work let's let's but let's

1668
01:04:18,059 --> 01:04:23,640
not confuse people because realistically

1669
01:04:20,639 --> 01:04:26,759
like that farming out doesn't just stop

1670
01:04:23,639 --> 01:04:28,980
at the person you know in many cases

1671
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:30,299
like cookies will form out to someone

1672
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:31,980
else to make the seeds and that person

1673
01:04:30,298 --> 01:04:34,619
might Farm out to someone else to make

1674
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:36,119
the seeds very much middlemen in the

1675
01:04:34,619 --> 01:04:38,160
middle of this without naming anyone

1676
01:04:36,119 --> 01:04:40,079
there's so many middle man in the middle

1677
01:04:38,159 --> 01:04:41,578
of this it's not even right it's like

1678
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:43,798
they get a contract and they're like hey

1679
01:04:41,579 --> 01:04:46,200
I'm gonna make this amount I'm willing

1680
01:04:43,798 --> 01:04:48,838
to give you this percentage of my amount

1681
01:04:46,199 --> 01:04:50,818
for you to do all the work yes I've got

1682
01:04:48,838 --> 01:04:52,558
the contract I've got the outlet I've

1683
01:04:50,818 --> 01:04:54,779
got the sale

1684
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:57,000
right I don't really want to do the work

1685
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:59,040
so how about you do all the work and

1686
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,719
I'll give you a piece of it but you

1687
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:02,639
can't do you can't get this deal without

1688
01:05:00,719 --> 01:05:05,459
me because I have the deal

1689
01:05:02,639 --> 01:05:07,920
yes right and so he's right there's

1690
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:10,798
usually multiple layers at times of

1691
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:13,440
farming it out hypothetically like if

1692
01:05:10,798 --> 01:05:14,579
there was a company named schmookies and

1693
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:17,338
one name

1694
01:05:14,579 --> 01:05:19,619
um impound or out house and they're like

1695
01:05:17,338 --> 01:05:21,539
hey will you make my seeds are like yeah

1696
01:05:19,619 --> 01:05:23,099
but yeah I'll make those seeds and then

1697
01:05:21,539 --> 01:05:26,039
like they don't even let them know and

1698
01:05:23,099 --> 01:05:27,420
they're like hey Ma I'm down here hey uh

1699
01:05:26,039 --> 01:05:29,639
little guy hey can you make the seeds

1700
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:32,159
yeah I'll give you x amount Kick It Up

1701
01:05:29,639 --> 01:05:34,019
bang I'm a breeder

1702
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:36,779
I mean that's been going on in the seed

1703
01:05:34,019 --> 01:05:38,460
game for a long time yeah you know and

1704
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:40,380
you know I mean that's not even for me

1705
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:43,260
to like cookies is like a clothing brand

1706
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:45,660
and it's stores sure yeah yeah you know

1707
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:47,880
and they but they want most they don't

1708
01:05:45,659 --> 01:05:49,379
really have like QC in the way you would

1709
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:51,900
think where it's like they don't do all

1710
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:53,519
that stuff in-house because that affects

1711
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:55,200
their ability to become multi-state

1712
01:05:53,519 --> 01:05:56,759
operators in some way

1713
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:59,058
technically they are a seed company

1714
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:02,160
though

1715
01:05:59,059 --> 01:06:04,559
didn't they they did kind of release

1716
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:07,259
Candy Rain I suppose but as we know and

1717
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:09,599
we don't have to name names they farmed

1718
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:12,780
out the making of Candy Rain to a third

1719
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:15,240
party yes yes and that third party made

1720
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:17,460
them and then they put them in they put

1721
01:06:15,239 --> 01:06:19,019
it in their packaging just like they

1722
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:20,940
might whatever you know whatever it

1723
01:06:19,019 --> 01:06:22,559
might be biscotti or cheetah piss or

1724
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:25,139
this or that or whatever they're gonna

1725
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:28,200
put it in their branded mylar

1726
01:06:25,139 --> 01:06:30,659
yeah but like the people growing it

1727
01:06:28,199 --> 01:06:33,179
aren't on their payroll

1728
01:06:30,659 --> 01:06:35,578
yeah you know

1729
01:06:33,179 --> 01:06:38,279
they contracted it out so a lot of these

1730
01:06:35,579 --> 01:06:40,019
big Brands don't actually they're not

1731
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:41,940
actually vertical in the sense that they

1732
01:06:40,019 --> 01:06:43,199
control their own quality

1733
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:45,539
yeah

1734
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:47,699
it'd be like if you know I don't know if

1735
01:06:45,539 --> 01:06:49,559
like Gucci was actually like getting all

1736
01:06:47,699 --> 01:06:50,939
of their stuff from like you know

1737
01:06:49,559 --> 01:06:53,460
there's like you know seven different

1738
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:55,139
Chinese sweatshops and they didn't

1739
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:56,940
actually have any like quality control

1740
01:06:55,139 --> 01:06:59,578
or anything like that yeah

1741
01:06:56,940 --> 01:07:01,380
you know and and and I'll you know I

1742
01:06:59,579 --> 01:07:04,559
mean it but it that's that's that's the

1743
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:07,500
state of it and so they don't want me

1744
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:10,380
they don't want people to know that

1745
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:12,059
because it it it it you know I mean I

1746
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:14,099
think we used the joke that 10 years ago

1747
01:07:12,059 --> 01:07:16,079
or whatever you know people thought that

1748
01:07:14,099 --> 01:07:17,960
like their cookies was like hand watered

1749
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:20,280
by burner

1750
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:22,260
you know in the bay when it was really

1751
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:24,180
first coming out that like all the

1752
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:25,680
cookies that was there was like from

1753
01:07:24,179 --> 01:07:27,598
four or five different dudes all

1754
01:07:25,679 --> 01:07:29,578
carefully curating it and making it

1755
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:32,039
happen yeah

1756
01:07:29,579 --> 01:07:34,798
and they were early on to realize that

1757
01:07:32,039 --> 01:07:36,720
like the brand was the thing

1758
01:07:34,798 --> 01:07:38,460
and they could Farm out the work and

1759
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:40,019
still make a big percentage for being

1760
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:42,298
the guy

1761
01:07:40,019 --> 01:07:44,038
yeah I think they were very early on at

1762
01:07:42,298 --> 01:07:45,900
figuring out that everything was a brand

1763
01:07:44,039 --> 01:07:48,299
branding was everything everything was a

1764
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:50,579
bunch of weed yeah and weed wasn't ready

1765
01:07:48,298 --> 01:07:52,920
for that huh so yeah that have you ever

1766
01:07:50,579 --> 01:07:55,798
seen one of these things in action have

1767
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:59,460
you ever seen this real quick no this is

1768
01:07:55,798 --> 01:08:04,079
what they call an ashit ashtray

1769
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:06,480
and uh yeah before we started sucked the

1770
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:09,119
bowl clean so I'm gonna try it we'll see

1771
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:12,420
I don't know let's see this is uh one of

1772
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:14,760
the C2 glass ones but it I can't always

1773
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:17,460
get it to work oh okay I guess it hadn't

1774
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:19,500
take a second hold on

1775
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:22,140
so loud isn't it

1776
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:24,238
it's very non-relaxing

1777
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:26,579
um yeah I don't

1778
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:29,039
maybe maybe I need to to love it to get

1779
01:08:26,579 --> 01:08:30,298
a better suck I'm not sure

1780
01:08:29,039 --> 01:08:32,399
um I don't know if you can see what the

1781
01:08:30,298 --> 01:08:34,979
it like sucked around but the center's

1782
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:37,858
still there oh well okay that was worth

1783
01:08:34,979 --> 01:08:40,439
a try I tried it

1784
01:08:37,859 --> 01:08:42,120
yeah uh that's a terrible sound it's not

1785
01:08:40,439 --> 01:08:44,219
how I that's not the sound I want to

1786
01:08:42,119 --> 01:08:46,979
hear when I'm trying to relax and

1787
01:08:44,219 --> 01:08:48,600
smoke some cannabis that's for sure no I

1788
01:08:46,979 --> 01:08:52,459
wouldn't mind if it did a good job but

1789
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:52,460
that did not work very well okay

1790
01:08:53,039 --> 01:08:59,238
I had to try it I don't know you had to

1791
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:59,239
try it and you try it

1792
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:04,798
okay

1793
01:09:02,759 --> 01:09:07,259
now let's get back to where we were

1794
01:09:04,798 --> 01:09:09,420
because that wasn't obnoxious as uh as

1795
01:09:07,259 --> 01:09:11,460
all hell that was a little obnoxious

1796
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:12,619
yeah I don't yeah I didn't know it was

1797
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:15,899
gonna be that loud loud

1798
01:09:12,619 --> 01:09:19,079
yeah it's like very high RPM

1799
01:09:15,899 --> 01:09:21,358
yeah and uh yeah right next to the

1800
01:09:19,079 --> 01:09:25,318
microphone too indeed

1801
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:27,000
indeed so I don't know I mean I like the

1802
01:09:25,319 --> 01:09:30,179
to the state of the Affairs it's kind of

1803
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:32,579
like what's happened in a nutshell is

1804
01:09:30,179 --> 01:09:34,560
there's vast over production in almost

1805
01:09:32,579 --> 01:09:39,179
every state

1806
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:42,000
that gets recreational right it happens

1807
01:09:39,179 --> 01:09:47,699
fairly quickly yeah

1808
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:50,399
um and then the glut leads to price Wars

1809
01:09:47,698 --> 01:09:53,399
where stores and Distributors start

1810
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:55,738
purchasing Things based on pricing and

1811
01:09:53,399 --> 01:09:58,619
margins for themselves

1812
01:09:55,738 --> 01:10:00,359
which leads to a lack of choice for

1813
01:09:58,619 --> 01:10:03,179
consumers because they don't get to pick

1814
01:10:00,359 --> 01:10:05,880
amongst the quality because the distros

1815
01:10:03,179 --> 01:10:08,699
and these stores are buying things that

1816
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:12,420
are most advantageous for them

1817
01:10:08,698 --> 01:10:15,599
than being like you know here's 28 kinds

1818
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:18,300
of you know these boofy to decent and a

1819
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:20,280
couple things that randomly are nice but

1820
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:23,699
they're all in mylar so you can't see it

1821
01:10:20,279 --> 01:10:26,759
so hopefully you guess which one's good

1822
01:10:23,698 --> 01:10:28,439
and I'll take your money right and then

1823
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:30,300
what happens is is that you hear all

1824
01:10:28,439 --> 01:10:31,738
this talk this might be pretty political

1825
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:34,320
or whatever but you hear all this talk

1826
01:10:31,738 --> 01:10:37,198
about how the black market or the

1827
01:10:34,319 --> 01:10:39,238
traditional Market is affecting

1828
01:10:37,198 --> 01:10:41,158
the legal market and the legal Market

1829
01:10:39,238 --> 01:10:44,419
would have a lot better sales and be a

1830
01:10:41,158 --> 01:10:47,698
lot more robust if we just didn't have

1831
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:49,440
all of this black market or all of this

1832
01:10:47,698 --> 01:10:52,738
traditional Market or medical market

1833
01:10:49,439 --> 01:10:55,500
demand going on which is hamstringing

1834
01:10:52,738 --> 01:10:57,779
our new legal industry

1835
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:59,760
yeah and they mostly blame it on cartel

1836
01:10:57,779 --> 01:11:01,679
Black Market specifically and I mean

1837
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:03,900
whatever you want well they just try to

1838
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:05,399
intertwine that propaganda is the same

1839
01:11:03,899 --> 01:11:08,339
thing and it just yeah

1840
01:11:05,399 --> 01:11:09,899
so this might get me in trouble but

1841
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:11,940
um I think I think it's actually

1842
01:11:09,899 --> 01:11:15,839
reversed

1843
01:11:11,939 --> 01:11:18,599
yes I do so and what I mean by that is

1844
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:20,520
that I think that it's very true that

1845
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:22,800
the White Market people

1846
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:24,780
um would all like all of the black

1847
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:26,760
market producers

1848
01:11:24,779 --> 01:11:30,359
to stop

1849
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:32,520
yep and they they want the supply of the

1850
01:11:30,359 --> 01:11:34,019
black market to stop but that's not

1851
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:36,900
because they think that there would be

1852
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:38,940
hordes of new people pouring into the

1853
01:11:36,899 --> 01:11:40,879
stores that would robustly boost up

1854
01:11:38,939 --> 01:11:44,639
their white market sales

1855
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:48,000
it's so that they can take their excess

1856
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:50,159
and dump it into the market share that

1857
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,260
was formally being supplied by the

1858
01:11:50,158 --> 01:11:54,059
traditional yeah

1859
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:56,119
and I think what happened in California

1860
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:59,659
is the first couple years

1861
01:11:56,119 --> 01:12:02,158
is this overproduction problem happened

1862
01:11:59,658 --> 01:12:03,839
there was a lot of diversion that people

1863
01:12:02,158 --> 01:12:07,500
didn't people don't want to admit that

1864
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:09,360
metric is both cumbersome expensive and

1865
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:10,679
super ineffective

1866
01:12:09,359 --> 01:12:12,960
yeah

1867
01:12:10,679 --> 01:12:17,158
like it's an Open Secret in the industry

1868
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:20,960
how poorly metric works at keeping

1869
01:12:17,158 --> 01:12:20,960
things where it's supposed to be kept

1870
01:12:22,698 --> 01:12:29,339
and it's not and and anyone that wants

1871
01:12:26,399 --> 01:12:32,460
to can get around it sure and so most

1872
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:34,199
large and medium-sized companies

1873
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:37,619
um that aren't Legacy and aren't fairly

1874
01:12:34,198 --> 01:12:39,419
small end up having to divert a decent

1875
01:12:37,619 --> 01:12:42,619
portion of what they make into the black

1876
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:45,480
yeah and that worked for a few years

1877
01:12:42,619 --> 01:12:46,859
until production and over production got

1878
01:12:45,479 --> 01:12:49,319
to a point where they started having

1879
01:12:46,859 --> 01:12:50,759
difficulty doing that and so there are

1880
01:12:49,319 --> 01:12:53,399
complaints that the black market is

1881
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:54,780
messing them up isn't about their white

1882
01:12:53,399 --> 01:12:57,000
market sales

1883
01:12:54,779 --> 01:12:59,698
yeah it's about their traditional

1884
01:12:57,000 --> 01:13:02,819
diversionary sales yeah

1885
01:12:59,698 --> 01:13:04,859
in my opinion no no it makes sense yeah

1886
01:13:02,819 --> 01:13:07,799
because what they want is they want the

1887
01:13:04,859 --> 01:13:10,319
traditional Supply to go away

1888
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:13,320
so that the traditional demand is more

1889
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:14,759
robust for them to supply yeah because

1890
01:13:13,319 --> 01:13:16,559
obviously because otherwise smokers will

1891
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:19,500
keep being smokers I mean there's this

1892
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:21,179
thing that like you know Matt and I were

1893
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:23,158
looking at not long ago where like this

1894
01:13:21,179 --> 01:13:27,539
past year Canada which has gone totally

1895
01:13:23,158 --> 01:13:29,759
legal they destroyed like 425 million

1896
01:13:27,539 --> 01:13:34,319
grams of unsold cannabis that had

1897
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:36,719
expired which was 28 of the yearly crop

1898
01:13:34,319 --> 01:13:37,738
that had been produced in the past 12

1899
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:39,840
months

1900
01:13:37,738 --> 01:13:41,759
and I think that worked out to like what

1901
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:44,420
was it like night I don't even it was

1902
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:46,560
like 916 tons or something it was like

1903
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:48,179
it was an enormous amount whatever

1904
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:49,440
anyone who wants to do the math I'm like

1905
01:13:48,179 --> 01:13:52,760
you can look it up you know Canada

1906
01:13:49,439 --> 01:13:55,919
destroys 425 million grams or something

1907
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:57,780
and so they actually what that means for

1908
01:13:55,920 --> 01:14:00,060
Canada though is that means whatever

1909
01:13:57,779 --> 01:14:03,000
system Canada has they're actually

1910
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:05,100
preventing a large at least that amount

1911
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,899
of it from being diverted

1912
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:08,820
and then it's sitting there

1913
01:14:06,899 --> 01:14:10,679
and then it eventually it gets old and

1914
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:13,019
expires and then they light it on fire

1915
01:14:10,679 --> 01:14:15,719
and get rid of it yeah

1916
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:17,340
I haven't heard maybe I'm wrong but I

1917
01:14:15,719 --> 01:14:18,779
haven't heard of a single recreational

1918
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:20,819
state

1919
01:14:18,779 --> 01:14:22,859
that has had to step in and destroy a

1920
01:14:20,819 --> 01:14:24,299
bunch of expired cannabis products of

1921
01:14:22,859 --> 01:14:26,579
any kind

1922
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:28,320
I don't know of any I hear of a lot of

1923
01:14:26,579 --> 01:14:30,000
people sitting on a lot of stuff but I

1924
01:14:28,319 --> 01:14:32,099
don't know if that's even I don't know

1925
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,658
what Market that is when I hear that

1926
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:35,340
you know but there should be maybe maybe

1927
01:14:33,658 --> 01:14:36,839
there's not I mean there's eventually

1928
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:37,679
there's rules where it's probably too

1929
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:38,880
old

1930
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:40,859
yeah

1931
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:42,359
you know and so I'm not even trying to

1932
01:14:40,859 --> 01:14:43,979
call people out or anything like that

1933
01:14:42,359 --> 01:14:46,799
they're just trying to like they get

1934
01:14:43,979 --> 01:14:49,139
into business they set up a 500 lighter

1935
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:50,640
you know and all of a sudden they

1936
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:52,560
realize that you know they're growing

1937
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:54,119
seven eight hundred pounds a rip five

1938
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:57,600
times a year

1939
01:14:54,119 --> 01:15:00,179
and there's not enough Demand with all

1940
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:02,280
the other indoors going around for them

1941
01:15:00,179 --> 01:15:03,779
to off all of their product into the

1942
01:15:02,279 --> 01:15:07,019
White

1943
01:15:03,779 --> 01:15:09,539
there's just not and you know I mean I

1944
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:12,360
think a lot of it too like I mean a big

1945
01:15:09,539 --> 01:15:15,300
portion of it started because it was it

1946
01:15:12,359 --> 01:15:17,399
was people in the the white

1947
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:20,640
like the the people with the financing

1948
01:15:17,399 --> 01:15:23,399
talking to the very first people in

1949
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:25,739
cannabis that they meet who could be any

1950
01:15:23,399 --> 01:15:28,198
Tom Dick or Harry there that has the

1951
01:15:25,738 --> 01:15:30,658
balls to say that they have run x amount

1952
01:15:28,198 --> 01:15:32,639
of lights that hasn't run any light

1953
01:15:30,658 --> 01:15:35,599
because I mean realistically how many

1954
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:38,940
guys uh free

1955
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:41,039
215 were running you know 100 lighters

1956
01:15:38,939 --> 01:15:43,019
but how many people stuck up their hands

1957
01:15:41,039 --> 01:15:44,760
and said I can run that

1958
01:15:43,020 --> 01:15:46,920
I mean there's a bunch of people that

1959
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:48,480
stuck up their hand and said I can run

1960
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:51,420
five acres

1961
01:15:48,479 --> 01:15:53,279
yeah that's a major [ __ ] problem I

1962
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:54,420
know how to run I know how to run a crew

1963
01:15:53,279 --> 01:15:56,219
of 70.

1964
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:57,960
and and like I said that's a major

1965
01:15:56,219 --> 01:15:59,760
problem and and that's that almost

1966
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:02,219
reaches to the disconnect that I've been

1967
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:04,860
speaking about with the the Legacy

1968
01:16:02,219 --> 01:16:06,539
strains and and the universities is that

1969
01:16:04,859 --> 01:16:08,158
there's still that disconnect there's

1970
01:16:06,539 --> 01:16:10,500
that disconnect between the people with

1971
01:16:08,158 --> 01:16:12,059
the money or financing or the people

1972
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:14,399
with the science that are writing the

1973
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:16,739
history books and the traditional Market

1974
01:16:14,399 --> 01:16:19,079
that's done this all along because

1975
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:20,579
everybody's trying to work everybody you

1976
01:16:19,079 --> 01:16:22,198
know in between the middlemen are all

1977
01:16:20,579 --> 01:16:24,899
trying to get between and work between

1978
01:16:22,198 --> 01:16:26,759
the two and these two have never spoken

1979
01:16:24,899 --> 01:16:28,319
I really feel like there's very little

1980
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:31,020
communication that's ever gone on

1981
01:16:28,319 --> 01:16:33,420
without these these Shifty ass middlemen

1982
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:36,600
well if you wanna if you want yeah if

1983
01:16:33,420 --> 01:16:39,440
you want to take a a like a a free

1984
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:44,039
market approach you know to it yeah

1985
01:16:39,439 --> 01:16:46,799
Dennis perrone's version was very

1986
01:16:44,039 --> 01:16:49,560
lightly regulated the light touch of

1987
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:53,880
government and let you know human

1988
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:56,760
Ingenuity and commerce build yeah and

1989
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:59,100
the legal situation has been in my

1990
01:16:56,760 --> 01:17:02,460
opinion legal is actually the wrong word

1991
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:06,000
it's more like highly taxed highly

1992
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:07,920
regulated very controlled and as a

1993
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,658
result of that they've created so many

1994
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:11,940
different barriers and so many different

1995
01:17:09,658 --> 01:17:13,859
inefficiencies

1996
01:17:11,939 --> 01:17:15,059
that you have these people that are

1997
01:17:13,859 --> 01:17:17,759
exploiting all these different

1998
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:20,340
inefficiencies and so you go and you can

1999
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:22,140
go in States from gluts where nobody can

2000
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:24,840
make any money and the price of cannabis

2001
01:17:22,140 --> 01:17:28,020
Falls below the cost of production

2002
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:31,020
to you know droughts

2003
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:32,940
where it spikes briefly you know and

2004
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:34,320
people are getting crazy dollars for

2005
01:17:32,939 --> 01:17:35,759
different things because it's all

2006
01:17:34,319 --> 01:17:38,460
volatile and then

2007
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:41,280
you know it's just not it's not open and

2008
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:42,480
fair and so as a result of that you know

2009
01:17:41,279 --> 01:17:44,819
there's like I think there's like 40

2010
01:17:42,479 --> 01:17:46,379
million people in California I don't is

2011
01:17:44,819 --> 01:17:48,119
there I don't even think there's a

2012
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:50,100
thousand legal stores

2013
01:17:48,119 --> 01:17:51,658
yeah I have no clue and as you know like

2014
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:54,060
you're in a different part of California

2015
01:17:51,658 --> 01:17:55,799
than I am there's all kinds of counties

2016
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:58,260
especially in the eastern part of

2017
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:59,039
California that have banned dispensaries

2018
01:17:58,260 --> 01:18:00,840
anyway

2019
01:17:59,039 --> 01:18:02,219
yeah like I don't think we have any here

2020
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:04,619
it has to be outside on discounting

2021
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:06,899
dispenser dispensaries are mostly a

2022
01:18:04,619 --> 01:18:09,059
coastal County phenomenon

2023
01:18:06,899 --> 01:18:11,579
all the way from San Diego up to

2024
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:12,420
Humboldt if your county touches the

2025
01:18:11,579 --> 01:18:15,000
ocean

2026
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:17,640
you probably have a dispensary and if

2027
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:20,100
your county is is along or east of the

2028
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:23,719
five you probably don't

2029
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:23,719
yeah that's pretty much it huh

2030
01:18:24,679 --> 01:18:29,399
where it's like so like they allowed

2031
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,619
massive production to take place

2032
01:18:29,399 --> 01:18:33,779
because they collected all this upfront

2033
01:18:31,619 --> 01:18:35,519
money and then they restricted the hell

2034
01:18:33,779 --> 01:18:37,619
out of where it could be sold

2035
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:40,320
so you have a glut and you give a lot of

2036
01:18:37,619 --> 01:18:42,359
power to the dispensaries and a lot of

2037
01:18:40,319 --> 01:18:45,238
power to the distros

2038
01:18:42,359 --> 01:18:47,519
s yeah right where before distros didn't

2039
01:18:45,238 --> 01:18:49,500
even need to exist a farmer could go

2040
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:50,580
directly to a dispensary and they could

2041
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:52,619
make a deal

2042
01:18:50,579 --> 01:18:54,479
yeah you're right now you have to have

2043
01:18:52,619 --> 01:18:56,640
another Middleman

2044
01:18:54,479 --> 01:18:58,738
now you have to have in California you

2045
01:18:56,640 --> 01:19:00,480
have to have a special delivery license

2046
01:18:58,738 --> 01:19:03,059
if I'm a farmer

2047
01:19:00,479 --> 01:19:05,399
and I want to drive my product

2048
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:07,080
to a dispensary I have to have a

2049
01:19:05,399 --> 01:19:10,019
delivery license otherwise it's not

2050
01:19:07,079 --> 01:19:12,600
legal for me to have it on the road yeah

2051
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:15,900
it's a throne on my own Farm it's only

2052
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:18,600
it's only legal on my property

2053
01:19:15,899 --> 01:19:20,819
I can't I mean as kids right we watch

2054
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:23,880
the movie Robin Hood Disney movie Robin

2055
01:19:20,819 --> 01:19:26,039
Hood and we also King jaw or you know or

2056
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:26,819
no the sheriff in Nottingham and we all

2057
01:19:26,039 --> 01:19:29,158
knew

2058
01:19:26,819 --> 01:19:31,319
that [ __ ] would come around and

2059
01:19:29,158 --> 01:19:33,899
tax people for their money and even his

2060
01:19:31,319 --> 01:19:35,819
kids we knew that doesn't make any sense

2061
01:19:33,899 --> 01:19:38,460
that's not that man's money give that

2062
01:19:35,819 --> 01:19:41,698
man his money back but as adults we've

2063
01:19:38,460 --> 01:19:43,679
all made this invisible agreement that

2064
01:19:41,698 --> 01:19:46,619
this is okay the Shakedown that's going

2065
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:49,079
on is cool and well maybe it's just my

2066
01:19:46,619 --> 01:19:51,179
punk rock ethos like it's your it's your

2067
01:19:49,079 --> 01:19:53,460
it's that's your pop rock ethos I think

2068
01:19:51,179 --> 01:19:55,679
a lot of people choose what I get shook

2069
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:57,899
down by where that money goes five years

2070
01:19:55,679 --> 01:20:00,719
ago I think there was a lot of people

2071
01:19:57,899 --> 01:20:05,158
that despite their reservations in can

2072
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:08,158
in in 64. we're like you know this could

2073
01:20:05,158 --> 01:20:10,679
suck in a variety of ways but at least

2074
01:20:08,158 --> 01:20:13,439
I'll be able to make a living support my

2075
01:20:10,679 --> 01:20:16,380
family put my money in the bank never

2076
01:20:13,439 --> 01:20:17,879
get raided right my kids won't ever I

2077
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:19,980
will you know nobody will know what a go

2078
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:21,239
bag is yeah

2079
01:20:19,979 --> 01:20:25,319
um you know and for people that don't

2080
01:20:21,238 --> 01:20:26,939
know up here a go bag used to be you

2081
01:20:25,319 --> 01:20:29,698
would have a bag packed with a bunch of

2082
01:20:26,939 --> 01:20:31,799
stuff Essentials for you or maybe your

2083
01:20:29,698 --> 01:20:34,079
family and your family would know that

2084
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:36,619
like if you got rated go run into the

2085
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:36,619
woods and hide

2086
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:41,279
your go bag is going to get you to the

2087
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:42,960
neighbors or it's going to allow you to

2088
01:20:41,279 --> 01:20:45,539
survive for a day or two until they

2089
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:46,859
leave and you can come back safely yeah

2090
01:20:45,539 --> 01:20:48,779
you know and there was a bunch of people

2091
01:20:46,859 --> 01:20:50,460
that didn't want that stress and they

2092
01:20:48,779 --> 01:20:51,779
were like okay well this deal seems kind

2093
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:54,000
of crappy

2094
01:20:51,779 --> 01:20:55,979
but at least I'll be able to legally

2095
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,698
support my family put my money in the

2096
01:20:55,979 --> 01:20:59,218
bank

2097
01:20:56,698 --> 01:21:02,039
and just have a normal business that's

2098
01:20:59,219 --> 01:21:05,579
fair a lot of these people had PTSD like

2099
01:21:02,039 --> 01:21:07,439
real genuine PTSD from being rated and

2100
01:21:05,579 --> 01:21:10,198
having their families lives upturned

2101
01:21:07,439 --> 01:21:12,539
it's not fair yeah I can tell you it

2102
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:14,399
sucks it's an occupational hazard you

2103
01:21:12,539 --> 01:21:16,619
know if you're if you're a minor maybe

2104
01:21:14,399 --> 01:21:19,198
you get black lung if you're an office

2105
01:21:16,619 --> 01:21:21,539
worker maybe you get carpal tunnel you

2106
01:21:19,198 --> 01:21:23,579
know if you're if you're a rug layer or

2107
01:21:21,539 --> 01:21:25,560
a roofer maybe you blow out your back or

2108
01:21:23,579 --> 01:21:27,539
have a herniated disc

2109
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:29,880
you know if if you were a cannabis

2110
01:21:27,539 --> 01:21:31,859
farmer even if you were like fully fully

2111
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:34,440
legal and selling all of your product to

2112
01:21:31,859 --> 01:21:37,139
a dispensary just like 215 intended and

2113
01:21:34,439 --> 01:21:39,178
all that yeah could still hit you and be

2114
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:41,219
like you're going to jail yeah they

2115
01:21:39,179 --> 01:21:43,260
don't care yeah that doesn't mean that

2116
01:21:41,219 --> 01:21:44,819
you might not win in court

2117
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:48,020
but you still got raided and went to

2118
01:21:44,819 --> 01:21:50,279
jail and your plants are all gone

2119
01:21:48,020 --> 01:21:52,500
they took what they wanted and now

2120
01:21:50,279 --> 01:21:54,300
you're fighting it out and so

2121
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:56,880
you know people thought initially but

2122
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:58,440
what's happened now is it's like you

2123
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:00,600
know it's gone on long enough where

2124
01:21:58,439 --> 01:22:01,859
that's the reason why a lot of these a

2125
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:04,620
lot of these

2126
01:22:01,859 --> 01:22:07,259
um you know up here in my area four or

2127
01:22:04,619 --> 01:22:10,260
five years ago people used to sell

2128
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:11,940
cannabis properties at a premium yeah

2129
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:13,920
like oh my God look at this Ranch it's

2130
01:22:11,939 --> 01:22:15,839
fully developed it's TurnKey it's got

2131
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:17,880
all this grow on it you can come in and

2132
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:20,100
you can make you know you have a turnkey

2133
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:21,719
business and now you see a bunch of

2134
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:26,159
these same properties and they're like

2135
01:22:21,719 --> 01:22:27,539
way less oh my God because you know a

2136
01:22:26,158 --> 01:22:28,979
lot of times it's like it's a losing

2137
01:22:27,539 --> 01:22:32,519
money proposition

2138
01:22:28,979 --> 01:22:34,919
yeah they took something that took a ton

2139
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:37,260
of Californians and a ton of rural areas

2140
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:39,300
and brought them out of poverty and

2141
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:41,699
created an enormous amount of economic

2142
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:44,520
activity both in the rural areas and in

2143
01:22:41,698 --> 01:22:46,500
the cities and they somehow like I said

2144
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:47,580
before they killed the goose that laid

2145
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:50,460
the golden egg

2146
01:22:47,579 --> 01:22:51,719
and nobody wants to admit nobody wants

2147
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:53,460
to admit that they made a bunch of

2148
01:22:51,719 --> 01:22:55,920
mistakes

2149
01:22:53,460 --> 01:22:57,060
and how they're going to redo it but

2150
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:58,560
what's going to happen in the next

2151
01:22:57,060 --> 01:23:00,780
couple of years is I think they're gonna

2152
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:03,239
you're gonna see like this thing has

2153
01:23:00,779 --> 01:23:05,759
been propped up by a bunch of investor

2154
01:23:03,238 --> 01:23:07,979
money getting poured into it yeah and

2155
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:09,659
when that investor money stops right

2156
01:23:07,979 --> 01:23:11,639
which is starting to stop because when

2157
01:23:09,658 --> 01:23:13,019
you start seeing investors start suing

2158
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:14,940
people

2159
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:17,340
it's because they've realized they've

2160
01:23:14,939 --> 01:23:18,839
given up hope that they're gonna now

2161
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:20,940
they're worried about their principal

2162
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:22,619
investment yeah

2163
01:23:20,939 --> 01:23:25,319
right when they go from like oh I'm

2164
01:23:22,619 --> 01:23:27,238
going to make a ton of money yeah right

2165
01:23:25,319 --> 01:23:29,880
about I'm going to try to recoup what I

2166
01:23:27,238 --> 01:23:32,819
can I'm gonna try to recoup you know I'm

2167
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:35,699
gonna try to mitigate my losses yeah

2168
01:23:32,819 --> 01:23:36,899
exactly yeah right and so as a result of

2169
01:23:35,698 --> 01:23:38,759
that

2170
01:23:36,899 --> 01:23:40,079
if that's the case then you're gonna see

2171
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:41,880
a bunch of

2172
01:23:40,079 --> 01:23:44,460
contraction

2173
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:47,520
right and

2174
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:49,319
You Know It uh I think most people if

2175
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:50,820
you ask most smokers that have been

2176
01:23:49,319 --> 01:23:53,880
around and at least have been smoking

2177
01:23:50,819 --> 01:23:55,799
since say like 2008

2178
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:59,159
they would probably tell you they

2179
01:23:55,800 --> 01:24:03,060
preferred the stores in the 215 era

2180
01:23:59,158 --> 01:24:05,819
oh yeah as far as quality and diversity

2181
01:24:03,060 --> 01:24:08,520
of what they had access to

2182
01:24:05,819 --> 01:24:11,579
yeah I mean just the things you could do

2183
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:13,199
like you could in 215 or you could run a

2184
01:24:11,579 --> 01:24:16,859
breeding project and like you're

2185
01:24:13,198 --> 01:24:18,359
freaking dispensary like it didn't

2186
01:24:16,859 --> 01:24:20,039
you know what I mean well the other

2187
01:24:18,359 --> 01:24:21,719
thing that you could also get popped

2188
01:24:20,039 --> 01:24:24,420
like you could get popped that day but

2189
01:24:21,719 --> 01:24:26,579
everybody knew like okay you get popped

2190
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:28,319
everybody builds out real quick a week

2191
01:24:26,579 --> 01:24:29,819
later run your [ __ ] you're back and then

2192
01:24:28,319 --> 01:24:31,079
another six months you do the same [ __ ]

2193
01:24:29,819 --> 01:24:32,340
everybody maybe I should make a

2194
01:24:31,079 --> 01:24:35,640
political statement

2195
01:24:32,340 --> 01:24:38,940
do it I like it in my opinion like

2196
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:40,500
the biggest thing that you know you were

2197
01:24:38,939 --> 01:24:42,719
talking about that article and like

2198
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:45,719
studying Delta eight and Delta 10 and

2199
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:47,760
THC and harm to children or whatever and

2200
01:24:45,719 --> 01:24:49,859
and Legacy strains the biggest thing

2201
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:51,239
they could do for legacy strains they

2202
01:24:49,859 --> 01:24:53,880
don't need some 20 million dollar

2203
01:24:51,238 --> 01:24:56,698
University study program they could just

2204
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:59,819
make it be like okay if you're if you

2205
01:24:56,698 --> 01:25:01,079
want to be non-commercial cannabis

2206
01:24:59,819 --> 01:25:03,420
right

2207
01:25:01,079 --> 01:25:06,359
I don't care if you have a breeding Pro

2208
01:25:03,420 --> 01:25:08,640
program with 200 plants in your backyard

2209
01:25:06,359 --> 01:25:10,079
yeah now the reason why they're scared

2210
01:25:08,640 --> 01:25:12,060
to do that is because they're scared

2211
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:16,439
that you're going to grow 205 pound

2212
01:25:12,060 --> 01:25:17,820
plants and grow you know uh a literal

2213
01:25:16,439 --> 01:25:19,019
you know they're gonna grow a thousand

2214
01:25:17,819 --> 01:25:20,279
pounds of weed and you're gonna sell it

2215
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:21,480
on the black market you're going to make

2216
01:25:20,279 --> 01:25:24,179
a ton of money and how they're going to

2217
01:25:21,479 --> 01:25:26,279
differentiate yeah but if you look at

2218
01:25:24,179 --> 01:25:28,920
like the heirloom vegetables like Baker

2219
01:25:26,279 --> 01:25:30,599
Creek or any of those people right the

2220
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:32,699
reason why all those heirloom vegetables

2221
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:36,360
survived was because there was a bunch

2222
01:25:32,698 --> 01:25:39,059
of enthusiasts that were able to breed

2223
01:25:36,359 --> 01:25:41,219
and grow and trade seeds and trade

2224
01:25:39,060 --> 01:25:43,320
cultivars and do all this stuff with

2225
01:25:41,219 --> 01:25:44,579
zero government care regulation and

2226
01:25:43,319 --> 01:25:47,399
without worrying about getting their

2227
01:25:44,579 --> 01:25:49,859
family yeah no so if you want to

2228
01:25:47,399 --> 01:25:51,658
preserve the Legacy allow all the weed

2229
01:25:49,859 --> 01:25:52,380
nerds to have whatever plant count they

2230
01:25:51,658 --> 01:25:54,539
want

2231
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:56,219
yeah like if you're not selling it and

2232
01:25:54,539 --> 01:25:58,619
you want to have 500 plants in your

2233
01:25:56,219 --> 01:26:00,840
garage let them

2234
01:25:58,619 --> 01:26:02,819
if you want to do a big seed pop and

2235
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:05,639
hunt for rare traits you're after and

2236
01:26:02,819 --> 01:26:07,439
try to create a new strain let them

2237
01:26:05,639 --> 01:26:08,880
you know you can still make rules where

2238
01:26:07,439 --> 01:26:10,619
like you're not allowed to send this out

2239
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:12,960
of state or we don't want you to sell it

2240
01:26:10,619 --> 01:26:15,719
or you know we don't want you to this or

2241
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:18,600
that but you know failing that it's like

2242
01:26:15,719 --> 01:26:19,859
if they if they want preservation of

2243
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:22,560
genetics

2244
01:26:19,859 --> 01:26:24,719
they should make rules that allow

2245
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:27,120
legally you to do that and it doesn't

2246
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:30,960
have to have this super taxed super

2247
01:26:27,119 --> 01:26:32,639
regulated commercial only legality

2248
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:35,399
because that's essentially what they've

2249
01:26:32,639 --> 01:26:37,619
done is they're like if you know it's

2250
01:26:35,399 --> 01:26:39,179
only legal if you're commercially paying

2251
01:26:37,619 --> 01:26:41,219
them

2252
01:26:39,179 --> 01:26:43,079
like I think a private farmer right now

2253
01:26:41,219 --> 01:26:44,100
can have like four or six plants or

2254
01:26:43,079 --> 01:26:46,198
something

2255
01:26:44,100 --> 01:26:48,780
that's called a Shakedown that's not

2256
01:26:46,198 --> 01:26:49,859
that's not that's not saving moms that

2257
01:26:48,779 --> 01:26:51,840
you care about

2258
01:26:49,859 --> 01:26:54,119
that's not popping a bunch of seeds and

2259
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:55,739
doing a Fino hunt that's not saving

2260
01:26:54,119 --> 01:26:57,899
things from the final hunt that's not

2261
01:26:55,738 --> 01:27:00,658
being like Oh I just popped you know 50

2262
01:26:57,899 --> 01:27:03,179
seeds of riots you know whatever hybrid

2263
01:27:00,658 --> 01:27:05,039
you know strawberry switchblade yeah and

2264
01:27:03,179 --> 01:27:07,500
there's 10 of them I like that I want to

2265
01:27:05,039 --> 01:27:09,539
run again and compare them there's no

2266
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:11,939
doing that anymore that's illegal even

2267
01:27:09,539 --> 01:27:15,060
if you want to do that in a in a four by

2268
01:27:11,939 --> 01:27:16,259
eight tent yeah and a two by two space

2269
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:18,719
you couldn't and you're growing them

2270
01:27:16,260 --> 01:27:21,119
little popsicles that's that's not legal

2271
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:23,340
it's Preposterous so the biggest thing

2272
01:27:21,119 --> 01:27:24,960
that they could do for a legacy is let

2273
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:26,760
all the weed nerds and let all the

2274
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:29,039
preservationists and let all the people

2275
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:31,739
that have all that stuff give them the

2276
01:27:29,039 --> 01:27:33,779
freedom to play around with weed

2277
01:27:31,738 --> 01:27:36,238
non-commercially

2278
01:27:33,779 --> 01:27:38,039
yeah which is what every other vegetable

2279
01:27:36,238 --> 01:27:40,379
and fruit can do

2280
01:27:38,039 --> 01:27:42,899
yeah as long as they make it it's only

2281
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:45,000
legal if you want to have this extremely

2282
01:27:42,899 --> 01:27:47,238
expensive to maintain and set up

2283
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:49,800
business

2284
01:27:47,238 --> 01:27:51,718
there's a lot of non-commercial cannabis

2285
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:52,800
that might have value later on that we

2286
01:27:51,719 --> 01:27:54,920
don't even know about

2287
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:57,600
yeah there could be cancer curing

2288
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:59,340
compounds there could be GL there could

2289
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:00,900
be ones that are better for glaucoma

2290
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:03,300
there can be ones that are better for

2291
01:28:00,899 --> 01:28:05,460
nausea or HIV or this or that or

2292
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:07,860
whatever or just don't even think that's

2293
01:28:05,460 --> 01:28:10,439
anybody's concern except maybe the the

2294
01:28:07,859 --> 01:28:13,259
PHD academics that are looking into it

2295
01:28:10,439 --> 01:28:16,138
but I don't think they again there's

2296
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:18,300
that disconnect of these middlemen that

2297
01:28:16,139 --> 01:28:23,039
have made this big wall between the two

2298
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:25,260
but if you allow us to preserve legally

2299
01:28:23,039 --> 01:28:28,139
then we'll do it

2300
01:28:25,260 --> 01:28:29,820
and the phds and all the testing and all

2301
01:28:28,139 --> 01:28:32,760
that that can happen later because we're

2302
01:28:29,819 --> 01:28:36,059
already doing it for ourselves

2303
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:37,980
they're just so bad at letting taking

2304
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:40,199
something the government taking

2305
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:43,019
something and then being like all right

2306
01:28:40,198 --> 01:28:47,279
you're right you know let's give it back

2307
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:49,560
like okay it doesn't happen all right so

2308
01:28:47,279 --> 01:28:54,359
if you want me to be like real political

2309
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:56,460
like going back to overgrow right which

2310
01:28:54,359 --> 01:28:59,339
was overgrown cannabis world where the

2311
01:28:56,460 --> 01:29:01,020
first two really big forums where people

2312
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:03,659
that didn't know each other could gather

2313
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:06,360
and talk about weed right yeah and the

2314
01:29:03,658 --> 01:29:09,359
whole overgrow concept was literally if

2315
01:29:06,359 --> 01:29:11,279
everyone over if everyone grows

2316
01:29:09,359 --> 01:29:14,219
we're gonna overgrow the government's

2317
01:29:11,279 --> 01:29:16,859
ability to criminalize all of us and

2318
01:29:14,219 --> 01:29:18,239
they'll have to change it yeah yeah like

2319
01:29:16,859 --> 01:29:19,979
like if there's enough Civil

2320
01:29:18,238 --> 01:29:22,500
Disobedience going on where we're like

2321
01:29:19,979 --> 01:29:25,079
this law sucks right and enough people

2322
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:27,238
do it they can't jail the entire

2323
01:29:25,079 --> 01:29:29,219
population they can't even jail most of

2324
01:29:27,238 --> 01:29:30,059
the population they can only jail a tiny

2325
01:29:29,219 --> 01:29:35,158
fraction

2326
01:29:30,060 --> 01:29:37,800
yeah right and so you know like

2327
01:29:35,158 --> 01:29:39,000
I don't think the fight has is over at

2328
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:41,400
all

2329
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:42,658
like well I think it's over my whole

2330
01:29:41,399 --> 01:29:44,399
life they've been like you're wrong

2331
01:29:42,658 --> 01:29:46,198
you're wrong you're wrong you can't have

2332
01:29:44,399 --> 01:29:49,379
it you're evil for having it you're a

2333
01:29:46,198 --> 01:29:50,759
scumbag no you're bad stop and now

2334
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:52,739
they're like hey

2335
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:55,800
this thing you got it's pretty cool

2336
01:29:52,738 --> 01:29:57,178
if you want we'll take it from here

2337
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:58,980
if you want to give us all your

2338
01:29:57,179 --> 01:30:00,779
knowledge and all your strains and all

2339
01:29:58,979 --> 01:30:02,519
your seeds and all that and let us eat

2340
01:30:00,779 --> 01:30:04,559
and let us commercially you we'll take

2341
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:05,639
you did a good job you're good we'll

2342
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:08,400
take it from here

2343
01:30:05,639 --> 01:30:10,020
yeah and so I think I don't think the

2344
01:30:08,399 --> 01:30:12,179
fight is over I think the fight has

2345
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:13,980
changed and that they're losing

2346
01:30:12,179 --> 01:30:16,199
and so they're finally starting to give

2347
01:30:13,979 --> 01:30:17,158
us medical and recreational at a wide

2348
01:30:16,198 --> 01:30:20,460
scale

2349
01:30:17,158 --> 01:30:22,679
I guess I guess for my again my point of

2350
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:24,480
view being very the punk rock kind of

2351
01:30:22,679 --> 01:30:26,340
point of view it's like

2352
01:30:24,479 --> 01:30:28,859
I didn't give a [ __ ] what they thought

2353
01:30:26,340 --> 01:30:30,719
then when it was illegal and I don't

2354
01:30:28,859 --> 01:30:33,479
give a [ __ ] what they think now when

2355
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:34,859
it's legal right however this is what

2356
01:30:33,479 --> 01:30:37,500
you gotta this is what you got to

2357
01:30:34,859 --> 01:30:39,719
realize though yeah is that when they

2358
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:42,359
didn't want us to have it at all

2359
01:30:39,719 --> 01:30:46,920
that made it a lot more lucrative

2360
01:30:42,359 --> 01:30:49,380
yes and as such that it was lucrative it

2361
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:52,980
allowed us to fund

2362
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:55,139
our Insurgency if you will that is true

2363
01:30:52,979 --> 01:30:58,319
yeah right it allowed us to fund seed

2364
01:30:55,139 --> 01:31:02,819
making clone clone saving clone sharing

2365
01:30:58,319 --> 01:31:05,340
you know yeah it allowed us to fund our

2366
01:31:02,819 --> 01:31:08,099
punk rock side of things

2367
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:10,440
absolutely so your fear that you talked

2368
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:12,659
about before is that you know they

2369
01:31:10,439 --> 01:31:15,000
crashed the price so much

2370
01:31:12,658 --> 01:31:18,299
that the people that are trying to enact

2371
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:21,238
change can't self-fund

2372
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:22,860
correct yeah you know like I mean take

2373
01:31:21,238 --> 01:31:24,479
it from like obviously like like the

2374
01:31:22,859 --> 01:31:27,179
weed fight that we're doing is totally

2375
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:28,439
non-violent but I often wonder like when

2376
01:31:27,179 --> 01:31:30,658
the American government was in

2377
01:31:28,439 --> 01:31:32,460
Afghanistan like

2378
01:31:30,658 --> 01:31:34,638
would we have would we have beaten the

2379
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:37,859
Taliban if the Taliban didn't have

2380
01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:44,060
hashish and opium

2381
01:31:37,859 --> 01:31:44,059
to fund their operations yeah who knows

2382
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:48,480
you know yeah

2383
01:31:46,319 --> 01:31:50,399
um you know in the sense that like you

2384
01:31:48,479 --> 01:31:52,439
know they were able to get you know they

2385
01:31:50,399 --> 01:31:54,899
at some point I can't remember when but

2386
01:31:52,439 --> 01:31:56,638
it was like I read this thing where like

2387
01:31:54,899 --> 01:31:58,259
you know we were three four years into

2388
01:31:56,639 --> 01:32:01,020
the into the fight over there and they

2389
01:31:58,260 --> 01:32:02,520
were like Afghanistan is producing 90 of

2390
01:32:01,020 --> 01:32:03,840
the world's heroin

2391
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:06,719
mm-hmm

2392
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:09,179
well that obviously who was who was

2393
01:32:06,719 --> 01:32:11,520
making that money

2394
01:32:09,179 --> 01:32:14,219
our government usually

2395
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:16,199
but I just mean that like it allowed

2396
01:32:14,219 --> 01:32:17,819
those like you know like a resistance

2397
01:32:16,198 --> 01:32:21,000
movement has to have some level of

2398
01:32:17,819 --> 01:32:22,019
funding yeah as I understood it it was

2399
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,639
uh

2400
01:32:22,020 --> 01:32:24,719
the Italian trying to clear it out

2401
01:32:23,639 --> 01:32:27,260
because they were religious

2402
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:29,698
fundamentalists and US protecting it is

2403
01:32:27,260 --> 01:32:32,639
I mean who knows what went on over there

2404
01:32:29,698 --> 01:32:33,899
I definitely think that you know they

2405
01:32:32,639 --> 01:32:36,359
might I don't know if they're clearing

2406
01:32:33,899 --> 01:32:38,039
it out again but it's like any kind of

2407
01:32:36,359 --> 01:32:40,019
movement needs something to fund itself

2408
01:32:38,039 --> 01:32:42,179
so we maybe it was a bad analogy or

2409
01:32:40,020 --> 01:32:43,739
whatever but they were able to I mean

2410
01:32:42,179 --> 01:32:45,179
they were able to use the hash trade and

2411
01:32:43,738 --> 01:32:46,259
weed or maybe they weren't even all that

2412
01:32:45,179 --> 01:32:47,579
involved in it and they just took

2413
01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:49,800
protection money

2414
01:32:47,579 --> 01:32:51,779
yeah I'm sure that was going on yeah

2415
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:53,039
from the farmers and the dealers and the

2416
01:32:51,779 --> 01:32:56,158
people that needed to use the trade

2417
01:32:53,039 --> 01:32:58,679
routes or whatever else yeah and so you

2418
01:32:56,158 --> 01:33:01,439
know in the 215 era and in the illegal

2419
01:32:58,679 --> 01:33:03,000
era it was much smaller but it was also

2420
01:33:01,439 --> 01:33:04,259
much more profitable and so if you

2421
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:06,420
stayed hidden you could kind of do what

2422
01:33:04,260 --> 01:33:08,639
you wanted yeah now I think they're

2423
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:10,380
trying to trick Us by being like okay

2424
01:33:08,639 --> 01:33:12,119
we'll give you what you want but it's

2425
01:33:10,380 --> 01:33:14,100
only kind of what you want and it's

2426
01:33:12,119 --> 01:33:16,079
basically us taking most of what you

2427
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:18,239
want but we'll take away some of the

2428
01:33:16,079 --> 01:33:19,380
fear of you getting in trouble and in

2429
01:33:18,238 --> 01:33:22,198
return

2430
01:33:19,380 --> 01:33:26,100
you'll give up your hope

2431
01:33:22,198 --> 01:33:29,219
yeah yeah allow us to just you know to

2432
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:31,079
just take this over from you yeah and so

2433
01:33:29,219 --> 01:33:33,060
at the growing side we'll let you smoke

2434
01:33:31,079 --> 01:33:34,920
but we got that we got the we got the

2435
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:37,860
backside you can smoke yeah and so to me

2436
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:39,239
it's like until I'm able to grow weed in

2437
01:33:37,859 --> 01:33:42,960
my backyard like I'm able to grow

2438
01:33:39,238 --> 01:33:45,839
cucumbers or tomatoes or whatever like

2439
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:48,840
think about before Whole Foods and

2440
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:51,179
before the 20 years ago when like the

2441
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:53,100
The Organic Revolution really like took

2442
01:33:51,179 --> 01:33:54,658
hold in America and got like more

2443
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:57,000
mainstream

2444
01:33:54,658 --> 01:33:59,279
like all the people doing all those

2445
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:00,719
heirloom vegetables and and fruits and

2446
01:33:59,279 --> 01:34:01,679
stuff we're all a bunch of crunchy

2447
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:04,739
hippies

2448
01:34:01,679 --> 01:34:06,179
yeah and Back To Nature types and weird

2449
01:34:04,738 --> 01:34:08,339
little farmers and stuff most people

2450
01:34:06,179 --> 01:34:10,619
didn't even know that was going on at

2451
01:34:08,340 --> 01:34:11,940
little co-ops yeah it was little co-ops

2452
01:34:10,619 --> 01:34:14,460
there was little things going on there

2453
01:34:11,939 --> 01:34:16,619
was small groups of enthusiasts that

2454
01:34:14,460 --> 01:34:18,420
kept all that stuff alive until big

2455
01:34:16,619 --> 01:34:21,238
companies were like oh people want this

2456
01:34:18,420 --> 01:34:23,819
okay we'll carry some yeah

2457
01:34:21,238 --> 01:34:26,039
right but we in order for weed to have

2458
01:34:23,819 --> 01:34:27,779
that happen they need to allow the

2459
01:34:26,039 --> 01:34:29,279
enthusiasts they need to allow the

2460
01:34:27,779 --> 01:34:31,800
people with passion they need to be

2461
01:34:29,279 --> 01:34:33,899
allow the people with as a touch of the

2462
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:36,239
Chisholm you know who get into it like

2463
01:34:33,899 --> 01:34:39,179
that deeply and care that deeply about

2464
01:34:36,238 --> 01:34:40,198
lineage and strains and history and old

2465
01:34:39,179 --> 01:34:42,179
things

2466
01:34:40,198 --> 01:34:44,519
to preserve it

2467
01:34:42,179 --> 01:34:46,319
how do you see that happening

2468
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:47,940
that's how I that's that's what I just

2469
01:34:46,319 --> 01:34:50,340
said I think that we need to go from

2470
01:34:47,939 --> 01:34:53,399
like a a

2471
01:34:50,340 --> 01:34:56,699
we need to make it actually legal

2472
01:34:53,399 --> 01:34:58,198
how is I mean how do we get lobbyists I

2473
01:34:56,698 --> 01:35:01,259
mean that's how people get things legal

2474
01:34:58,198 --> 01:35:04,559
I mean how do how do people like us the

2475
01:35:01,260 --> 01:35:07,199
strain nerds how do we assemble well

2476
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:09,860
we're an adorable to index power we're

2477
01:35:07,198 --> 01:35:13,319
in a dark time in the moment because

2478
01:35:09,859 --> 01:35:15,539
they changed all the rules on us by

2479
01:35:13,319 --> 01:35:18,238
partially giving us what we wanted

2480
01:35:15,539 --> 01:35:20,519
yes and now everyone's realizing that

2481
01:35:18,238 --> 01:35:24,419
was a little bit of like Fool's Gold

2482
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:26,480
right and where do we go from here yeah

2483
01:35:24,420 --> 01:35:29,520
and so probably what it's going to take

2484
01:35:26,479 --> 01:35:31,559
is what I think is going to happen is is

2485
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:33,300
they're not going to they're not going

2486
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:37,320
to really start to look at changing all

2487
01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:37,320
the rules and regulations until

2488
01:35:37,380 --> 01:35:40,440
um

2489
01:35:38,158 --> 01:35:41,939
until the states start failing and get

2490
01:35:40,439 --> 01:35:43,738
embarrassed

2491
01:35:41,939 --> 01:35:45,479
yeah I can see that like I've I've

2492
01:35:43,738 --> 01:35:46,919
consulted on some pretty big projects

2493
01:35:45,479 --> 01:35:48,658
here and there and like when I talk to

2494
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:51,359
people in big AG

2495
01:35:48,658 --> 01:35:54,059
yeah they just can't believe the rules

2496
01:35:51,359 --> 01:35:56,639
and regulations and [ __ ]

2497
01:35:54,060 --> 01:35:58,500
that we have to jump through oh yeah

2498
01:35:56,639 --> 01:36:00,900
they're used to being able at a large

2499
01:35:58,500 --> 01:36:03,119
level to Cowboy Up

2500
01:36:00,899 --> 01:36:05,759
and kind of do what they want with wide

2501
01:36:03,119 --> 01:36:07,380
choices and latitude and it's all based

2502
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:09,060
on being efficient and having good

2503
01:36:07,380 --> 01:36:11,039
production models and this and that but

2504
01:36:09,060 --> 01:36:13,280
the hand of the government is pretty

2505
01:36:11,039 --> 01:36:13,279
light

2506
01:36:13,619 --> 01:36:18,059
you know and you know that's what we

2507
01:36:16,439 --> 01:36:20,819
need is we need a light hand right now

2508
01:36:18,060 --> 01:36:22,380
we have a heavy hand

2509
01:36:20,819 --> 01:36:24,238
you know and there's people that are

2510
01:36:22,380 --> 01:36:25,920
trying to steal it from us and there's

2511
01:36:24,238 --> 01:36:28,500
people in our community that are banding

2512
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:30,840
with them hoping to help them steal it

2513
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:33,479
from us but to get personally wealthy

2514
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:34,860
along the way yeah and make it for them

2515
01:36:33,479 --> 01:36:37,138
and their family

2516
01:36:34,859 --> 01:36:38,719
and all those people need to get mostly

2517
01:36:37,139 --> 01:36:41,880
screwed

2518
01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:43,439
yeah I'd be nice if they did but yeah a

2519
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:46,139
lot of them are I mean let's let's put

2520
01:36:43,439 --> 01:36:48,119
it this way right like it is true yeah

2521
01:36:46,139 --> 01:36:50,699
I mean you know

2522
01:36:48,119 --> 01:36:52,920
you could talk about uh you know there's

2523
01:36:50,698 --> 01:36:54,479
that there's uh

2524
01:36:52,920 --> 01:36:57,779
let's put it this way we don't need to

2525
01:36:54,479 --> 01:37:01,439
name who right who's you thinking about

2526
01:36:57,779 --> 01:37:05,698
would you want to be sued by Scots

2527
01:37:01,439 --> 01:37:08,158
oh no no fear no like a massive

2528
01:37:05,698 --> 01:37:10,439
Corporation with endless money and

2529
01:37:08,158 --> 01:37:14,339
probably lawyers that are 500 an hour

2530
01:37:10,439 --> 01:37:16,919
would you want them to come after you

2531
01:37:14,340 --> 01:37:18,539
they win they win suits where they're

2532
01:37:16,920 --> 01:37:21,179
they sound like they're the devil and

2533
01:37:18,539 --> 01:37:23,460
they win the suits yeah so and so some

2534
01:37:21,179 --> 01:37:25,619
of the some of these rich investors are

2535
01:37:23,460 --> 01:37:27,899
like you know you know what Bernie

2536
01:37:25,619 --> 01:37:30,479
madoff's problem was

2537
01:37:27,899 --> 01:37:33,000
he stole from other rich people

2538
01:37:30,479 --> 01:37:35,099
yeah and when they figured it out they

2539
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:38,698
were like oh no no no no no no no no no

2540
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:39,900
no no I'm gonna call up my 500 an hour

2541
01:37:38,698 --> 01:37:42,000
lawyer

2542
01:37:39,899 --> 01:37:43,799
you know and I'm gonna get his Law Firm

2543
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:46,380
you know and then you know you get

2544
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:47,940
dozens of people doing this

2545
01:37:46,380 --> 01:37:49,500
that's what's gonna happen with a bunch

2546
01:37:47,939 --> 01:37:51,000
of these investors when they find out

2547
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:53,399
that they poured their money down the

2548
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:55,738
toilet oh yeah

2549
01:37:53,399 --> 01:38:00,179
and they found out that a bunch of a

2550
01:37:55,738 --> 01:38:02,819
bunch of like non-ethical hustlers

2551
01:38:00,179 --> 01:38:05,579
were sloshing their money around and not

2552
01:38:02,819 --> 01:38:08,519
really treating it the right way

2553
01:38:05,579 --> 01:38:10,698
but do you think you know so do you

2554
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:14,420
think there's a chance that

2555
01:38:10,698 --> 01:38:16,799
that any kind of major corporation

2556
01:38:14,420 --> 01:38:19,619
predicted that this is what would happen

2557
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:21,560
because I in my opinion I don't think

2558
01:38:19,619 --> 01:38:25,559
that this is that out of the realm of

2559
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:28,920
logic for all having taken place like

2560
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:31,199
from watching how alcohol became what it

2561
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:33,480
was to now and stuff and how many people

2562
01:38:31,198 --> 01:38:35,638
ripped it off and got in the middle

2563
01:38:33,479 --> 01:38:37,799
between the the gray areas and stuff

2564
01:38:35,639 --> 01:38:40,020
alcohol is a totally alcohol is a

2565
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:41,340
totally different material it is a

2566
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:43,020
totally different scenario but look at

2567
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:45,360
all the the dirty middlemen in between

2568
01:38:43,020 --> 01:38:48,060
and how many people that were like

2569
01:38:45,359 --> 01:38:50,639
actually Outlaws doing it got screwed in

2570
01:38:48,060 --> 01:38:52,380
the end that's the whole scenario and

2571
01:38:50,639 --> 01:38:54,840
now it's a lot and you can kind of say

2572
01:38:52,380 --> 01:38:56,400
they got screwed but like if you want to

2573
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:58,500
I mean this is getting really off track

2574
01:38:56,399 --> 01:39:02,399
but if you want to look at alcohol

2575
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:04,500
the reason why alcohol got made illegal

2576
01:39:02,399 --> 01:39:06,059
if you can look it up was because before

2577
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:09,658
prohibition

2578
01:39:06,060 --> 01:39:11,880
like Americans were the was the drunkest

2579
01:39:09,658 --> 01:39:14,099
country on Earth

2580
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:16,380
right there was men drinking gallons

2581
01:39:14,100 --> 01:39:20,820
upon gallons of whiskey

2582
01:39:16,380 --> 01:39:23,639
there was mass like absences on Mondays

2583
01:39:20,819 --> 01:39:27,059
on the work week because people were so

2584
01:39:23,639 --> 01:39:29,579
hungover from the from from the weekend

2585
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:32,039
yeah right the abolitionists the

2586
01:39:29,579 --> 01:39:34,619
prohibitionists the reason why they were

2587
01:39:32,039 --> 01:39:37,079
so against it was because the level of

2588
01:39:34,619 --> 01:39:40,139
public drunkenness like if you just type

2589
01:39:37,079 --> 01:39:43,920
into Google like how much they drank

2590
01:39:40,139 --> 01:39:46,380
then versus today it's astronomical

2591
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:48,000
right and the reason they got rid of it

2592
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:50,239
wasn't because they made a big mistake

2593
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:55,500
it was because they were like oh man

2594
01:39:50,238 --> 01:39:57,419
like we fueled these criminal groups to

2595
01:39:55,500 --> 01:39:59,100
where they've taken over almost every

2596
01:39:57,420 --> 01:40:01,139
major city and they actually run the

2597
01:39:59,100 --> 01:40:02,760
cops and they run the Mayors and they're

2598
01:40:01,139 --> 01:40:04,679
electing yeah and they're doing this and

2599
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:07,500
they're doing that and everyone's

2600
01:40:04,679 --> 01:40:09,840
disobeying us like everyone

2601
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:11,579
and it's creating this horrific thing

2602
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:13,980
and like after they got rid of

2603
01:40:11,579 --> 01:40:16,559
prohibition it took him an extra 50 or

2604
01:40:13,979 --> 01:40:18,359
60 years to break the mob

2605
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:20,820
yeah I mean I was just thinking like

2606
01:40:18,359 --> 01:40:23,599
Kennedy like he I was all the way up

2607
01:40:20,819 --> 01:40:26,099
into 63 that and he was alcohol

2608
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:27,840
prohibition like like what was his dad

2609
01:40:26,100 --> 01:40:30,179
he was not not him yeah that's what I'm

2610
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:31,800
saying but he had political effect all

2611
01:40:30,179 --> 01:40:33,960
the way up until 63 to get his sons

2612
01:40:31,800 --> 01:40:35,400
elected oh and there's there's almost no

2613
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:37,920
doubt that the I mean that the Chicago

2614
01:40:35,399 --> 01:40:40,379
mob helped Kennedy get elected and

2615
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:42,658
helped him win Illinois

2616
01:40:40,380 --> 01:40:44,940
um and you know and I'm not I'm not

2617
01:40:42,658 --> 01:40:49,259
trying to like you know divert on a

2618
01:40:44,939 --> 01:40:52,559
tangent but like we'd weed has not like

2619
01:40:49,260 --> 01:40:54,780
alcohol fueled so much money that it

2620
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:56,699
corrupted so many police forces so much

2621
01:40:54,779 --> 01:40:58,380
government so many mayors so many

2622
01:40:56,698 --> 01:41:00,899
senators so many different things that

2623
01:40:58,380 --> 01:41:03,600
they almost in order to restore order

2624
01:41:00,899 --> 01:41:04,920
they had to stop it it was like a

2625
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:08,159
massive failure

2626
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:10,440
yeah they didn't stop it cannabis you

2627
01:41:08,158 --> 01:41:12,299
know there's not got cannabis like you

2628
01:41:10,439 --> 01:41:14,158
know criminal groups or whatever that

2629
01:41:12,300 --> 01:41:16,079
like own mayors that own the police

2630
01:41:14,158 --> 01:41:18,479
forces that are like there's not enough

2631
01:41:16,079 --> 01:41:20,279
money sloshing around that's true no

2632
01:41:18,479 --> 01:41:21,779
there's just nothing that you know I

2633
01:41:20,279 --> 01:41:22,920
mean like they said like Al Capone or

2634
01:41:21,779 --> 01:41:26,460
something like that you know he's worth

2635
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:28,199
like you know 700 million dollars but

2636
01:41:26,460 --> 01:41:30,960
looking at it just strictly from a

2637
01:41:28,198 --> 01:41:33,000
business model it was very easy to

2638
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:34,500
predict how it was going to go there was

2639
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:36,179
going to be people who thought they were

2640
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:38,039
Rich enough to play and then they were

2641
01:41:36,179 --> 01:41:40,800
going to be the actual rich people who

2642
01:41:38,039 --> 01:41:42,060
could take loss that had way more money

2643
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:42,980
than the people that thought they were

2644
01:41:42,060 --> 01:41:45,780
Rich here

2645
01:41:42,979 --> 01:41:47,939
losses longer and play the longer game

2646
01:41:45,779 --> 01:41:51,000
because that's but honestly economics I

2647
01:41:47,939 --> 01:41:52,859
you know like I've consulted for people

2648
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:55,859
that I think are incredibly Rich at

2649
01:41:52,859 --> 01:41:58,920
times and yeah like in order for those

2650
01:41:55,859 --> 01:42:01,500
incredibly rich people to you still have

2651
01:41:58,920 --> 01:42:03,840
to realize that like they invest their

2652
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:06,420
money in so many different things

2653
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:08,460
that like cannabis has to be as good or

2654
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:10,859
better than other places they could put

2655
01:42:08,460 --> 01:42:12,899
their money oh sure and what they're

2656
01:42:10,859 --> 01:42:16,500
discovering is that cannabis is actually

2657
01:42:12,899 --> 01:42:18,539
quite a bit worse yeah than most other

2658
01:42:16,500 --> 01:42:21,658
places they could put their money

2659
01:42:18,539 --> 01:42:23,158
so cannabis might have extracted a ton

2660
01:42:21,658 --> 01:42:25,138
of investment out of all these different

2661
01:42:23,158 --> 01:42:26,519
types of people but eventually there's

2662
01:42:25,139 --> 01:42:28,260
the situation where like you've been

2663
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:30,179
losing money for four or five years and

2664
01:42:28,260 --> 01:42:33,119
you're like oh I thought that you know

2665
01:42:30,179 --> 01:42:35,399
profit would be around the corner

2666
01:42:33,118 --> 01:42:37,139
and if it's not you might just cut bait

2667
01:42:35,399 --> 01:42:39,059
and start putting that money you were

2668
01:42:37,139 --> 01:42:40,920
pouring into it into

2669
01:42:39,060 --> 01:42:43,139
you know into something that's going to

2670
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:45,000
make you money right away

2671
01:42:43,139 --> 01:42:48,118
yeah that's that's what I mean like it's

2672
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:50,520
economics these guys Outlast these guys

2673
01:42:48,118 --> 01:42:52,618
right but I don't think they predicted

2674
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:55,020
that I think there's people that are

2675
01:42:52,618 --> 01:42:56,519
trying to outlast others but I think

2676
01:42:55,020 --> 01:42:58,100
that there's a lot of losers that

2677
01:42:56,520 --> 01:43:01,619
thought they would be in the Outlast

2678
01:42:58,100 --> 01:43:03,539
category again that's economics the guys

2679
01:43:01,618 --> 01:43:05,158
that fall out never think they're going

2680
01:43:03,539 --> 01:43:06,658
to be the ones that fall out they always

2681
01:43:05,158 --> 01:43:08,579
think they're the richest in the house

2682
01:43:06,658 --> 01:43:09,779
that are going to be the guys that are

2683
01:43:08,579 --> 01:43:11,158
the smartest it's almost like I mean I

2684
01:43:09,779 --> 01:43:13,439
could do it I could do it the thing is

2685
01:43:11,158 --> 01:43:16,198
is that like looking at like that like

2686
01:43:13,439 --> 01:43:17,759
there's like you know New York just

2687
01:43:16,198 --> 01:43:20,539
opened up

2688
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:22,739
and New York has like five stores open

2689
01:43:20,539 --> 01:43:24,300
and they're trying to like build this

2690
01:43:22,738 --> 01:43:26,759
this legal industry and there's all

2691
01:43:24,300 --> 01:43:29,880
these news reports now of like you know

2692
01:43:26,760 --> 01:43:31,139
hundreds of bodegas illegally selling

2693
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:32,279
cannabis that they know is from

2694
01:43:31,139 --> 01:43:34,199
California

2695
01:43:32,279 --> 01:43:35,460
yeah that makes sense yeah and they're

2696
01:43:34,198 --> 01:43:36,599
like how in the hell are we gonna stop

2697
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:38,219
this thing

2698
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:39,780
you know it's like they don't they don't

2699
01:43:38,219 --> 01:43:41,539
get that like one of the things that

2700
01:43:39,779 --> 01:43:45,840
alcohol did that was vastly different

2701
01:43:41,539 --> 01:43:48,118
than cannabis is that alcohol was made

2702
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:50,039
legal at the federal level when they

2703
01:43:48,118 --> 01:43:53,399
repealed the amendment

2704
01:43:50,039 --> 01:43:55,439
so all 50 states oh yeah made it legal

2705
01:43:53,399 --> 01:43:56,939
right and that there were certain

2706
01:43:55,439 --> 01:43:59,519
counties and there were certain places

2707
01:43:56,939 --> 01:44:01,559
that are still dry to this day

2708
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:03,060
in Arkansas and you know there's

2709
01:44:01,560 --> 01:44:04,800
Missouri there's some places in the Deep

2710
01:44:03,060 --> 01:44:07,380
South that are still dry counties and

2711
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:11,279
you can't buy alcohol but right now as

2712
01:44:07,380 --> 01:44:13,859
long as there's legal counties not legal

2713
01:44:11,279 --> 01:44:15,779
Counties Legal States not legal states

2714
01:44:13,859 --> 01:44:17,939
it's going to be chaos and they won't be

2715
01:44:15,779 --> 01:44:21,238
able to control it

2716
01:44:17,939 --> 01:44:24,238
yeah they just won't sure I mean look at

2717
01:44:21,238 --> 01:44:26,099
Oklahoma right Oklahoma used to be one

2718
01:44:24,238 --> 01:44:27,839
of the worst places to get caught with

2719
01:44:26,100 --> 01:44:29,159
cannabis in the entire United States you

2720
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:31,139
used to be able to read in High Times

2721
01:44:29,158 --> 01:44:34,379
that people got caught with like 12

2722
01:44:31,139 --> 01:44:36,239
plants and got 50 years yeah right like

2723
01:44:34,380 --> 01:44:37,679
he used to be incredibly severe and then

2724
01:44:36,238 --> 01:44:40,079
they're pretty Republican and so they're

2725
01:44:37,679 --> 01:44:42,239
like okay we're just gonna like make it

2726
01:44:40,079 --> 01:44:45,359
legal and we're gonna have almost no

2727
01:44:42,238 --> 01:44:47,339
government regulation right yeah and

2728
01:44:45,359 --> 01:44:49,079
then they do that for a few years and

2729
01:44:47,340 --> 01:44:52,400
then they realize that like most of the

2730
01:44:49,079 --> 01:44:54,600
grows are cartel or Chinese Nationals

2731
01:44:52,399 --> 01:44:56,939
and they're using and they're using

2732
01:44:54,600 --> 01:44:58,980
Oklahoma as a base to supply all the

2733
01:44:56,939 --> 01:45:00,359
illegal states in the southern part of

2734
01:44:58,979 --> 01:45:03,359
Southeastern part of the United States

2735
01:45:00,359 --> 01:45:06,238
and Texas and they're like what the hell

2736
01:45:03,359 --> 01:45:08,759
yeah there's only four million people

2737
01:45:06,238 --> 01:45:13,638
in Oklahoma

2738
01:45:08,760 --> 01:45:13,639
yeah but they allowed like 3 000 Acres

2739
01:45:13,859 --> 01:45:18,420
the supply like four million people

2740
01:45:17,158 --> 01:45:21,979
yeah

2741
01:45:18,420 --> 01:45:21,980
and then they're shocked at diversion

2742
01:45:22,319 --> 01:45:27,238
what are you gonna do what are you gonna

2743
01:45:24,060 --> 01:45:29,119
do you know so yeah I mean I I think the

2744
01:45:27,238 --> 01:45:32,218
fight right now is the people that care

2745
01:45:29,118 --> 01:45:34,799
are are hurting

2746
01:45:32,219 --> 01:45:36,779
because the game has changed and it's

2747
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:37,980
hard to adapt to change that happens

2748
01:45:36,779 --> 01:45:39,960
really quickly

2749
01:45:37,979 --> 01:45:42,899
and so the parts that Matt and I care

2750
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:43,980
about are you know I mean we're for the

2751
01:45:42,899 --> 01:45:46,259
small guy

2752
01:45:43,979 --> 01:45:48,779
you know we want we want we want as much

2753
01:45:46,260 --> 01:45:50,400
experimentation as possible we want

2754
01:45:48,779 --> 01:45:51,899
people to be able to like you know

2755
01:45:50,399 --> 01:45:53,399
pursue their little dreams or their

2756
01:45:51,899 --> 01:45:55,019
little interests

2757
01:45:53,399 --> 01:45:56,279
and you know if you want to start a

2758
01:45:55,020 --> 01:45:57,659
small company and you want to start a

2759
01:45:56,279 --> 01:46:01,019
small business it shouldn't take

2760
01:45:57,658 --> 01:46:03,479
millions of dollars of outside capital

2761
01:46:01,020 --> 01:46:04,920
yeah just to get a small one up and

2762
01:46:03,479 --> 01:46:07,019
running and going

2763
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:09,239
I didn't I think the first thing that

2764
01:46:07,020 --> 01:46:12,000
really shocked me when I when I talked

2765
01:46:09,238 --> 01:46:14,939
to the very first person that went from

2766
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:18,060
you know traditional Market to Legal was

2767
01:46:14,939 --> 01:46:21,000
how much money it costs just to get the

2768
01:46:18,060 --> 01:46:24,960
equipment for the for the government to

2769
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:26,639
surveil you via metric oh yeah I mean I

2770
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:29,819
was like you have to pay all this money

2771
01:46:26,639 --> 01:46:32,880
just for them to to snitch on there's

2772
01:46:29,819 --> 01:46:35,519
there's farms in Santa Barbara that have

2773
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:37,800
to pay 800 to a million dollars or more

2774
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:40,020
just for their licenses every year yeah

2775
01:46:37,800 --> 01:46:42,539
it's insane just for a 10 000 square

2776
01:46:40,020 --> 01:46:45,060
foot license which is the size of a you

2777
01:46:42,539 --> 01:46:46,979
know basically a football field I go

2778
01:46:45,060 --> 01:46:49,500
back to my Robin Hood comment I mean

2779
01:46:46,979 --> 01:46:51,718
just it it's base logic it's all bad we

2780
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:53,279
know it as at our heart we know we

2781
01:46:51,719 --> 01:46:55,679
shouldn't be getting shut down like that

2782
01:46:53,279 --> 01:46:58,500
you know so honestly what would happen

2783
01:46:55,679 --> 01:47:00,600
is if you want if you what I think would

2784
01:46:58,500 --> 01:47:03,060
happen is that if they actually made a

2785
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:05,039
metric that worked and they drew like a

2786
01:47:03,060 --> 01:47:07,139
big bright line where legal couldn't get

2787
01:47:05,039 --> 01:47:10,439
diverted at all

2788
01:47:07,139 --> 01:47:12,719
I think 80 to 90 I think 80 percent of

2789
01:47:10,439 --> 01:47:14,879
the farms in the state would fail

2790
01:47:12,719 --> 01:47:16,500
yeah and it would be mostly the big

2791
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:18,539
farms

2792
01:47:16,500 --> 01:47:21,300
yeah because they would be unsustainable

2793
01:47:18,539 --> 01:47:23,340
and it would be the small smaller Farms

2794
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:25,020
that are more that are more Nimble that

2795
01:47:23,340 --> 01:47:26,639
are better at growing that could produce

2796
01:47:25,020 --> 01:47:28,739
a better quality product that would

2797
01:47:26,639 --> 01:47:30,600
honestly probably survive

2798
01:47:28,738 --> 01:47:33,419
you know I think that it would be a

2799
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:34,800
couple big farms smushing everybody out

2800
01:47:33,420 --> 01:47:36,719
I actually don't think without

2801
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:39,300
exportation to other states or other

2802
01:47:36,719 --> 01:47:43,079
areas that's actually feasible I think

2803
01:47:39,300 --> 01:47:45,779
most of those things would fail

2804
01:47:43,079 --> 01:47:48,719
you lived you live in an area where

2805
01:47:45,779 --> 01:47:51,479
there is a demand for crafts still

2806
01:47:48,719 --> 01:47:53,939
where there is a quantity of smokers

2807
01:47:51,479 --> 01:47:55,439
that do care about quality and no

2808
01:47:53,939 --> 01:47:58,219
quality in the first place to care about

2809
01:47:55,439 --> 01:48:00,839
quality but if you're in one of these

2810
01:47:58,219 --> 01:48:03,118
many other cities that aren't one of the

2811
01:48:00,840 --> 01:48:04,739
meccas of cannabis and it wasn't like

2812
01:48:03,118 --> 01:48:06,179
that a lot of people have never seen

2813
01:48:04,738 --> 01:48:09,238
quality in the first place to know

2814
01:48:06,179 --> 01:48:11,158
quality oh I get it I wouldn't get it I

2815
01:48:09,238 --> 01:48:13,738
just think that like a small family

2816
01:48:11,158 --> 01:48:15,479
optimistic I'm not I don't think I'm

2817
01:48:13,738 --> 01:48:17,759
optimistic I just think you're

2818
01:48:15,479 --> 01:48:19,799
optimistic I just think that all these

2819
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:22,500
big big farms

2820
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:23,639
are surviving on Fresh investment and

2821
01:48:22,500 --> 01:48:25,800
diversion

2822
01:48:23,639 --> 01:48:28,579
yeah I agree

2823
01:48:25,800 --> 01:48:30,659
because you know like I mean I remember

2824
01:48:28,579 --> 01:48:31,800
I'm not going to call it who it is

2825
01:48:30,658 --> 01:48:33,059
because it's unimportant but I was

2826
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:35,159
Consulting on something and they had

2827
01:48:33,060 --> 01:48:38,280
like a they had a pretty good-sized farm

2828
01:48:35,158 --> 01:48:40,920
down south and one of their sales guys

2829
01:48:38,279 --> 01:48:44,819
came to me all panicked and he was like

2830
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:47,520
Hey I just I just I got all for all the

2831
01:48:44,819 --> 01:48:49,019
legal sales for all the dispensaries and

2832
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:50,280
I was like okay and he's like this is

2833
01:48:49,020 --> 01:48:52,860
really weird and I'm like what's weird

2834
01:48:50,279 --> 01:48:54,000
he's like if we hit the numbers you say

2835
01:48:52,859 --> 01:48:57,299
we can hit

2836
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:59,460
we could Supply 90 percent of the state

2837
01:48:57,300 --> 01:49:02,779
in sales

2838
01:48:59,460 --> 01:49:02,779
he's like where is it all going

2839
01:49:04,979 --> 01:49:10,138
and I was a question you're starting to

2840
01:49:07,198 --> 01:49:13,019
figure it out huh

2841
01:49:10,139 --> 01:49:16,139
you know and so as a result it's like I

2842
01:49:13,020 --> 01:49:18,840
think I think without exportation I

2843
01:49:16,139 --> 01:49:21,539
think all of these huge farms would

2844
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:22,619
implode underneath their own weight

2845
01:49:21,539 --> 01:49:24,840
yeah

2846
01:49:22,618 --> 01:49:27,479
you know I think they would

2847
01:49:24,840 --> 01:49:29,940
and you know the difference between the

2848
01:49:27,479 --> 01:49:31,859
small Family Farms up by me and the the

2849
01:49:29,939 --> 01:49:33,539
big farms down there is the big farms

2850
01:49:31,859 --> 01:49:35,759
down there are all funded by rich people

2851
01:49:33,539 --> 01:49:38,479
that can just divert their money and go

2852
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:38,480
do something else

2853
01:49:39,139 --> 01:49:43,739
and the small farms up in Humboldt Mendo

2854
01:49:42,118 --> 01:49:45,960
in these different spots like the people

2855
01:49:43,738 --> 01:49:47,879
up here have no other choice that's what

2856
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:50,219
I'm saying it's it's there's no there's

2857
01:49:47,880 --> 01:49:51,900
no choice you're already happening it's

2858
01:49:50,219 --> 01:49:54,899
already happened oh it's already

2859
01:49:51,899 --> 01:49:56,698
happening we can't rewind the tape on

2860
01:49:54,899 --> 01:49:58,259
what we've lost in the families and a

2861
01:49:56,698 --> 01:50:02,579
lot of stuff and

2862
01:49:58,260 --> 01:50:04,920
but it also it also boom during 215.

2863
01:50:02,579 --> 01:50:07,559
there was a lot I don't want to call

2864
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:08,819
anybody out again but there was a lot of

2865
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:11,880
rich kids

2866
01:50:08,819 --> 01:50:13,618
that came up here and bought properties

2867
01:50:11,880 --> 01:50:15,840
with their family money

2868
01:50:13,618 --> 01:50:18,299
and then hired one of their buddies to

2869
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:20,760
run it after a year or two and then

2870
01:50:18,300 --> 01:50:23,880
ended up living in Santa Rosa or the bay

2871
01:50:20,760 --> 01:50:26,940
or LA or wherever and just taking a

2872
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:28,920
percentage because they owned the land

2873
01:50:26,939 --> 01:50:31,859
that their parents want them

2874
01:50:28,920 --> 01:50:33,658
yeah you know there was a lot of there

2875
01:50:31,859 --> 01:50:35,219
was a lot of out of town people that

2876
01:50:33,658 --> 01:50:36,719
bought property up here

2877
01:50:35,219 --> 01:50:38,520
you know because it just funded their

2878
01:50:36,719 --> 01:50:40,319
Burning Man lifestyle or funded their

2879
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:41,520
Hawaii or funded their this or that it

2880
01:50:40,319 --> 01:50:43,500
gave them a bunch of free time it's like

2881
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:45,060
imagine you could set up a scene and

2882
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:47,279
you're like okay I'll hire you to run my

2883
01:50:45,060 --> 01:50:50,940
spot but yeah I'm gonna go get these

2884
01:50:47,279 --> 01:50:52,618
neck tattoos while you do all this work

2885
01:50:50,939 --> 01:50:54,419
you're going to do all this work but I

2886
01:50:52,618 --> 01:50:56,219
provide this spot

2887
01:50:54,420 --> 01:50:58,020
you know and you can't afford the spot

2888
01:50:56,219 --> 01:50:59,639
but I can because my parents bought it

2889
01:50:58,020 --> 01:51:00,960
yeah because they have good credit and

2890
01:50:59,639 --> 01:51:03,239
they put down the down payment that's

2891
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:05,158
very typical though you know yeah

2892
01:51:03,238 --> 01:51:06,539
it's very typical people don't want to

2893
01:51:05,158 --> 01:51:08,099
people don't want to admit it but there

2894
01:51:06,539 --> 01:51:10,380
was a bunch of people they're all

2895
01:51:08,100 --> 01:51:12,179
they're all fleeing the county now yeah

2896
01:51:10,380 --> 01:51:14,520
because their business model failed they

2897
01:51:12,179 --> 01:51:16,739
can't give a percentage for nothing

2898
01:51:14,520 --> 01:51:18,179
yeah you know but there was and there

2899
01:51:16,738 --> 01:51:19,919
was a lot of middlemen too that were

2900
01:51:18,179 --> 01:51:21,779
making a lot of money not doing very

2901
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:23,340
much

2902
01:51:21,779 --> 01:51:25,380
but I'm just saying the people that are

2903
01:51:23,340 --> 01:51:26,460
actually willing to like work work their

2904
01:51:25,380 --> 01:51:28,500
spot

2905
01:51:26,460 --> 01:51:30,179
yeah you know

2906
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:32,279
um because I think what would happen is

2907
01:51:30,179 --> 01:51:33,779
is like imagine imagine you have a 40

2908
01:51:32,279 --> 01:51:36,059
Acre Farm

2909
01:51:33,779 --> 01:51:38,039
you know that could be that could be 41

2910
01:51:36,060 --> 01:51:40,980
Acre Farms

2911
01:51:38,039 --> 01:51:43,260
or that could be a 160 10 000 square

2912
01:51:40,979 --> 01:51:45,779
foot Farms

2913
01:51:43,260 --> 01:51:48,360
you see what I'm saying yeah like and

2914
01:51:45,779 --> 01:51:50,219
those little Farms you know it's it's

2915
01:51:48,359 --> 01:51:51,899
just like what do you think better weed

2916
01:51:50,219 --> 01:51:54,800
comes out of a four lighter or a four or

2917
01:51:51,899 --> 01:51:54,799
a 500 lighter

2918
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:01,020
smaller is generally better there's like

2919
01:51:58,319 --> 01:52:02,698
there is like a size at which you're not

2920
01:52:01,020 --> 01:52:05,580
going to be able to get

2921
01:52:02,698 --> 01:52:07,079
um craft anymore nobody wants to agree

2922
01:52:05,579 --> 01:52:09,539
what that size is because everybody

2923
01:52:07,079 --> 01:52:10,679
wants to call whatever project they're

2924
01:52:09,539 --> 01:52:12,359
on Craft

2925
01:52:10,679 --> 01:52:14,340
yeah you know of course

2926
01:52:12,359 --> 01:52:16,380
but let's just face it it's like

2927
01:52:14,340 --> 01:52:18,179
eventually it's too big

2928
01:52:16,380 --> 01:52:20,039
and you're having hired help that aren't

2929
01:52:18,179 --> 01:52:21,118
as good as you care for most of your

2930
01:52:20,039 --> 01:52:23,238
plants

2931
01:52:21,118 --> 01:52:23,238
yeah

2932
01:52:23,579 --> 01:52:27,779
that's the way it works

2933
01:52:25,679 --> 01:52:29,460
you know so I mean I'm not even trying

2934
01:52:27,779 --> 01:52:32,219
to be all that hopeful because it's it's

2935
01:52:29,460 --> 01:52:34,739
a very stressful time and I worry that

2936
01:52:32,219 --> 01:52:38,340
even if like I managed to survive

2937
01:52:34,738 --> 01:52:41,638
or not me or you know various people up

2938
01:52:38,340 --> 01:52:44,639
in my area managed to survive most won't

2939
01:52:41,639 --> 01:52:46,618
I don't know under the current under the

2940
01:52:44,639 --> 01:52:48,420
current situation and then

2941
01:52:46,618 --> 01:52:51,539
and then as a result of that my

2942
01:52:48,420 --> 01:52:54,359
community falls into poverty again

2943
01:52:51,539 --> 01:52:56,698
and with that goes the Legacy strains

2944
01:52:54,359 --> 01:52:59,759
and and that's that's why I said like

2945
01:52:56,698 --> 01:53:03,000
when I saw that article to me like it's

2946
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:05,579
just like you are a year and a half too

2947
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:08,340
late to even be

2948
01:53:05,579 --> 01:53:11,039
I mean granted there are a lot of things

2949
01:53:08,340 --> 01:53:12,600
left that that haven't been lost that

2950
01:53:11,039 --> 01:53:15,600
are in libraries there are still people

2951
01:53:12,600 --> 01:53:19,139
keeping these not everything is lost

2952
01:53:15,600 --> 01:53:21,719
but there are so like if they gave any

2953
01:53:19,139 --> 01:53:23,340
shits about Legacy anything they would

2954
01:53:21,719 --> 01:53:25,439
have been doing this

2955
01:53:23,340 --> 01:53:26,639
from the jump I don't think they

2956
01:53:25,439 --> 01:53:28,859
realized

2957
01:53:26,639 --> 01:53:30,659
and the other part of it too is that

2958
01:53:28,859 --> 01:53:32,880
even if even if they do have all this

2959
01:53:30,658 --> 01:53:35,339
money and even if like these even if

2960
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:37,020
these like various colleges or whatever

2961
01:53:35,340 --> 01:53:39,539
are gonna start doing it does that mean

2962
01:53:37,020 --> 01:53:41,600
that these like small

2963
01:53:39,539 --> 01:53:45,000
you know preservationists or whatever

2964
01:53:41,600 --> 01:53:47,280
are going to like give over their legacy

2965
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:48,600
stuff to these researchers we already

2966
01:53:47,279 --> 01:53:50,579
know what's gonna happen because we saw

2967
01:53:48,600 --> 01:53:53,699
it happen in Thailand is it just is that

2968
01:53:50,579 --> 01:53:55,979
just a way for wealthy people to collect

2969
01:53:53,698 --> 01:53:59,698
all the because the thing is is that

2970
01:53:55,979 --> 01:54:00,678
wealthy people have everything that we

2971
01:53:59,698 --> 01:54:04,138
don't

2972
01:54:00,679 --> 01:54:05,520
except for the knowledge of how to do a

2973
01:54:04,139 --> 01:54:07,440
good job

2974
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:10,020
the the connections within the community

2975
01:54:07,439 --> 01:54:11,219
and the strains and and what's real and

2976
01:54:10,020 --> 01:54:13,739
what's not

2977
01:54:11,219 --> 01:54:15,600
yes they can get all the permits they

2978
01:54:13,738 --> 01:54:17,339
can hire the construction companies they

2979
01:54:15,600 --> 01:54:19,800
can get the lawyers they can get lot

2980
01:54:17,340 --> 01:54:21,719
they can do all that

2981
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:24,060
they just but when it comes to actually

2982
01:54:21,719 --> 01:54:26,100
growing it processing it trimming it

2983
01:54:24,060 --> 01:54:28,139
putting good weed in the bag and then

2984
01:54:26,100 --> 01:54:29,820
knowing what the differences are

2985
01:54:28,139 --> 01:54:31,980
they have no idea

2986
01:54:29,819 --> 01:54:34,559
so in a lot of states that have gone

2987
01:54:31,979 --> 01:54:35,698
legal they want to hire people to teach

2988
01:54:34,560 --> 01:54:38,100
them

2989
01:54:35,698 --> 01:54:41,039
and they want to get the strains

2990
01:54:38,100 --> 01:54:42,860
and then they want to fire them

2991
01:54:41,039 --> 01:54:45,179
yeah

2992
01:54:42,859 --> 01:54:47,099
after they have the strains and after

2993
01:54:45,179 --> 01:54:48,960
they have the Sops and after they have

2994
01:54:47,100 --> 01:54:50,280
the know-how they're like oh I don't

2995
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:52,560
need you anymore

2996
01:54:50,279 --> 01:54:54,238
so my biggest fear with the Legacy study

2997
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:55,500
is you could say oh it's too little too

2998
01:54:54,238 --> 01:54:57,658
late they should have done this a while

2999
01:54:55,500 --> 01:55:00,618
ago but like what does that money go to

3000
01:54:57,658 --> 01:55:02,759
what are they going to study

3001
01:55:00,618 --> 01:55:05,279
we've already seen what what happens

3002
01:55:02,760 --> 01:55:06,900
with this I like to me it's obvious

3003
01:55:05,279 --> 01:55:08,880
what's going on because they just did

3004
01:55:06,899 --> 01:55:11,698
this in the Philippines is it another

3005
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:13,920
philos or Thailand I'm sorry Thailand no

3006
01:55:11,698 --> 01:55:16,559
I mean like over in Thailand they they

3007
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:19,319
have they have a lady there as I

3008
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:22,020
understand it allegedly not very well

3009
01:55:19,319 --> 01:55:24,840
tied in by what she's saying in

3010
01:55:22,020 --> 01:55:26,880
representing his as history of Thai

3011
01:55:24,840 --> 01:55:30,420
strains which are really grown by

3012
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:32,880
laozian communities in Thailand you know

3013
01:55:30,420 --> 01:55:35,940
um they now have like four or five like

3014
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:38,279
land race Legacy strains that you could

3015
01:55:35,939 --> 01:55:40,259
come get and get in Thailand only as you

3016
01:55:38,279 --> 01:55:42,059
know like and they use it like a a

3017
01:55:40,260 --> 01:55:44,699
freaking

3018
01:55:42,060 --> 01:55:46,980
a shopping thing like a marketing Ploy

3019
01:55:44,698 --> 01:55:49,559
and that's what I like we know like in

3020
01:55:46,979 --> 01:55:50,879
my mind in my heart I know where they're

3021
01:55:49,560 --> 01:55:53,159
going with it I should say I shouldn't

3022
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:55,319
say we know I think I know where they're

3023
01:55:53,158 --> 01:55:57,839
going with it

3024
01:55:55,319 --> 01:55:59,880
because we see we see the [ __ ] all the

3025
01:55:57,840 --> 01:56:01,619
time like we saw people go to Oklahoma

3026
01:55:59,880 --> 01:56:04,380
and all the same people going to

3027
01:56:01,618 --> 01:56:06,000
Oklahoma are now in Thailand it's like

3028
01:56:04,380 --> 01:56:08,400
how many

3029
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:10,319
it just everything mimics each other

3030
01:56:08,399 --> 01:56:11,698
they cared about Legacy strains in

3031
01:56:10,319 --> 01:56:13,679
Thailand it was a big deal it made

3032
01:56:11,698 --> 01:56:15,839
international news real international

3033
01:56:13,679 --> 01:56:18,060
news and all of a sudden they want to

3034
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:20,940
fund this thing for legacy strains in

3035
01:56:18,060 --> 01:56:22,560
here people got mad at me about Oklahoma

3036
01:56:20,939 --> 01:56:24,118
or whatever and

3037
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:27,060
um I have some I have some producers

3038
01:56:24,118 --> 01:56:28,859
against it because uh someone I knew

3039
01:56:27,060 --> 01:56:30,840
pretty well got in prison there for a

3040
01:56:28,859 --> 01:56:32,519
very long time in the Grateful Dead era

3041
01:56:30,840 --> 01:56:35,159
for weed

3042
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:36,360
um but you know Matt and I used to joke

3043
01:56:35,158 --> 01:56:38,519
a little bit that like every

3044
01:56:36,359 --> 01:56:41,939
disreputable character in cannabis like

3045
01:56:38,520 --> 01:56:45,960
like fell upon Oklahoma as the great New

3046
01:56:41,939 --> 01:56:47,219
Hope you know yeah yeah and um and

3047
01:56:45,960 --> 01:56:48,779
that's kind of what like what people are

3048
01:56:47,219 --> 01:56:50,520
chasing is they're bouncing around to a

3049
01:56:48,779 --> 01:56:53,158
new state and being like maybe I can get

3050
01:56:50,520 --> 01:56:54,659
three to five years out of it before the

3051
01:56:53,158 --> 01:56:56,819
compression hits and I can make money

3052
01:56:54,658 --> 01:56:58,799
and I can bounce around oh and there's

3053
01:56:56,819 --> 01:57:01,139
opportunity here oh there's opportunity

3054
01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:03,119
there oh there's opportunity over here

3055
01:57:01,139 --> 01:57:04,980
and maybe there's a window where I can

3056
01:57:03,118 --> 01:57:06,839
succeed before

3057
01:57:04,979 --> 01:57:09,718
all these things I know are gonna hit

3058
01:57:06,840 --> 01:57:11,279
hit and then I can bounce to the next

3059
01:57:09,719 --> 01:57:13,139
I just see like

3060
01:57:11,279 --> 01:57:15,118
like this be the opportunity and I'm

3061
01:57:13,139 --> 01:57:16,319
gonna say this specifically as an

3062
01:57:15,118 --> 01:57:17,698
example because it's something that

3063
01:57:16,319 --> 01:57:20,460
couldn't possibly happen because it's

3064
01:57:17,698 --> 01:57:22,559
going on in Canada but like an

3065
01:57:20,460 --> 01:57:24,118
opportunity for someone like uh the bull

3066
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:26,760
rider strain that they really have

3067
01:57:24,118 --> 01:57:29,219
nothing to do with at all and like oh

3068
01:57:26,760 --> 01:57:31,800
this is a legacy strain hey perfect time

3069
01:57:29,219 --> 01:57:33,779
to Market these two bam come get your

3070
01:57:31,800 --> 01:57:35,400
bull rider at the [ __ ] you know like

3071
01:57:33,779 --> 01:57:37,259
and nothing has anything to do with

3072
01:57:35,399 --> 01:57:38,939
anything in the first place and all the

3073
01:57:37,260 --> 01:57:41,360
real Legacy Growers that have this stuff

3074
01:57:38,939 --> 01:57:41,359
are like

3075
01:57:41,899 --> 01:57:46,259
and all the scientists are studying that

3076
01:57:44,460 --> 01:57:47,219
because they're like hey you know and

3077
01:57:46,260 --> 01:57:49,320
they're the ones who wrote the history

3078
01:57:47,219 --> 01:57:51,359
book again we won't name names but like

3079
01:57:49,319 --> 01:57:53,698
some of the same people that like ran

3080

3083

probably going to be the people if

3084
01:58:01,139 --> 01:58:04,079
there's money involved they'll probably

3085
01:58:02,460 --> 01:58:05,219
be the people running towards the end

3086
01:58:04,079 --> 01:58:07,859

prospective uh people that are in those

3099
01:58:29,099 --> 01:58:34,619
positions to be hiring these people if

3100
01:58:31,800 --> 01:58:38,219
you see in these people's past resumes

3101
01:58:34,618 --> 01:58:40,618
like Colorado Thailand like all this

3102
01:58:38,219 --> 01:58:42,960
movement through the Cannabis States as

3103
01:58:40,618 --> 01:58:44,519
they go probably double thinking that's

3104
01:58:42,960 --> 01:58:46,500
that's my best advice I could give you

3105
01:58:44,520 --> 01:58:48,300
just double think it double double do a

3106
01:58:46,500 --> 01:58:50,460
second interview give second interviews

3107
01:58:48,300 --> 01:58:51,719
two interviews for that guy I used to

3108
01:58:50,460 --> 01:58:54,480
have I used to have this like running

3109
01:58:51,719 --> 01:58:57,239
joke with friends that like my

3110
01:58:54,479 --> 01:58:59,459
consultation thing would be yeah that I

3111
01:58:57,238 --> 01:59:01,618
would sit next to people and I would

3112
01:58:59,460 --> 01:59:03,658
listen to the person pitch you

3113
01:59:01,618 --> 01:59:04,920
and then I would talk to them and then I

3114
01:59:03,658 --> 01:59:06,899
would tell you if they were full of [ __ ]

3115
01:59:04,920 --> 01:59:09,480
or not yeah yeah I mean it's a great way

3116
01:59:06,899 --> 01:59:12,539
to be like you you can't tell I can tell

3117
01:59:09,479 --> 01:59:13,859
yeah yeah I'll be able to tell

3118
01:59:12,539 --> 01:59:15,658
you know

3119
01:59:13,859 --> 01:59:17,158
and because it's like one of those

3120
01:59:15,658 --> 01:59:19,500
things like you and I know like you can

3121
01:59:17,158 --> 01:59:21,000
only you can fake the talk to people

3122
01:59:19,500 --> 01:59:22,738
that know nothing

3123
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:24,719
yes

3124
01:59:22,738 --> 01:59:26,218
but you sit down in a room with like me

3125
01:59:24,719 --> 01:59:27,840
or you like not just like I'm not trying

3126
01:59:26,219 --> 01:59:28,920
to put myself on some pedestal but I'm

3127
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:31,560
just saying you sit down with someone

3128
01:59:28,920 --> 01:59:33,480
that's been uh in weed for their entire

3129
01:59:31,560 --> 01:59:35,219
life and in these various circles and in

3130
01:59:33,479 --> 01:59:38,098
these various groups and knows a lot

3131
01:59:35,219 --> 01:59:41,340
yeah you can either talk the talk or you

3132
01:59:38,099 --> 01:59:43,739
can't yeah and and the thing that again

3133
01:59:41,340 --> 01:59:47,719
I I emphasize this almost on every

3134
01:59:43,738 --> 01:59:51,479
episode like it it used to be more

3135
01:59:47,719 --> 01:59:52,920
clear to everyone that these people that

3136
01:59:51,479 --> 01:59:54,779
would sell these people on these ideas

3137
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:57,300
that they hey I've got this rare rare

3138
01:59:54,779 --> 01:59:59,819
cut it was really easy to then for a

3139
01:59:57,300 --> 02:00:01,619
person to go hey there's x amount of

3140
01:59:59,819 --> 02:00:03,599
people with this cut is this does this

3141
02:00:01,618 --> 02:00:06,179
guy have this cut he doesn't okay he's a

3142
02:00:03,599 --> 02:00:08,159
liar let's boot him out it's very hard

3143
02:00:06,179 --> 02:00:09,779
to do that and for some reason like I

3144
02:00:08,158 --> 02:00:11,579
said the disconnects gotten further and

3145
02:00:09,779 --> 02:00:14,219
further and further and we need to try

3146
02:00:11,579 --> 02:00:15,960
to seal that up somehow and hopefully

3147
02:00:14,219 --> 02:00:18,060
it's one of those things where it's one

3148
02:00:15,960 --> 02:00:19,198
of those things where like if you in the

3149
02:00:18,060 --> 02:00:21,179
normal world

3150
02:00:19,198 --> 02:00:23,219
let's say that like you want to hire an

3151
02:00:21,179 --> 02:00:24,840
accountant you can go look at their

3152
02:00:23,219 --> 02:00:27,599
resume and you can see that they went to

3153
02:00:24,840 --> 02:00:30,060
school for this they got accredited by

3154
02:00:27,599 --> 02:00:32,520
that they passed this test or this board

3155
02:00:30,060 --> 02:00:34,199
they're actually like a bonded or

3156
02:00:32,520 --> 02:00:36,060
licensed they think about like even

3157
02:00:34,198 --> 02:00:39,000
being a contractor

3158
02:00:36,060 --> 02:00:40,800
with a Contractor License yeah you know

3159
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:43,800
and a bond where like they have

3160
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:45,960
insurance in case they mess up your your

3161
02:00:43,800 --> 02:00:48,900
house or something right there's nothing

3162
02:00:45,960 --> 02:00:51,118
there's nothing like that trade style or

3163
02:00:48,899 --> 02:00:52,799
accreditation style yet with candidates

3164
02:00:51,118 --> 02:00:54,779
because we all come out of the Shadows

3165
02:00:52,800 --> 02:00:57,480
yeah I mean you bring your Syndicate one

3166
02:00:54,779 --> 02:01:00,840
boom so everybody everybody can just be

3167
02:00:57,479 --> 02:01:02,098
like I I'm good at talking and Faking It

3168
02:01:00,840 --> 02:01:04,860
yeah

3169
02:01:02,099 --> 02:01:07,739
no for real that yeah that's how it goes

3170
02:01:04,859 --> 02:01:09,000
you know and a lot of the times when

3171
02:01:07,738 --> 02:01:10,799
I've been you know when I've tried to

3172
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:12,479
consult for people one of the most

3173
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:13,860
frustrating things is you give them good

3174
02:01:12,479 --> 02:01:16,919
advice and they don't want to listen to

3175
02:01:13,859 --> 02:01:19,198
it no I mean yeah or they yeah or they

3176
02:01:16,920 --> 02:01:21,060
don't know who to listen to or they're

3177
02:01:19,198 --> 02:01:23,279
getting conflicting advice

3178
02:01:21,060 --> 02:01:24,480
and they don't have the intelligence not

3179
02:01:23,279 --> 02:01:26,519
the intelligence that's the wrong one

3180
02:01:24,479 --> 02:01:29,638
they don't have the knowledge of the

3181
02:01:26,520 --> 02:01:31,500
scene they're in yeah to know which

3182
02:01:29,639 --> 02:01:33,779
advice is better

3183
02:01:31,500 --> 02:01:35,219
yeah and cannabis is super hard to do

3184
02:01:33,779 --> 02:01:36,779
research in yeah I almost said

3185
02:01:35,219 --> 02:01:38,039
intelligence but intelligence isn't the

3186
02:01:36,779 --> 02:01:40,019
right word because they could be super

3187
02:01:38,039 --> 02:01:42,300
intelligent and knowledgeable about

3188
02:01:40,020 --> 02:01:44,880
other areas yeah exactly they're just

3189
02:01:42,300 --> 02:01:46,440
they're just ignorant about wheat and

3190
02:01:44,880 --> 02:01:48,659
that ignorance get used against them

3191
02:01:46,439 --> 02:01:51,779
because then it it goes into like well

3192
02:01:48,658 --> 02:01:54,658
who sounds good yeah

3193
02:01:51,779 --> 02:01:56,039
you know who puts himself forward the

3194
02:01:54,658 --> 02:01:57,899
most who raises their hands and lives

3195
02:01:56,039 --> 02:01:59,939
and has the best marketing you know what

3196
02:01:57,899 --> 02:02:01,738
I mean who has it you know most of the

3197
02:01:59,939 --> 02:02:04,979
people that ran towards the money first

3198
02:02:01,738 --> 02:02:06,359
in 2018 2019 they were like we want to

3199
02:02:04,979 --> 02:02:10,439
get rich

3200
02:02:06,359 --> 02:02:11,880
we're gonna go sell our story yeah and a

3201
02:02:10,439 --> 02:02:14,339
lot of those people ended up bouncing

3202
02:02:11,880 --> 02:02:16,139
around because it ends up they they sell

3203
02:02:14,340 --> 02:02:18,179
their story but then a year year and a

3204
02:02:16,139 --> 02:02:20,219
half two years into it they get fired

3205
02:02:18,179 --> 02:02:22,079
because they weren't able to deliver

3206
02:02:20,219 --> 02:02:23,939
I mean I've seen projects that are on

3207
02:02:22,079 --> 02:02:24,840
like their Fifth Management Group in six

3208
02:02:23,939 --> 02:02:27,299
years

3209
02:02:24,840 --> 02:02:28,619
that's so wild because and that's like

3210
02:02:27,300 --> 02:02:31,020
they fire people because they they're

3211
02:02:28,618 --> 02:02:32,519
like oh this these people aren't it yeah

3212
02:02:31,020 --> 02:02:33,960
and then they hire more people that

3213
02:02:32,520 --> 02:02:37,199
aren't it because they don't have a

3214
02:02:33,960 --> 02:02:39,719
framework for how to for how to tell

3215
02:02:37,198 --> 02:02:40,859
yeah okay um yeah so that's that's it
