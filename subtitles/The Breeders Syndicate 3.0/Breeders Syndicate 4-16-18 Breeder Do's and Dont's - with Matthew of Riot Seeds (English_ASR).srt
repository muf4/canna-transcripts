me get back to this real quick yeah yeah

165
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:10,450
just shut your mouth you know when an

166
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:12,400
old school breeder comes up that that's

167
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:15,879
your chance man that's your chance to

168
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:17,649
like get that get that power up like on

169
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:19,120
Super Mario Brothers you know yeah it's

170
00:08:17,649 --> 00:08:21,729
your chance to absorb it like a sponge

171
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,050
take that take that chance man listen to

172
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:24,460
what they have to say there's a lot of

173
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:30,930
guys who have a lot of amazing [ __ ] to

174
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:36,579
say let's see what you got

175
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:38,168
breeding number two number two I did

176
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:43,599
tell you Nick not to use protection

177
00:08:38,168 --> 00:08:47,049
I'm sorry breeding is a [ __ ] science

178
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:49,450
there is an actual science to this there

179
00:08:47,049 --> 00:08:51,699
are [ __ ] terms that have actual

180
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:54,070
definitions don't be one of those people

181
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:58,810
who uses the term IBL and not know what

182
00:08:54,070 --> 00:09:01,330
the [ __ ] IBL is right no F ones no F

183
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:03,309
two years no backcrosses know that in

184
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:05,320
crosses are a thing but no the

185
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:07,539
appropriate time to use them this is

186
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,310
there's a science to this and believe it

187
00:09:07,539 --> 00:09:11,589
or not there are other things besides

188
00:09:09,309 --> 00:09:14,289
weed that people grow that they've been

189
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:16,660
growing for a long time that also have

190
00:09:14,289 --> 00:09:19,419
breeding terms associated with it as

191
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:22,929
well and that's where we have somewhat

192
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:23,889
borrowed and we have changed some of the

193
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:26,439
breeding terms because some of those

194
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:28,600
don't apply to cannabis but but

195
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:31,240
definitely understand all those inside

196
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,980
out if you need if you want a good place

197
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,730
to start don't start with the [ __ ]

198
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,190
forum don't

199
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:38,079
start with reading what some

200
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:42,699
[ __ ] breeder like Melvin says

201
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:45,039
or or whoever you know I mean mostly if

202
00:09:42,698 --> 00:09:47,049
people are using IBL in their lines and

203
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:49,599
it's not CSI humboldt it's not me it's

204
00:09:47,049 --> 00:09:52,169
not professor p chances are they don't

205
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,250
know what a [ __ ] IPL is guaranteed

206
00:09:52,169 --> 00:09:56,289
don't slap that on the end of your

207
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,839
[ __ ] [ __ ] if you're a new breeder you

208
00:09:56,289 --> 00:10:01,448
don't know what it means learn how to

209
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:03,010
write and I actually did this earlier oh

210
00:10:01,448 --> 00:10:05,049
the book list

211
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:06,610
Robert Colonel Clark marijuana botany

212
00:10:05,049 --> 00:10:08,109
that's all you ever need to know as far

213
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:10,509
as books you really don't need more than

214
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:12,759
that DJ shorts book I can't read the

215
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:15,698
title it's good for learning about

216
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:17,350
specific Mexican lines but I mean other

217
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,729
than that when it comes to straight

218
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:22,620
breeding you don't need more than Rob

219
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:27,789
Robert colonel Clark's marijuana botany

220
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:34,509
learn how to write cannabis genetic

221
00:10:27,789 --> 00:10:38,980
nomenclature female X male female X

222
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:41,259
female parentheses reversed that use

223
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:43,120
your brackets brackets are your friends

224
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:44,588
parentheses are your friends there's a

225
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,360
reason that those are there people don't

226
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:48,579
just throw those in there to make it

227
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,709
look pretty and more established use

228
00:10:48,578 --> 00:10:53,138
them correctly it makes you look more

229
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:56,518
intelligent and it genuinely get you

230
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:59,079
respect from your peers better alright

231
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:02,620
breeding has a purpose part three

232
00:10:59,078 --> 00:11:06,669
breeding has a [ __ ] purpose if you

233
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:09,068
are crossing two things just to see what

234
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:10,360
happens and you don't really know what's

235
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:11,139
gonna happen because you've never grown

236
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,870
those lines before

237
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:16,568
that's not breeding that seed making now

238
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:18,610
with that said it's possible to be a

239
00:11:16,568 --> 00:11:20,919
seed maker in a breeder and in fact it's

240
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:23,079
advisable to do both because people need

241
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:24,309
that new shiny [ __ ] thing and it's

242
00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:26,379
hard to stay relevant in the cannabis

243
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:28,659
community if you are not doing both and

244
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:30,370
that's just a fact I mean it really is

245
00:11:28,659 --> 00:11:33,309
if you're not constantly pushing out new

246
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:35,318
lines it's hard to stay relevant so push

247
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:37,000
out new lines do your thing but work

248
00:11:35,318 --> 00:11:38,620
some lines in the background get to know

249
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,948
get to know what it's like to watch

250
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:47,019
plants evolve let's see what else we got

251
00:11:41,948 --> 00:11:47,919
here but yeah yeah a breed with the

252
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:49,990
purpose

253
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:56,019
say this is my Engel I want something

254
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:57,789
that is say I want it short with [ __ ]

255
00:11:56,019 --> 00:12:00,850
dense structure but I don't want to deal

256
00:11:57,789 --> 00:12:03,188
with PM and maybe some purple would be

257
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:04,808
nice then look in your toolbox see what

258
00:12:03,188 --> 00:12:06,370
you have to create that make that [ __ ]

259
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:09,669
happen sometimes it'll take several

260
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:11,169
generations but when you do that you'll

261
00:12:09,669 --> 00:12:14,378
have some true braiding lines in the end

262
00:12:11,169 --> 00:12:15,969
and that's that's the most valuable then

263
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:19,209
you can have in your tool kit as far as

264
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:24,370
a breeder goes let's see what else we

265
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:25,748
got now we're at permissions it's

266
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:32,379
probably the question I get asked about

267
00:12:25,749 --> 00:12:35,860
the most permissions the number one

268
00:12:32,379 --> 00:12:38,528
determiner and all this stuff is did you

269
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:41,259
pay for the seeds okay that's something

270
00:12:38,528 --> 00:12:44,078
you need to take into account when

271
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:46,720
thinking about all this stuff short

272
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:49,659
stout and sticky mucky [ __ ] it's

273
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,249
true it's true it is true I have like

274
00:12:49,659 --> 00:12:55,139
pig pen I have a little cloud when I

275
00:12:51,249 --> 00:12:57,639
walk around if you paid for the seeds

276
00:12:55,139 --> 00:13:00,278
different rules apply I mean if you are

277
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:02,139
a tester you definitely need me to ask

278
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:04,360
me to ask permission from that breeder

279
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:06,039
and it needs to be clear before you use

280
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,509
those seeds if you didn't pay for those

281
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:11,250
they're a gift or whatever ask

282
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:14,110
permission if you paid for them

283
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:16,568
realistically you should be able to do

284
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:18,459
what you want except for direct copying

285
00:13:16,568 --> 00:13:19,708
that's not okay in any industry why

286
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:24,000
should it be okay in this industry

287
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:27,909
breeding is an art and if someone is

288
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,438
taking your art changing the name on it

289
00:13:27,909 --> 00:13:31,509
like wiping off your name writing their

290
00:13:29,438 --> 00:13:34,120
name on it and signing it with a new

291
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:37,949
name hey that's that's [ __ ] right

292
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:41,769
that's [ __ ] that doesn't fly anywhere

293
00:13:37,948 --> 00:13:43,659
so but if you're making it f1 hybrid

294
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:46,990
let's say and you're using two different

295
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:49,208
readers work if you paid for those seeds

296
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:53,620
you really don't necessarily have to ask

297
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:55,899
them for their work but you should you

298
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:59,169
should its proper it's polite you'll get

299
00:13:55,899 --> 00:14:00,610
more respect from those people whose

300
00:13:59,169 --> 00:14:01,299
work you're using you'll definitely get

301
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:03,190
more respect

302
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:05,829
name-check those [ __ ] later you

303
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:07,420
know shout out some props to them that's

304
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:08,980
the way it's done man that's that's the

305
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:10,509
way you get respect from everyone your

306
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:12,580
elders and everyone that came before you

307
00:14:10,509 --> 00:14:16,120
you got to pay your dues you have to pay

308
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:18,160
your dues however if you ask and they

309
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,419
say no and you bought those and

310
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:23,588
[ __ ] and you're not doing a

311
00:14:19,419 --> 00:14:25,539
direct copy it's up to you it depends on

312
00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:28,800
how much you want some some breeders get

313
00:14:25,539 --> 00:14:31,208
more upset about that than others right

314
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:34,929
as far as the make your own mail thing

315
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:39,838
that's that's nice and dandy but again

316
00:14:34,929 --> 00:14:42,009
not it's not an obligation to do that

317
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,660
you're still trying to get bodis

318
00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:46,299
permission buddy I don't think Bodie

319
00:14:43,659 --> 00:14:48,399
cares so much man he's one of the most

320
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:52,958
open breeders there are as far as people

321
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:58,509
working with this stuff when I say

322
00:14:52,958 --> 00:15:04,569
direct copy I mean s 1 or F Gen let's

323
00:14:58,509 --> 00:15:06,370
see when is it okay to F gen and if you

324
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:09,700
if you don't understand what GN is refer

325
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:12,480
back to rule 2 and get the book Robert

326
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,480
clown hood Clark

327
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:19,360
Robert Connell Clark marijuana botany

328
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:22,149
that'll help you learn those terms when

329
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,870
is it okay to f gen if a company is no

330
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:28,480
longer around if a company is no longer

331
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:30,429
around and they and there's no

332
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,539
foreseeable future for them coming back

333
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:37,028
around it usually is okay

334
00:15:34,539 --> 00:15:38,500
especially when a line is really hard to

335
00:15:37,028 --> 00:15:40,240
find and there's a lot of people that

336
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,100
want it in their collection and there's

337
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,110
a chance to like to be lost then it's

338
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,820
not just okay it's really advisable to

339
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:47,980
do that we don't want to start losing

340
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,670
lines because that's all so many been

341
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,100
lost already

342
00:15:48,669 --> 00:15:52,870
because of stuff like that in the case

343
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:59,589
of let's let's let's choose the brothers

344
00:15:52,870 --> 00:16:01,269
grin Graham situation they left there

345
00:15:59,589 --> 00:16:05,230
was no foreseeable future of them coming

346
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:07,659
back a lot of people made c99 F gens you

347
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:09,250
know Apollo 11 F gens Apollo 13 that

348
00:16:07,659 --> 00:16:10,569
made sense a lot of those lines were

349
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:14,320
hard to get even back then they were

350
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:15,040
expensive and and a lot of people did

351
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,769
what they could

352
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:19,120
save those lines if it's from key plane

353
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,350
you want to use it shoot yourself

354
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,339
because you should be using [ __ ]

355
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:26,170
[ __ ] from that idiot but that's when

356
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:28,209
it's okay to F Jim without permission

357
00:16:26,169 --> 00:16:30,639
some of those guys aren't even around to

358
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:33,250
ask permission for or in the case of a

359
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,528
clone only where the breeder is not

360
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:37,028
determined you can in you need to do

361
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:38,740
your due diligence to make sure that the

362
00:16:37,028 --> 00:16:41,379
breeders not determined but there's some

363
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:45,659
pretty obvious candidates out there that

364
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:45,659
nobody knows who bred it bagsied etc

365
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:53,560
rule five respect man respect and and

366
00:16:50,789 --> 00:16:55,389
don't give respect where they haven't

367
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:56,559
earned it because there's a lot of

368
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,789
[ __ ] they have an earned

369
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:00,458
respect that have been around a while

370
00:16:57,789 --> 00:17:03,818
doesn't mean they have have respect a

371
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:05,980
lot of these guys have respect respect

372
00:17:03,818 --> 00:17:07,899
from customers and not even to their own

373
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:09,699
customers respect from people buying

374
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,110
seeds because they're on the attitude or

375
00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:13,689
whatever seed bank and they're getting

376
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:15,399
hype but they don't have the respect of

377
00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:17,110
their peers what you want your ultimate

378
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,169
goal if you really want to be a breeder

379
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:21,668
is the respect of your [ __ ] peers do

380
00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:23,169
you have the respect of your peers do

381
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:25,179
you do the people that you interact with

382
00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:30,730
do the people that you respect respect

383
00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:32,798
to you that's major man that's major the

384
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:34,179
six this is probably one of the most

385
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:37,418
important and I should have probably

386
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:40,750
listed as number one come with thick

387
00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:43,120
[ __ ] skin you're not gonna make it if

388
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:45,819
you get your feelings hurt I'm telling

389
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:47,918
you what it's really really hard to make

390
00:17:45,819 --> 00:17:51,009
it in this industry it's even more

391
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,809
cutthroat than it used to be people say

392
00:17:51,009 --> 00:17:54,369
[ __ ] about you and if they have enough

393
00:17:52,808 --> 00:17:55,720
[ __ ] people listening to them those

394
00:17:54,369 --> 00:17:57,969
people will say [ __ ] about you they'll

395
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:01,029
post it everywhere a lot of these guys

396
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:02,950
have all the time on their hand to do

397
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:07,869
this [ __ ] man and you know lots of

398
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:10,179
retirees or disabled people or or not

399
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:11,379
necessary disabled people but people on

400
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:14,140
workman's comp or whatever they have

401
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:17,049
time to do this [ __ ] and they will

402
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:19,270
[ __ ] try to crush you people don't

403
00:18:17,048 --> 00:18:21,158
like competition people do not like

404
00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:24,970
competition and they will try to bring

405
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:26,860
you so get some thick [ __ ] skin you

406
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:28,390
know I when I came to this I thought I

407
00:18:26,859 --> 00:18:28,759
had thick [ __ ] skin but there was

408
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,680
there

409
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:33,170
years where I was [ __ ] completely

410
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,490
doubting everything that I did and I

411
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:37,580
shouldn't have ever let anybody had that

412
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:42,890
effect on me but it's hard man it's hard

413
00:18:37,579 --> 00:18:44,089
so when you get trolled once you start

414
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:48,290
getting the following and you get

415
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:48,709
trolled take it as a compliment for

416
00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:50,750
reals

417
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:52,009
take it as a compliment hey that means

418
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:55,940
you're doing something that's that's

419
00:18:52,009 --> 00:18:56,869
stirring people's emotions I mean if

420
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,920
you're being a [ __ ] and you're

421
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:59,929
getting trolled that's a different thing

422
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,310
but for the most part if you're if

423
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:03,350
you're doing some good [ __ ] for people

424
00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:05,569
and people are liking it and you're

425
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:07,819
still getting trolled take it as a

426
00:19:05,569 --> 00:19:10,279
compliment a lot of these guys that do

427
00:19:07,819 --> 00:19:12,799
troll people just want you to recognize

428
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:15,950
them they just want your attention be it

429
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,779
negative or positive kind of like little

430
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:19,400
[ __ ] kids like how they just they'll

431
00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:24,680
like slap you to get your attention go

432
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:28,009
you know kind of like that yeah that's

433
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:29,450
what I got for the the rules in general

434
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:32,779
is there anything anybody has any

435
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:42,200
questions about my paper one put my bit

436
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:43,970
Bop um I mean jaws did a great job of

437
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,319
making himself you know popular off

438
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:47,839
trolling me and that was only because I

439
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:49,369
responded to his [ __ ] so there's a time

440
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:52,849
and place to respond and sometimes I

441
00:19:49,369 --> 00:19:55,669
suck it at just not I sometimes I do

442
00:19:52,849 --> 00:19:59,079
respond too much and I've been trying to

443
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:59,080
way that reaction better

444
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:06,049
what's wrong with cookie mean I haven't

445
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:11,380
figured that out man and figured that

446
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:17,690
out what are the unwritten rules now

447
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:20,180
give Matt everything for free be it

448
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:22,100
lights be it nutrients just give me [ __ ]

449
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:28,580
you know just give me free [ __ ] I like

450
00:20:22,099 --> 00:20:32,689
free [ __ ] what's up Jax what's the best

451
00:20:28,579 --> 00:20:34,220
way to collect money for seeds I can't

452
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:36,710
go into detail on that since that's an

453
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:40,730
illegality you know and I don't want to

454
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:42,529
set myself up but there's ways to do it

455
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:44,569
I don't recommend paper

456
00:20:42,529 --> 00:20:46,460
PayPal is [ __ ] terrible and they like

457
00:20:44,569 --> 00:20:50,119
to steal your money on a morale clause

458
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:52,579
so I don't recommend that do reversals

459
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:53,928
cause more harm snow only if an idiots

460
00:20:52,579 --> 00:20:57,918
doing a traversal and they haven't

461
00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:59,690
properly assessed their lines what was

462
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,700
your question Jax I saw something pop up

463
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:03,798
but every time I pop from here to

464
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:05,808
somewhere else like it turns off my

465
00:21:03,798 --> 00:21:08,960
screen so I couldn't answer I saw

466
00:21:05,808 --> 00:21:16,190
something about God's gift and something

467
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:20,480
else what do you consider strange built

468
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:21,890
off height not good breeding and no I

469
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,788
mean they're there strains that

470
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:27,288
absolutely deserve the hype you know and

471
00:21:25,788 --> 00:21:29,720
that are good breeding but there's

472
00:21:27,288 --> 00:21:31,339
plenty of it aren't ya

473
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,829
send out tons of free gear that's a gif

474
00:21:31,339 --> 00:21:34,250
you would like you all right guys let's

475
00:21:33,829 --> 00:21:35,720
help

476
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:38,359
let's help my friend Jacqueline decide

477
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,788
fire OG or lemon meringue or God's gift

478
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:44,199
I'm gonna say no on the gods gift

479
00:21:40,788 --> 00:21:50,779
I don't know much about lemon meringue

480
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:52,190
other people well I take that back

481
00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:54,889
that's right you never smoke but you

482
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:56,390
want to try go for something light go

483
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:59,270
for God's gift go for something light

484
00:21:56,390 --> 00:22:01,370
and when I say take a little tiny hit at

485
00:21:59,269 --> 00:22:04,190
a time wait ten minutes taking out a

486
00:22:01,369 --> 00:22:06,048
little tiny hit and being serious it's

487
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:11,058
not like when we were young and smoking

488
00:22:06,048 --> 00:22:13,429
pot it's nothing like it it's called

489
00:22:11,058 --> 00:22:15,158
micro dosing and and it works great with

490
00:22:13,429 --> 00:22:19,220
cannabis when you don't have a tolerance

491
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:21,950
so go for something light yeah fire OG

492
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:24,259
will [ __ ] her up oh [ __ ] her day up if

493
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:28,759
it's grown well so yeah definitely go

494
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:33,069
for something light okay I'll be around

495
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:35,629
I got ya let me know how it goes

496
00:22:33,069 --> 00:22:37,460
do you think if someone finds a cut in

497
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:39,140
someone else's seeds or bad seed that

498
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:41,630
passes it around do you think the person

499
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:43,549
that found it should say what is done

500
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:45,530
with it let's see I think that's one fun

501
00:22:43,548 --> 00:22:46,940
to cut someone else's seeds or bag so he

502
00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:49,038
passes around do you think the person

503
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:52,960
that found it should say what is done

504
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:55,180
with it that's a good question man um I

505
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,009
mean I think

506
00:22:55,180 --> 00:23:03,910
I think both people should have a say

507
00:22:57,009 --> 00:23:06,129
but that doesn't always happen exactly

508
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:08,680
man I remember when I quit smoking for

509
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:11,350
two years I was dating a [ __ ] [ __ ]

510
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,610
and she didn't want me smoking despite

511
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:15,699
what I do for a living

512
00:23:12,609 --> 00:23:17,679
so I've played in and I'm not referring

513
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:23,380
about to Britain in any way by the way

514
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:25,750
brings great but yeah I mean the first

515
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:28,090
time smoking again it's just like that

516
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:29,890
first high and some shit's too much man

517
00:23:28,089 --> 00:23:32,019
have you curled up in the corner and a

518
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:35,500
little ball crying that's no fun and

519
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:36,819
that's no fun at all have you ever made

520
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:40,119
something so dank you didn't want to

521
00:23:36,819 --> 00:23:41,409
release it no um I want people to have

522
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:43,919
good we don't when I have the best weed

523
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:46,090
out there of course I'll release it

524
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:48,070
there were times where I wouldn't

525
00:23:46,089 --> 00:23:51,579
release cuts of stuff but I would

526
00:23:48,069 --> 00:23:55,059
release weed of it and clockwork being

527
00:23:51,579 --> 00:23:56,169
the main one with that and it was just

528
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:58,450
because I didn't want us to get ripped

529
00:23:56,170 --> 00:24:01,570
off but eventually that's gonna happen

530
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:03,160
anyways if it's good enough if your weed

531
00:24:01,569 --> 00:24:06,189
is good enough it will get ripped off

532
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:08,110
and that's part of the process but you

533
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:09,519
the thing I just tell myself is these

534
00:24:08,109 --> 00:24:11,079
guys are still gonna be working with my

535
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:11,740
tailings they're always a few years

536
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:15,129
behind me

537
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:19,450
so whatever mmm God's gift storing God's

538
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:21,670
gift was it GDP and oh gee I think GDP

539
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:23,980
oh gee isn't that God's gift

540
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:25,870
most God's gift cuts like the Sonoma

541
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:27,789
God's gift cut out there that's the

542
00:24:25,869 --> 00:24:32,559
original was the Sonoma God's gift and

543
00:24:27,789 --> 00:24:34,509
it was kind of leafy and very non long

544
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:39,899
narrow leaves it wasn't very frosty not

545
00:24:34,509 --> 00:24:39,900
very great but for its time it was okay

546
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:51,850
best strain for consistent piney chirps

547
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:54,399
don't know I'm not big on the pines how

548
00:24:51,849 --> 00:24:56,649
do I get some seeds to you if you would

549
00:24:54,400 --> 00:25:02,850
ever like something I need to get a peel

550
00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:04,930
box I really do but just DM me man DM me

551
00:25:02,849 --> 00:25:06,669
what if you make a known strain with

552
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:09,549
different source to parents what do you

553
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:12,160
mean if you recreate a strain with

554
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:15,279
different parents like let's say it's

555
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:18,370
fire og cross two abusive og let's say

556
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:20,740
and you use those same two cuts to make

557
00:25:18,369 --> 00:25:21,849
the line that's yours man you do

558
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:23,589
whatever the [ __ ] you want with it

559
00:25:21,849 --> 00:25:24,969
there there's different ways to paint

560
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:27,759
the same picture you know what I mean

561
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:29,289
and not and once the strains are

562
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:31,150
acclimated to your room what you make is

563
00:25:29,289 --> 00:25:33,250
going to be different than what is

564
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:35,800
presented especially when it comes to

565
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:37,660
selection you know what I mean if you do

566
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:39,549
a selection from that specific cross

567
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:43,330
it'll be different than the selection

568
00:25:39,549 --> 00:25:45,129
that's available as a clone only there

569
00:25:43,329 --> 00:25:48,429
you go snow cap four pint herbs I don't

570
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:50,380
know much about snow cat did you like

571
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:54,660
that I rock you just mad because your

572
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:54,660
face is longer than the [ __ ] donkeys

573
00:25:56,099 --> 00:26:00,009
bodis one of my good friends I recommend

574
00:25:58,509 --> 00:26:02,950
everything that he does the guy's a

575
00:26:00,009 --> 00:26:05,529
[ __ ] magician he is the Wizard of

576
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:08,049
weed so you're in good hands with

577
00:26:05,529 --> 00:26:09,609
anything from the guy man just look at

578
00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:11,980
the description see if it appeals to you

579
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:13,959
and try it and and in if it works for

580
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:18,640
you that's great if not move to the next

581
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:20,799
that's what groans do we adapt is p90 1

582
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,910
classed as a skunk p90 1 it would be

583
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:27,700
class more as an Afghani Thai hybrid

584
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:29,830
Williams wonder frost - I think no hold

585
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:33,640
on what was that it was it was it was

586
00:26:29,829 --> 00:26:35,829
silver-backed I crossed you I always

587
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:38,009
forget the other part well I'll have to

588
00:26:35,829 --> 00:26:38,009
look

589
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:45,490
have you found any skunky ones in the

590
00:26:43,298 --> 00:26:47,859
green suicide absolutely and all of that

591
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:52,150
and anything I use the the roadkill

592
00:26:47,859 --> 00:26:54,548
Afghani mail with you're gonna find some

593
00:26:52,150 --> 00:27:00,670
skunky phenotypes in it it's very very

594
00:26:54,548 --> 00:27:03,009
heavy with skunky phenotypes Bodie is an

595
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:04,509
amazing dude I I can't say that about a

596
00:27:03,009 --> 00:27:08,289
lot of people but I can absolutely say

597
00:27:04,509 --> 00:27:10,089
that about him he is he's when my

598
00:27:08,289 --> 00:27:12,069
company almost crashed when I got a

599
00:27:10,089 --> 00:27:14,230
really [ __ ] up disease from the

600
00:27:12,069 --> 00:27:16,750
Philippines a plant disease but he made

601
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:18,759
sure that my business did not crash and

602
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:20,950
I could never say anything bad about the

603
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:24,058
guy because of that and not only because

604
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:26,230
that he is at his base a good person

605
00:27:24,058 --> 00:27:28,269
what's my favorite strain I have a lot

606
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:33,058
of favorite strains it just depends on

607
00:27:28,269 --> 00:27:33,058
the time the day my mood etc

608
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,419
bodis one of my favorite human beings

609
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:47,250
not just breeder but one of my favorite

610
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:49,230
human beings on this earth what to

611
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:52,019
expect from platinum alien orange

612
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:57,319
cookies did you are you familiar with

613
00:27:52,019 --> 00:27:59,700
the the the orange cookies from obsolete

614
00:27:57,319 --> 00:28:08,399
I'm a I'm a grower not a shower

615
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:10,279
definitely not a short grower alien

616
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:14,730
orange cookies are you familiar with it

617
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:17,190
the orange cookies there's an astringent

618
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:19,860
phenotype in the line that is crazy

619
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:21,779
frosty really dense and it's it's the

620
00:28:19,859 --> 00:28:23,969
the one phenotype I found that didn't

621
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:26,009
[ __ ] her tell Loompa to come on right

622
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:29,519
now while we still have some time - oh

623
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:30,298
man to get on I'd love to have him on

624
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:37,619
anytime

625
00:28:30,298 --> 00:28:39,599
I love the looms bring them on but it

626
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:41,099
has like an astringent like almost it's

627
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:42,359
not even really that orange the

628
00:28:41,099 --> 00:28:44,819
phenotype that I picked it's very

629
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:48,959
astringent very [ __ ] frosty very

630
00:28:44,819 --> 00:28:51,058
dense and it breeds very well that mixed

631
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,890
with my platen of an animal that passes

632
00:28:51,058 --> 00:28:55,529
over banana Terps like artificial banana

633
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:59,788
Terps you'll find everything in there

634
00:28:55,529 --> 00:29:01,798
and in between if I could recommend one

635
00:28:59,788 --> 00:29:03,269
of my strange to pop a pack what would

636
00:29:01,798 --> 00:29:06,569
it be it depends on the person's grower

637
00:29:03,269 --> 00:29:08,849
level orange cookies was full of [ __ ]

638
00:29:06,569 --> 00:29:10,980
Herms it took a long time to find a

639
00:29:08,849 --> 00:29:11,519
single cut that didn't pass on her

640
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:15,750
traits

641
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:19,470
it was [ __ ] really hard to find it

642
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:20,159
made it worth it to spend money on all

643
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:24,120
this packs

644
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:29,280
however yeah pretty much anything with

645
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:31,529
Caleo has some issues a skunk number one

646
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:35,158
crossed with the female p90 one with

647
00:29:31,529 --> 00:29:35,490
time L is is it skunky all maybe just a

648
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:37,799
little

649
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:41,700
let's see 19 years ago that crossed with

650
00:29:37,798 --> 00:29:44,418
the FEM of P 91 with time male I've kind

651
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:48,840
of confused on what you're asking

652
00:29:44,419 --> 00:29:52,559
um you know psychedelic effect really

653
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:54,240
depends on your own brain chemistry what

654
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:54,940
might be psychedelic for me and trippy

655
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,440
for me may

656
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:59,440
not have that effect for you so it's

657
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:02,019
really hard to say there are certain

658
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,410
lines that are known to have that effect

659
00:30:02,019 --> 00:30:06,910
for a majority of people be it Malawi

660
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:09,090
different Malawi is different Africans

661
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:13,660
but yeah

662
00:30:09,089 --> 00:30:19,389
alien technology is in the alien Orange

663
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:21,930
cookies I believe I'm pretty sure aliens

664
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:23,710
orange cookies I don't remember but yeah

665
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:26,590
it's good [ __ ] man

666
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:28,360
that orange cookies cut is amazing but I

667
00:30:26,589 --> 00:30:29,889
don't recommend running the seeds

668
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:35,649
because you will have a long hunt in

669
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:37,690
front of you what made me keep popping

670
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:39,970
packs when you get Herms I understand

671
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:41,950
cannabis science and and and how plants

672
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:44,589
work everything needs some acclamation

673
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:46,630
to an extent there are some lines that

674
00:30:44,589 --> 00:30:49,240
hurt more than others and that just

675
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:50,980
means the lines are not as happy in

676
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:54,730
their current environment as other lines

677
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:59,110
would be some lines adapt better knowing

678
00:30:54,730 --> 00:31:02,289
that full well if you find like one in

679
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:03,819
30 that aren't a herm it still usually

680
00:31:02,289 --> 00:31:05,379
passes on her traits when you breed with

681
00:31:03,819 --> 00:31:07,089
it that's why you have to run the

682
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:13,060
progeny to yourself to make sure that

683
00:31:07,089 --> 00:31:15,369
that that trait didn't pass on yes did

684
00:31:13,059 --> 00:31:17,799
an original Indian cookie strain correct

685
00:31:15,369 --> 00:31:21,339
I didn't release it I let some out to a

686
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:24,250
few different people the strongest are

687
00:31:21,339 --> 00:31:26,819
KS Terps would be the heirloom Afghani s

688
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:29,380
ones that to me had the strongest

689
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:33,339
descanse ray cam was really loved for

690
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:35,200
it's a scotch berry chirps as well uh it

691
00:31:33,339 --> 00:31:37,089
was never really into peyote purple for

692
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,720
crossing I already had Bubba's that I

693
00:31:37,089 --> 00:31:39,720
was working with

694
00:31:45,579 --> 00:31:50,839
yeah

695
00:31:46,788 --> 00:31:52,339
exactly I mean the her Michoud Rives me

696
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:52,939
nuts I see people complaining about

697
00:31:52,339 --> 00:31:55,488
Herms

698
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:58,580
and what that tells to me first when you

699
00:31:55,489 --> 00:32:00,259
see someone say man you look 10 packs

700
00:31:58,579 --> 00:32:02,298
you know everything's [ __ ] herb that

701
00:32:00,259 --> 00:32:05,929
says more about the person growing then

702
00:32:02,298 --> 00:32:07,730
it does the whoever seeds here an an

703
00:32:05,929 --> 00:32:09,590
experienced grower gets that should be

704
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:11,298
able to hear that and go oh you got a

705
00:32:09,589 --> 00:32:15,308
[ __ ] problem dude that's not that

706
00:32:11,298 --> 00:32:15,308
common to have that many [ __ ] homes

707
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:20,659
but even then man like if you're a

708
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:22,099
grower you're supposed to be able to

709
00:32:20,659 --> 00:32:24,139
adapt this [ __ ] that's what good growers

710
00:32:22,099 --> 00:32:25,398
do you see a herm you catch that [ __ ]

711
00:32:24,138 --> 00:32:26,988
early cuz you pay attention to your

712
00:32:25,398 --> 00:32:29,839
plants pay attention your [ __ ] plants

713
00:32:26,989 --> 00:32:32,119
don't [ __ ] [ __ ] it's a part of

714
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:33,949
growing cannabis is an intersex plant by

715
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:35,988
Nature you know what I mean so just

716
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:37,278
handle your [ __ ] handle your business it

717
00:32:35,989 --> 00:32:40,608
makes you look like a [ __ ] when you cry

718
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:42,798
so yeah but I mean if you if you spent

719
00:32:40,608 --> 00:32:44,538
thousands on a line and you have not

720
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:45,829
found anything that won't herm and

721
00:32:44,538 --> 00:32:47,509
you're not the only person having this

722
00:32:45,829 --> 00:32:49,759
problem then there's a problem and it

723
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:53,450
needs to be addressed exactly you know I

724
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:55,429
mean that's how it goes but nine out of

725
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:57,499
ten times it's gonna be because it's not

726
00:32:55,429 --> 00:32:58,999
happy in your room let it acclimate take

727
00:32:57,499 --> 00:33:01,339
a clone from a clone from a clone if

728
00:32:58,999 --> 00:33:02,989
that line is good enough to put that

729
00:33:01,339 --> 00:33:04,220
much time into and you really see some

730
00:33:02,989 --> 00:33:06,048
potential in it but it still has her

731
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:08,329
arms clone from a clone from a clone

732
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:10,548
acclimate it'll probably not happen

733
00:33:08,329 --> 00:33:12,819
again nine times out of ten it won't

734
00:33:10,548 --> 00:33:12,819
happen again

735
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:16,730
limelight is not is not a massive

736
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:21,288
yielder it's one of the Jack hairs that

737
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:24,950
has a smaller yield compared to typical

738
00:33:21,288 --> 00:33:26,749
Jack hairs but the resin production

739
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:28,369
makes up for its yield tenfold

740
00:33:26,749 --> 00:33:31,669
especially if you're an extract artist

741
00:33:28,368 --> 00:33:33,949
and the lime the lime skunk is is insane

742
00:33:31,669 --> 00:33:36,038
the lime skunk combo is insane I loved

743
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:36,038
it

744
00:33:40,369 --> 00:33:50,489
same questions different feed you what's

745
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,440
your thought on breeders or even new

746
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:54,240
scope readers making profits off s ones

747
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,250
from kick-ass clones like lemon tree TK

748
00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:00,630
to bring a Kim dog other than getting

749
00:33:56,250 --> 00:34:05,160
beat up um there's a there's a time and

750
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:06,600
place for s ones you know I can't I

751
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,010
can't really call people out for that

752
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:10,170
because I mean early on in my career

753
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:12,630
that's what I did I would I would

754
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:15,179
reverse plants and cross them to popular

755
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:17,099
fun on the hybrids back then the clones

756
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:18,960
didn't get sent around the country as

757
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:20,869
often things were a lot more rare so at

758
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,740
that time there was a high demand for it

759
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:24,089
apparently now there's still a high

760
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:26,789
demand for it

761
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:27,929
I just wish like when people s one lemon

762
00:34:26,789 --> 00:34:30,389
tree they'd call it what it is

763
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:33,829
it's [ __ ] lemon diesel you know well

764
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:36,179
you know get the names right at least

765
00:34:33,829 --> 00:34:37,590
Topanga Canyon I don't even know who's

766
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:39,780
responsible for that so I don't see a

767
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:42,179
problem with us wanting that chem 91

768
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:45,300
that's a different story that's a

769
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:48,059
different story we know who was

770
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:51,990
responsible for that one the fact that

771
00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:56,309
he isn't kicked down anything yet seeds

772
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:58,229
or anything that's a shame you know so

773
00:34:56,309 --> 00:35:05,250
when I see chem 91 s ones I kind of that

774
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:06,900
that does kind of earth me yeah would

775
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:08,610
you say poly hybridization is a reason

776
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:10,650
for more firms occurring no I would say

777
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:12,829
it's from bad growers feeding the plants

778
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,829
like tomatoes

779
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:27,589
but yeah I mean when it comes to when it

780
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:27,589
comes to people of in reversed hybrids I

781
00:35:28,579 --> 00:35:32,429
especially if it's a hybrid I I think

782
00:35:30,869 --> 00:35:33,569
it's awesome especially if they know

783
00:35:32,429 --> 00:35:34,679
what they're doing and they're good at

784
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:40,019
it you know what I mean if they're doing

785
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:41,849
it right why not then again I I don't do

786
00:35:40,019 --> 00:35:43,679
a lot of reverse lines anymore I sell to

787
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:46,039
spray but I tend to stick with regulars

788
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:48,210
just because it's just what I like doing

789
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:51,329
it costs a lot more money to make

790
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:55,380
reverse to do to do reversals it costs a

791
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:57,799
lot more money less pollen people don't

792
00:35:55,380 --> 00:36:00,480
realize how much more of a process it is

793
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:03,900
love you stray I still got to send you

794
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:11,490
your [ __ ] dad tools still have them

795
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:12,869
here for you yeah I have my press but I

796
00:36:11,489 --> 00:36:15,419
haven't put it up because the landlord

797
00:36:12,869 --> 00:36:16,859
walkthrough [ __ ] so yeah I don't I

798
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:19,409
haven't put anything up or used it

799
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:21,240
because of that it's gonna be a [ __ ]

800
00:36:19,409 --> 00:36:23,309
hectic week I'll tell you that much it's

801
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:28,619
already been crazy trying to get all

802
00:36:23,309 --> 00:36:30,539
this [ __ ] done why do people get so much

803
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:34,440
[ __ ] for making s ones that's a good

804
00:36:30,539 --> 00:36:36,420
question and I think it's um I think

805
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:38,869
it's just misinformation for a long time

806
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:42,539
everybody was saying oh it's one sperm

807
00:36:38,869 --> 00:36:43,889
feminize you turn the her a lot of the

808
00:36:42,539 --> 00:36:46,159
time what people were seeing and they

809
00:36:43,889 --> 00:36:49,969
were calling harm reversals were males

810
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:49,969
true males in a line

811
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:57,060
what's up Mean Gene I want to bring Mean

812
00:36:55,139 --> 00:36:59,159
Gene on the show to what I want to I

813
00:36:57,059 --> 00:37:01,710
want to have you on the show so many

814
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:03,509
people I want to have on what's the

815
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:04,590
difference between your heirloom Afghani

816
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:06,600
to roadkill's gun

817
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:08,579
well I had a roadkill Afghani and that

818
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:12,299
was my heirloom Afghani cross to

819
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:14,460
sourdough and I also did a version where

820
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:16,380
it was the male Afghani that passed on

821
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:19,409
the skunk tray cross to soured of is the

822
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:22,050
female but the main difference is one

823
00:37:19,409 --> 00:37:25,519
has the sour dub in it and the other

824
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:26,880
doesn't sour dub did great at passing on

825
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:30,630
skunked herbs

826
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:33,390
it already has kind of a skunky Terp to

827
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:35,220
it when I grow it anyways it's very

828
00:37:33,389 --> 00:37:36,868
skunky but not supersuit

829
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:39,358
skunky but because of that little bit of

830
00:37:36,869 --> 00:37:41,160
skunk it really really absorbs a skunk

831
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:44,069
when crossed and that and that's cool to

832
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:48,779
see very underrated line very underrated

833
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:50,580
cut man I wanted to be at the San

834
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:52,080
Bernadino cup it this weekend my friend

835
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:53,039
bikes gonna be there but I don't know if

836
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,449
I'm gonna be able to make it because of

837
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:57,119
all the landlord [ __ ] going on it's

838
00:37:54,449 --> 00:37:59,239
[ __ ] me in the ass not too stoked

839
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:03,539
about it

840
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:06,089
Mean Gene Mean Gene deck ice lays it

841
00:38:03,539 --> 00:38:12,420
with the memes have you ever used an S

842
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:16,980
one male in a breeding project once in

843
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:19,740
the clockwork piff and it was it was

844
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:22,740
phenomenal he had a higher female to

845
00:38:19,739 --> 00:38:25,858
male ratio which is you know kind of

846
00:38:22,739 --> 00:38:27,449
cool but that was the only time I did it

847
00:38:25,858 --> 00:38:29,219
it was an experiment and it turned out

848
00:38:27,449 --> 00:38:31,679
to be good but I don't like using s 1

849
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:33,929
males too much do you ever hit the a fee

850
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:35,699
with the reverse cut I never got around

851
00:38:33,929 --> 00:38:38,098
to it man I had a lot of trouble with

852
00:38:35,699 --> 00:38:40,439
the a fee still having some trouble with

853
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:42,450
it I just lost the mom I have one single

854
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,280
cut of it left trying to root right now

855
00:38:42,449 --> 00:38:47,509
and I'm gonna do my best to get it to

856
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:52,019
mewni to do some tissue culture with or

857
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:53,760
who else DSG labs one of those guys I'm

858
00:38:52,019 --> 00:38:55,289
giving them to tissue culture it just so

859
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,450
it doesn't get lost it's an important

860
00:38:55,289 --> 00:39:01,349
line but it's not very vigorous the

861
00:38:57,449 --> 00:39:05,338
seeds were super [ __ ] old it's slow

862
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:06,930
but god damn it has amazing terms okay

863
00:39:05,338 --> 00:39:08,489
however my max looking they're still

864
00:39:06,929 --> 00:39:10,139
young man I've kept them in small pots

865
00:39:08,489 --> 00:39:13,319
just because I was trying to finish this

866
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:16,289
last run and right now I don't know what

867
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:23,430
the future is for the immediate future

868
00:39:16,289 --> 00:39:26,159
is anyway for that what is dumpster it's

869
00:39:23,429 --> 00:39:31,769
usually a big box outside of a like a

870
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:35,699
convenience store you know a moon is the

871
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:38,880
boss mony is the boss that guy is a

872
00:39:35,699 --> 00:39:40,319
tissue culture [ __ ] genius do the

873
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,180
strawberry switch made like to be pushed

874
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,230
out or left alone it depends on where

875
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:43,879
you're growing it and how you're growing

876
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:45,920
it

877
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:48,019
it grows completely different outdoors

878
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:54,200
than it does indoors the Terps also

879
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:56,119
change do you ever cut off mail shoots

880
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:57,379
with pollen sacks about to open and

881
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:59,809
isolate them to collect the pollen

882
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:02,840
better yeah that that can definitely be

883
00:39:59,809 --> 00:40:04,610
a method for collecting pollen like you

884
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:07,250
know cut off a big branch to get in some

885
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:08,720
water so it's like a water cup so it's

886
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:13,840
easier to collect the pollen as opposed

887
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:13,839
to trying to move a tree around you know

888
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:20,989
yeah that's that's a definite good

889
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:24,460
option for it I remember the story about

890
00:40:20,989 --> 00:40:26,569
dumpsters something about someone saw a

891
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:27,889
cannabis plant that like had been tossed

892
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:29,210
or a seedling or something they'd been

893
00:40:27,889 --> 00:40:31,879
tossed right by a dumpster so they

894
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:33,199
picked it up kept it and whatever that's

895
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:35,599
the story I remember hearing I don't

896
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:36,980
know how accurate that is but that was

897
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:40,519
the can of Bible story if I remember

898
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:48,019
correctly anyone got the real purple

899
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:52,250
cush or grape ape from comp Chi I have

900
00:40:48,019 --> 00:40:55,759
the sr-71 purple kush which is pretty so

901
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:57,619
close to herbal it's ridiculous and was

902
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,930
the other one Grape Ape I don't have

903
00:40:57,619 --> 00:41:02,059
great paper anymore Bodie ran that a lot

904
00:40:59,929 --> 00:41:03,739
and I used to run it I made Grape Ape a

905
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:06,139
swans I made a grape Apes our bubble

906
00:41:03,739 --> 00:41:07,789
cross back in the day but I don't keep

907
00:41:06,139 --> 00:41:09,710
the grape ape anymore it's very similar

908
00:41:07,789 --> 00:41:11,980
again to Urkel with slightly more narrow

909
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:11,980
leaves

910
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:19,860
endure with LED on the switchblade I

911
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,809
really couldn't tell you I've never

912
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:23,190
grown under LEDs at all so I don't know

913
00:41:21,809 --> 00:41:25,650
how she'll react

914
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:28,670
she's a very the switchblade is very

915
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:34,280
lanky very lanky so keep that in mind

916
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:37,050
very lanky it stretches a lot in Flour

917
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:39,540
those underdog purples are some of the

918
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:48,539
most ancient on earth I gotta tell you

919
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:50,190
got to tell ya what was the deal with

920
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:52,170
rehearsing the Uptown piff to make us

921
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:53,700
ones wasn't the restrictions on that the

922
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:57,059
only restriction that I had was that I

923
00:41:53,699 --> 00:42:03,299
couldn't release it pure I didn't

924
00:41:57,059 --> 00:42:06,360
reverse any pits I had the h1 the h2 h1

925
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:09,539
being the Frankie type H to being the

926
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:10,829
mango piff but I was never allowed to

927
00:42:09,539 --> 00:42:12,449
release appear that was the only thing

928
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:15,420
that was never allowed to [ __ ] do and

929
00:42:12,449 --> 00:42:18,149
I kind of wish I would have just done it

930
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:21,360
just to have to do a CD increase so I

931
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:23,160
didn't ever lose it so yeah I I don't

932
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:25,050
know man

933
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:27,119
but I just didn't want to piss off a

934
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:28,470
bunch of Dominicans that's not it's not

935
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:32,909
the way to go is have a bunch of

936
00:42:28,469 --> 00:42:34,619
Dominican gangsters pista here loud

937
00:42:32,909 --> 00:42:35,879
watermelon chirps Africa is the first

938
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:41,730
thing I think of when I think of like

939
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:43,829
melon like a blue melon type I growing

940
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:45,329
I've seen some watermelon skittles that

941
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:48,630
didn't have the watermelon Terps it was

942
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:51,090
more sweet F gooey definitely had melon

943
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:52,670
what about the watermelon hash plant

944
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:55,260
from Bodhi I believe that had some

945
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:57,150
watermelon phenotypes as well very hard

946
00:42:55,260 --> 00:43:05,760
to grow indoor but definitely had the

947
00:42:57,150 --> 00:43:07,950
watermelon chirps you know what like I

948
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,690
figure if I keep doing these eventually

949
00:43:07,949 --> 00:43:11,369
more sales will come so yeah I guess

950
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:13,769
that's a way of getting picked it's fun

951
00:43:11,369 --> 00:43:15,480
though man I like I like interacting

952
00:43:13,769 --> 00:43:18,239
with everyone and it makes me happy when

953
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:20,400
my friends come in you know like we can

954
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:22,409

956
00:43:22,409 --> 00:43:25,549
genetics I could do it all day

957
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,909
sour bubble as in gorilla I have never

958

00:43:31,858 --> 00:43:39,058
a bubble gum bubble gum line from bog

961
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:43,109
twitch gets you paid I need to look into

962
00:43:39,059 --> 00:43:45,030
that [ __ ] I think I'm the last the

963
00:43:43,108 --> 00:43:46,650
furthest thing for a cannabis therapist

964
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:54,930
I'm too chaotic people don't need that

965
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:56,519
[ __ ] yeah you can ask about springtails

966
00:43:54,929 --> 00:43:58,710

967
00:43:56,519 --> 00:44:00,030

00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:26,769
it shows now especially in California

995
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,360
because they're saying that the

996
00:45:26,769 --> 00:45:30,909
California met Burt is going to be going

997
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:32,559
around checking everyone's licenses to

998
00:45:30,909 --> 00:45:33,609
sell set seeds if you're selling without

999
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:36,130
a license they're gonna have a [ __ ]

1000
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:41,769
problem you're gonna be on a big radar

1001
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:44,260
you don't want to be on best place to

1002
00:45:41,769 --> 00:45:46,320
pick up si si Humboldt seeds ooh I don't

1003
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:48,750
have an answer for that I don't know

1004
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:53,140
I'll ask him and get back to you on a

1005
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:58,349
mmm feature feed what nutrients do I use

1006
00:45:53,139 --> 00:45:58,349
I use uh nod right now what am i using

1007
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:07,779
NPK raw I mean it just really it tends

1008
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:09,550
to be whatever I have around as long as

1009
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:11,680
it has the correct NPK values that I

1010
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:13,870
need I can use a plethora of different

1011
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:15,549
nutrients I don't need a line spelled

1012
00:46:13,869 --> 00:46:18,849
out for me it's very very simple

1013
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:25,180
um feeding cannabis plants is extremely

1014
00:46:18,849 --> 00:46:30,159
simple so so simple nitrogen with low PK

1015
00:46:25,179 --> 00:46:34,389
in veg high nitrogen low PK like a 5:1

1016
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:36,589
one in blue you would be closer to a 155

1017
00:46:34,389 --> 00:46:41,059
or zero five five

1018
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:45,050
it add cal-mag add some beneficials I

1019
00:46:41,059 --> 00:46:48,170
had some what's that stuff called and I

1020
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:53,210
like a lot silly

1021
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:55,340
so mono silicic acid you can you can add

1022
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:58,429
in some B vitamins you know what I mean

1023
00:46:55,340 --> 00:47:00,880
like it's it's not too complex and then

1024
00:46:58,429 --> 00:47:03,469
carbs carbs of carbs and flour as well

1025
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:07,480
it's not complex that the whole

1026
00:47:03,469 --> 00:47:09,980
hydroponic industry was based on people

1027
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:14,179
it's like a bunch of used-car salesmen

1028
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:20,150
man yeah C guy gotta have a nursery

1029
00:47:14,179 --> 00:47:22,819
permit Geno's yeah so yeah I think I

1030
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:28,730
think the Emerald cup was the last big

1031
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:30,470
rodeo I don't recommend Seed Vault

1032
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:32,240
because I've watched them rip people off

1033
00:47:30,469 --> 00:47:37,159
before and then changed their name to

1034
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:39,049
Seed Vault have you heard the term

1035
00:47:37,159 --> 00:47:40,609
unlocking your plant potential I've

1036
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:45,410
heard it but I mean that could mean any

1037
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:47,960
number of things you know I like the

1038
00:47:45,409 --> 00:47:50,469
term grow with your plant don't just

1039
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:52,309
grow your plant grow with your plant I

1040
00:47:50,469 --> 00:47:53,929
like that a lot

1041
00:47:52,309 --> 00:48:00,980
because it's it's very true grow with

1042
00:47:53,929 --> 00:48:02,539
your plan how did I get the virus out of

1043
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:04,789
my room when I lost everything

1044
00:48:02,539 --> 00:48:07,070
I didn't lose everything but most of

1045
00:48:04,789 --> 00:48:09,079
everything got hit I had to start from

1046
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:12,559
scratch lots of bleach throw a lot of

1047
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:15,079
way really really use some hardcore cans

1048
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:17,029
back then to try to eradicate whatever

1049
00:48:15,079 --> 00:48:19,789
it was happening I just hit it with my

1050
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:21,050
my black death potion and that's only to

1051
00:48:19,789 --> 00:48:23,150
be used in the most extreme

1052
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:25,490
circumstances when you have like the

1053
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:27,559
last of a last of a cut in existence in

1054
00:48:25,489 --> 00:48:29,449
the world and people are relying on you

1055
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:32,779
to keep it alive that's when you use the

1056
00:48:29,449 --> 00:48:34,789
Black Death but you don't flower ever

1057
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:36,260
from that plant you need a clone of a

1058
00:48:34,789 --> 00:48:39,800
clone of a clone of a clone to do that

1059
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:42,320
but yeah what virus would you two look

1060
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:44,480
like okay um the best way I can describe

1061
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:46,820
this and I'm gonna tell you right now it

1062
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:49,219
wasn't [ __ ] powdery mildew it wasn't

1063
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:50,360
any kind of normal mold spore it didn't

1064
00:48:49,219 --> 00:48:54,230
really react

1065
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:57,289
mold to mold treatments it looked like a

1066
00:48:54,230 --> 00:48:59,840
mail hit my whole room and a layer of

1067
00:48:57,289 --> 00:49:02,900
pollen was sitting on all the leaves you

1068
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:04,250
could wash it off it would go away you

1069
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:04,700
come back two hours later and there it

1070
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:07,880
was again

1071
00:49:04,699 --> 00:49:09,769
it was [ __ ] weird it was weird

1072
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:13,789
so I trusted to do trim the Philippines

1073
00:49:09,769 --> 00:49:16,309
to send me a clone and what exists in

1074
00:49:13,789 --> 00:49:20,380
the Philippines doesn't necessarily

1075
00:49:16,309 --> 00:49:23,420
exist in the American cannabis world and

1076
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:25,789
what the clone was that I got it from I

1077
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:29,000
didn't see a little anything too shaky

1078
00:49:25,789 --> 00:49:31,099
on it you know but it may have already

1079
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:36,500
built up a resistance being a Filipino

1080
00:49:31,099 --> 00:49:40,039
landrace so yeah that's that's wild I

1081
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:42,500
tried everything with it and eventually

1082
00:49:40,039 --> 00:49:44,119
the last two cuts were saved but I had

1083
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,570
to go get clockwork back from someone

1084
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:45,769
else

1085
00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:48,019
I had to get a lot of stuff back from

1086
00:49:45,769 --> 00:49:49,429
other people I'd passed it to and if

little did little did you know now you

1128
00:51:46,949 --> 00:51:56,579
may have known but I feel smarter saying

1129
00:51:48,929 --> 00:51:58,739
it YouTube does blow but it's the only

1130
00:51:56,579 --> 00:52:00,449
way you can re-watch this video or watch

1131
00:51:58,739 --> 00:52:01,829

1132
00:52:00,449 --> 00:52:04,500
I want to make sure that people can have

1133
00:52:01,829 --> 00:52:07,289

1140
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:32,490
there's only one up there right now

1141
00:52:28,039 --> 00:52:35,940
Mooney will be doing a another live feed

this Friday so if you missed any of the

1143
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:39,869
tissue culture stuff we're gonna review

1144
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:42,210
a lot of that so we can save it and put

1145

1148
00:52:46,829 --> 00:52:51,569
have someone with Muniz experience that

1149
00:52:48,929 --> 00:52:54,539
teaches all of the guys who owned and

1150
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:56,970
run the big labs come and give you this

1151
00:52:54,539 --> 00:52:58,949
information for free that guy makes

1152

1156
00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:12,030
to him it's the only time I ask you

1157
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:16,829
bring your [ __ ] a game bring your A

1158
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:17,220
game it's just important man like it

1159
00:53:16,829 --> 00:53:19,019
shows

1160
00:53:17,219 --> 00:53:20,519
a nice level of respect when you've done

1161
00:53:19,019 --> 00:53:22,500
your research and you come in here and

1162
00:53:20,519 --> 00:53:24,869
you don't ask crazy [ __ ] you know that

1163
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:27,599
you could ask the [ __ ] some nerd at a

1164
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:28,800
[ __ ] hydroponic store save the

1165
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:30,750
questions for the Nerds at the

1166
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,970
hydroponic store that you couldn't ask

1167
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:39,030
me or Mooney otherwise you know what I

1168
00:53:32,969 --> 00:53:40,409
mean yeah so any more questions time

1169
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:50,670
isn't out yet so let's let's get the

1170
00:53:40,409 --> 00:53:53,250
questions going oh oh also when this is

1171
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:54,869
over go to my buddy other Cuban breeders

1172
00:53:53,250 --> 00:54:03,059
live feed watch him

1173
00:53:54,869 --> 00:54:05,369
learn some [ __ ] how many of these folks

1174
00:54:03,059 --> 00:54:07,230
would get together if 10 or 15 of us for

1175
00:54:05,369 --> 00:54:08,430
you I think a lot of people would do it

1176
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:10,170
man it's just a matter of getting us

1177
00:54:08,429 --> 00:54:11,419
together to do it in one area where it

1178
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:14,130
can all make it

1179
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:17,460
do you believe Adam Dunn's bubblegum

1180
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:18,930
story no I definitely think tissue

1181
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:21,269
culture as a future in a method that

1182
00:54:18,929 --> 00:54:23,129
will either stop or prolonged Rick yep

1183
00:54:21,269 --> 00:54:23,519
um tissue culture is the way of the

1184
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:25,440
future

1185
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:27,989
absolutely is cloning is going to be a

1186
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:30,088
thing of the past and there will always

1187
00:54:27,989 --> 00:54:33,750
be a place for cloning for quick-quick

1188
00:54:30,088 --> 00:54:34,759
clones but tissue culture is the way of

1189
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:37,050
the future

1190
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:38,640
gibberellic acid versus STS for

1191
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:41,039
feminizing I would think GA 3 would work

1192
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:43,889
better and you are incorrect GA 3 is

1193
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:46,259
much less effective GA 3 is great for

1194
00:54:43,889 --> 00:54:47,670
stretching plants however GA 3 doesn't

1195
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:49,200
necessarily block ethylene on its own

1196
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:51,059
you need something that's not only gonna

1197
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:53,129
increase gibberellic acid in the plant

1198
00:54:51,059 --> 00:54:59,849
but will also block ethylene and that's

1199
00:54:53,130 --> 00:55:01,440
where STS comes into play you have a DNA

1200
00:54:59,849 --> 00:55:03,780
holy grail yeah I wouldn't even admit

1201
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:05,670
that [ __ ] out loud freak I wouldn't

1202
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:08,150
admit that [ __ ] out loud on it some DNA

1203
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:08,150
[ __ ]

1204
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:17,650
yeah man it's it's a matter of of trying

1205
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:21,588
to get us all together in the same spot

1206
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:23,358
that's all it is man a lot of there are

1207
00:55:21,588 --> 00:55:24,949
plenty of us that get along that that

1208
00:55:23,358 --> 00:55:26,329
are very educated they can do a show

1209
00:55:24,949 --> 00:55:28,909
together but it's it's a matter of

1210
00:55:26,329 --> 00:55:32,179
getting us to a place where we'll travel

1211
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:34,338
to because frankly we're a bunch of

1212
00:55:32,179 --> 00:55:36,980
[ __ ] Hermits we're a bunch of [ __ ]

1213
00:55:34,338 --> 00:55:39,679
Hermits for real total [ __ ] Hermits

1214
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:41,269
and we don't get out very often most of

1215
00:55:39,679 --> 00:55:47,239
us can't leave our plants long enough to

1216
00:55:41,269 --> 00:55:49,429
get away that long yeah his cult

1217
00:55:47,239 --> 00:55:52,629
classics are KS for me I don't think so

1218
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:55,098
I don't know where there's this room

1219
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:57,200
yeah come to me let's throw one in

1220
00:55:55,099 --> 00:56:03,859
Bakersfield and I'll get arrested it

1221
00:55:57,199 --> 00:56:05,659

1244
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:14,690
we've all been dying since the day we

1245
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:17,720
were born and I don't think he's any

1246

Super Skunk of some sort crossed with

1250
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:31,820
probably tie Super Skunk I could

1251
00:57:29,090 --> 00:57:35,600
probably recreate that or uh Super Skunk

1252
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:38,120
Mexican tie anyone else noticed that sub

1253
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:42,739
wears the same yeah well meth does that

1254
00:57:38,119 --> 00:57:54,400

1255
00:57:42,739 --> 00:57:54,399
never forget that one what else we got

1256

00:58:05,719 --> 00:58:09,109
do good playing off each other it's

1260
00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:10,820
funny I was one of the best Adam done

1261
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:12,140
shows ever when it was me and Loompa

1262
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:14,330
just being [ __ ] crazy

1263
00:58:12,139 --> 00:58:16,519
well I was being crazy cuz I was high on

1264
00:58:14,329 --> 00:58:19,489
a lot of xanax and that that's for real

1265
00:58:16,519 --> 00:58:22,460
a little [ __ ] up used a few choice

1266
00:58:19,489 --> 00:58:26,359
words kind of being stupid wasn't making

1267
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:27,740
much sense but yeah lemon tree oh gee

1268
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:29,240
I'm not sure what lemon tree oh gee is

1269
00:58:27,739 --> 00:58:32,419
is that the same things lemon tree but

1270
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:38,000
the original lemon diesel is lemon tree

1271
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:39,800
and it was it super super Airy it might

1272
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,119
be too much cal-mag or nitrogen and in

1273
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:44,360
defeating I know it doesn't like that

1274
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:50,239
like most most most narrow leaf dominant

1275
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:51,860
plants long what happened cry-baby I did

1276
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:52,849
I miss it your question oh we got a

1277
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:57,559
minute remaining I wasn't paying

1278
00:58:52,849 --> 00:59:02,000
attention one minute remaining pom pom

1279
00:58:57,559 --> 00:59:05,690
pom ball what's up loops next time come

1280
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:10,280
on earlier and we could do a show

1281
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:12,139
because because our shits funny anyway

1282
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:15,220
yep everyone if you want to get in for
