00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,920
uh slightly less because we bought so

60
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,280
it's 2300 roughly a little bit more but

61
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,518
not much

62
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,680
um it's a lot smaller than this place as

63
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,560
far as the house but the property is big

64
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,560
so

65
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,759

covering

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,840
the forum era post 2006

70
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:53,679
which really was i mean i chose that

71
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,120
because that's when i come in

72
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,000
so mostly

73
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,400
the tail end of overgrow uh

74
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,280
cannabis world a little bit

75
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,719
uh

76
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,640
i don't remember when planet ganja

77
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:07,439
dipped out

78
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:09,839
some grass city troll it up

79
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:09,840
um

80
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,000
pop pimp trichome kings

81
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,400
the farter

82
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,920
stuff like that there's a seed depot

83
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,840
stuff

84
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:23,759
yeah i see mag of course

85
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,920
there's a big point to it too and and

86
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,359
it's that a lot of people like that

87
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,359
weren't around during the forums it's

88
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,799
really easy to tell who they are and the

89
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,120
ones that pretend

90
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,040
like they were it's also really easy to

91
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,519
tell that they were because or that they

92
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:39,039
weren't because they only reference the

93
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,959
ones that are still up and only quote

94
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:43,280
the forms that are still up which is a

95
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,360
very very

96
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,400
i can't i can't mention that one sub rob

97
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,080
since it's private i don't want to

98
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,280
mention it

99
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,400
try to follow rules on that one but um

100
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,598
yeah i mean

101
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,879
people try to quote stuff all the time

102
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:56,959
but you're only seeing

103
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:59,598
a brief glimpse of what happened back

104
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,000
then some of the most salacious [ __ ]

105
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:03,679
horrible [ __ ] went down on sites like

106
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,080
sea depot where

107
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,280
a lot of people started popping up a lot

108
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,360
of people that are selling seeds started

109
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,120
popping up on seed depot and i'm sure

110
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,959
they are super stoked that you can't

111
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,560
find that [ __ ] but we do have the

112
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,560
wayback machine and i actually haven't

113
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,560
tested that for seed depot so we'll see

114
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:24,000
yeah uh ganja plantage was on um way

115
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,240

116
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,319
uh only certain

117
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,079
threads were it was really hard to find

118
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:32,639
any consistency in why certain things

119
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,639
were or not

120
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,439
oh here we go there's not so

121

yeah so i was just telling everyone

144
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,840
we're going to be going over the forum

145
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:26,478
era post overgrow so 2006 roughly and on

146
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,959
and uh i was explaining how there are a

147
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:30,959
lot of a forum still up that were around

148
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,758
during that time like the farm

149
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:33,839
um

150
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,199
i see mad

151
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,439
troll it up some of the some of the

152
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,080
others that came around that time

153
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:41,839
um but there are a lot that are not up

154
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,079
and people that like to pretend that

155
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:45,599
they were around back then

156
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:47,199
often reference the ones that are still

157
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,879
up that they can go back and like reread

158
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,160
and pretend like hey i was i was there i

159
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:51,759
know what was going on but they're

160
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,439
missing like 90 percent of the

161
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,680
conversations that were going on because

162
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:57,918
those aren't even accessible any longer

163
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,840
one of one of the things i notice about

164
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:01,359
that era

165
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:03,519
is that

166
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,439
you know a lot of times we catch people

167
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:08,318
on stuff

168
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:10,000
because people go back to [ __ ]

169
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,240
yes and they read

170
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,399
uh you know threads and things like that

171
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,800

you know it is a big deal it's a big

182
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:37,758
tell but to someone that never read any

183
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:38,959
of those forums you can come out and

184
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,680
confidently

185
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:44,079
start jabbing about a bunch of stuff

186
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,199
yeah and sound like you were there

187
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:47,038

not i'm not gonna say anybody's name but

189
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:50,639
uh someone made a post the other day

190
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:51,839
that obviously was not around on the

191
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,439
forums

192
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:57,198
and said you know

193
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:59,519
x person got cloned from y person got

194
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,800
cloned from z person and it was just

195
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:06,000
super off like the most

196
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,079
off it could be i mean

197
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,399
that's learning from me i try we try not

198
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:13,359
to name names when it's not but it was

199
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:16,318
pretty funny the chain of custody

200
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,160
yeah that was asserted

201
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,080
you know you you just had you just had

202
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,400
to laugh at a certain point but yeah i

203
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:23,199
will say even back then

204
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:24,318
like

205
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,280
uh

206
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,879
you know

207
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:28,559
i don't know exactly how to describe it

208
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,719
but i would say that like

209
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,319
like overgrow even had some of the best

210
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,319
commentary

211
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,560
but also some of the worst

212
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,479
like you kind of the forums really

213
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,160
helped figuring out what you were doing

214
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:43,120
if you already went in there with some

215
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,879
connection and some ability to discern

216
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,399
yeah you know cannabis world was a

217
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,039
little bit more like where the adults

218
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:50,079
gathered yeah uh over a girl you could

219
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:52,639
have like

220
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:54,240
everyone from like some 17 year old kid

221
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,960
[ __ ] posting you even though we didn't

222
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,400
use that term back then yeah to like

223
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:02,239
camara and sam skunk man and phds and

224
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:03,598
breeding talking [ __ ] in another in

225
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,598
another area

226
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:08,079
yeah so it really was like a

227
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:10,719
cross-section of weed in america

228
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:12,639
my main my main thing would be like i

229
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,919
would compare that to like grass city

230
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:18,319
from my era grass city and um roll it up

231
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:20,000
we always called it troll it up but

232
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,598
those two were like what everybody would

233
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,199
say like that's where everybody

234
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:24,240
everybody had an account on those pretty

235
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,038
much because that's where everybody

236
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,120
started during that era and then slowly

237
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:31,839
you'd see people migrate but then those

238
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,440
the ones that hung out in that area area

239
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:35,759
kind of never really seemed to go

240
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,240
anywhere as far as their knowledge or

241
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:40,559
making any headway with anything really

242
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,200
that's how i saw it yeah i mean and you

243
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,879
know it should be said too that like you

244
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,440
know there was different different

245
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:49,278
forums had different

246
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,440
i don't know different ethics maybe is

247
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:53,838
the best way to put it yeah you know

248
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,480
some some were more lightly moderated

249
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,240
and things got left up um you know

250
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,039
obviously like hate speech and and

251
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,839
various other aspects was was eliminated

252
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:06,719
um you know or but a lot of times you

253
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,120
know unlike ig or whatever um you know

254
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,519
if you didn't like the threads got left

255
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,200
they might get locked if arguments got

256
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,080
too heated but they would typically be

257
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,640
left

258
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,560
yeah where in today's environment on ig

259
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,838
a lot of times people just

260
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,439
get rid of it

261
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,480
yeah oh yeah

262
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,000
it's all

263
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,080
it's all uh what do you call that

264
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,839
curated it's all curated as soon as it

265
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,519
starts going off the rails or as soon as

266
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,680
they start seeing information they don't

267
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,278
want out there yeah um they'll just

268
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:34,879
delete comments or they'll delete the

269
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:37,200
whole thread or they'll turn off

270
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:39,679
comments yeah right away

271
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,200
um you know and then you know i see mag

272
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:43,039
you know there was you know there was an

273
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,160
in crowd and an outcrowd

274
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:45,759
mm-hmm

275
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:46,799
you know definitely that was the

276
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:49,278
outcrowd

277
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:52,159
i think i had a record uh for being the

278
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:54,559
person most banned from every forum and

279
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:55,919
it it i think i mean i even had my own

280
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,399
forums back in the day that people

281
00:09:55,919 --> 00:10:00,479
rocked on you know it was it got bad i

282
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,919
mean it was interesting in the sense

283
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,680
that like in the beginning in

284
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:06,240
overgrowing cannabis world and stuff i

285
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:08,159
was super excited and i got on there to

286
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,200
share information with uh with a bunch

287
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:11,519
of people

288
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,160
um and then you know but i was always

289
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,919
nervous about doing any kind

290
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:17,838
like you know i lived in mendo or

291
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:20,559
whatever so i didn't really need to like

292
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:23,279
meet new weed people yeah but i liked

293
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:25,199
learning what other people far away knew

294
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:27,600
yeah but a lot of people used it in the

295
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,200
dms to trade clones and do all this type

296
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,360
of stuff i never really did that i was

297
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,759
more like an in-person kind of kind of

298
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,278
guy yeah um and then when obviously when

299
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:38,720
heaven stairway got in trouble and they

300
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:39,679
shut all that down yeah i got scared

301
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,519
so

302
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:45,359
um you know this era that we're going to

303
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,560
talk about like 2006 on it really is csi

304
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,440
and matt's

305
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:48,239
era

306
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,160
yeah

307
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,919
it really is where you know i might have

308
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:53,679
been lurking a little bit and poking

309
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:55,519
around here and there

310
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:57,199
um and even some other friends of ours

311
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,919
that aren't going to join like uh our

312
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,278
buddy hi and lonesome oh yeah yeah you

313
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:03,278
know there there was some people that

314
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:06,000
were that were extremely active in that

315
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:08,078
area sure and know a lot of the the who

316
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,519
you know who was who was a jackass who

317
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:11,919
who was kind

318
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,560
uh who was a problem back then

319
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:16,240
you know where stuff came from

320
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:18,319
and one of the interesting things about

321
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,399
weed is that it reinvents itself every

322
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,120
five or ten years yeah

323
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,039
so

324
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,679
you get all these new people coming in

325
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:27,919
and people get to rebrand themselves

326
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:30,719
yeah now it's happening every six months

327
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:32,958
it seems yeah well it's modern fast

328
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,720
turnover yeah modern marketing

329
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:37,119
i mean i mentioned that i mentioned this

330
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,519
before but it was kind of like what the

331
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,078
uh what the old deadheads told me about

332
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,759
how dead tour used to be before the

333
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:44,559
grateful dead had touched a gray a big

334
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:46,480
hit

335
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:49,039
yeah where it was small

336
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,600
everybody knew kind of got vetted in

337
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:54,319
you know things didn't change that much

338
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,759
and then um you know

339
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,720
oh my god big ups to daniel okay so then

340
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,319
and then

341
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,360
and then there was a top they had a top

342
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,519
10 hit

343
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,440
and literally hundreds of thousands of

344
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,839
new people showed up

345
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:11,200
yeah and how do you assimilate them into

346
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,720
your community that fast yeah

347
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,639
really yeah

348
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,480
you know it becomes difficult so a lot

349
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,560
of times like old-timers or whatever

350
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,079
they feel overwhelmed

351
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,000
because like the norms of their

352
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:23,919
community and what they could expect you

353
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,320
know and instead of being like a

354
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:27,679
respected elder somebody's like who the

355
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,079
[ __ ] is this guy

356
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:30,879
yeah why do i have to listen to you

357
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:32,638
yeah

358
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:34,399
you know where before when it was

359
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,440
smaller like those people might have had

360
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,159
respect

361
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,920
yeah

362
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:39,919
yeah it's a much it did get very

363
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:42,078
different and i want to say it wasn't

364
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:44,639
quite at cookies where everything took a

365
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:46,638
big swing but it wasn't much long after

366
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,399
cookies came around that that the forum

367
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,519
the whole idea forms kind of changed but

368
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,839
i think that also had to do with

369
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,000
instagram which is also why cookies kind

370
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,680
of even got even more blown up i think

371
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,278
uh social media

372
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,278
um yeah

373
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:01,039
the kind of the difference between the i

374
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,919
would say the forums

375
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:05,199
were

376
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:08,000
mostly writing with some pictures

377
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,560
where instagram flipped it 180 degrees

378
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,159
to being it's almost all pictures with a

379
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:14,078
little bit of writing

380
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:16,078
yeah so you see some of these old

381
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:17,599
write-ups that people have and their

382
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:18,879
paragraphs and you know they're like a

383
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,320
small essay

384
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:24,958
yeah right where people ask me stuff all

385
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,000
the time on ig and it's really hard

386
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,000
because it's like what are you going to

387
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,839
write a novel in the comments

388
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,039
yeah yeah it's kind of like you're

389
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,800
trying to write something that's like

390
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:36,480
this long like what can i yeah it's like

391
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:38,799
a haiku yes how can i get my my thing

392
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,079
across in like x amount of syllables or

393
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:41,759
four sentences

394
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:43,439
yeah yeah you kind of have to especially

395
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,720
if you're on twitter right and then and

396
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,399
then you end up and then you end up

397
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,560
leaving on a lot of nuance in detail

398
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,799
where on the forum era people could like

399
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:52,000
write three or four paragraphs each back

400
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:54,078
and forth

401
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,480
and some like kemke could write really

402
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:58,719
really just

403
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,519
bad really bad

404
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,120
un illegible stuff for paragraphs and

405
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,240
paragraphs i mean when you write

406
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:09,440
paragraphs you really realize why we

407
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,600
invented punctuation yeah for sure you

408
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:15,040
know why we invented paragraphs in the

409
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,800
first place spacing periods commas all

410
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,599
the various aspects it really helps

411
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:19,120
because

412
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,879
yeah you know one one of the things that

413
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:25,039
hurts you online is that um nuance gets

414
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:26,720
lost yeah it does are you being

415
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:28,159
sarcastic

416
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,000
yeah are you being funny what's your

417
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:32,639
body language

418
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,039
you know all those types of things

419
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,879
you know um yeah that was actually a

420
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:38,958
good point uh you know in the overgrow

421
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:41,360
era digital cameras

422
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:42,399
um you know didn't exist

423
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,720
yeah

424
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,559
i mean i was talking i was actually

425
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,000
talking about that in the

426
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:49,359
in the one that you missed because you

427
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,360
were you know you were otherwise

428
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,278
occupied where it was like

429
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,759
people documenting their stuff really

430
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:58,559
advanced a lot more when digital cameras

431
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:01,600
came out oh yeah and then exponentially

432
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:03,838
once uh phones had cameras yeah once

433
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,680
phones had cameras it was all bets off

434
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,000
the era where you had to get your own

435
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:09,838
stuff developed

436
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,078
that's unsadly it's not oh yeah i can

437
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,720
only imagine it's not very documented i

438
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:16,159
mean i was at i was at csi's house i

439
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,360
don't know half a year ago or something

440
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:19,600
like that we were looking through a

441
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,278
couple of boxes of his um

442
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,759
uh polaroids

443
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:26,958
right yeah but they fade

444
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:28,319
yeah that cat sucks

445
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:29,919
you know and maybe if he would have kept

446
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,759
them in some kind of like

447
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:33,439
perfectly sealed environment with the

448
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,039
right humidity or something like that

449
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,920
you know but yeah you're looking at

450
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:40,399
polaroids from 95 or six or seven or

451
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:42,078
whatever and a lot of them the colors

452
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,159
are bleeding into each other and it's

453
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:46,559
hard to make it's not

454
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:48,240
it's not you know it's not shark

455
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:50,479
yeah

456
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,839
you know yeah that sucks that sucks bad

457
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,839
i would have never guessed that until he

458
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,079
told me that yeah i mean you know he's

459
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,839
got a couple shoe boxes full yeah and i

460
00:15:56,078 --> 00:15:59,359
was busting his chops to get him [ __ ]

461
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,800
scanned i was like you got to get those

462
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,480
scanned at least for history he's like

463
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:05,278
don't do any good

464
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,399
i mean i you know i had my i had my my

465
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:10,399
uh my first daughter in 09 you know and

466
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,879
i think and i can look back on my phone

467
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,679
i think you know the first real camera

468
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:18,078
on an iphone came out no 8.

469
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:19,679
oh wow yeah i don't remember yeah laid

470
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:21,519
out late08

471
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:23,838
you know and and that's kind of that

472
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,600
that was a revolution in itself

473
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,040
oh i'm sure because now you can just

474
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,879
pull it out of your pocket and be like

475
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:30,240
there's my weed plant click

476
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:32,000
it's always amazing that with all these

477
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,039
cell phones we don't really see many

478
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,559
like real documented ufo pics i know i'm

479
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:38,000
it's kind of off tangent but i just

480
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:39,758
thought about that

481
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,320
well i will say

482
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,959
as a as as a you know somebody who's

483
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,639
pulled a lot of tarps in their day

484
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:48,638
that you know a lot of times when you

485
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,720
pull tarp on you you're doing light

486
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,959
depth you're you're pulling tarp at six

487
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,519
or seven o'clock at night right yeah and

488
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:57,599
then you go back out there after dark

489
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,120
which in june might be 9 30 or 10

490
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,959
o'clock at night

491
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,560
right to pull the tarp off so everything

492
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:04,318
can breathe because you only want to

493
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:06,000
darken it for as much as you need to

494
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:08,720
right oh yeah and you don't want to trap

495
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,160
in all that moisture and all that right

496
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,078
so you got to go out there and you know

497
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,000
mendo or whatever in the woods

498
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:16,639
and sometimes i would see the most

499
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,400
beautiful skies the most beautiful moons

500
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:23,038
just yeah and your phone could not show

501
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,280
you what my eyes could see oh yeah for

502
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:26,558
sure i would take i would take you know

503
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:28,318

no

528
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:21,038
you know it took a long time for

phones to even begin to catch up to like

530
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:26,960
what 35 millimeter could do you're

531
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:29,600
busting my skeptical comet not so

532
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:33,440
know crushing my skepticism

533
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:35,759
i fully believe that there are aliens

534
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,360
i just disbelieve most people that tell

535
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:39,839
try to tell me a bunch of facts about

536

ever been near earth you know like i i

539
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:49,440

540
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:51,599
comes in when people start writing

541
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,400
getting like very long youtubes about

542

the different you know what was kind of

588
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:35,120
going around post 2006 it was the end of

589
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:38,000
the overgrow era end of the cannabis

590
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:39,359
world era and maybe maybe uh you could

591
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,640
talk about some of the things that you

592
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:45,599
saw during those those uh that integral

593
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:49,600
period between the end of overgrow and

594
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:51,038
the beginning of things like the farm

595
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:52,879
what kind of what kind of strains were

596
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:55,279
people [ __ ] with around then what was

597
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,960
the hot [ __ ] uh

598
00:20:55,279 --> 00:21:01,038
are are you talking about like oh six on

599
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,798
oh six to like oh six to oh eight

600
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:04,798
somewhere in there yeah yeah yeah yeah i

601
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:06,798
mean i think that's when chemdawg really

602
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:07,759
started becoming unpopular

603
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:09,679
yeah

604
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:12,000
um chemd

605
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,360
came out i i think i honestly think that

606
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,880
that's the year

607
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:18,399
uh you know

608
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:21,200
mass g uh posted up on icy mag although

609
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,759
that's right that threat is gone

610
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,279
oh is that threat gone i did my research

611
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:27,919
i think it's like

612
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:30,158
is that the the creation of sour d1

613
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,600
no no no that's that was the overgrowth

614
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,480
that was okay

615
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:34,798
so

616
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,360
yeah that that's well long gone unless

617
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:38,158
somebody has a archives

618
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:41,119

622
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,640

671
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,720
and uh

672
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,079
pollinated a bunch of stuff

673
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,038
on purpose

674
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,199
yeah

675
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:38,000
but that that was just that freak thing

676
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,480
so

677
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,960
yeah now it's canada it can't it kind of

678
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,319
counts it counts it does count it was

679
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,640
with intention

680
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:49,278
yeah yeah i mean there there there i did

681
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,880
have some friends that i mean we didn't

682
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:53,359
use i didn't we didn't know anything

683
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,120
about any of the any of the chems you

684
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:57,199
could spray on plants

685
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:58,399
but people used to try to torture their

686
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,720
plants

687
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,559
to get them to free if it was if you

688
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,159
knew it can herb

689
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:06,319
sometimes you could put it into too

690
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,480
small of a pot you could let it get dry

691
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:11,119
you could beat it up a bit you could try

692
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,519
to collect see if it could throw some

693
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:14,639
that was like the that was like our way

694
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:16,720
of

695
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,200
you know right can you beat it up enough

696
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,440
to get some pollen off it remember uh

697
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,519
soma's someone's way you just flour them

698
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,038
out for like 80 or 90 days and get a

699
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:26,400
couple bananas

700
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:27,839
yeah wrote

701
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,400
it

702
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:30,399
yeah yeah

703
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,079
i don't know where he got that term from

704
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,440
for it but yeah i remember

705
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:37,918
yeah

706
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,080
yeah he's a special guy

707
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,400
actually i did like as when his book

708
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:44,798
came out or whatever i do like the soma

709
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,798
beds

710
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,278
they were interesting they were

711
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:52,079
interesting they're just they're just

712
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:53,038
deep indoor beds on wheels

713
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:54,960
you know

714
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:55,839
is basically what they were

715
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,679
um

716
00:24:55,839 --> 00:25:00,079
you know with with you know some

717
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,679
drainage in the bottom and some layering

718
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:03,278
you know maybe they have some rocks and

719
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,400
they have some like and then they have a

720
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:06,558
layer of

721
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,798
of uh ground cover or something and then

722
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:10,798
you put soil on top and

723
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:11,599
and they have you ever seen

724
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:13,599
huh

725
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:16,158
they had the air tubes on them in all

726
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:18,639
four corners where the air kicked down

727
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:21,440
to the lower roots you would put like

728
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,360
big pieces of pvc with holes drilled in

729
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,640
and you would put those on the side and

730
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:27,199
those would go all the way in the

731
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,960
corners to the bottom yeah so that you

732
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,640
would actually and that would connect to

733
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,240
the gravel at the bottom so that you

734
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,720
could bring air

735
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,159
yeah yeah yeah it wasn't the worst idea

736
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,759
no no no

737
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,760
i've done that

738
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:41,359
and especially for well it's not so much

739
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:43,519
you had to go trees

740
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:44,959
you know i mean you know look out look

741
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:46,879
at look at a bunch of you could you

742
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,519
could actually grow a bed

743
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,360
with it you know homie style with 25 or

744
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:53,440
30 plants if you wanted

745
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:54,639
yeah right right right you know and then

746
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,640
you didn't have to worry about

747
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,640
individual ones dying

748
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,720
right right because you just water the

749
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,679
bed and everything stays alive

750
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,679
oh yeah

751
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,880
i used to use those no drain beds way

752
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,240
back in uh

753
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:11,039
2000 or so i didn't know drink beds

754
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,480
just shallow like six inches deep heads

755
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:14,400
you know

756
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,839
how'd that work out

757
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,320
i did pretty good

758
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:20,000
yeah yeah yeah um definitely some

759
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:22,319
interesting stuff

760
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,640
uh that was back in my not so organic

761
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:24,639
days

762
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:34,879

buds get as big as they want

770
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:50,959

and it's going to make it happy and i've

777
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:07,200
been organic for five months already you

778
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:09,439
know so it'll all flush out at the end

779
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,080
and it's definitely still organic

780
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,960
uh yeah that stuff was tough

781
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:14,558

782
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,840

785
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,159
heady version

786
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:26,960

788
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,640
it was canadian it was it was it was it

789
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,600
was one of those you know powdered

790
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,960
whatever

791
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:34,158
it was all this it was all the same

792
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,558
there was a bunch of people that came

793
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,080
out with zero fifty thirty and tried to

794
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:39,599
make it seem like their zero fifty

795
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:41,359
thirty was special

796
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:44,319
all right mono so the one thing i'll say

797
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:46,879
about the the bud blaster is that

798
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:48,639
they had a they had their own special

799
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,720
grinder

800
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,720
so their powder was super fine and it

801
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,600
actually dissolved

802
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,278
ah some of the cheap stuff you get there

803
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:58,719
in like a thousand gallon tank or

804
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:00,640
whatever and you're up on a ladder and

805
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,399
you're dumping stuff like that in there

806
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,559
and then you get some softballs at the

807
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:07,278
bottom that you're like wondering how to

808
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:09,200
hit with a stick to break up

809
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:12,079
because it wouldn't actually dissolve

810
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,000
yeah you know right so but that's off

811
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:16,398
topic you know i suppose we should

812
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,359
probably ratchet back around

813
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:19,439
um

814
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:21,439
so we got to convince we got to convince

815
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,440
caleb and matt to talk because this is

816
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:26,798

855
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,278

856
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:02,879
on like on dead door and stuff like that

857
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:05,038
because everybody you know everybody had

858
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,000
a nickname yeah

859
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:06,879
yeah

860
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,480
you know

861
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,919
everybody had a nickname

862
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,000
so

863
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,840
um

864
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,480
but yeah i mean maybe maybe you guys

865
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:18,720
could talk about like you know uh

866
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,319
who who who were some of the big i don't

867
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,679
want to say the word influencer maybe

868
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:24,079
but who are some of the people that were

869
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:26,399
sort of like driving the conversations

870
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:28,720
who were you excited to hear

871
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:30,558
you know posting on stuff

872
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,798
like and then maybe just like how hard

873
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:34,960
it was to get information back then

874
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:36,398
because a lot of these forums

875
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,558
you know you guys were talking about the

876
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:40,479
chem dog you know there was an aspect

877
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:42,879
where the reason why you know somebody

878
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:46,079
like you know skunk va has his name or

879
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,039
chem dog 101 or any of these things is

880
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:49,359
because

881
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:51,119
at some form or another on icmag or

882
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:53,199
whatever it was the first time these

883
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:54,398
things started getting argued about and

884
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,038
debated

885
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:58,239
yeah by people outside and a lot of

886
00:30:57,038 --> 00:30:59,679
times

887
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,519
what happens too

888
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,120
is that these things become references

889
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:04,798
because then you've got

890
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:07,439
this guy comes out and says this thing

891
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:09,278
on ic mag at this year

892
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,000
and then three years later on whatever

893
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:16,159
on roll it up let's say he's saying this

894
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,079
and now on ig he said this and this

895
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,840
you know and they always they always

896
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:21,678
want to be like this is the most current

897
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:24,639
story this is what you should believe

898
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:26,159
yeah yeah and in some cases those forms

899
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,320
don't exist anymore and they're very

900
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:31,120
fortunate that they don't and you know

901
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:33,839
one of the one of the ways that uh csi

902
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:36,000
got his reputation as inspector as he

903
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:37,519
was really good at at using your own

904
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,359
words against you

905
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,200
yeah

906
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:42,959
well i just but i just mean in the sense

907
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,200
of someone would like confidently say

908
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,840
this this this and this and then he

909
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,440
would be like well why did you write

910
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:52,079
in your own words

911
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,840
that bastard this right how do you how

912
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:54,798
do you make these two things come

913
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:57,038
together

914
00:31:54,798 --> 00:31:58,240
i've got a bunch of swerve quotes i can

915
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:00,398
share

916
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,000
oh yeah

917
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:03,119
you know and and that's a lot of things

918
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,679
most people probably don't even know who

919
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:07,359
swerve is but there's been there's been

920
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,960
a bunch of people

921
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:11,519
you know that come that you know flash

922
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,440
in the pans that come and go yeah they

923
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,919
come up they have their moment they they

924
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,120
they spew a bunch of [ __ ] they make a

925
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,038
bunch of money

926
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:20,719
all of a sudden their stories start to

927
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:21,440
implode

928
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,798
right

929
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,278
yeah

930
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:26,720
and you know in some cases they rebrand

931
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:30,240
themselves

932
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,679
and so it again to the to the new badge

933
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,519
right right

934
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,200
you know

935
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,960
who i looked up to is going to be a lot

936
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,798
different than maybe who caleb looked up

937
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,880
to because when i first started coming

938
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:43,440

00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:52,240
influencing really well that that had

943
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:53,200
some respect during those years

944
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,200
um

945
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,919

pretty big and still had a good name a

982
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:12,799
lot of the stuff i was looking at when i

983
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,878
came in was was dutch stuff i really

984
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,359
didn't focus a lot on americans at the

985
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:19,039
time because i just didn't i wasn't hit

986
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:20,719
to it you know i hadn't right when i

987
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:22,159
came in i wasn't hit to the fact that

988
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,199
all those dudes were white labeling and

989
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,838
most the americans were making their

990
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:26,799
seeds or spanish or actually back then i

991
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:29,679
don't even know who was making their

992
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,119
[ __ ] seeds you know right but

993
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,280
yeah i mean

994
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:35,200
it was very different i mean uh

995
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,639
greenhouse hadn't been totally trashed

996
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,239
it was still kind of under the radar for

997
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,639
new people at the time

998
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:41,519
that that they were doing anything

999
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,559
you know

1000
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:45,759
untoward dna was massive during those

1001
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:47,358
years

1002
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,200
they were why i started doing six seeds

1003
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:50,398
of pack because their [ __ ] was six seeds

1004
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,000
a pack and they were the ones selling

1005
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:54,000
the most so i was like okay i guess

1006
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,119
that's what you do you know what i mean

1007
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,440
right um

1008
00:34:55,119 --> 00:35:00,320
yeah and then sub cool of course it just

1009
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,960
started [ __ ] taking off and i was

1010
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,200
fortunate that i met sonny chiba um very

1011
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,358
early on so i learned very quickly oh

1012
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:10,078
maybe that guy isn't someone i should be

1013
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:12,400
looking at for breeding tips you know

1014
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:14,560
right right it took me a while but i got

1015
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,960
it but yeah that's it was it was a much

1016
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:18,639
different take yeah

1017
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,639
it's interesting then because that's

1018
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:21,838
kind of when everybody first came out of

1019
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:23,440
the shadows

1020
00:35:21,838 --> 00:35:26,400
yeah and you could walk out of the

1021
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,480
shadows with any stories you wanted

1022
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,519
about yourself or the strains or

1023
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,280
whatever else and a lot of times you

1024
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:36,559
were the only person

1025
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,079
um you know from sam skunk man on

1026
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:39,920
yeah you were the only per you were the

1027
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,519
only person telling the story about

1028
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,440
those strengths

1029
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:48,000
right right i mean you remember huh

1030
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,838
the audience was so small finding people

1031
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,880
who are actually there

1032
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:53,119
you know

1033
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,880
was was very difficult

1034
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,559
yeah it was it was a lot smaller than

1035
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,720
now i just don't you think people that

1036
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:01,039
came later can grasp how small the

1037
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:04,319
community was

1038
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:06,639
and how slow information was

1039
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,240
now it's pretty rapid fire

1040
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:10,159
right you know and a lot of people

1041
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:13,118
connect all the time

1042
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:14,000
um oh yeah somebody said crunch bubble

1043
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,720
you know

1044
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,639
uh that guy i mean he that guy used to

1045
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:19,759
move massive amounts of what was it blue

1046
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:21,598
dot

1047
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,000
through the third floor in oakland you

1048
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,838
know he had all those warehouses of 600

1049
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,320
watt

1050
00:36:24,838 --> 00:36:29,920
hps's on hydro tables

1051
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,320
bumping out a bunch of stuff for third

1052
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:35,039
floor but it was you know what what's

1053
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,640
funny about that guy is that some of

1054
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:38,639
those pictures were like some of the

1055
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:41,358
first warehouse scenes that people were

1056
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:42,319
willing to like throw up on ig on on the

1057
00:36:41,358 --> 00:36:43,119
internet

1058
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,200
yeah

1059
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:47,680
most people were growing in closets or

1060
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:49,759
bedrooms or greenhouses or in the woods

1061
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:51,598
or wherever and all of a sudden you see

1062
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,359
a 40 lighter

1063
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,280
right and for a lot of people that was

1064
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:56,078
the first time

1065
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,480
right

1066
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:01,280
it might look rudimentary now

1067
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:03,199
yeah now but yeah but even just then 0.5

1068
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,480
or 0-6 or something like that you know

1069
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:06,319
finding people

1070
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:09,119
and i think too that like what most

1071
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:11,200
people don't understand maybe is that a

1072
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:13,519
lot of the a lot of the breeders like

1073
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:15,279
that got famous later like a couple

1074
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:17,199
people on the show or whatever like

1075
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:21,519
almost all the breeders

1076
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:23,919
were european or american or canadian

1077
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:25,280
yeah right and the people that were

1078
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,838
working

1079
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:31,200
breeding in america were generally doing

1080
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:31,199
it through friendship circles

1081
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,800
there was a lot of trading and via dm

1082
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:39,519
amongst friends and amongst

1083
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,920
contemporaries it wasn't like

1084
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:44,159
like on you know at least from what i

1085
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,720
remember it wasn't like oh i've got a

1086
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:48,639
big drop coming next friday

1087
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:50,480
here's the fifth here's the 15. here's

1088
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:52,960
the names i made up for them here's the

1089
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:55,358
hybrids here's where you can get them

1090
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,679
here's how we're going to sell them all

1091
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:59,759
it was like you know you trade seeds

1092
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:01,679
when you saw people or people were trade

1093
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,960
selling them via dm or something like

1094
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:05,919
that like but

1095
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:08,000
it was different um i remember

1096
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,400
as far as americans went there was not a

1097
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,159
lot of americans doing direct sales on

1098
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,720
websites you would never really see that

1099
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:16,559
like it was all done you know dms or

1100
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:18,480
like on weird little auction sites that

1101
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:19,920
were floating around but other than that

1102
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,159
there wasn't a really good way to market

1103
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,320
yourself as an american breeder without

1104
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:27,759
mostly giving seeds away to people i

1105
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,640
mean did you have that experience csi

1106
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,520
i

1107
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:34,480
i didn't get involved in any of i wanted

1108
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:36,639
to back in the 0.608 era

1109
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,838
i looked into it but

1110
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:39,358
um

1111
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:41,599
you know i was i was still way way too

1112
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:43,920
paranoid to do any of that stuff yeah

1113
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:47,039
i i should have done it you know like

1114
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,480
you know dna and subcool and hell even

1115
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:49,599
swerve you know

1116
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,280
yeah

1117
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,960
you know uh

1118
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,359
i mean all those guys

1119
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:57,760
you know made huge names because there

1120
00:38:55,358 --> 00:38:59,838
wasn't competition yeah there was no

1121
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,839
competition you didn't really have to

1122
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:03,679
have a whole lot of talent to be very

1123
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:06,000
successful

1124
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:09,759
someone just said mr soul handled all of

1125
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,760
sssc in the 80s

1126
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,559
well you know so i mean what's

1127
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,159
interesting about that is that you know

1128
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:19,440
there's been a lot there's been a lot of

1129
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:21,679
talk about american sssc right

1130
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,079
and you know matt and myself got to

1131
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:26,639
interview uh the owner

1132
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:28,079
uh who was very cool and

1133
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:29,118
you know all that kind of stuff got put

1134
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:32,160
to rest

1135
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:34,000
yeah hard the part wasn't there wasn't

1136
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:36,480
any american help no but not for

1137
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,719
maneuver but it goes but it goes to show

1138
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,880
how you know in our world you can kind

1139
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:43,118
of step out of the shadows and be like

1140
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,480
oh i mean there was a lot of people

1141
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:46,000
uh that

1142
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,440
you know they came out of the shadows

1143
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,559
and they were the first time that people

1144
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,599
were like you know oh i'm i this is my

1145
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:53,279
cut

1146
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,280
yeah and then it turns out that they

1147
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,839
just got the cut early

1148
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,200
yeah but they got a few years of like oh

1149
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:01,920
if you want to use my cut you got to

1150
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:03,759
give me 50 of the proceeds of the seeds

1151
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,318
or you got to pay me or you got to this

1152
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:09,119
or you got to that it's my work it's my

1153
00:40:06,318 --> 00:40:10,559
my my my and then it comes out later

1154
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,800
that they just got it from these other

1155
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:14,559
people early but they were the first one

1156
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,880
to go public

1157
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:18,639
right you know and a lot of times what

1158
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,920
happened is is that the first person to

1159
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:22,318
go public

1160
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,400
um you know got credit

1161
00:40:22,318 --> 00:40:26,400
yeah

1162
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,720
yeah you know um you know they got

1163
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,680
credit and their story was the story for

1164
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:31,358
a minute

1165
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:33,679
and sometimes other people would get

1166
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:35,759
upset and get online and start you know

1167
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:37,759

1176
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:57,039
right and then that and then that got

1177
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:58,719

00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:02,959
up or like even linked or even realized

1180
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:04,239
what was going on after 15 years to

1181
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,559
connect

1182
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:09,519
right because stories

1183
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:10,239
707 seed bank uh shaw bud he's the one

1184
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:14,000

1185
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:16,799
you know got uh skunk va onto overgrow

1186
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,318
and icymag to actually post about that

1187
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,839
stuff otherwise

1188
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:21,679
i think there'd be a completely

1189
00:41:19,838 --> 00:41:24,318
different chem dog history

1190
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:25,440
oh yeah if he hadn't done that

1191
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:28,000
you know

1192
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,159
do we remember what the very very first

1193
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,280
claim of the chem dog seeds not

1194
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:33,759
necessarily the first one people

1195
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,519
remember but the very first claims of

1196
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,119
kim dog who was the first one to claim

1197
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:38,639
that strain was it even greg or were

1198
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:40,318
there other people popping up as it was

1199
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:41,920
getting popular going that's mine i've

1200
00:41:40,318 --> 00:41:45,039
read that [ __ ]

1201
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:47,039
i don't remember anybody claiming it

1202
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:50,318
um lots of people claiming they had the

1203
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:51,679
91 or oh yeah yeah sure that there's

1204
00:41:50,318 --> 00:41:53,039
just like well

1205
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:55,039
i don't know how all these different

1206
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:56,800
cuts could be the right one

1207
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:58,960
oh you know because it's purple that's

1208
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,599
how you know when it purps

1209
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:04,639
i i saw a few chem dog cats and

1210
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:06,960
they they uh uh some of them look like

1211
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:08,078
mass super skunk chem dogs

1212
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,079
yeah

1213
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,839
but that that just basically means

1214
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,640
somebody bought some weed

1215
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:15,039
that

1216
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:17,519
was was called chem dog and it had some

1217
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:18,960
seeds in it and whatever had pollinated

1218
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:20,639
that chem dog

1219
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,400
you know kim dog's not a bad

1220
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:23,920
hermaphrodite just by itself i mean not

1221
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,920
so nice

1222
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,680
you know no and

1223
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,358
so usually if you find seeds in your

1224
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:32,480
creme dog you know

1225
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:33,519
it's been pollinated by something else

1226
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,880
yeah

1227
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:36,960
well there was there was also a thing

1228
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,720
too that was that was really confusing i

1229
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,119
think and this isn't anything against

1230
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:42,719
greg or chemdog but you know

1231
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:45,039
it's it's like for people that want

1232
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:47,358
specific lineages

1233
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:50,318
he was pretty famous for when you buy

1234
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:52,318
weed you're buying chem dog weed

1235
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:54,159
from chem dog

1236
00:42:52,318 --> 00:42:55,358
it didn't really matter exactly what it

1237
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:57,759
was

1238
00:42:55,358 --> 00:42:59,440
it was weed from chem dog and so i think

1239
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,960
that created confusion too because

1240
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,200
everyone was like oh it's this one

1241
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,159
specific thing

1242
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:06,318
you know

1243
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:08,159
um but it really was chem doc yeah it's

1244
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:10,400
just branding i mean back then branding

1245
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:12,000
was branding you know it was it was it

1246
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,318
was early it was an early form of

1247
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,199
branding yeah for sure

1248
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:16,960
you know

1249
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:19,439
and people weren't and a lot of these

1250
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,960
guys were young and nobody knew

1251
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,480
especially then when things first

1252
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,000
started getting famous

1253
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:25,280
i don't think anybody knew that some of

1254
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,920
these strains were going to be so

1255
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:30,319
lastingly famous

1256
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,159
so a lot of times they wrote down

1257
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:34,239
various stories or this or that they

1258
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:36,318
didn't really expect it to get

1259
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:39,118
become part of canon or become part of

1260
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:40,239
the fabric of the tale

1261
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:42,240
and then they have to look back and

1262
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:43,279
defend it

1263
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:45,679
you know

1264
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:47,200
um and you know it's hard for people

1265
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:48,480
sometimes to say you know my memory was

1266
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:49,598
a little that's what i remembered at the

1267
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,199
time

1268
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,640
you know right after more after more

1269
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:54,799
information came out and i talked to

1270
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:56,879
more friends i kind of revised a little

1271
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,240
bit because other people had it's hard

1272
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,160
for people to say that a lot of times

1273
00:43:58,239 --> 00:44:01,838
people would dig in their heels

1274
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:03,440
yeah and then you've got two or three or

1275
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:06,559
four versions of the story and you're

1276
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:08,800
trying to figure out which one works

1277
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:10,639
which one is the most believable

1278
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,200
right right you know what what's your

1279
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:15,358
favorite wildest story

1280
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:17,279
um from the forum errors that you knew i

1281
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:19,598
mean you that that you knew was kind of

1282
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,440
like that's too [ __ ] stupid to even

1283
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:23,200
be possible do you have any that stick

1284
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:27,280
out where you're like that was a bold

1285
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:27,279
[ __ ] claim and really wonky

1286
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:31,838
what comes to mind when i say that

1287
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:35,520
um okay so

1288
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:37,519
i hate to keep bringing up my boy swerve

1289
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:38,480
it doesn't really have a whole lot to do

1290
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:41,440
with him

1291
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:44,760
but the guy he got pretty much most all

1292
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:46,400
of his early og cuts from in

1293
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,280
0607

1294
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,838
um

1295
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:52,640
this guy

1296
00:44:48,838 --> 00:44:53,679
uh had an account on icmag

1297
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:56,480
and

1298
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:58,799
then he made up another account and i

1299
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:01,440
think this was in 07

1300
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:04,640
and oh he made up another account

1301
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:06,559
pretending to be his own mentor you know

1302
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:07,920
with all the same spelling errors all

1303
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:11,519
the same you know

1304
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:13,920
type styles all that and

1305
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:16,400
he made a whole thread on it and acted

1306
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:19,119
like you know he was the original

1307
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,800
creator of the uj kush blah blah blah

1308
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:22,640

1309
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,960

king pretty much made that strange very

1332
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,599
much so yeah known it wasn't a

1333
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:19,920
well-known strain i don't think was it

1334
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:22,640
no no no no

1335
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,559
and you know he he talked about the

1336
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:29,039
rarity and how this guy never lets it

1337
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:31,358
out blah blah blah a few years later um

1338
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:33,119
a person that we we know who it was but

1339
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:35,519
i don't think he'll ever admit it

1340
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:39,358
right went on and tried to say that she

1341
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:42,159
was the the wife of the man who held

1342
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:44,318
asian fantasy and he has died and she

1343
00:46:42,159 --> 00:46:46,480
wants to get those genetics out there

1344
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:49,119
you know and ended up i think it's

1345
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,719
pretty sure it was nyc kid um

1346
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:52,480
kind of big upping himself trying to

1347
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:54,879
give himself some provenance on a cut

1348
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:57,119
he'd never had access to

1349
00:46:54,880 --> 00:47:00,000
well we don't honestly we don't know

1350
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:01,200
that part of it because

1351
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,400
who

1352
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:03,919
have you

1353
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,720
or anybody

1354
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,920
ever seen this asian fantasy keyword

1355
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:10,879
fantasy

1356
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:13,200
outside of the candle bible and

1357
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,079
nyc kid and his crew

1358
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:15,199
no

1359
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:17,839
i mean

1360
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:19,838
it's kind of a fantastic yeah yeah and

1361
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:21,358
in fact african black magic i mean

1362
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:23,519
there's some there's some pictures of it

1363
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:25,199
or whatever but i mean jason king even

1364
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:26,639
talked about how homey wouldn't give it

1365
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:28,879
out to anyone

1366
00:47:26,639 --> 00:47:30,960
and you know was it was a massive

1367
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,720
hoarder of it you know

1368
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,159
and so there's an aspect to it there too

1369
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:36,318
where it's like people

1370
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:38,639
people can hoard something so much that

1371
00:47:36,318 --> 00:47:40,800
it doesn't become famous

1372
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:42,480
yeah right you know because nobody ever

1373
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,079
sees it like before

1374
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,079
before this forum time that you were

1375
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:47,680
talking about there was probably like

1376
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,359
you know four or five people or

1377
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:51,199
something in california that had the

1378
00:47:49,358 --> 00:47:53,838
chem 91.

1379
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:56,558
someone just said i have asian fantasy s

1380
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:59,039
ones from t h gobs so we're still doing

1381
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:00,400
it go nyc kid you go

1382
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:03,039
but yeah i mean it was like one of those

1383
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:04,639
things where like if you know if if og

1384
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:06,880
kush if some of the if some of these

1385
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:09,039
famous things don't slip out

1386
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,640
and people don't start cropping them you

1387
00:48:09,039 --> 00:48:12,719
know there was an aspect where it was

1388
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:15,759
like for a long time there was only four

1389
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:18,399
or five garages pumping chem 91

1390
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:20,800
mm-hmm yeah like every you know so how

1391
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,079
much weed is that not very much

1392
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:24,079
it doesn't really give you very much

1393
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:26,400
opportunity to try it it doesn't really

1394
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:27,680
get give you an opportunity for like a

1395
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,400
fad to

1396
00:48:27,679 --> 00:48:32,239
you know like if og hadn't snuck out if

1397
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:35,039
all those guys hadn't been money hungry

1398
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:36,799
down there in l.a and it snuck out it

1399
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:38,079
probably wouldn't have had that kind of

1400
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:41,359
impact

1401
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:43,359
yeah because it has to be there

1402
00:48:41,358 --> 00:48:44,960
you have to be able to get at even even

1403
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:46,838
if you have to pay a lot for it you do

1404
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:49,599
have to be able to access

1405
00:48:46,838 --> 00:48:51,440
it right so asian fantasy is one of

1406
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:53,280
those things where like it

1407
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,838
you know um

1408
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,839
it never got out and then so as a result

1409
00:48:55,838 --> 00:48:59,519
of that it allowed scammers to be like

1410
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:01,039
this is it

1411
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:02,480
right and how could you tell the

1412
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:04,000
difference

1413
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,079
hey um

1414
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,920
you know you you still

1415
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:09,440
you still buddies with the

1416
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,880
with old jason

1417
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,039
mr king

1418
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:15,599
um i haven't spoken to him in a minute

1419
00:49:13,039 --> 00:49:19,759
but we're cool yeah he lives on maui

1420
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:20,720
i know uh i wonder if you can uh ask him

1421
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,880
kind of

1422
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:26,318
maybe some of because i talked to him

1423
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,440
before i like met you met you yeah

1424
00:49:26,318 --> 00:49:28,719
you know he

1425
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,559
he uh

1426
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:32,719
he affirmed that you know all my

1427
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:34,480
information was right and then he was

1428
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:36,000
like where'd you where'd you find all

1429
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,358
this stuff out

1430
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,199
you know

1431
00:49:37,358 --> 00:49:41,119
i mean he might know some some

1432
00:49:39,199 --> 00:49:43,358
background details that you know

1433
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:44,720
definitely didn't make it into the book

1434
00:49:43,358 --> 00:49:46,078
yeah i bet

1435
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:47,598
one of the one i've been actually

1436
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,200
thinking about reaching out and talking

1437
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:52,000
to him because one of the things that's

1438
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:54,480
interesting is that he probably has a

1439
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,440
[ __ ] ton of pictures

1440
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:59,280
uh of weed from myself and my and some

1441
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,679
and friends and then people that i don't

1442
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:03,119
know obviously too but um that didn't

1443
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:05,279
make it in the book

1444
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:07,119
yeah because you know you might take you

1445
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:09,359
know dozens or hundreds of pictures or

1446
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:11,358
something and then two make it

1447
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:15,279
yeah you pick a couple

1448
00:50:11,358 --> 00:50:16,239
um you know uh and and all that but he

1449
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,920
um

1450
00:50:16,239 --> 00:50:19,519
you know and i think i think the asian

1451
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:22,079
fantasy that he was talking about was in

1452
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:22,079
hawaii

1453
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:27,039
i want to say i remember and i could be

1454
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,720
totally wrong so maybe i shouldn't say

1455
00:50:27,039 --> 00:50:31,920
it but i think i think bodhi knows the

1456
00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:33,358
asian fantasy person maybe

1457
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,559
i might be wrong

1458
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:36,400
hmm

1459
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:38,480
i don't know i'm gonna ask him

1460
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,920
i'll figure it out i mean to me it's one

1461
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:42,719
of those it's one of those like

1462
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:44,159

1470
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,480

uh-huh yeah so i told this story before

1495
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:48,160
but like it got mailed to one of our

1496
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:51,440
spots

1497
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:53,118
uh-huh so uh jason king's i don't think

1498
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,639
it's shady to say this but his

1499
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:56,079
girlfriend at the time was this chick

1500
00:51:54,639 --> 00:51:58,960
named rebecca

1501
00:51:56,079 --> 00:52:01,039
yeah and she was from asheville area of

1502
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,159
north carolina

1503
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:04,639
and so

1504
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:07,279
she you know he used to rave about that

1505
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:10,000
cut all the time and so she finally got

1506
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:13,440
some of her friends to send it to us

1507
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,960
yeah right and dude it was like uh our

1508
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:17,039
buddy hi and lonesome has a terrible

1509
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:19,119
story uh but

1510
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:21,039
um it was kind of like that in the sense

1511
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:23,440
where i was expecting to get this tiny

1512
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:25,440
little box with some clones

1513
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,159
and we got this box that was like you

1514
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,800
know

1515
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:31,118
this big by two feet tall or whatever

1516
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:33,200
and it was two mothership plants in one

1517
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:36,240
gallon pots with steaks and each one was

1518
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:38,799
about 18 inches tall

1519
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:40,399
in 03 or something like that and it was

1520
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:42,640
like so all those pictures in the can of

1521
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,559
bible that you see of mothership

1522
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:47,279
those all came from those two moms that

1523
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:48,800
got mailed to us yeah and then we mom

1524
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:51,040
those out

1525
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,640
and uh you know it got they got grown at

1526
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:54,800
eddie left and they got grown to various

1527
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:56,318
friends houses and stuff like that so i

1528
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,839
actually had i actually i had the

1529
00:52:56,318 --> 00:52:59,279
mothership for four or five years i

1530
00:52:57,838 --> 00:53:00,480
think

1531
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,800
um

1532
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:05,838
and uh it wasn't

1533
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:07,280
i think it was a super unique plant uh

1534
00:53:05,838 --> 00:53:08,960
it wasn't one of i didn't have it didn't

1535
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,559
have the nicest flavor i didn't really

1536
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,838
like the flavor that much but it had a

1537
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:13,359
pretty cool high

1538
00:53:11,838 --> 00:53:16,000
and it did this weird thing where it

1539
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:17,920
would fall half over but then hold

1540
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,519
itself up

1541
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,760
so like you know how most branches if

1542
00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:23,599
they flop they flop

1543
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,599
it would like flop but then it would

1544
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:28,640
like raise itself up and it would grow

1545
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:31,359
sideways through your garden

1546
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:34,159
almost kind of a little like train wreck

1547
00:53:31,358 --> 00:53:36,960
it would get would catch itself

1548
00:53:34,159 --> 00:53:39,920
and and just like and it had like these

1549
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:42,240
it was a really odd sativa um

1550
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,838
it had thin leaves and it was big

1551
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:47,118
branchy thing

1552
00:53:43,838 --> 00:53:48,558
um but you know i mean i honestly like

1553
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:49,760
compared to

1554
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:52,240
all the other [ __ ] we've been talking

1555
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:55,920
about like bubbas and chems and you know

1556
00:53:52,239 --> 00:53:56,799
super skunk it was it was a little midsy

1557
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,960
you know

1558
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:00,559
uh in all reality but it was one of

1559
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,480
those things that probably like was

1560
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:04,240
genetically very different

1561
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:06,159
than everything else

1562
00:54:04,239 --> 00:54:07,439
so i like i like you know we like those

1563
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:09,279
weird things

1564
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:11,838
yeah it's real quick to touch back on

1565
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:13,200
elvis since you were you were on thc

1566
00:54:11,838 --> 00:54:14,558
farmers stuff for a long time right

1567
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:16,480
caleb

1568
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:17,760
or at least attentive to it

1569
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,440
um

1570
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:21,119
i was on the outskirts of the devil's

1571
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:24,159
harvest crew

1572
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:26,079
back in those days too and uh there was

1573
00:54:24,159 --> 00:54:28,318
there were some of those guys that one

1574
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:31,039
circulated through that crew

1575
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:33,358
a good bit and it it started uh i think

1576
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:35,199
iraq from maybe like

1577
00:54:33,358 --> 00:54:37,119
i don't know if i should say a state

1578
00:54:35,199 --> 00:54:39,439
that's a long time

1579
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:42,720
uh you know uh

1580
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:44,639
i think he's he circulated elvis for a

1581
00:54:42,719 --> 00:54:48,159
while through there i wouldn't be

1582
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:50,639
surprised if a doctor maybe had grown it

1583
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:52,639
was he uh he was he was real good

1584
00:54:50,639 --> 00:54:55,199
buddies with a lot of those cats

1585
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:58,558
and i mean the whole time i was i was

1586
00:54:55,199 --> 00:55:00,798
online i only i only traded cuts uh

1587
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:03,280
through the mail maybe tw uh i only

1588
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:04,798
received cuts through the mail twice i

1589
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:07,280
think

1590
00:55:04,798 --> 00:55:09,358
like you know 40 50 plus

1591
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:11,359
you know uh packages that cuts but i

1592
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:13,119
only received twice i did all my other

1593
00:55:11,358 --> 00:55:14,318
business just in person up and down the

1594
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:17,039
west coast

1595
00:55:14,318 --> 00:55:18,838
so that's me i'm very much

1596
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:22,558
i'm in

1597
00:55:18,838 --> 00:55:23,440
person miss elvis from the farm

1598
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:26,319
um

1599
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:28,798
i wasn't very active on the farm at all

1600
00:55:26,318 --> 00:55:30,400
very very little it was a person who

1601
00:55:28,798 --> 00:55:32,480
showed like they were the main person

1602
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,680
showing the the elvis cut back then

1603
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,960
there was something called like the pink

1604
00:55:33,679 --> 00:55:36,239
cadillac cut and then there was the

1605
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,240
elvis cut

1606
00:55:36,239 --> 00:55:40,399
um that's that's the only person i ever

1607
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:42,000
got it from but i never

1608
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,680
they disappeared like

1609
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,719
not even a month after giving it to me

1610
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:46,879
but they were the ones that were always

1611
00:55:44,719 --> 00:55:48,639
documenting it on the farm but i never

1612
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,440
knew if that was if it's just someone

1613
00:55:48,639 --> 00:55:50,159
from

1614
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,920
that

1615
00:55:50,159 --> 00:55:53,759
[ __ ] and made their way through

1616
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:56,318
because they disappeared so fast uh

1617
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:58,799
after me popping out and get it from him

1618
00:55:56,318 --> 00:56:01,119
was it super incidency

1619
00:55:58,798 --> 00:56:03,280
uh no it was exactly like what they talk

1620
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:07,119
about like a vinyl smell

1621
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:10,400
vinyl just artificial vinyl

1622
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:10,400
yeah not instantly at all

1623
00:56:10,639 --> 00:56:13,358
one of the things that's kind of

1624
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:15,519
interesting about that era too is it's

1625
00:56:13,358 --> 00:56:18,239
kind of like the last era before like

1626
00:56:15,519 --> 00:56:19,838
the the clone name dominance thing

1627
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:22,000
started happening

1628
00:56:19,838 --> 00:56:24,000
where everyone's growing og or

1629
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,039
everyone's growing sour or everyone's

1630
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,880
growing

1631
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:29,199
all that kind of stuff so there was a

1632
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,640
lot of these odd strains

1633
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:31,919
you know not odd in the sense that

1634
00:56:30,639 --> 00:56:33,440
there's anything wrong with them just

1635
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:36,720
odd odd

1636
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:39,039
random strains that were easily sold

1637
00:56:36,719 --> 00:56:40,639
you know and so they they people liked

1638
00:56:39,039 --> 00:56:42,239
him and they got traded

1639
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:44,000
yeah you know people weren't looking

1640
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:45,598
necessarily for like oh i need to get

1641
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,960
this specific cut because i'm going to

1642
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:48,400
be able to move it and it's going to go

1643
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:50,000
for x price

1644
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,160
you know they were more interested in

1645
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,639
like the legend or the history

1646
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:56,879
or whatever of said cut or the person

1647
00:56:54,639 --> 00:56:58,879
behind it and you could get on there and

1648
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,480
start talking about your cut

1649
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:02,000
and all of a sudden drum up a bunch of

1650
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:04,159
interest

1651
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,199
yeah and especially like if we wanted to

1652
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:06,639
go back

1653
00:57:05,199 --> 00:57:08,399
um you know when we were talking about

1654
00:57:06,639 --> 00:57:10,480
how small it was

1655
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:12,639
i mean think about how revolutionary you

1656
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:15,119
know just some some of matt's favorite

1657
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:16,960
some of blueberry stuff got you know and

1658
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:18,880
how it looked

1659
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:21,039
there wasn't that much competition there

1660
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:24,400
wasn't that much stuff outside of europe

1661
00:57:21,039 --> 00:57:26,639
or shanti or scentsy or you know uh

1662
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,639
simon from sirius or some of that stuff

1663
00:57:26,639 --> 00:57:30,078
like there wasn't that many american

1664
00:57:28,639 --> 00:57:31,358
breeders so the few people that were

1665
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:34,720
doing it like

1666
00:57:31,358 --> 00:57:36,159
like mr soul or or dj short or whoever

1667
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:38,399
that were willing

1668
00:57:36,159 --> 00:57:40,639
to to show their work i think it kind of

1669
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:43,838
got like outsized

1670
00:57:40,639 --> 00:57:46,159
you know outsized impact

1671
00:57:43,838 --> 00:57:49,279
you know like cindy 99 probably got way

1672
00:57:46,159 --> 00:57:49,279
more famous than it should have

1673
00:57:50,159 --> 00:57:54,078
was super kind

1674
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,599
you know just to be just to be just to

1675
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:57,599
be perfectly honest i don't think in

1676
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:58,720
today it would have the same lasting

1677
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:01,280
impact

1678
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:02,798
right no not today now it wouldn't it

1679
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:05,200
wouldn't have it wouldn't have been able

1680
00:58:02,798 --> 00:58:07,599
to break through but it was like so

1681
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:09,118
i do think because it is is like when

1682
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:11,359
you try to think of an outdoor plant

1683
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:13,920
that's fast enough and still considered

1684
00:58:11,358 --> 00:58:15,279
sativa to most people i think that it's

1685
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,440
it would be very hard to find a

1686
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:19,200
replacement for c99 that's that fast

1687
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:21,679
with those type of high qualities and i

1688
00:58:19,199 --> 00:58:23,679
think that also had a major effect

1689
00:58:21,679 --> 00:58:25,759
because it was it's a perfect outdoor

1690
00:58:23,679 --> 00:58:27,838
plant for blast and fast you know and it

1691
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,960
could be grown indoors i just mean it

1692
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:30,719
got like

1693
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,798
all his work got real there wasn't that

1694
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:34,639
much competition so there was a lot of

1695
00:58:32,798 --> 00:58:36,798
time to talk about

1696
00:58:34,639 --> 00:58:39,279
you know like not only cindy 99 but like

1697
00:58:36,798 --> 00:58:41,838
we were like the genius or the apollo or

1698
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:43,760
this or that or whatever or like you

1699
00:58:41,838 --> 00:58:46,239
know everybody got plenty of time to

1700
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:47,760
debate the four or five things that dj

1701
00:58:46,239 --> 00:58:49,759
released

1702
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:52,400
yeah because there just wasn't that

1703
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:54,000
there wasn't that many different things

1704
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:56,559
you know there wasn't that many now

1705
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,880
there's there's thousands of breeders

1706
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:00,880
and so standing out is very hard then it

1707
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:02,640
was like you know what was what was

1708
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:05,760
there like you know a dozen big people

1709
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:07,598
doing stuff yeah it was a lot easier for

1710
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:09,599
people to [ __ ] keep other people down

1711
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:11,280
too like the ones at the top since there

1712
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:13,039
wasn't a lot of competition and they

1713
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:15,200
they held a lot of sway they could

1714
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:16,880
really cut fucker's throats real fast

1715
00:59:15,199 --> 00:59:18,719
and it happened a lot too and it was a

1716
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,599
lot easier to do that

1717
00:59:18,719 --> 00:59:22,000
you know

1718
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:24,559
i would have probably got cut then uh if

1719
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,838
i had even tried to start back then

1720
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:27,519
dude

1721
00:59:25,838 --> 00:59:28,719
like i said i was banned off every forum

1722
00:59:27,519 --> 00:59:30,719
and it got to the point where i was like

1723
00:59:28,719 --> 00:59:34,000
[ __ ] this let me start my own forum like

1724
00:59:30,719 --> 00:59:35,838
mr nice i i never got banned from um i

1725
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,679
got asked to leave after a picture

1726
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:39,599
contest because the the wright berry

1727
00:59:37,679 --> 00:59:40,879
pictures beat out one of mr nices and he

1728
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:41,838
thought that was kind of [ __ ] of me to

1729
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,720
put it in

1730
00:59:41,838 --> 00:59:44,400
um

1731
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:47,039
but yeah all the rest of them it was

1732
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:48,318
really hard because a lot of the ones a

1733
00:59:47,039 --> 00:59:50,880
lot of people that were running those

1734
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:52,400
forums also had a seed company

1735
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,240
right and most of those seed banks and

1736
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:56,160
seed companies would eventually start

1737
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:58,719
[ __ ] people and if you were one of

1738
00:59:56,159 --> 01:00:01,039
those people to speak up

1739
00:59:58,719 --> 01:00:03,039
you're done you know they don't want you

1740
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:06,079
around yeah i mean i

1741
01:00:03,039 --> 01:00:07,679
i see mag definitely had uh some of that

1742
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:09,440
aspect to it too

1743
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:10,639
yeah there was the in crowd and the

1744
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,760
outcrowd

1745
01:00:10,639 --> 01:00:14,960
you know

1746
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:17,040
for sure as far as that goes

1747
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:19,119
i'm just surprised that forum is still

1748
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:20,000
alive after everything that went on with

1749
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:21,039
it

1750
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,559
yeah

1751
01:00:21,039 --> 01:00:25,119
see people somebody talked about that

1752
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:27,359
people talk about 89 super skunk there

1753
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:29,760
was no 89 super skunk

1754
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:32,000
one of one of the things that gets that

1755
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:33,599
that annoys the hell out of me uh

1756
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,679
honestly and this isn't to call out

1757
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:36,559
whoever has 89 super skunk but just in

1758
01:00:35,679 --> 01:00:39,279
general

1759
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:41,040
is like they'll take the first year

1760
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:43,920
that something was ever released or

1761
01:00:41,039 --> 01:00:46,079
named and be like i have that weed from

1762
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:47,920
a year or two before then

1763
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:50,240
yeah that's a big problem

1764
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:53,440
like so the first time super skunk ever

1765
01:00:50,239 --> 01:00:55,199
got used was in the 1990

1766
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:57,119
seed bank catalog

1767
01:00:55,199 --> 01:00:59,279
yeah that's when it had a picture that's

1768
01:00:57,119 --> 01:01:00,880
when it had a name that's when neville

1769
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:03,119
released it

1770
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:06,079
you know um and so people are like oh

1771
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:08,000
i've got the 89 super skunk

1772
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:09,280
well how

1773
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,559
you know and then they're like oh you

1774
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,519
know then they got to come up with like

1775
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:13,680
well you know it was all that

1776
01:01:11,519 --> 01:01:15,599
pre-release special [ __ ] because i my my

1777
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:17,598
uncle was buddies with homie who gave it

1778
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:19,440
down on special kick down

1779
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:22,400
oh they'll be like you know you know i

1780
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:24,559
got that 95 93 scentsy star

1781
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:27,280
i actually have pictures of that

1782
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:29,760
1989 super skunk and they look awful

1783
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:32,240
cookie-ish it's pretty pretty

1784
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:34,240
but you know it it happens all the time

1785
01:01:32,239 --> 01:01:36,159
and then you see a lot of these old cuts

1786
01:01:34,239 --> 01:01:37,358
right now the years keep getting earlier

1787
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:38,480
and earlier

1788
01:01:37,358 --> 01:01:40,318
yeah

1789
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:42,000
you know i mean one thing and this isn't

1790
01:01:40,318 --> 01:01:44,318
you know this isn't to you know

1791
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,679
obviously uh bodies use this or whatever

1792
01:01:44,318 --> 01:01:49,039
else right

1793
01:01:45,679 --> 01:01:50,879
but there is no g13 hash plant in the 88

1794
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:54,880
catalogs

1795
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:58,798
no no it came out in the 89 catalog

1796
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:59,838
for the first year 89 90.

1797
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:02,318
you know

1798
01:01:59,838 --> 01:02:04,078
but 88 much better

1799
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:05,838
it sounds nice

1800
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:07,200
you know and i'm not trying to throw any

1801
01:02:05,838 --> 01:02:08,480
shade on it or anything like that

1802
01:02:07,199 --> 01:02:10,239
there's plenty of people that have found

1803
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:11,679
nice weed and you know buddy made a

1804
01:02:10,239 --> 01:02:14,879
bunch of hybrids with it and it came

1805
01:02:11,679 --> 01:02:17,038
from ndn guy i think right yeah yeah

1806
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:19,280
uh origin originally or whatever you

1807
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:21,440
know he reproduced it but it's like it

1808
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:23,599
got released in 89

1809
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:26,480
yeah right right but everyone calls it

1810
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:29,599
the great you know the 88

1811
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:31,199
right close enough you know

1812
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:33,680
that you know some of that first pif

1813
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:36,318
some of that first stuff they talk about

1814
01:02:33,679 --> 01:02:39,759
um they'll call it the great 88.

1815
01:02:36,318 --> 01:02:41,599
yeah that [ __ ] got released in 89.

1816
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,960
so there's a bunch of stuff out there

1817
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:44,798
where people will be like this cut is

1818
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:47,039
from a year or two before this line ever

1819
01:02:44,798 --> 01:02:49,599
got released here's a quick question

1820
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:52,640
though i mean i have zero experience in

1821
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:54,160
this uh because i was living in my you

1822
01:02:52,639 --> 01:02:56,798
know whole and humble

1823
01:02:54,159 --> 01:02:56,798
but um

1824
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:01,119
you were there so

1825
01:02:59,199 --> 01:03:03,679
or maybe maybe you were there years

1826
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:07,280
later what was the possibility of them

1827
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:08,399
doing uh releases of their seeds

1828
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:11,359
um

1829
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:13,838
at the canvas cups

1830
01:03:11,358 --> 01:03:15,358
um

1831
01:03:13,838 --> 01:03:17,358
so that is true

1832
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:19,759
it is possible like for instance the

1833
01:03:17,358 --> 01:03:21,598
first cannabis cup i went to the was the

1834
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:23,599
jack herrera cup

1835
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:24,400
uh and the whole thing was themed on him

1836
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:26,480
right

1837
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:28,480
right and it was all about like it was

1838
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:31,199
the whole like all the festivities were

1839
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:32,798
all about the emperor wears no clothes

1840
01:03:31,199 --> 01:03:34,879
and they released

1841
01:03:32,798 --> 01:03:36,000
jack herrera seeds

1842
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:38,079
um

1843
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,239
you know from uh

1844
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:44,000
uh in 95

1845
01:03:40,239 --> 01:03:47,358
94 yeah 95 they released them but it was

1846
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,159
you know it was late november

1847
01:03:47,358 --> 01:03:50,159
right

1848
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:53,038
um but it wasn't in the catalog until

1849
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:53,038
the following year

1850
01:03:53,199 --> 01:03:58,480
right so it was like literally it was

1851
01:03:55,599 --> 01:04:00,880
literally the first time for instance uh

1852
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:02,559
jack was dropped was at the camp was at

1853
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:05,039
the cannabis cup

1854
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:06,480
right in late november so i suppose you

1855
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:08,559
could have gotten it

1856
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:10,079
jacqueria at least six weeks before the

1857
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:11,519
year turned

1858
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:12,880
right right

1859
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:14,639
you know

1860
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:17,760
i mean uh

1861
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:18,960
for example salmon creek big bud um you

1862
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:21,200
know uh

1863
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:22,960
you know homeboy homeboy from sama creek

1864
01:04:21,199 --> 01:04:26,000
you know he bought those seeds at the

1865
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:27,920
cup the year it won the cup and then

1866
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,880
smuggled 50 of those seeds home in his

1867
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:31,838
little belt

1868
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:33,200
you know hi hideaway belt thing

1869
01:04:31,838 --> 01:04:36,239
and

1870
01:04:33,199 --> 01:04:38,798
that's you know his selection from those

1871
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:42,639
uh scentsy big bud seeds or whatever is

1872
01:04:38,798 --> 01:04:44,480
what made salmon creek big bud

1873
01:04:42,639 --> 01:04:46,000
i mean that's that's definitely possible

1874
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,960
a lot of times

1875
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,280
um

1876
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:52,720
a lot of new seed releases

1877
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:54,720
would get dumped in late november then

1878
01:04:52,719 --> 01:04:55,759
because because it was like an industry

1879
01:04:54,719 --> 01:04:57,759
gathering

1880
01:04:55,760 --> 01:05:00,480
right right and there was tons of and

1881
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:03,680
honestly there was tons of custies there

1882
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:05,519
i ended up hating going to amsterdam for

1883
01:05:03,679 --> 01:05:07,519
the cannabis cup i went three times and

1884
01:05:05,519 --> 01:05:09,599
then never again

1885
01:05:07,519 --> 01:05:12,880
mostly because it sucked

1886
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:13,680
uh and the reason it sucked was that

1887
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:16,079
uh

1888
01:05:13,679 --> 01:05:18,798
amsterdam is pretty far north

1889
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:20,798
and so it's cold as [ __ ] in late

1890
01:05:18,798 --> 01:05:22,480
november there right so you can go in

1891
01:05:20,798 --> 01:05:23,759
summer and it's nice and it's beautiful

1892
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:26,159
and you're on a bicycle and you're

1893
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:27,680
cruising around all stoned or you can go

1894
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:30,639
when it's sleeting

1895
01:05:27,679 --> 01:05:33,838
and 29 degrees

1896
01:05:30,639 --> 01:05:36,078
and that's not as nice you know and then

1897
01:05:33,838 --> 01:05:38,318
all the best weed would get saved for

1898
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:40,720
celebrities that were coming in

1899
01:05:38,318 --> 01:05:43,038
and who's who so there was worse weed to

1900
01:05:40,719 --> 01:05:45,279
get because it was all getting saved for

1901
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:47,760
you know snoop dogg or you know sam

1902
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:50,079
skunk man's friends or you know whoever

1903
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:53,200
whoever the high times crew or whatnot

1904
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:55,039
and then on top of that

1905
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:57,519
you could buy tickets to go to the

1906
01:05:55,039 --> 01:06:00,640
cannabis cup out of high times

1907
01:05:57,519 --> 01:06:02,559
right so you go to europe on vacation

1908
01:06:00,639 --> 01:06:05,358
and the coffee shops are full with all

1909
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:07,200
these dudes from jersey and new york

1910
01:06:05,358 --> 01:06:09,279
yeah screaming about wanting to get the

1911
01:06:07,199 --> 01:06:11,439
best bud in the world

1912
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:13,200
so it's like you fly

1913
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:15,119
12 hours away from your house and you're

1914
01:06:13,199 --> 01:06:16,318
surrounded by a bunch of obnoxious east

1915
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:17,920
coasters

1916
01:06:16,318 --> 01:06:19,759
and there's not as good weed and it's

1917
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:21,838
crowded and it's cold and it's raining

1918
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:25,119
or it's snowing and it's like i much

1919
01:06:21,838 --> 01:06:25,119
preferred going there in summer

1920
01:06:25,519 --> 01:06:28,480
you know just because it was nice and

1921
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:30,000
chill

1922
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:33,119

1923
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,079

1931
01:06:47,519 --> 01:06:50,480

yeah yeah it was it was it was cuban you

1958
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:48,160

1959
01:07:47,199 --> 01:07:50,159
[ __ ]

1960
01:07:48,159 --> 01:07:51,598
and they had all those like long-winded

1961
01:07:50,159 --> 01:07:54,000
posts on

1962
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:55,599
on [ __ ] the forums about what

1963
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,760
percentage and how much it was

1964
01:07:55,599 --> 01:08:01,200
increasing with everyone you did and

1965
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:03,200
laying it all out you know yeah

1966
01:08:01,199 --> 01:08:04,639
there was some really bad breeder tech

1967
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:08,318
being shared

1968
01:08:04,639 --> 01:08:08,318
that seemed cutting edge at the time

1969
01:08:08,798 --> 01:08:12,400
people still repeat that [ __ ] [ __ ]

1970
01:08:10,798 --> 01:08:14,798
like like a

1971
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:16,719
mantra oh you gotta back cross it four

1972
01:08:14,798 --> 01:08:19,039
times and you get that's as good as a s1

1973
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:20,640
that's a clone man and i saw and i saw

1974
01:08:19,039 --> 01:08:22,960
somebody talking about i like the super

1975
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:25,119
silver haze better than the jack herrera

1976
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:26,719
um the whole reason super silver haze

1977
01:08:25,119 --> 01:08:29,198
exists is because

1978
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:31,359
um neville didn't feel like the jack

1979
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:33,278
herrera project was ready for prime time

1980
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:35,039
he just released it due to

1981
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:37,279
you know allen and ben drunkers from

1982
01:08:35,039 --> 01:08:40,719
sensei were businessmen and so when he

1983
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:42,319
left he kept working on it

1984
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:44,319
and then a couple of years later i think

1985
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:46,880
in 97 or something

1986
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:48,560
he they released mango and neville and

1987
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:50,079
super silver haze

1988
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:52,159
because he felt like you know they'd

1989
01:08:50,079 --> 01:08:54,079
actually gotten somewhere on it

1990
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:55,519
right right right but they still did a

1991
01:08:54,079 --> 01:08:57,838
couple and i actually think that was the

1992
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:58,960
last big release that neville ever did

1993
01:08:57,838 --> 01:09:00,000
right

1994
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:02,319
um

1995
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:05,198
but i mean i smoked that

1996
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:07,520
that super silver haze cut because two i

1997
01:09:05,198 --> 01:09:10,238
went in 90 i was basically like every

1998
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:11,440
other year like i went 97 and 99 two to

1999
01:09:10,238 --> 01:09:13,599
the cups

2000
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:15,838
and those last two cups that super

2001
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:17,600
silver haze was all over the place

2002
01:09:15,838 --> 01:09:21,119
because that right that was in that was

2003
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:24,319
like the first and third year at one

2004
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:26,640
it was like the hot [ __ ] over there

2005
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:28,080
right right it really was it was the hot

2006
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:31,359
[ __ ] i mean it was super there was a

2007
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:33,838
female of it that went like 14 weeks

2008
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:34,719
uh will the community let rez back into

2009
01:09:33,838 --> 01:09:37,359

2010
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:38,480

2016

2017
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:51,358
the law enforcement and all that

2018
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:54,159

2020
01:09:54,158 --> 01:09:59,039
you're right big time he was a big time

2021
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:00,880
troll jerk

2022
01:09:59,039 --> 01:10:03,359
generally a pain in the ass to get along

2023
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:05,600
with not a pleasant homie

2024
01:10:03,359 --> 01:10:06,960
yeah at all despite despite any of the

2025
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,480
rest of the bull whatever you want to

2026
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:10,640
believe about

2027
01:10:08,479 --> 01:10:13,839
you know all the mess that happened

2028
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:16,560
legally or whatever uh yeah he was a he

2029
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:18,159
was an early troll

2030
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:20,960
he was a jackass

2031
01:10:18,158 --> 01:10:22,639
he had a huge ego

2032
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:25,920
i mean he still does

2033
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:27,840
he he had a decent level of intelligence

2034
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:30,079
which would have been i think much more

2035
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:32,079
appreciated if he hadn't had so much ego

2036
01:10:30,079 --> 01:10:32,800
with it yeah a little humid you know i

2037
01:10:32,079 --> 01:10:35,039
mean

2038
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:37,520
not you know a bunch of ego and a bunch

2039
01:10:35,039 --> 01:10:38,800
of rudeness

2040
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:40,560
you know there was some root there was

2041
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:42,400
some rude people you could put up with a

2042
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:44,640
little bit better but they were like

2043
01:10:42,399 --> 01:10:47,279
borderline geniuses

2044
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:48,960
right right right you know like tom hill

2045
01:10:47,279 --> 01:10:51,198

2046
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:53,039

times

2053
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:07,760

yeah

2058
01:11:13,039 --> 01:11:18,000
rude kind of rude you know but it's hard

2059
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:19,840
it's hard to have patience

2060
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,760
you know and let's face it right a lot

2061
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:23,360
of us are weirdos

2062
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:26,800
a lot of us don't have the greatest

2063
01:11:23,359 --> 01:11:30,000
interpersonal skills to begin with

2064
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:31,920
you know for yourself

2065
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:34,640
i mean speaking for me i probably have a

2066
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:35,840
little bit more than your average grower

2067
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:38,159
just a bit

2068
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:40,719
yeah you know but a lot but a lot of

2069
01:11:38,158 --> 01:11:42,639
them it's like you know we're kind of

2070
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:44,800
harsh edges people that live in the

2071
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:45,840
hills don't talk to people hang out with

2072
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,279
plants

2073
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:48,480
and they're really good with plants and

2074
01:11:47,279 --> 01:11:49,840
they're not so good with social

2075
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:51,119
interaction

2076
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:53,360
right

2077
01:11:51,119 --> 01:11:55,198
so you put those people on the forums

2078
01:11:53,359 --> 01:11:57,359
and you put those people like you know

2079
01:11:55,198 --> 01:11:59,119
on ig or whatever and it's like it's not

2080
01:11:57,359 --> 01:12:01,679
the easiest thing

2081
01:11:59,119 --> 01:12:04,079
i did have an adjustment period that

2082
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:05,760
i will admit i had an adjustment period

2083
01:12:04,079 --> 01:12:08,238
of where

2084
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:10,159
i may have been a little meaner in

2085
01:12:08,238 --> 01:12:12,959
responses and talking to people a little

2086
01:12:10,158 --> 01:12:14,799
snappy maybe a little bit of ego

2087
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:17,198
you know it happens

2088
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:20,320
but some of us grow into beautiful

2089
01:12:17,198 --> 01:12:22,158
smiling faces like this

2090
01:12:20,319 --> 01:12:24,238
i'm also still banned from breed bay for

2091
01:12:22,158 --> 01:12:26,799
uh picking on sub cool

2092
01:12:24,238 --> 01:12:28,319
it's also it's also the way i look at it

2093
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:30,960
is like you know i mean everybody has

2094
01:12:28,319 --> 01:12:32,238
the natural inclination sometimes but

2095
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:33,679
it's like are you trying to get your

2096
01:12:32,238 --> 01:12:35,599
point across are you trying to [ __ ]

2097
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:37,279

2098
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:40,159

and then they mailed greg some more weed

2110
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:09,529
and then 15 years went by before they

2111
01:13:06,399 --> 01:13:11,279

chem 91 or anything like that until 06

2116
01:13:17,439 --> 01:13:23,599
until the reunion when the forums got

2117
01:13:20,158 --> 01:13:25,839
people back together they had no idea

2118
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:28,480

2122
01:13:33,359 --> 01:13:38,479

2128
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:48,158
some other pounds and you just keep

2129
01:13:46,079 --> 01:13:50,000
doing that and you did that for a while

2130
01:13:48,158 --> 01:13:52,079
and one of these sales turned into

2131
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,319

hit hit joe brand up again and had him

2147
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:26,399
mail him some more weed i think 2m right

2148
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:28,960
2 ounces and we don't even know if the

2149
01:14:26,399 --> 01:14:31,198
seeds came from the deer creek show

2150
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:32,800
or the seeds came from the weed that joe

2151
01:14:31,198 --> 01:14:35,599
sent him later

2152
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:38,719
i it's i from based on the stories i've

2153
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:41,520
kind of deciphered i i think it

2154
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:42,560
it came from the ones that was sent that

2155
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:44,880
one had

2156
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:47,120
no seeds but then again we know these

2157
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:49,520
stories are a little up and down

2158
01:14:47,119 --> 01:14:51,599
i mean you know not to i like two of my

2159
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:55,440
favorite cuts of all time come out of

2160
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:58,480
g's little rooms but i will say that um

2161
01:14:55,439 --> 01:15:00,399
all of us on this thing have tried to uh

2162
01:14:58,479 --> 01:15:03,039
have tried to interpret what he meant by

2163
01:15:00,399 --> 01:15:04,719
rejuvenating the 91 after it got tired

2164
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:07,119
in 1994.

2165
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:10,000
well hybrum's always rejuvenated

2166
01:15:07,119 --> 01:15:12,000
rejuvenated yeah the rejuvenation he had

2167
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,840
to let it go and rejuvenate it

2168
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,679
that's how you fix it

2169
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:17,679
from scene and that [ __ ] never got

2170
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:18,480
explained

2171
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:20,960
you know

2172
01:15:18,479 --> 01:15:22,479
um and so i don't you know there's

2173
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:24,800
when it when any time you have a

2174
01:15:22,479 --> 01:15:27,439
situation where you know we can even go

2175
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:29,920
back and take you know like ancient you

2176
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:34,319

you know you you create these ancient

2180
01:15:37,439 --> 01:15:40,559
legends and it's like how do you

2181
01:15:39,119 --> 01:15:42,800
disprove them

2182
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:44,880
yeah in a lot of cases you can't prove

2183
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:46,320
or disprove because they're so old

2184
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:48,239
well let's get back to the forums i got

2185
01:15:46,319 --> 01:15:49,198
a question yeah yeah

2186
01:15:48,238 --> 01:15:50,718

01:15:52,479 --> 01:15:55,359
seed bank that carried your [ __ ] when

2190

01:16:21,359 --> 01:16:25,920
yeah i i

2202
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:27,600
could say one thing is that my buddy

2203
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:29,279
that i never mentioned his name but

2204
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:31,360
staten island when we were doing all the

2205
01:16:29,279 --> 01:16:33,198
super dog work and we were doing all

2206
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:36,238
those hybrids that made it into the can

2207
01:16:33,198 --> 01:16:38,960
of bible he had big dreams

2208
01:16:36,238 --> 01:16:41,839
of realizing that you could probably

2209
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:43,279
make more money like off of an eight

2210
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:44,880
lighter of seed

2211
01:16:43,279 --> 01:16:46,319
than you could off an eight lighter of

2212
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:48,640
flower

2213
01:16:46,319 --> 01:16:50,639
and he saw what was coming i honestly

2214
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:52,400
didn't believe him

2215
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:53,760
you know i didn't think i didn't think

2216
01:16:52,399 --> 01:16:57,039
that we you would ever be able in

2217
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:58,800
america to like package up and sell

2218
01:16:57,039 --> 01:17:00,960
enormous amounts of seed or anything

2219
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:02,320
like that because at the time we were

2220
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:04,079
making all this stuff and we were

2221
01:17:02,319 --> 01:17:06,000
literally giving it away to good friends

2222
01:17:04,079 --> 01:17:07,600
and stuff because we had more than we

2223
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,920
knew what to do with and there wasn't an

2224
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:12,640
outlet for it

2225
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:14,640
um you know the era that that caleb

2226
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:17,280
talks about getting involved is one of

2227
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:19,840
the earlier eras where you could really

2228
01:17:17,279 --> 01:17:22,000
actually start to sell it

2229
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:24,480
it wasn't simple in the beginning even

2230
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,079
even if you were an active breeder

2231
01:17:24,479 --> 01:17:28,479
finding out how to get it to the

2232
01:17:26,079 --> 01:17:30,158
community wasn't very simple

2233
01:17:28,479 --> 01:17:32,079
no

2234
01:17:30,158 --> 01:17:34,158
you had to trust i mean like even even

2235
01:17:32,079 --> 01:17:36,880
with me i started the um

2236
01:17:34,158 --> 01:17:37,599
selling seats directly really early for

2237
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:40,880
for

2238
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:42,159
a u.s person um but when i first started

2239
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:43,679
you still had to

2240
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:45,599
really put your trust in someone in

2241
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:47,119
europe for the most part if you wanted

2242
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:49,199
any kind of traction for your seeds if

2243
01:17:47,119 --> 01:17:50,479
you wanted any

2244
01:17:49,198 --> 01:17:51,678
i mean you had to work with seed banks

2245
01:17:50,479 --> 01:17:53,279
for people they

2246
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:54,719
eventually know who you are if the seed

2247
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:56,399
bank didn't carry you you probably

2248
01:17:54,719 --> 01:17:58,000
weren't [ __ ] important that's why

2249
01:17:56,399 --> 01:18:00,569
everybody looked at it we were about to

2250
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:04,880
go into csi after dark

2251
01:18:00,569 --> 01:18:05,679
[Laughter]

2252
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:08,239
yeah

2253
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:10,800
but yeah i mean uh you know a good bit

2254
01:18:08,238 --> 01:18:12,799
of that was in the 90s

2255
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:14,719
you know when dj short wanted to get his

2256
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:16,960
blueberry seed out there

2257
01:18:14,719 --> 01:18:17,679
he had to give it away

2258
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:20,480
to

2259
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:22,560
uh two different groups in europe

2260
01:18:20,479 --> 01:18:24,158
yeah first he had to give it to tony at

2261
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:26,000
sag martha and then he had to give it to

2262
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:27,439
dutch passion i don't know if he

2263
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,439
intentionally gave it away but i think

2264
01:18:27,439 --> 01:18:30,719
that's how it ended up working out i

2265
01:18:29,439 --> 01:18:31,759
think he did

2266
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:33,359
huh

2267
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:35,280
didn't didn't he

2268
01:18:33,359 --> 01:18:38,158
purposely give him to him and maybe he

2269
01:18:35,279 --> 01:18:40,800
purposely did i think he thought that he

2270
01:18:38,158 --> 01:18:42,079
would still retain all control and this

2271
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,119
and that that's where he was probably

2272
01:18:42,079 --> 01:18:45,119
mistaken

2273
01:18:43,119 --> 01:18:46,800
but in order for him to even like get

2274
01:18:45,119 --> 01:18:49,198
money for his seeds

2275
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:51,360
he had to send them to an established

2276
01:18:49,198 --> 01:18:54,479
seed bank

2277
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:56,238
yeah in a different continent

2278
01:18:54,479 --> 01:18:57,279
that's how hard it was to move seeds

2279
01:18:56,238 --> 01:18:59,279
then

2280
01:18:57,279 --> 01:19:01,279
yeah but you know when he i think sag

2281
01:18:59,279 --> 01:19:03,198
martha they had his seeds in what like

2282
01:19:01,279 --> 01:19:05,359
you know the mid-90s or something like

2283
01:19:03,198 --> 01:19:07,039
that um

2284
01:19:05,359 --> 01:19:08,639
right around there

2285
01:19:07,039 --> 01:19:10,000
the internet didn't even exist then

2286
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:11,360
really

2287
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:14,238
right right

2288
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:15,839
i did but not not not like any level

2289
01:19:14,238 --> 01:19:17,519
that you were going to be able to use it

2290
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:20,159
for that

2291
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:22,800
yeah yeah i think overgrowth started in

2292
01:19:20,158 --> 01:19:24,000
either 98 or 99

2293
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:26,239
or maybe

2294
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,640
yeah yep now you're right about that so

2295
01:19:26,238 --> 01:19:31,119
like the first forums the first being

2296
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:33,440
able to exchange stuff like how would dj

2297
01:19:31,119 --> 01:19:36,719
have even set up an internet was gonna

2298
01:19:33,439 --> 01:19:40,639
set up a geocities like [ __ ] you know

2299
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:41,600
web page and sell illegal beans

2300
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:44,320
you know

2301
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:47,360
um i mean up until up until they passed

2302
01:19:44,319 --> 01:19:49,359
the the 215 in in late

2303
01:19:47,359 --> 01:19:51,519
96 i think it was

2304
01:19:49,359 --> 01:19:53,359
it was it was illegal in all 50 states

2305
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:55,120
there wasn't any there wasn't even a

2306
01:19:53,359 --> 01:19:56,000
legitimate reason you could possess any

2307
01:19:55,119 --> 01:19:57,439
of it

2308
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,119
yeah

2309
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:00,079
and i think he feels burnt he felt

2310
01:19:59,119 --> 01:20:01,279
burned

2311
01:20:00,079 --> 01:20:03,519
but you know what were you going to do

2312
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:05,279
when you gave it away to the dutch

2313
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:06,480
right if he didn't know that those those

2314
01:20:05,279 --> 01:20:08,000
dutch guys were going to do whatever the

2315
01:20:06,479 --> 01:20:08,799
[ __ ] they wanted with it then he was

2316
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,960
just

2317
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:12,639
he had just done his groundwork

2318
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:15,760
yeah right

2319
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:17,679
well yeah that that that's a

2320
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:21,600
blueberry is almost a

2321
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:23,119
a a full days topic just by itself it is

2322
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:24,719
but i just meant in the sense that like

2323
01:20:23,119 --> 01:20:26,639
just to use it on the example of how

2324
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:28,480
hard it was to sell seeds if you were a

2325
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:30,800
small american breeder

2326
01:20:28,479 --> 01:20:33,279
yeah he had to work with the dutch just

2327
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:35,279
to get it out there there wasn't an

2328
01:20:33,279 --> 01:20:36,238
avenue what were you gonna do

2329
01:20:35,279 --> 01:20:37,599
i mean

2330
01:20:36,238 --> 01:20:39,839
you know um

2331
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:41,520

american you know seed sellers or

2333
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:46,480
whatever used to try to fake that their

2334
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:47,920
stuff was based out of europe right

2335
01:20:46,479 --> 01:20:49,519

2336
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:51,279
right

2337
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:54,480

2341
01:20:59,359 --> 01:21:04,079

um i can say back in

2354
01:21:23,399 --> 01:21:27,119
0203.0405 i mean my buddy from staten

2355
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:28,560
island would tell me about this stuff

2356
01:21:27,119 --> 01:21:30,479
that he wanted to do and i would laugh

2357
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:32,000
at him

2358
01:21:30,479 --> 01:21:33,839
i was like oh you want us to all go to

2359
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,198
jail

2360
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:37,119
because that's what that's what it seems

2361
01:21:35,198 --> 01:21:39,439
like you're talking about to me

2362
01:21:37,119 --> 01:21:40,800
you know yeah when i started i i was one

2363
01:21:39,439 --> 01:21:42,879
of the peo i think i was one of the few

2364
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:45,039
people that pretended that my website

2365
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:47,359
was in amsterdam just to like

2366
01:21:45,039 --> 01:21:49,039
try to hide under the shadows you know

2367
01:21:47,359 --> 01:21:52,000
just because no one was doing it it

2368
01:21:49,039 --> 01:21:53,439
[ __ ] was a big red flag so even

2369
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:55,520
though i'm just waiting for that hit

2370
01:21:53,439 --> 01:21:56,879
even having the infrastructure set up to

2371
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:57,920
be successful

2372
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:00,239
yeah

2373
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:02,960
and and that's kind of why there was so

2374
01:22:00,238 --> 01:22:05,119
few breeders back then

2375
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:06,399
because it was generally done out of

2376
01:22:05,119 --> 01:22:07,920
love

2377
01:22:06,399 --> 01:22:10,158
and you were trading amongst other

2378
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:11,679
people and there wasn't something like

2379
01:22:10,158 --> 01:22:13,039
there is now where somebody can be like

2380
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:14,960
oh i'm gonna drop

2381
01:22:13,039 --> 01:22:16,880
my mac one drop and i'm gonna make 200

2382
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:18,639
grand and you know i'm gonna i'm gonna

2383
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:20,400
i'm gonna hype it

2384
01:22:18,639 --> 01:22:22,239
yeah you really couldn't hype it there

2385
01:22:20,399 --> 01:22:25,439
wasn't marketing there wasn't an ability

2386
01:22:22,238 --> 01:22:27,279
to reach a big audience right right

2387
01:22:25,439 --> 01:22:28,638
i don't think

2388
01:22:27,279 --> 01:22:30,319
you know

2389
01:22:28,639 --> 01:22:31,840
it took a while

2390
01:22:30,319 --> 01:22:34,399
well and uh

2391
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:35,199
in in in the era you know oh six you

2392
01:22:34,399 --> 01:22:38,719
know

2393
01:22:35,198 --> 01:22:41,519
through 08 even 2010 i mean most of the

2394
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:44,480
marketing most most of the availability

2395
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:45,360
was all based on internet forums right

2396
01:22:44,479 --> 01:22:47,119
yeah

2397
01:22:45,359 --> 01:22:47,920
you know that was and

2398
01:22:47,119 --> 01:22:49,760
yeah

2399
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:51,760
and people should also remember that

2400
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:52,560
when overgrowing cannabis world got shut

2401
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:55,280
down

2402
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:58,080
they got shut down because a very big uh

2403
01:22:55,279 --> 01:22:58,880
you know seed vendor got raided

2404
01:22:58,079 --> 01:23:01,119
uh

2405
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:03,039
heaven's stairway

2406
01:23:01,119 --> 01:23:05,279
that was and that scared a bunch of

2407
01:23:03,039 --> 01:23:06,880
people

2408
01:23:05,279 --> 01:23:09,039
and there's still repercussions and

2409
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:10,000
ripples hitting from that [ __ ] bust

2410
01:23:09,039 --> 01:23:12,800
you know

2411
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:14,639
and you know and then you know and and

2412
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:16,880
you know and people even in canada and

2413
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:20,480
stuff like that you know mark emery you

2414
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:22,639
know uh i mean he he went to [ __ ] he

2415
01:23:20,479 --> 01:23:24,399
went to jail

2416
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:25,600
mm-hmm you know

2417
01:23:24,399 --> 01:23:26,879
it was yours

2418
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:28,239
did you have any dealings with mark

2419
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:32,159
cameron kayla

2420
01:23:28,238 --> 01:23:35,279
at all oh no no no interactions

2421
01:23:32,158 --> 01:23:37,519
no interactions at all but uh um

2422
01:23:35,279 --> 01:23:40,479
you know i was i was getting uh

2423
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:42,560
cannabis culture or cannabis canada from

2424
01:23:40,479 --> 01:23:45,198
pretty much like the first issue

2425
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:47,360
you know i've always been a historian so

2426
01:23:45,198 --> 01:23:49,678
i mean i have hundreds and hundreds of

2427
01:23:47,359 --> 01:23:51,039
kind of books and i was you know for

2428
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:53,119
years i was getting every single

2429
01:23:51,039 --> 01:23:55,359
magazine that was put out on on

2430
01:23:53,119 --> 01:23:57,439
everything so i've always been way more

2431
01:23:55,359 --> 01:23:58,399
of a reader than a talker

2432
01:23:57,439 --> 01:23:59,279
yeah

2433
01:23:58,399 --> 01:24:01,920
you know

2434
01:23:59,279 --> 01:24:03,039
it helps put details together sometimes

2435
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:04,079
yeah it does

2436
01:24:03,039 --> 01:24:07,279
yeah

2437
01:24:04,079 --> 01:24:08,238
but no no no uh direct you know dealings

2438
01:24:07,279 --> 01:24:10,479
i mean

2439
01:24:08,238 --> 01:24:12,718
uh the stuff i liked from

2440
01:24:10,479 --> 01:24:16,079
from those magazines though and and him

2441
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:18,880
were like the abc stuff from back yeah

2442
01:24:16,079 --> 01:24:20,639
late 90s and then the purple indica

2443
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:23,679
purple kush stuff

2444
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:25,600
that was in those early issues as well

2445
01:24:23,679 --> 01:24:27,039
but uh and then i think emery was

2446
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:29,360
working with the same purple indica

2447
01:24:27,039 --> 01:24:31,359
that's around now or at least a relative

2448
01:24:29,359 --> 01:24:35,359
uh it wasn't emory uh there was an

2449
01:24:31,359 --> 01:24:36,960
article based out of snohomish county

2450
01:24:35,359 --> 01:24:40,079
in washington

2451
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:43,039
and it it basically dated that that

2452
01:24:40,079 --> 01:24:45,840
stuff back into the you know at the very

2453
01:24:43,039 --> 01:24:47,039
least you know early mid 90s

2454
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:48,159
yeah that's cool

2455
01:24:47,039 --> 01:24:49,600
so

2456
01:24:48,158 --> 01:24:50,879
there was a question we were talking

2457
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:52,159
about the other night and i was like i

2458
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:53,359
need to ask not so that and i can't

2459
01:24:52,158 --> 01:24:55,759
remember what it was

2460
01:24:53,359 --> 01:24:57,359
it had something to do with uh

2461
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:59,119

how did it make it here yeah who brought

2464
01:25:01,439 --> 01:25:04,879
it oh that's that's pretty simple story

2465
01:25:03,679 --> 01:25:07,440
so

2466
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:10,079
it ties into the forums so

2467
01:25:07,439 --> 01:25:13,359
people's in 06 people started getting

2468
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:14,880
excited about uh chem dog

2469
01:25:13,359 --> 01:25:16,719
and the chem dog story because it

2470
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:19,119

stuff like that and

2478
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,960
and then

2479
01:25:33,119 --> 01:25:36,719
you know that's kind of actually what

2480
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:37,760
started to reunite

2481
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:41,600
um

2482
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:44,079
uh people like peabud and joe brand and

2483
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:46,560
uh chem dog all they all started

2484
01:25:44,079 --> 01:25:48,559
chatting i believe they even called like

2485
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:51,520
the the seeds that ended up being the

2486
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:54,880
one through four the reunion seeds

2487
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:57,840
or yeah the number four they uh named

2488
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:59,679
the reunion fino specific reunion fino

2489
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:02,000
that's what it was right because it was

2490
01:25:59,679 --> 01:26:04,158
like they had all they'd all kind of met

2491
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,279
up as this you know like different

2492
01:26:04,158 --> 01:26:07,519
people were like hey dude they're

2493
01:26:05,279 --> 01:26:08,800
talking about your story on the internet

2494
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:10,320
right

2495
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:12,480
and so

2496
01:26:10,319 --> 01:26:14,158
chem dog hadn't actually had the chem 91

2497
01:26:12,479 --> 01:26:16,638
in quite a long time

2498
01:26:14,158 --> 01:26:18,960
um he had gotten in trouble and lost it

2499
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:20,079
and he had been working with some of the

2500
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:22,239
chem dog

2501
01:26:20,079 --> 01:26:23,760
super skunk hybrids that he had and bag

2502
01:26:22,238 --> 01:26:25,599
seed and different things

2503
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:26,560
and when it got famous again he wanted

2504
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:28,400
it back

2505
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:29,360
but nobody had it

2506
01:26:28,399 --> 01:26:32,399
so

2507
01:26:29,359 --> 01:26:33,439
he got um he got skunked he got skunked

2508
01:26:32,399 --> 01:26:36,719
va

2509
01:26:33,439 --> 01:26:38,638
to go back east with it and he was like

2510
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:40,158
if you bring it back to bring it back to

2511
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:42,079
me and i've got this different one that

2512
01:26:40,158 --> 01:26:43,039
you guys don't have out there

2513
01:26:42,079 --> 01:26:45,279
and

2514
01:26:43,039 --> 01:26:47,840
um i'll give it to you

2515
01:26:45,279 --> 01:26:50,158
so he went back east and and saw a dude

2516
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:53,679
and gave him the and gave him the dog

2517
01:26:50,158 --> 01:26:56,079
and then uh greg gave him the d

2518
01:26:53,679 --> 01:26:59,359
and he came back and mommed it up and

2519
01:26:56,079 --> 01:27:01,600
that's how uh me and uh i see collective

2520
01:26:59,359 --> 01:27:03,359
both got it so was it skunky a that did

2521
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:06,639
it brought it 100

2522
01:27:03,359 --> 01:27:08,960
oh cool and that was it

2523
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:10,800
it was him it was it was all it's he's

2524
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:13,439
the reason it's he to me

2525
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:15,360
he's the reason it's on the west coast

2526
01:27:13,439 --> 01:27:17,678
very cool he put forth the effort he

2527
01:27:15,359 --> 01:27:20,399
went back east to see

2528
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:21,920
uh he gave he gave the dog to chem dog

2529
01:27:20,399 --> 01:27:23,198
he got the d

2530
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:25,119
that was and i think

2531
01:27:23,198 --> 01:27:26,158
if i remember too

2532
01:27:25,119 --> 01:27:29,519
um

2533
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:32,399
uh i believe that um

2534
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:34,320
chem dog tried to give him back the mss

2535
01:27:32,399 --> 01:27:36,319
yeah he just said that but it was the

2536
01:27:34,319 --> 01:27:38,880
shorter one that was in the high times

2537
01:27:36,319 --> 01:27:41,359
and it wasn't what uh homie remembered

2538
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:43,760
at all that makes a lot of sense too

2539
01:27:41,359 --> 01:27:46,000
yeah so then yeah so then he came back

2540
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:47,760
and he grew it up into a mom

2541
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,920
or whatever and then

2542
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:52,320
i see collective and myself got it not

2543
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:53,840
that long after that and but to me it's

2544
01:27:52,319 --> 01:27:56,319
like the reason it's on the west coast

2545
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:58,239
is is skunk va

2546
01:27:56,319 --> 01:28:01,119
well on greg

2547
01:27:58,238 --> 01:28:02,158
on g's tour um

2548
01:28:01,119 --> 01:28:04,960
he uh

2549
01:28:02,158 --> 01:28:07,519
he he dropped it off uh in

2550
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:11,520
the you know la area with swerve the

2551
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:14,000
chem d in oh six but this is off of o6

2552
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:16,159
he um and swerve traded him a bunch of

2553
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:18,800
fake cuts for it you know

2554
01:28:16,158 --> 01:28:19,679
no big deal and then he also stopped at

2555
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:23,199
uh

2556
01:28:19,679 --> 01:28:24,399
he stopped at um you know obsoletes in

2557
01:28:23,198 --> 01:28:26,719
central cal

2558
01:28:24,399 --> 01:28:29,519
um on his tour and then he stopped at

2559
01:28:26,719 --> 01:28:31,359
joe brands and then he headed up into

2560
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:33,199
oregon and stopped at some other folks

2561
01:28:31,359 --> 01:28:36,079
place and i think he might have given

2562
01:28:33,198 --> 01:28:39,039
them the chem d2 but he he stopped at a

2563
01:28:36,079 --> 01:28:41,359
a good handful of places giving cuts out

2564
01:28:39,039 --> 01:28:43,039
selling weed at dispensaries all that

2565
01:28:41,359 --> 01:28:45,599
kind of stuff on his

2566
01:28:43,039 --> 01:28:46,560
you know reunion tour of sorts and this

2567
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:49,360
is

2568
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:51,360
like first week of august oh six

2569
01:28:49,359 --> 01:28:54,000
so it sounds like uh

2570
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:58,000
skunk va went over there you know

2571
01:28:54,000 --> 01:29:01,359
earlier in the year and and and got

2572
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:03,279
the same or similar cut i don't know

2573
01:29:01,359 --> 01:29:04,880
seems like there was a few cuts that got

2574
01:29:03,279 --> 01:29:06,639
passed out that year

2575
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:09,039
yeah

2576
01:29:06,639 --> 01:29:11,359
yeah i mean it so but that's that's kind

2577
01:29:09,039 --> 01:29:13,119
of that's how that's how the the and

2578
01:29:11,359 --> 01:29:15,519
that led to a bunch of stuff that led to

2579
01:29:13,119 --> 01:29:17,359
the one two three four

2580
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:18,480
getting popped and started to get traded

2581
01:29:17,359 --> 01:29:19,519
around

2582
01:29:18,479 --> 01:29:22,158
right now

2583
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:24,000
um that led to the d that led to the one

2584
01:29:22,158 --> 01:29:26,319
through the four and the d and all that

2585
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,279
starting to get added to the mix

2586
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:29,439
um

2587
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:32,800
i don't know that the weird thing about

2588
01:29:29,439 --> 01:29:35,359
the the chem stuff is that my buddy

2589
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:36,639
disliked the sis quite a bit

2590
01:29:35,359 --> 01:29:38,960
he thought it was ugly and he didn't

2591
01:29:36,639 --> 01:29:40,719
like how it got him high so he never

2592
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:43,119
brought it west

2593
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:45,039
and so it never really percolated around

2594
01:29:43,119 --> 01:29:46,960
our crew

2595
01:29:45,039 --> 01:29:50,479
um you know we

2596
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:53,119
way later we saw some of the s-ones

2597
01:29:50,479 --> 01:29:54,638
um but not the actual not the actual

2598
01:29:53,119 --> 01:29:56,238
first one

2599
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:57,440
you know yeah

2600
01:29:56,238 --> 01:29:59,759
so

2601
01:29:57,439 --> 01:30:01,039
but yeah i mean that's and i you know

2602
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:03,440
i'm pretty sure

2603
01:30:01,039 --> 01:30:06,399
uh you know he i i never lost i never

2604
01:30:03,439 --> 01:30:07,439
lost it after skunk gave it to me

2605
01:30:06,399 --> 01:30:08,799
um

2606
01:30:07,439 --> 01:30:11,359
yeah i mean that and that's that's the

2607
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:13,199
kind of thing like you know uh csi and i

2608
01:30:11,359 --> 01:30:14,799
talk about it all the time it's like are

2609
01:30:13,198 --> 01:30:18,000
there strains where like the chain of

2610
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:18,000
custody wasn't broken

2611
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:22,960
right right because once you lose the

2612
01:30:21,359 --> 01:30:26,799
chain of custody

2613
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:30,000
um you know it's hard

2614
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:31,039
it gets hard you know like um

2615
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:34,000
because

2616
01:30:31,039 --> 01:30:35,760
who knows you know you try to you you lo

2617
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,960
i lost the sour diesel you try to get it

2618
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:38,719
back it's not the same thing you

2619
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:40,960
remember you lost to this you try to get

2620
01:30:38,719 --> 01:30:45,279
it back it's not the same you remember

2621
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:45,279
um you know so on and so forth so

2622
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:51,360
kind of like when a 707 uh showboat got

2623
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:53,199
his bubba back from me

2624
01:30:51,359 --> 01:30:55,279
um i i

2625
01:30:53,198 --> 01:30:57,519
i don't think i did it on purpose it was

2626
01:30:55,279 --> 01:30:58,960
an accident it got mixed up in a flat

2627
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:00,480
because i was bringing a ton of people a

2628
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:03,039
bunch of stuff

2629
01:31:00,479 --> 01:31:05,599
at a party and uh

2630
01:31:03,039 --> 01:31:08,399
then like a year later he's like yeah

2631
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:10,639
and inspect his bubba and i was like

2632
01:31:08,399 --> 01:31:14,479
what's this inspector's bone

2633
01:31:10,639 --> 01:31:17,119
he had bomb threat and not oh [ __ ]

2634
01:31:14,479 --> 01:31:19,119
but i was like oh my bad my bad i'm

2635
01:31:17,119 --> 01:31:21,679
trying to give you you know the fake

2636
01:31:19,119 --> 01:31:22,559
that's one well not fake but you know

2637
01:31:21,679 --> 01:31:25,679
yeah

2638
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:28,560
but yeah that happens all the time

2639
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:30,480
i think i'd take a bomb thread over

2640
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:33,440
over original maybe

2641
01:31:30,479 --> 01:31:35,439
you can always get a new bomb threat if

2642
01:31:33,439 --> 01:31:36,719
you have that that's true that's true

2643
01:31:35,439 --> 01:31:37,839
it's a good point

2644
01:31:36,719 --> 01:31:40,000
you know

2645
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:41,600
here's a question for you since uh we've

2646
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,719
kind of meandered away from the forum

2647
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:43,440
stuff but

2648
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:45,198
do you

2649
01:31:43,439 --> 01:31:47,119
csi do you do any work with jesus are

2650
01:31:45,198 --> 01:31:48,000
you planning any work with it

2651
01:31:47,119 --> 01:31:50,238
uh

2652
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,238
uh

2653
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:55,760
maybe if i could find a mass super skunk

2654
01:31:54,238 --> 01:31:58,959
yeah yeah

2655
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:58,960
that was for you too really

2656
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:04,400
i was telling him last night that i

2657
01:32:02,238 --> 01:32:06,399
think he should because

2658
01:32:04,399 --> 01:32:08,879
i think it's a it's a rad clone but it

2659
01:32:06,399 --> 01:32:10,799
is it is very finicky and it does make

2660
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:12,880
it a lot harder to to pull off reversals

2661
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:14,480
on unhappy finicky [ __ ]

2662
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:16,000
right it would it would be really cool

2663
01:32:14,479 --> 01:32:21,198
to kind of

2664
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:22,399
uh attempt to remake like uh a sour type

2665
01:32:21,198 --> 01:32:25,119
from

2666
01:32:22,399 --> 01:32:27,839
you know building blocks i mean yeah

2667
01:32:25,119 --> 01:32:29,840
we all have the the 91

2668
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:31,679
but you know what building blocks you

2669
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:33,840
know it might not have to be the exact

2670
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:35,199
thing but what could you get close

2671
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:38,000
enough to

2672
01:32:35,198 --> 01:32:40,719
to make a sour diesel out of you know

2673
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:42,000
the original building blocks yeah

2674
01:32:40,719 --> 01:32:44,399
you know

2675
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:46,560
i think i think jesus leans closer to a

2676
01:32:44,399 --> 01:32:49,039
sour type than it does a chem type

2677
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:49,039
personally

2678
01:32:49,439 --> 01:32:52,559
oh yeah definitely definitely yeah i

2679
01:32:51,439 --> 01:32:55,279
think so

2680
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:56,400
it's a cool one yeah yeah

2681
01:32:55,279 --> 01:32:57,920
all right so people want to hear

2682
01:32:56,399 --> 01:32:59,359
something about irene i don't know what

2683
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:01,279
they want to hear about irene i think

2684
01:32:59,359 --> 01:33:04,479
we've already told the story of irene

2685
01:33:01,279 --> 01:33:06,840
but do you have any good irene tales

2686
01:33:04,479 --> 01:33:09,279
oh i don't know i

2687
01:33:06,840 --> 01:33:10,880
mean she's cool

2688
01:33:09,279 --> 01:33:11,679
i think

2689
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:14,239
um

2690
01:33:11,679 --> 01:33:16,000
i i had irene for a little bit

2691
01:33:14,238 --> 01:33:18,718
and didn't realize she was

2692
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:20,960
she was you know as as nice as she was

2693
01:33:18,719 --> 01:33:23,679
until i think i grew her outdoors

2694
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:25,679
uh in maybe 2008

2695
01:33:23,679 --> 01:33:27,039
i'm thinking

2696
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:28,639
yeah

2697
01:33:27,039 --> 01:33:31,679
i don't want to fudge the fudge the

2698
01:33:28,639 --> 01:33:33,359
dates though um but yes she came out so

2699
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:34,639
nice back then

2700
01:33:33,359 --> 01:33:36,880
you know

2701
01:33:34,639 --> 01:33:38,560
good old-fashioned atlanta

2702
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:40,719
atlanta's finest

2703
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:41,760
yeah it is a special one

2704
01:33:40,719 --> 01:33:44,239
yeah

2705
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:46,320
i mean it doesn't have a whole

2706
01:33:44,238 --> 01:33:48,559
whole lot of a story you know

2707
01:33:46,319 --> 01:33:49,599
yeah just another another bag seed

2708
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:51,120
really

2709
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:53,280
that's what it all boils down to it's

2710
01:33:51,119 --> 01:33:55,439
just another [ __ ] bad seed

2711
01:33:53,279 --> 01:33:57,519
i mean that is one of the most humbling

2712
01:33:55,439 --> 01:34:00,158
things about breeding

2713
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:03,440
is that a lot of the most famous strains

2714
01:34:00,158 --> 01:34:03,439
are total accidents

2715
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:07,280
right and you put a bunch of time and

2716
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:08,719
work and effort into stuff and then you

2717
01:34:07,279 --> 01:34:10,960
know your air conditioner goes out and

2718
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:14,560
some [ __ ] herms and the seed off of that

2719
01:34:10,960 --> 01:34:16,719
is better than anything you tried to do

2720
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:18,719
a lot of times when it comes to like

2721
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:21,359
these stories

2722
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:23,119
the accidental weed is so good it's what

2723
01:34:21,359 --> 01:34:25,198
makes people want to try to like

2724
01:34:23,119 --> 01:34:28,800
shoehorn in that they

2725
01:34:25,198 --> 01:34:30,960
had some intentional part of making it

2726
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:32,239
not so much that i was just there or we

2727
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:35,198
got late they don't want to say well i

2728
01:34:32,238 --> 01:34:36,879
just got lucky in my room

2729
01:34:35,198 --> 01:34:38,399
they want to be like oh well i did this

2730
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:39,920
and i did this and i did this and then

2731
01:34:38,399 --> 01:34:41,519
that happened and yeah now it's all the

2732
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:44,000
weed that you all love

2733
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:46,239
look everybody's got to work their stud

2734
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:48,960
isn't that how it's done you know but

2735
01:34:46,238 --> 01:34:51,279
but really it was more like you know i

2736
01:34:48,960 --> 01:34:54,239
was i had my room i ended up partying

2737
01:34:51,279 --> 01:34:55,840
for a few days i [ __ ] off i walked in

2738
01:34:54,238 --> 01:34:58,399
there there was some bananas i found

2739
01:34:55,840 --> 01:35:00,400
some seeds trimming

2740
01:34:58,399 --> 01:35:02,399
that's like 99

2741
01:35:00,399 --> 01:35:04,638
of bag seed stories

2742
01:35:02,399 --> 01:35:05,679
yeah that that's kind of why i believe

2743
01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:07,118
uh

2744
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:09,199
uh

2745
01:35:07,118 --> 01:35:11,599
matt burger and josh d story because

2746
01:35:09,198 --> 01:35:14,479
it's not impressive it's not a

2747
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:16,960
it it's a herm you know in a little

2748
01:35:14,479 --> 01:35:19,039
closet under the stairs story and it's

2749
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:20,319
just like who makes that stuff up that's

2750
01:35:19,039 --> 01:35:22,158
not right

2751
01:35:20,319 --> 01:35:24,960
that's just oops

2752
01:35:22,158 --> 01:35:27,759
yeah yeah i mean you know i it it that's

2753
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:30,239
very humbling but i i also do think that

2754
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:32,079
a lot of that 90s weed it just goes to

2755
01:35:30,238 --> 01:35:33,839
show that when you're crossing things

2756
01:35:32,079 --> 01:35:36,158
that like aren't

2757
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:38,880
when you're crossing real fire

2758
01:35:36,158 --> 01:35:39,679
you know right um it's a lot easier to

2759
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:41,600
get

2760
01:35:39,679 --> 01:35:43,199
you know like was was neville an amazing

2761
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:45,280
breeder or did he just get to get the

2762
01:35:43,198 --> 01:35:47,279
best of the best from america and cross

2763
01:35:45,279 --> 01:35:48,559
it together for the first time

2764
01:35:47,279 --> 01:35:49,599
right right

2765
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:52,000
you know what i'm saying there's a

2766
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:53,600
there's an ad there's arguments to both

2767
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:58,319
he was you know he was the first person

2768
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:58,320
to cross nl and skunk right

2769
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:02,159
huh

2770
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:03,039
not so what are you saying i'm rude no

2771
01:36:02,158 --> 01:36:04,399
uh

2772
01:36:03,039 --> 01:36:06,639
no uh

2773
01:36:04,399 --> 01:36:09,439
i was thinking you should get uh tom on

2774
01:36:06,639 --> 01:36:11,440
and try to get uh

2775
01:36:09,439 --> 01:36:14,000
figure out a little more details about

2776
01:36:11,439 --> 01:36:16,158
pine tar and all that kind of stuff

2777
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,118
because love to

2778
01:36:16,158 --> 01:36:19,679
you know

2779
01:36:17,118 --> 01:36:21,519
i don't think he even knows who i am to

2780
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:23,760
get him on

2781
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:26,480
or he's not likely

2782
01:36:23,760 --> 01:36:28,880
i i think he's banned off i see mag so

2783
01:36:26,479 --> 01:36:30,959
uh yeah i mean let me ask you like a

2784
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:32,960
real question do you think that he would

2785
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:36,800
be better for a live or do you think he

2786
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:40,399
would be better for uh a lightly edited

2787
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:42,159
uh podcast or something oh probably a a

2788
01:36:40,399 --> 01:36:44,238
heavily edited podcast you're right

2789
01:36:42,158 --> 01:36:45,759
because i mean we definitely matt and i

2790
01:36:44,238 --> 01:36:47,839
have definitely interviewed some like

2791
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:50,639
knowledgeable old-timers

2792
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:50,639
right been like

2793
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:55,360
yeah no

2794
01:36:53,039 --> 01:36:56,319
mom's a character i like him but man

2795
01:36:55,359 --> 01:36:58,559
he'll

2796
01:36:56,319 --> 01:36:58,559
yeah

2797
01:36:58,639 --> 01:37:02,480
he might pray off topic

2798
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:04,159
yeah

2799
01:37:02,479 --> 01:37:06,399
you know yeah so there's there is a

2800
01:37:04,158 --> 01:37:07,519
question everybody is asking and it's up

2801
01:37:06,399 --> 01:37:08,479
to you if you want to talk about i don't

2802
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:10,320
even know if you want to deal with this

2803
01:37:08,479 --> 01:37:12,959
one right now or save it for a full

2804
01:37:10,319 --> 01:37:16,399
episode caleb

2805
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:18,000
backstory on z what do you think

2806
01:37:16,399 --> 01:37:20,799
oh man

2807
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:22,880
um i don't want to like

2808
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:24,320
say anything yet

2809
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:26,639
because yeah let's say you want to save

2810
01:37:24,319 --> 01:37:29,198
it for a full show of some sort later

2811
01:37:26,639 --> 01:37:30,880
well i i still have some groans to do on

2812
01:37:29,198 --> 01:37:32,238
that whole thing but yeah

2813
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:33,279
man

2814
01:37:32,238 --> 01:37:35,919
i

2815
01:37:33,279 --> 01:37:40,000
i wouldn't be surprised if it's not just

2816
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:43,118
an s1 of of uh that green sherbert cut

2817
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:44,960
yeah um there's there's just two too

2818
01:37:43,118 --> 01:37:46,559
many similarities

2819
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:48,800
and

2820
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:51,600
the whole you know uh heterozygous

2821
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:54,159
homozygous thing between the two of them

2822
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:57,039
really kind of leans towards it just

2823
01:37:54,158 --> 01:37:58,238
being a as one of that

2824
01:37:57,039 --> 01:38:01,039
yeah but

2825
01:37:58,238 --> 01:38:01,039
i don't know um

2826
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:05,840
yeah i could go on and on on some

2827
01:38:04,079 --> 01:38:08,960
comparisons on

2828
01:38:05,840 --> 01:38:11,199
you know how some of that stuff could uh

2829
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:12,399
could potentially make sense

2830
01:38:11,198 --> 01:38:14,399
um yeah

2831
01:38:12,399 --> 01:38:15,759
but i don't know i don't know

2832
01:38:14,399 --> 01:38:17,759
yeah we'll save it for another time but

2833
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:20,000
yeah that's a that's a good answer one

2834
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:22,880
thing one thing that is going on

2835
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:25,359
uh about that is that um

2836
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:27,118
uh csi and i and matt we all talk all

2837
01:38:25,359 --> 01:38:28,319
the time about how when you compare

2838
01:38:27,118 --> 01:38:30,960
stories

2839
01:38:28,319 --> 01:38:33,840
to what the plants tell you

2840
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:36,239
uh how they breed what their s ones look

2841
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:38,239
like um what what they look like when

2842
01:38:36,238 --> 01:38:41,359
they get crossed to different things

2843
01:38:38,238 --> 01:38:43,439
and how what your eyes tell you lines up

2844
01:38:41,359 --> 01:38:46,079
with what the story is

2845
01:38:43,439 --> 01:38:48,879
right right right you know and sometimes

2846
01:38:46,079 --> 01:38:50,639
it it sometimes it adds a lot

2847
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:52,960
in terms of what you see

2848
01:38:50,639 --> 01:38:55,039
um you know like about i have a heart i

2849
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:58,560
have a really hard time believing

2850
01:38:55,039 --> 01:39:00,319
that the the cis the 91 the chem d and

2851
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:01,679
the one through four all came out of the

2852
01:39:00,319 --> 01:39:04,079
same bud

2853
01:39:01,679 --> 01:39:07,039
yeah yeah you know um they're just too

2854
01:39:04,079 --> 01:39:09,359
vastly different to me um you know but

2855
01:39:07,039 --> 01:39:10,800
that's i wasn't there either

2856
01:39:09,359 --> 01:39:13,599
you know and a lot of this stuff is like

2857
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:14,560
the most famous stories

2858
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:16,560
they

2859
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:19,039
almost because almost all of them come

2860
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:20,960
from accidents and because a lot of them

2861
01:39:19,039 --> 01:39:23,359
come from other people it's like the

2862
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:25,920
people that marketed stuff or marketed

2863
01:39:23,359 --> 01:39:28,000
skittles or marketed cookie or whatever

2864
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:29,679
like they probably you know different

2865
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:32,238
people get it maybe it doesn't get quite

2866
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:32,239
as famous

2867
01:39:32,399 --> 01:39:36,238
you know um you know and they should get

2868
01:39:34,639 --> 01:39:37,840
great credit for marketing it to the

2869
01:39:36,238 --> 01:39:41,718
point that they did

2870
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:41,719
yeah right oh yeah

2871
01:39:42,319 --> 01:39:48,000
i've never disputed that um you know i i

2872
01:39:45,359 --> 01:39:50,880
give lots of people accolades for mar

2873
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:52,960
successfully marketing and you know

2874
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:55,118
building you know clones that would

2875
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:56,719
never have been anything up you know to

2876
01:39:55,118 --> 01:39:57,679
what they are

2877
01:39:56,719 --> 01:39:59,760
uh

2878
01:39:57,679 --> 01:40:01,440
what i've always you know frowned on of

2879
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:03,520
course is you know people being

2880
01:40:01,439 --> 01:40:04,638
dishonest doing it i think you can do it

2881
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:06,639
honestly

2882
01:40:04,639 --> 01:40:07,440
and still be successful

2883
01:40:06,639 --> 01:40:09,679
sure

2884
01:40:07,439 --> 01:40:12,158
you know having to just make up big old

2885
01:40:09,679 --> 01:40:14,399
big ol you know fictitious backstories

2886
01:40:12,158 --> 01:40:15,359
or yeah like you're the one responsible

2887
01:40:14,399 --> 01:40:17,198
for it

2888
01:40:15,359 --> 01:40:18,559
that's why instead of you know i mean

2889
01:40:17,198 --> 01:40:20,319
there's cats like

2890
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:22,080
you know josh and matt who are like oh

2891
01:40:20,319 --> 01:40:24,238
yeah it was a herm accident under the

2892
01:40:22,079 --> 01:40:26,158
stairs and then there's other cats you

2893
01:40:24,238 --> 01:40:28,079
know who are like yes we created that

2894
01:40:26,158 --> 01:40:31,039
from our multi-thousand plant grows

2895
01:40:28,079 --> 01:40:33,679
aren't we awesome yes yes we popped we

2896
01:40:31,039 --> 01:40:35,198
popped 15 seeds and the 20th was the

2897
01:40:33,679 --> 01:40:37,359
best

2898
01:40:35,198 --> 01:40:40,079
so you know

2899
01:40:37,359 --> 01:40:42,880
um you know i

2900
01:40:40,079 --> 01:40:45,118
i think the the truth is is

2901
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:47,039
the the biggest factor for me

2902
01:40:45,118 --> 01:40:48,960
yeah and yeah there's an aspect where

2903
01:40:47,039 --> 01:40:52,399
and and you know we should say this too

2904
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:54,399
is that truth is a most people everyone

2905
01:40:52,399 --> 01:40:56,000
likes to say they want the truth but

2906
01:40:54,399 --> 01:40:58,158
like people that really care about it

2907
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,198
it's like a really small percentage

2908
01:40:58,158 --> 01:41:02,158
yeah oh

2909
01:40:59,198 --> 01:41:04,238
most people like truth if it helps them

2910
01:41:02,158 --> 01:41:05,599
burnish their money or their reputation

2911
01:41:04,238 --> 01:41:08,638
or whatever else

2912
01:41:05,600 --> 01:41:10,239
sure and the truth is usually boring you

2913
01:41:08,639 --> 01:41:12,639
know people who are looking for

2914
01:41:10,238 --> 01:41:14,479
excitement from the truth

2915
01:41:12,639 --> 01:41:16,159
they're going to be like oh well that

2916
01:41:14,479 --> 01:41:18,319
was lame

2917
01:41:16,158 --> 01:41:20,399
yeah something up i don't care

2918
01:41:18,319 --> 01:41:22,238
especially when the answer is 99 of the

2919
01:41:20,399 --> 01:41:23,439
time oh it's a bad seed

2920
01:41:22,238 --> 01:41:25,439
yeah

2921
01:41:23,439 --> 01:41:27,678
or yeah or you know or it happened an

2922
01:41:25,439 --> 01:41:29,359
accident at my buddy's house

2923
01:41:27,679 --> 01:41:31,039
or yeah i said this or i was you know

2924
01:41:29,359 --> 01:41:32,639
like you know you were early involved

2925
01:41:31,039 --> 01:41:34,800
and you know the story even just knowing

2926
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:36,800
the story is cool

2927
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:38,320
right but then people want to be part

2928
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:39,520
like they want to be this active

2929
01:41:38,319 --> 01:41:42,399
component

2930
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:43,920
that was critical to the story

2931
01:41:42,399 --> 01:41:44,960
you know

2932
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:47,118
right

2933
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:48,960
and i i did forget someone earlier that

2934
01:41:47,118 --> 01:41:50,719
was really important when i was was you

2935
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:52,158
know coming in and that was that was

2936
01:41:50,719 --> 01:41:54,880
doing reversals before i was and that

2937
01:41:52,158 --> 01:41:56,799
was rascal i think i think i would be

2938
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:58,719
remiss not to mention him because he was

2939
01:41:56,800 --> 01:42:00,800
doing good things and had legitimate

2940
01:41:58,719 --> 01:42:02,960
cuts you know for the most part as far

2941
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:04,560
as i know like he was doing good [ __ ]

2942
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:06,158
work and he was doing it at a time when

2943
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:08,320
it wasn't popular when people were

2944
01:42:06,158 --> 01:42:10,079
pushing back against feminist seed so i

2945
01:42:08,319 --> 01:42:11,840
give that guy props too all the stuff

2946
01:42:10,079 --> 01:42:15,039
that that guy made between whatever it

2947
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:17,039
was 09 and 12 or whatever yeah all those

2948
01:42:15,039 --> 01:42:18,880
hybrids are fire yeah there was some

2949
01:42:17,039 --> 01:42:21,359
good [ __ ] in there i mean he really

2950
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:23,039
maybe not all but like the vast majority

2951
01:42:21,359 --> 01:42:25,439
of the stuff he had some really nice

2952
01:42:23,039 --> 01:42:27,760
cuts and he was crossing them together

2953
01:42:25,439 --> 01:42:30,319
and they led to some really nice things

2954
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:31,679
yeah i mean white fire you know a lot of

2955
01:42:30,319 --> 01:42:33,039
people don't even know like about the

2956
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:34,719
white anymore like not a lot of people

2957
01:42:33,039 --> 01:42:36,479
talk about it but that was the essence

2958
01:42:34,719 --> 01:42:37,279
behind the white fire that was [ __ ]

2959
01:42:36,479 --> 01:42:38,559
cool

2960
01:42:37,279 --> 01:42:39,840
right right

2961
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:40,840
yep

2962
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:42,800
that

2963
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:44,560
uh what

2964
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:48,079

he's alluded a lot to

2970
01:42:55,118 --> 01:43:00,158
knowing exactly what the hybrid of the

2971
01:42:57,279 --> 01:43:01,198
white is because it's supposedly a tk

2972
01:43:00,158 --> 01:43:02,399
hybrid

2973
01:43:01,198 --> 01:43:03,678

language when it comes to that you know

2984

2986
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:30,800

yeah yeah

2988
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:35,520
there there was a there was one plant in

2989
01:43:33,279 --> 01:43:36,639
our first run of them

2990
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:37,520
where

2991
01:43:36,639 --> 01:43:38,800
um

2992
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:41,520
actually there was there was there was

2993
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:42,800
four plants that uh we pulled out of the

2994
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:44,960
first run

2995
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:47,520
um and uh

2996
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:49,039
one was a green girl scout cookie like a

2997
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:51,679
green forum cut

2998
01:43:49,039 --> 01:43:52,960
um other was a plant that looked just

2999
01:43:51,679 --> 01:43:54,079
like the white

3000
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:55,039
you know not

3001
01:43:54,079 --> 01:43:56,319
but

3002
01:43:55,039 --> 01:43:58,719
so similar

3003
01:43:56,319 --> 01:44:01,519
yeah it was obvious and then there was

3004
01:43:58,719 --> 01:44:03,840
the number 50 and the 51 were

3005
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:07,520
which were my two actual favorites of

3006
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:10,079
the whole bunch and then you know i i

3007
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:12,239
smoked both those heavily and the 50

3008
01:44:10,079 --> 01:44:13,359
turned out to be my absolute favorite of

3009
01:44:12,238 --> 01:44:16,000
the whole bunch

3010
01:44:13,359 --> 01:44:18,479
and so that's the one i kept and

3011
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:21,520
still play with from the first and then

3012
01:44:18,479 --> 01:44:22,559
i did another 100 plus you know tks one

3013
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:25,600
pop and

3014
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:26,880
you know got other selections from there

3015
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:29,760
yeah

3016
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:30,960
so caleb what do you think about cookies

3017
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:32,480
uh

3018
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:34,719
great question from ask what do you

3019
01:44:32,479 --> 01:44:37,359
think

3020
01:44:34,719 --> 01:44:38,880
i think that goes into the category of

3021
01:44:37,359 --> 01:44:44,559
2000

3022
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:47,039
uh what 2010 and on 2010 2011 yeah

3023
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:49,280
people people ask a bunch of that

3024
01:44:47,039 --> 01:44:50,880
and i think i mean

3025
01:44:49,279 --> 01:44:52,800
it's a story

3026
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:54,319
you know and it's a story that like

3027
01:44:52,800 --> 01:44:55,760
there's a lot of pieces that aren't

3028
01:44:54,319 --> 01:44:56,719
known that well

3029
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:58,480
um

3030
01:44:56,719 --> 01:45:00,319
but it's a definitely one that's going

3031
01:44:58,479 --> 01:45:02,079

01:45:05,039 --> 01:45:08,479

showing my face or chatting about stuff

3090
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:06,080
they both pushed for quite a long time

3091
01:47:03,439 --> 01:47:06,879
to get me to tell stories and talk [ __ ]

3092
01:47:06,079 --> 01:47:09,679
um

3093
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:11,760
so really it it really is they gave me

3094
01:47:09,679 --> 01:47:13,118
the confidence to say you people would

3095
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:15,360
want to hear it

3096
01:47:13,118 --> 01:47:16,960
let's chat let's talk history

3097
01:47:15,359 --> 01:47:18,319
and you know and there's an aspect to it

3098
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:20,399
too where it's like a lot of the stuff

3099
01:47:18,319 --> 01:47:21,920
we're talking about with you guys this

3100
01:47:20,399 --> 01:47:24,479
is what we have all been doing amongst

3101
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:25,600
each other privately for [ __ ] ever

3102
01:47:24,479 --> 01:47:27,118
yeah

3103
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:29,920
so we've all heard each other's stupid

3104
01:47:27,118 --> 01:47:32,079
[ __ ] stories 100 times you know

3105
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:34,399
and and all that and so this is this is

3106
01:47:32,079 --> 01:47:37,279
really how information gets information

3107
01:47:34,399 --> 01:47:40,000
and cuts gets saved and shared

3108
01:47:37,279 --> 01:47:42,158
and you know history survives and

3109
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:44,719
generally the point of all this is to

3110
01:47:42,158 --> 01:47:46,799
get you know versions of history out

3111
01:47:44,719 --> 01:47:48,800
there and gets passed along

3112
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:50,800
right yep so other things newer people

3113
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:52,320
can hear it so it's it's just not a wash

3114
01:47:50,800 --> 01:47:53,920
in [ __ ]

3115
01:47:52,319 --> 01:47:55,599

3124
01:48:09,118 --> 01:48:12,559
