00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:08,939
cannabis Show Breaking Down the myths

3
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:10,739
and history in cannabis I'm Matthew seed

4
00:00:08,939 --> 00:00:12,599
maker for over a decade and a half and

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,240
this is my journey in defining my truth

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:18,480
in this wild world of cannabis I invite

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,820
you to join me and the can Illuminati by

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,160
strapping into the passenger seat but be

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,660
warned it's not always pretty with the

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,518
invasion of corporate culture into

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,740
cannabis it's getting even more muddy

12
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:30,538
which is why I've made it my mission to

13
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:32,579
have a permanent record before all the

14
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:33,480
history is lost and buried under a pile

15
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,100
of

16
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:37,379
cookies

17
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,300
we're the traditional Market

18
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,679
The Syndicate is a collection of seed

19
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:43,738
makers that want to push back against

20
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:45,299
all the smoke and mirrors in doing so we

21
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:47,339
will continue to ruffle the feathers of

22
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:49,738
those who oppose and my personal mission

23
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,200
has become much bigger than myself

24
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:54,619
welcome to the Cannabis Underground

25
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,359
this is the revolution

26
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:59,218
[Music]

27
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:02,579
hello everyone welcome to breeder

28
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:04,198
Syndicate I'm Matthew riot here with my

29
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:07,140
co-host Alison Fulton today we're going

30
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:09,420
to be discussing something that uh

31
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,579
it's one of the most important topics in

32
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,379
cannabis uh not just breeding but it's

33
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:16,798
an integral part of breeding which is

34
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:18,379
the name game how does it work what are

35
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,060
its implications

36
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:23,519
what are some variables that go into

37
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,759
selecting and how do those affect the

38
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,920
outcome of the final flower uh

39
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,659
medically or otherwise

40
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,820
um so yeah this is something I'm super

41
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,979
passionate about and we've been kind of

42
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:37,199
talking about it a little bit and and I

43
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:39,900
felt like as an overall arching theme

44
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,400
for um this season one of the things I

45
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,240
wanted to drive home

46
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,978
was reaching the end user of flower

47
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:48,899
because it's not something something

48
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:50,938
that we deal with a lot they're not

49
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,200
they're not our main

50
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:54,898
um

51
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,280
what would you call that are the people

52
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:58,200
watching our show they're not our main

53
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,280
demographic the end user of the flower a

54
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,899
lot of times the people watching our

55
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,579
show are seed makers or people

56
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:03,599
interested specifically in genetics and

57
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:05,639
breeding

58
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:09,118
but this season I really want to tap

59
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,280
into them because in the end they are

60
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,739
the people that need to know they are

61
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,878
the consumers and uh they need to

62
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:16,980
understand what they're putting in their

63
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:19,079
body and I I think this is one of the

64
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:21,359
few ways that we can do it so with that

65
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,800
thousand

66
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,500
yeah I think

67
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,060
the only things I'll add are this sort

68
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,280
of does apply to seeds as well and it

69
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,620
sort of does apply to clones as well to

70
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,620
a degree in terms of like the broader

71
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,360
market so I think in a way we will be

72
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,000
covering we'll touch on all of those

73
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,980
things I think uh and if we don't get

74
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,159
enough time we'll we'll return to this

75
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:47,219
because this is yeah like Matt said one

76
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:50,519
of the core issues

77
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:52,318
um that we we want to highlight

78
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:53,939
um

79
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:54,958
I don't know there's much else for me to

80
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:55,800
say

81
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,500
um

82
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,319
I think Matt you want to start with

83
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:06,060
from a Breeder's point of view initially

84
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:07,139
you know what goes into naming something

85
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,539
so

86
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:11,759
um when I started thinking about the the

87
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:13,560
whole topic and and how we could cover

88
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,399
it maybe or if it was even worth talking

89
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,300
about

90
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,939
I I wanted to start from a seed Maker's

91
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:24,360
perspective or a Breeder's perspective

92
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:27,239
um during the my early days

93
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:30,060
um so we're talking you know 2006

94
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:32,878
to 2012 right right around in that era

95
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,500
uh actually probably 2006 2010 and then

96
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,179
before like obviously before I came in

97
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,158
this is relevant

98
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,900
um but this is just from my experience

99
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:41,039
how it went

100
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,019
um different breeders had different

101
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:44,759
methods for coming up with names a lot

102
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:47,340
of those that started early on whether

103
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:49,079
it was from Neville you know saying wow

104
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,819
that that butt is awful large yielding

105
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,060
that is a big bud

106
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:56,518
um or uh wow that one smells skunky

107
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,560
that's skunk you know you would you

108
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,959
would pick things whether it was the

109
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,900
scent the look

110
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,299
um any number of things like that but

111
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,799
really obvious visual cues scent cues

112
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:08,879
stuff like that when you were picking

113
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:10,438
names

114
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:13,739
um sometimes it wasn't like that in the

115
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:16,019
case of something like AK-47 you know

116
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:20,100
um but generally speaking they were

117
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:21,600
pretty easy uh to assess like names were

118
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,479
individual

119
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,520
you knew if it was bubbleberry it was

120
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,500
gonna be Sega Mathis bubbleberry

121
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:30,299
generally speaking right before the

122
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:34,379
before the white labeling came on and

123
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:37,319
and all the [ __ ] shows started but um

124
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:39,360
let's see there's also the combinations

125
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:40,800
of when you combine strains like when we

126
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,060
started doing hybrids you know let's say

127
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,139
you have a blueberry and a bubble gum

128
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,899
you combine them and now you have

129
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:47,699
bubbleberry or we have let's say uh Girl

130
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:50,579
Scout cookies and blueberry now you have

131
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:52,199
cookie Berry or you know the white cut

132
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:54,240
across the Fire OG now you have White

133
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,400
Fire OG these were just really simple

134
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,918
ways to do it like there was a lot of

135
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,539
creativity in it but it helped it helped

136
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:01,859
Define what you were going to get and

137
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,120
and because of the name you knew okay

138
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,680
it's gonna be like the white it's gonna

139
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,240
be like the fire we're gonna see you

140
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,060
know projecty somewhere in between the

141
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,280
two and it's kind of how it went

142
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:15,780
um let's see

143
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:17,939
there was also I think the effect of the

144
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:20,279
different scale uh the number of people

145
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:21,959
who were in the industry back then yeah

146
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:24,418
as compared to now you were saying like

147
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:27,060
back then conceivably you could quite

148
00:05:24,418 --> 00:05:29,538
easily search for the name that you are

149
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,399
you want to use and

150
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:33,719
feel like you have kind of done a little

151
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:35,819
bit of due diligence I think you wanted

152
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,580
to talk about like what due diligence

153
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:41,099
really meant back then or yeah

154
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:43,198
that's right um so it was a lot easier

155
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,400
to step on toes that's kind of the word

156
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,259
we always used

157
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:48,179
um or to avoid it

158
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:50,520
um because it weren't a whole lot of us

159
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,918
like people looking in nowadays like

160
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:54,740
look bad like look at history and they

161
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:57,418
see you know tens of thousands of

162
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:59,400
breeders and strains and all this you

163
00:05:57,418 --> 00:06:01,258
know all these names but back then there

164
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:03,418
wasn't a whole shitload of people making

165
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:05,699
seeds there really wasn't so it was

166
00:06:03,418 --> 00:06:07,560
really easy for people to communicate

167
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,180
with each other uh though not everybody

168
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,680
did communicate back some people

169
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,538
obviously were less communicative than

170
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,100
others but there was also very few

171
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,839
reference sites there were I mean we

172
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,000
knew the forums we knew where we could

173
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:19,799
search and look for names

174
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,300
um to see if it had been used it was a

175
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,660
lot easier to figure that stuff out

176
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:27,240
granted it wasn't you know Surefire but

177
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:29,100
it was pretty good it was pretty easy to

178
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,840
see if it name had been used and if

179
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,639
you're gonna step on toes and if so what

180
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:34,560
toes you were going to step on dude and

181
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,418
we could we just considered a due

182
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,038
diligence it was polite you know if

183
00:06:36,418 --> 00:06:40,139
someone was around before you and it

184
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:44,120
chosen the name before you it wasn't

185
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:47,240
polite to then take that name use what

186
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:50,100
time marketing money they had put into

187
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,780
branding The Strain and then take it for

188
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,060
yourself and then try to bump off it and

189
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:57,239
that and it's like that in any commodity

190
00:06:54,060 --> 00:07:00,120
any industry names uh are meant to

191
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,160
identify and and it was easier to do do

192
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,939
Jilla due diligence

193
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,580
um

194
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:07,079
but nowadays I think is where we're

195
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:08,519
heading right

196
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:10,379
and

197
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:12,719
it's not looking so good

198
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:15,360
it's not looking so easy

199
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,580
what are some examples to you of names

200
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,098
that just don't really mean

201
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:21,659
either what they say or just they just

202
00:07:20,098 --> 00:07:24,060
don't really mean anything at all and I

203
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:26,400
know you had a couple of examples so

204
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,620
like recently doing the reviews that

205
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:30,418
we've been taught you know doing on our

206
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,519
show and and I'll talk about it some

207
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:34,318
more later because it's very it very

208
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:35,639
much ties into the whole theme of this

209
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,280
season

210
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:40,199
um I've run into some really confusing

211
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:41,879
stuff so for those who don't know real

212
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,460
quickly I've avoided the modern Market

213
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:46,860
as far as like what's being pushed or

214
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:49,379
hyped in in collectives and dispensaries

215
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,360
what you know the height Flower Boys and

216
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:54,538
the heady boys are smoking I have no

217
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:57,000
clue I have zero clue didn't care I knew

218
00:07:54,538 --> 00:07:58,800
what I liked and it just I saw it as all

219
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,418
the same stuff however

220
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,160
um I've been trying to dive into it so I

221
00:08:00,418 --> 00:08:03,839
can have an actual educated perspective

222
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,039
on it and not just speak

223
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,739
um from the hip

224
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:11,159
and I've been encountering a lot of

225
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:14,519
these these major uh I mean you know

226
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:17,639
clashes in in eras in Generations on how

227
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:19,079
we name stuff like uh for example I saw

228
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:20,579
Blue Sushi and I was like okay I don't

229
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:22,680
know what Sushi is right I've never

230
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:24,000
heard that one but blue that tells me

231
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,340
it's going to be a blueberry hybrid

232
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,899
probably smell blueberry that sounds

233
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,638
legit like that's because I like

234
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:32,278
blueberry that's when I see blue that's

235
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:34,918
what I go for I like things with with uh

236
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:37,860
that scent that smell that high

237
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:40,259
and I look it up and it's like some

238
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:43,500
weddings ghettels there's no blue in it

239
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:46,500
I was so confused I did not get it how

240
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,240
do you come up with Blue Sushi like and

241
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:51,179
that's aside from the fact of what Zushi

242
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,339
is who knows you know but the the one

243
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:56,278
thing in there that does speak to its

244
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:58,140
lineage is just the Z right that's it

245
00:08:56,278 --> 00:08:59,700
that's it yeah if a z is in there so you

246
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:01,679
know it might have some Skittles in it

247
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,060
maybe if you're lucky they're like you

248
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:05,039
know I mean like nowadays I don't even

249
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:06,539
know that that means much the Z might be

250
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:09,120
more popular than the actual strain

251
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:10,439
Skittles now in strain names so you know

252
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,000
I I would bet that there's a lot of

253
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,980
stuff out there with Z in it that don't

254
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,139
have z in it you know in the actual

255
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:18,000
strain it's crazy

256
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:20,399
but yeah I think it's definitely worth

257
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,659
highlighting as well where like

258
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:27,539
uh just using the the letter Z is now

259
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:29,480
like adding adding something to your

260
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:32,879
name

261
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:35,339
yeah it has it adds content implied

262
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:37,980
context that may not be there yeah but

263
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:40,860
it's implied yeah for sure but it's also

264
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:42,720
based on the Breeders or whatever seed

265
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,480
makers knowledge that people are looking

266
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,778
for that in that signifier people want

267
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,459
that c yeah yeah but I mean a lot of

268
00:09:48,778 --> 00:09:52,439
this I started seeing with like animal

269
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:55,199
cookies and Girl Scout cookies that was

270
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,700
like the first notable examples to me

271
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,140
um I mean granted there were blueberries

272
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,120
out there that were nothing blue or

273
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:01,740
related but that was just people I think

274
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,659
just really confused on what they had

275
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,399
but like when we got to Girl Scout

276
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:07,740
cookies and animal cookies

277
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:09,419
I was fully expecting these things to

278
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,680
smell and taste like

279
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:12,838
sweet

280
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:14,519
cookies and they just don't like people

281
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:17,100
say oh it's doughy it's you know like

282
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:20,278
maybe to them but like doughy

283
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:22,320
is not sweet cookies like it is not an

284
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:25,139
animal cracker like these are very far

285
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,278
from it you know wedding cake it's kind

286
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:29,519
of doughy

287
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:31,200
kind of creamy is it like does it smell

288
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,120
like sweet birthday cake or wedding cake

289
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,519
no not at all

290
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,799
um does it taste like it so

291
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,839
yeah I mean before this would anyone

292
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:43,019
have been like yeah I want some dough

293
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,600
Terps like it's that I've never I would

294
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:47,039
have never thought I've never heard that

295
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,560
you know like you'd be like oh you got

296
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:51,539
that Pine you got that that kush you

297
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:54,619
know but I've never I can't wait to

298
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:56,819
smoke that dough never had that now

299
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,560
doughy just sounds to me like something

300
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:01,920
went wrong

301
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:04,018
to me what doe implied was a bat like a

302
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:05,399
bad expression from OG kush or triangle

303
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:07,620
and a hybrid that's where you usually

304
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,480
run into like the bad expressions of

305
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:12,060
triangle and OG kush or the doughiness

306
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:15,539
which is bad expression or like bad

307
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:17,099
processing right like yeah yeah but I

308
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:19,078
mean when I say bad expression it's

309
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,778
obviously preference too because it's

310
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:24,059
not what I prefer like I prefer like

311
00:11:21,778 --> 00:11:25,500
very specific ends of OG Kush and when I

312
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:26,639
hit that realm I'm like

313
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,919
common

314
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:31,379
boofy end so let's move the other

315
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:32,699
direction but someone found that as a a

316
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:34,740
very

317
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:37,259
um as their keeper and apparently it

318
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,600
resonated with the world so

319
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:41,578
that you know that that is just my

320
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,440
opinion uh but I mean then we have

321
00:11:41,578 --> 00:11:48,239
things like gushers

322
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:51,540
um gelati uh gedapists just whatever

323
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:54,539
name they can throw on [ __ ] that implies

324
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:55,319
so much like I was seeing lychee

325
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:58,439
um

326
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:01,019
um tarot bun like there's these aren't

327
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:03,079
in cannabis I'm sorry

328
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:06,060
and and I don't know if it's

329
00:12:03,078 --> 00:12:07,859
psychosomatism that makes people

330
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:09,958
think that this is what they're going to

331
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,800
experience and then therefore experience

332
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:12,539
it

333
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:17,099
like suggestion

334
00:12:12,539 --> 00:12:18,899
or does the modern Market not care if

335
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:21,540
the name resembles

336
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:23,399
what the expectations are setting and is

337
00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:26,278
it is it because I'm old and been in a

338
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:28,019
long time that I have those expectations

339
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:29,399
I don't know maybe that's something you

340
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:32,039
can comment on Thousand because you're

341
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:34,019
you're from a different era

342
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:35,578
I mean from a cynical point of view it's

343
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:40,200
unsurprising

344
00:12:35,578 --> 00:12:43,259
um like you said previously you

345
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:45,180
could rely on names actually

346
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:47,159
corresponding with some quality of the

347
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:49,799
plant or some quality of some some

348
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:52,199
aspect of its lineage

349
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:54,319
um but increasingly as the names

350
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:57,480
themselves have

351
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,860
started to

352
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,420
you know have their own kind of like

353
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,860
clout games

354
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:03,838
yeah

355
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:06,778
um people would just

356
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:09,240
focus on engineering names uh and the

357
00:13:06,778 --> 00:13:10,679
names themselves become

358
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,940
you know what people make the decisions

359
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:14,458
based on I don't think they didn't

360
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:17,100
adding anything new but yeah that's just

361
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:19,199
I mean like from your perspective like

362
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,540
when you came in and you started smoking

363
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,000
a lot and buying strains you know what I

364
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:26,219
mean did you have expectations at that

365
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,539
maybe these Skittles would actually

366
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,540
taste like Skittles

367
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:36,740
I mean that that first of all depends on

368
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:36,739
me knowing what Skittles even is right

369
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:42,360
not really or I mean it I'm sure I'll

370
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,820
put it this way I'm sure it is right but

371
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,639
candy because of the way the market

372
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,959
works here it's not like we all

373
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:51,539
we all have access to the same

374
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:53,939
information or it's like a unified scene

375
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:56,519
in any way it's it's still really like

376
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:57,660
fragmented here you know people are just

377
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:00,060
like

378
00:13:57,659 --> 00:14:01,919
you know

379
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:03,239
yeah the Skittles candy for sure you

380
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:05,699
don't have Skittles candy

381
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,919
no we do we do okay that's right I guess

382
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:10,920
I just mean I guess I just mean that

383
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:12,659
like the conical Community or

384
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:14,879
quote-unquote industry here isn't

385
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:16,439
unified enough to kind of have a sense

386
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:18,958
of like

387
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,820
what these things actually mean

388
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,919
um

389
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:25,620
there isn't like a generally accepted

390
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:27,360
sense of anything but from your

391
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,360
perspective your personal perspective

392
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,039
having like having since you have the

393
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,320
candy Skittles there right like you have

394
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:36,240
did you have that as a kid

395
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,920
yeah yeah so if you're asking like you

396
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,299
know if I see the name Skittles would I

397
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,740
immediately make that Association yeah

398
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:42,059
of course I would did you I mean did you

399
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,519
have the expectation when you first

400
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:45,778
heard of Skittles The Strain yeah like

401
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:48,078
that's probably gonna be at least you

402
00:14:45,778 --> 00:14:50,639
know somewhere in that room yeah

403
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:53,278
I've got a good anecdote for this which

404
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:56,159
is that the first pack of seeds I ever

405
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:59,759
bought was called gorilla Skittles and

406
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:02,519
it was from Barney's right yeah and I'll

407
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:05,338
be honest with you when I when I chose

408
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:08,759
it it was completely arbitrary I was

409
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:12,240
just I was so overwhelmed by the names

410
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:15,419
that were on those websites that yeah I

411
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,220
just picked a name that sounded

412
00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:19,078
it's something that just stood out or

413
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,339
seemed even more bizarre than the other

414
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:22,500
names

415
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:26,100
um and at the time I had very little

416
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,539
appreciation for the history

417
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:31,199
um or what any of those things actually

418
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:32,399
meant uh sure you know what you get uh

419
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:34,799
photographs

420
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,419
whatever they've written

421
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,759
um and whatever other people say about

422
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:40,198
it right which I think you know I I

423
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:42,720
definitely have more to say about later

424
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:44,639
as well but yeah in terms of my initial

425
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,920
experiences looking at these play you

426
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,740
know uh looking at these products

427
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:51,659
yeah it was overwhelming it seemed

428
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:54,480
arbitrary

429
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:57,120
um and

430
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,120
yeah I don't know everyone watching this

431
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,980
right now in the comments below add in

432
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,899
your um thoughts like because I'm really

433
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,639
interested to see one what was

434
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:08,519
everyone's first seed purchase in what

435
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:10,320
year add that in also what were your

436
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:11,720
expectations when buying this and what

437
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,860
did you

438
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,420
what did you what went into your

439
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:19,079
purchase was it the grams per square

440
00:16:15,419 --> 00:16:21,899
meter pictures name

441
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:23,278
um reputation of strain so yeah in the

442
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:26,698
comments below if you can if you can

443
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:28,439
tell us what you think I'd love to know

444
00:16:26,698 --> 00:16:30,419
let's see

445
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:33,060
so we have the the seed buying

446
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:35,039
perspective a seed buyers perspective

447
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:37,739
kind of talked about that a little bit

448
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:40,980
uh we talked about how we choose names

449
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:43,320
let's see where are we at

450
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:45,720
I mean I'll just I'll say a bit more on

451
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:49,560
say buying I think

452
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:52,920
if you if you're new and you look at a c

453
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:55,859
bank website and look at the names

454
00:16:52,919 --> 00:17:00,120
you you you won't have a sense of like

455
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:02,278
what's important slash popular yet

456
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:05,400
um so you won't you won't necessarily

457
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:07,140
know what chem dog means or what sure OG

458
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,759
Kush means or what Gorilla Glue means or

459
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:11,640
Skittles yet

460
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:14,099
and then in the absence of having any

461
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,259
context historically

462
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:18,058
um you do then gravitate towards brand

463
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:20,220
names that you are familiar with or

464
00:17:18,058 --> 00:17:22,019
strong associations like you you were

465
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,539
talking about that

466
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:26,519
um and that's where the game you know

467
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:28,199
that that's where it gets it gets crazy

468
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:30,058
because

469
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:32,460
all you have

470
00:17:30,058 --> 00:17:34,200
is you know in terms of you uh looking

471
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:38,640
at these things all the information that

472
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:39,660
you get is like yeah photographs

473
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,360
um whatever arbitrary information

474
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:44,279
they've decided to include uh whatever

475
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:45,839
kind of thin branding

476
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:48,538
um they've developed around these

477
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:51,298
products and maybe some like social

478
00:17:48,538 --> 00:17:53,339
media interactions that you get to see

479
00:17:51,298 --> 00:17:56,220
um

480
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:57,359
yeah I mean and at this point it's kind

481
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:00,120
of like

482
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:02,159
this is why like a lot of people ask me

483
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:04,439
why I got into this when did I get into

484
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,480
history it was because I realized like

485
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,700
kind of once I started seeing all this

486
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,460
stuff going through the logic of seed

487
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,558
buying I was spending my money on seeds

488
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:16,079
I had already taken a big dive at one

489
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:17,819
point on a massive purchase from

490
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:19,500
Amsterdam on a bunch of Dutch companies

491
00:18:17,819 --> 00:18:22,079
and

492
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:24,058
I realized at one point all I have is

493
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,038
info from these people I need to know

494
00:18:24,058 --> 00:18:27,839
who the people are giving me this info

495
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:30,839
and are they reliable

496
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:32,699
that that was the the point of where I

497
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:35,459
realized I need to see who these people

498
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:37,259
are like are they are they good

499
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:39,480
researchers are they passing on reliable

500
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:41,160
info is this something they're making up

501
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,779
are they the type of person who would

502
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:45,419
make something up do they have a history

503
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:47,700
of this you know that's when that all

504
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:49,500
became really important and and that's

505
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,360
when I started my journey and when I

506
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,400
started asking like at this point

507
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:55,678
between grower to buyer is there any

508
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,360
chance someone would have a motive to

509
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,759
change the name on what they purchased

510
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:02,038
as a clone or a seed to meet market

511
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:04,619
demand How likely is that to occur and

512
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:06,599
how often do we think that is occurring

513
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:08,519
you know that's that's when all those

514
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:10,259
questions came and started swelling to

515
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:12,839
me

516
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:16,019
okay maybe maybe this is a good point

517
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:17,819
for me to introduce a little uh

518
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:19,798
uh analogy

519
00:19:17,819 --> 00:19:21,899
and this is actually something it's a

520
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:24,538
it's an article written by a writer

521
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:26,038
journalist called Jenny Odell and it's

522
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:28,079
called there's no such thing as a free

523
00:19:26,038 --> 00:19:29,160
watch and I won't go into too much

524
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,558
detail

525
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:34,320
um that I would say that the

526
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:36,119
the piece itself is an amazing read for

527
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:38,220
those of you who are interested but I'll

528
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:39,000
give you a little a little rundown on

529
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,460
like

530
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,558
what she discovered and what this is all

531
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:45,000
about so

532
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:47,160
um I don't know exactly where she picks

533
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,798
up this lead right but she basically

534
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:52,200
finds online that there are a couple of

535
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:56,400
stores advertising this

536
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:59,220
very generic looking watch

537
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,919
um it's kind of just imagine like

538
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,720
a vaguely modern minimalist looking

539
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,059
watch that like

540
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:09,179
you know it's not very offensive but is

541
00:20:06,058 --> 00:20:11,160
is also not super distinctive

542
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:13,740
um and she starts looking around and she

543
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:17,160
starts finding the exact same watch

544
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:19,740
being sold by all these different uh

545
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:23,460
e-commerce stores online

546
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:26,579
the way it's being sold uh is is one of

547
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:29,160
two ways one they say for a limited time

548
00:20:26,579 --> 00:20:30,899
only you get this watch for free you

549
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,419
just need to pay for shipping

550
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:35,460
okay that's one side of it the other

551
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:37,020
side of it is they just say okay it was

552
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,120
fifty dollars it's marked down to ten

553
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:41,879
dollars right kind of pretty classic

554
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:43,979
schemes yeah and if you go on onto these

555
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,440
shops you know it'll have these fake

556
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:48,480
tickers that are like oh look like

557
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,919
people are buying it like live right now

558
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,480
yeah you can see like the numbers

559
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,280
dropping yeah and it's like you better

560
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,120
you better get in right you better get

561
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:56,639
in

562
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:58,439
and so she starts looking around a bit

563
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,700
more she starts examining the shop

564
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,279
itself

565
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:04,620
and she notices a couple of things one

566
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:06,000
when she looks at the photographs of the

567
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:08,219
shop and all that

568
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,679
she does some reverse image searches and

569
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:13,740
she finds that The Branding for the

570
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:16,080
store itself is all fake like the

571
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:17,640
photographs like for example this store

572
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:19,740
is meant to be based in like a hip

573
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,538
height of San Francisco yeah and they're

574
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:24,000
photographs of like an actual physical

575
00:21:21,538 --> 00:21:25,619
shop sure she does a reverse image

576
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,940
search and like that shop that

577
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:29,819
photograph actually belongs to some

578
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:31,620
other shop of course no relation right

579
00:21:29,819 --> 00:21:35,418
yeah and she looks into like the address

580
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:35,418
and it's not a real not a real address

581
00:21:35,579 --> 00:21:39,240
um she looked into the writing that they

582
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,740
have on the about page and it's been

583
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,480
ripped from like

584
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:45,659
I don't know like the San Francisco like

585
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,220
city council website I don't know sure

586
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:50,340
um so all the branding information

587
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:52,500
around the store itself is all fake so

588
00:21:50,339 --> 00:21:54,359
that's one level well the photographs

589
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,940
are fake

590
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:59,819
okay she goes deeper

591
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:03,480
she starts trying to find out how many

592
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:05,639
stores actually sell the same generic

593
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,860
looking watch and she finds a whole

594
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:12,720
bunch of them they're apparently in all

595
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:14,699
these hip cities Madrid London Paris

596
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,679
and they're all selling the same thing

597
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:19,259
they call them different names and the

598
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:20,880
branding's changed but they're the same

599
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:23,640
watch okay

600
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,559
so then she goes even deeper she tries

601
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,480
to find out where the watches even come

602
00:22:25,558 --> 00:22:30,379
from right and quite quickly she gets to

603
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:33,419
like Alibaba and these like Chinese

604
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:36,539
wholesalers slash manufacturers

605
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:39,538
now the crazy part here is that she can

606
00:22:36,538 --> 00:22:41,700
never find who actually has been

607
00:22:39,538 --> 00:22:44,339
manufacturing these

608
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:47,159
she finds a network of quote-unquote

609
00:22:44,339 --> 00:22:50,038
suppliers that I they are listed as like

610
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:54,299
manufacturers slash wholesalers

611
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:57,240
and so it's just this crazy

612
00:22:54,298 --> 00:23:00,179
Human Centipede of like Drop Shipping

613
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,558
yeah no yeah for those of you

614
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:03,840
for those of you who don't know right

615
00:23:01,558 --> 00:23:06,000
Drop Shipping is when the shop never

616
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:09,058
actually touches or handles any of the

617
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,859
goods they can order from a customer and

618
00:23:09,058 --> 00:23:14,038
they simply send their order to the

619
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:16,139
warehouse the Fulfillment Place yeah

620
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:18,658
yeah whether that place is what where

621
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:20,700
they actually make it uh or where they

622
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:22,620
actually fulfill it that you may may be

623
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:25,259
another intermediary

624
00:23:22,619 --> 00:23:27,599
yeah yeah yeah and so there's basically

625
00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:29,339
this you can already see the possibility

626
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:31,678
of there being like a whole chain of

627
00:23:29,339 --> 00:23:33,720
drop shippers

628
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,000
you know like this person's Drop

629
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,740
Shipping but the per that who they're

630
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,119
buying it from is also Drop Shipping and

631
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:43,019
who they're buying from is also Drop

632
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:46,798
Shipping and so it's just this like

633
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:49,679
endless uh

634
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:51,779
endless chain of like

635
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,000
fake Goods

636
00:23:51,779 --> 00:23:56,460
and no accountability and no actual

637
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,440
origin yeah

638
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,880
um and I don't know I think that like

639
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,100
the analogies between something like

640
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:05,039
that and cannabis

641
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:06,418
I think there's a lot of crossover

642
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:09,058
tons

643
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:10,679
um you know the other day A bunch of us

644
00:24:09,058 --> 00:24:14,879
watched a a documentary called

645
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:16,919
telemarketers and it was on HBO uh this

646
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,840
guy Patrick J pesvis and his friends did

647
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:20,820
a it started off that they were just

648
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:22,619
like junkies or one was a junkie and one

649
00:24:20,819 --> 00:24:23,879
was like a young kid at a telemarketing

650
00:24:22,619 --> 00:24:25,918
job and they were just filming how Wild

651
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:28,440
it was at their job where they were

652
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,059
getting paid to pretend to be policemen

653
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,620
calling for the policeman's balls to

654
00:24:30,058 --> 00:24:32,819
seeing if you would donate to officers

655
00:24:31,619 --> 00:24:36,658
such and such

656
00:24:32,819 --> 00:24:38,939
and it was a similar idea to me and I

657
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:41,159
saw it very so many parallels to our

658
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:45,240
cannabis Community because

659
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:46,919
between that phone and and that at the

660
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,759
actual like Dude using heroin on the

661
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:49,440
other line

662
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:51,119
the perception to the person on the

663
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,120
other end of the line is that this is

664
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:56,699
you know officer Joe mcdonagall you know

665
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:59,339
what I mean like it's perception is

666
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:00,779
everything absolutely everything and

667
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:02,819
when there's a barrier there there is

668
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:04,379
some level of faith that has to go into

669
00:25:02,819 --> 00:25:06,359
this

670
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:07,020
yeah and I've always felt like if you

671
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:09,479
can

672
00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:12,538
mitigate Faith the more you can mitigate

673
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:14,220
faith and and get to actual hard data

674
00:25:12,538 --> 00:25:16,740
the better off you are

675
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:19,259
okay I'm glad you said that okay because

676
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:20,460
just just drawing on that watch analogy

677
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:22,379
for a bit more

678
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:25,860
sure one of the other observations she

679
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:27,539
made was how it was being validated

680
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:30,599
online

681
00:25:27,538 --> 00:25:32,400
and so these these quote-unquote shops

682
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:35,038
they would have Instagram accounts with

683
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,019
a whole bunch of followers okay their

684
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:39,240
followers were what she called quote

685
00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:41,759
unquote aspirational influences people

686
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:44,220
who might didn't have like they maybe

687
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:46,259
had like around a thousand followers

688
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:48,900
each so they're not big yet but they

689
00:25:46,259 --> 00:25:50,158
have they do have some visibility

690
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,900
and

691
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,640
what happens is that there's a kind of

692
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:55,919
mutualism a kind of symbiosis that

693
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:59,520
happens between this fake shop and these

694
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:01,620
quanticore influences where

695
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:05,400
the fake shop gives these influencers

696
00:26:01,619 --> 00:26:08,219
more exposure and the influences also

697
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:10,919
give the fake shot exposure

698
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:12,058
and they validate each other yep the

699
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:14,880
cosine

700
00:26:12,058 --> 00:26:16,798
yeah and going back to what you're

701
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,240
saying about perception well it's partly

702
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:20,339
a product of the internet right now

703
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,380
anyone can have

704
00:26:20,339 --> 00:26:23,879
you can basically magic a brand out of

705
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,320
nothing because you no longer need

706
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:28,860
premises

707
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:31,859
you no longer need like all these like

708
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:34,558
traditional infrastructure you know

709
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:36,058
um for business

710
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:37,379
um and so you can play all these games

711
00:26:36,058 --> 00:26:40,079
online because now you're just playing

712
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:44,100
almost like a pure information game

713
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:46,678
yes you can use to manipulate the

714
00:26:44,099 --> 00:26:49,139
information space

715
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:51,600
that's information Warfare psyops yeah

716
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:53,940
it's in in at every step of the way it

717
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:56,099
is I mean realistically yeah it sounds

718
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,840
extreme but it really is I mean it's a

719
00:26:56,099 --> 00:27:00,538
confidence game

720
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:02,339
um when I talk about co-signing a lot uh

721
00:27:00,538 --> 00:27:04,440
I talk a lot of people ask me why I

722
00:27:02,339 --> 00:27:07,199
don't have certain breeders interviewed

723
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,400
on this show and I try to you know every

724
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,980
once in a while I'll answer them and

725
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:13,200
explain it to him but realistically when

726
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:15,538
I have when I bring people on the show I

727
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:19,140
try to account for not just who they are

728
00:27:15,538 --> 00:27:23,099
right now and what they're presenting to

729
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:25,080
me right now I also am I'm trying to

730
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:26,819
predict whether these people are always

731
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:28,678
going to continue to operate in this

732
00:27:26,819 --> 00:27:30,599
manner and be good people because you

733
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:33,179
know how complicated life can get and

734
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:34,259
and you know someone suddenly loses

735
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:36,538
everything

736
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:39,058
they sometimes you can be moral fluid

737
00:27:36,538 --> 00:27:41,460
and and the things they wouldn't do

738
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:42,960
before for money now become a viable

739
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:46,200
option we've just watched our whole

740
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,900
cannabis Market tanked so what I've

741
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:51,120
choose what breeders to bring on it's

742
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:53,100
normally people that I am

743
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:55,500
I'm very

744
00:27:53,099 --> 00:27:59,219
very long acquainted with and that I'm

745
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:02,278
willing to in a sense cosine

746
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:04,079
a bit because I'm willing to say like if

747
00:28:02,278 --> 00:28:05,579
I bring them on and have a serious heart

748
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:07,740
to Art conversation with them people

749
00:28:05,579 --> 00:28:09,658
will have the perception that not only

750
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:12,120
we are friends but that I believe

751
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:13,919
everything they're saying and because I

752
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:15,778
know that perception is there I do not

753
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,419
want to bring on people that I don't

754
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:20,640
necessarily believe or trust and then

755
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:22,320
leave it up to the people watching to

756
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,000
figure that out because you know we're

757
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:26,278
just presenting something

758
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,778
I can't live with that and and when

759
00:28:26,278 --> 00:28:29,579
people ask me about certain breeders

760
00:28:27,778 --> 00:28:31,200
it's not even necessarily that I think

761
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:33,658
they're bad breeders and haven't had

762
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:37,019
them on it's just because I don't know

763
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:39,240
them well enough to put my own

764
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:41,038
my own cosine on the line if that makes

765
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,419
sense but it's not necessarily speaking

766
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:44,759
out against people if they're not on

767
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:46,080
it's just that safety measure and that

768
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:47,460
safety measure is there because of

769
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:49,500
perception

770
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,460
yeah yeah I think that's a really good

771
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,419
point

772
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:54,179
um

773
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:56,759
and you know just to I think just to

774
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:58,679
really really draw the point home right

775
00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:02,480
a fake watch

776
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:05,759
is actually easier to verify than say

777
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:09,240
seeds right oh yeah you get the fake

778
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:10,798
watch you look at it it's in your hand

779
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,200
does it work

780
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:15,359
what's its quality like you can see like

781
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,460
it you can just do it is it yeah does it

782
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:19,439
look like it's supposed to so at least

783
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:21,480
if you bought a fake watch you know

784
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:25,080
whether or not your pinks can't

785
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:26,819
okay but I did want to say right the

786
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:29,099
point being the major point being

787
00:29:26,819 --> 00:29:32,158
cannabis specifically

788
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:34,079
is even more ripe for exploitation right

789
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,600
and you were talking about flower before

790
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:38,278
Matt yeah imagine you're buying seeds

791
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:40,379
right and I I you and I talked about

792
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:41,640
this a bit before the recording but I

793
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:44,640
think this is the point I was trying to

794
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:47,220
make the seeds themselves are a promise

795
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,740
of plants

796
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:51,419
okay they

797
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:54,538
you know we've talked about genetic

798
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:57,480
variability before odds probability or

799
00:29:54,538 --> 00:30:01,500
that you that comes into play right the

800
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:04,740
plants are a promise of flour

801
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:06,298
and the end result of all of that is

802
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:10,859
processed flowers so you have yet

803
00:30:06,298 --> 00:30:12,778
another stage so basically from from the

804
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:16,199
beginning point of seeds to the end

805
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:19,079
point of uh consumable flour you

806
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,940
actually have multiple leaps to make

807
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:24,480
and it's a long time

808
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:26,340
and it's time and so what you get in a

809
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:30,480
chain of leaps like that or chain of

810
00:30:26,339 --> 00:30:32,699
promises like that is deniability yeah

811
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,919
you know you have both you can both play

812
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:37,558
in this realm of plausibility and

813
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:39,120
deniability you if someone wasn't happy

814
00:30:37,558 --> 00:30:41,579
with what you

815
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:42,959
uh what they got you could say oh but it

816
00:30:41,579 --> 00:30:45,119
could have been you could have just

817
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:48,298
messed up at any of these points and

818
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:50,099
that's the way to deny like your

819
00:30:48,298 --> 00:30:52,440
responsibility as the breeder or segment

820
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:54,719
yep right absolutely but even if you're

821
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:57,240
even if you're a legitimate breeder or

822
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,798
seed maker like this this sucks for you

823
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:01,440
as well because if someone comes to you

824
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:03,480
and says hey I didn't get what I thought

825
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,940
I was gonna get you have to now

826
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,500
troubleshoot and try to figure out at

827
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:09,058
which stage something could have gone

828
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:12,720
wrong

829
00:31:09,058 --> 00:31:15,240
absolutely and that I met I imagine it

830
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,500
must be so crazy to have some of these

831
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,298
troubleshooting conversations with

832
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:20,940
people as someone who actually does care

833
00:31:18,298 --> 00:31:23,099
and is trying to make sure that like

834
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:25,200
people are getting what you promise

835
00:31:23,099 --> 00:31:27,058
it you know what honestly for me it's

836
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,419
been very um

837
00:31:27,058 --> 00:31:32,639
I'm I'm constantly the bearer bad news

838
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:34,200
and I've kind of just come to live with

839
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,240
that you know like whether it's new

840
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,819
people in our Discord

841
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,740
um asking questions about some like

842
00:31:38,819 --> 00:31:42,178
Barney's Farm or whoever you know like

843
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,919
I'm just gonna

844
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:46,019
have to open some doors that they

845
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:48,419
haven't heard yet you know and when it

846
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:49,798
comes to stuff like that because like

847
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:52,320
you know there are a few of us who

848
00:31:49,798 --> 00:31:54,179
actually like test our lines know what

849
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:56,579
we're working with and run them out I

850
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:59,159
don't run into a whole lot of people

851
00:31:56,579 --> 00:32:01,079
having issues with what I'm telling them

852
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:03,840
the line's going to be like not being

853
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:05,759
like in the end even if it's badly grown

854
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:07,079
usually there's some representation

855
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:08,220
there to where people are like okay I

856
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:10,259
[ __ ]

857
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:13,558
but the problem comes if you're using

858
00:32:10,259 --> 00:32:15,898
seed banks because now you've got a a

859
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:18,658
middleman in between now let's say they

860
00:32:15,898 --> 00:32:20,099
get seeds and these seeds didn't pop

861
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:21,419
well

862
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:22,798
if you're selling them direct and you

863
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:24,120
know the siege is still popping for

864
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:25,319
other customers you have them there with

865
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:27,298
you and you can pop them there yet

866
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:29,339
they're not having them pop there you

867
00:32:27,298 --> 00:32:31,679
have to then think okay how are they

868
00:32:29,339 --> 00:32:33,720
storing them at the seed bank was there

869
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,340
any problem with them getting cooked on

870
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,679
the way in the mail between point A to

871
00:32:35,339 --> 00:32:40,199
point B or point B to point c

872
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,580
um how did they pop them what methods

873
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,620
are they using did they wash their

874
00:32:41,579 --> 00:32:46,199
[ __ ] hands like any number of things

875
00:32:43,619 --> 00:32:48,719
so yeah that's that's usually where uh

876
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,038
trickiness comes into play is uh seed

877
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,460
banks for me

878
00:32:50,038 --> 00:32:55,319
yeah yeah and okay now that that's a

879
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:57,240
really good insight as well because I

880
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:59,639
did want to hear a bit about you yeah

881
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:01,740
that makes sense yeah but okay if even

882
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:04,380
if we move to flower right flower as a

883
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:06,179
product instead of seeds so there we can

884
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:08,460
say okay the Chain's been shortened you

885
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:09,960
it's not like the person has to grow it

886
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:12,480
out and see what happens it's like the

887
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:15,840
flower is the flower

888
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:19,140
um but even then right how we judge

889
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:22,139
flower it's extremely subjective

890
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:26,278
so you pointed out before that how you

891
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:28,038
judge smell how you judge a fix it's not

892
00:33:26,278 --> 00:33:32,159
like those are

893
00:33:28,038 --> 00:33:34,798
firm Universal objective things correct

894
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,600
so even with flower you still run into

895
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:39,960
all of this

896
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:41,398
subjective uncertainty and uh you know

897
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,899
you come up against the limits of your

898
00:33:41,398 --> 00:33:44,699
judgment you come up against the limits

899
00:33:42,898 --> 00:33:45,479
of what you can communicate to each

900
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:48,960
other

901
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:50,519
yeah and and it also again it depends on

902
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,558
education too

903
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:53,640
um another one of the review things that

904
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:56,278
I've been doing is something we're

905
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:57,480
starting to call Legit or not and it's I

906
00:33:56,278 --> 00:33:58,259
just have no better name for it sorry

907
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,899
guys

908
00:33:58,259 --> 00:34:02,640
um but it it was from my point of view

909
00:34:00,898 --> 00:34:04,199
as I started looking into some of the

910
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,059
new hype Market you know looking into

911
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,860
these new names and trying these strains

912
00:34:06,058 --> 00:34:10,559
out seeing if they are anything like

913
00:34:07,859 --> 00:34:11,699
they're claiming to be or their lineages

914
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:13,559
Etc

915
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:15,598
um I've also been kind of interested in

916
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:17,159
seeing if any of the old clones that we

917
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,200
have kept all these years and that I

918
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:21,059
know flower up real well if I can go

919
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,079
into the modern Collective dispensary

920
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,759
Market

921
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,858
see that on a menu pick it out and

922
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,200
reliably get it like what's the

923
00:34:25,858 --> 00:34:29,759
percentage you know in what city like

924
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:33,480
all these are data points to me and I'm

925
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:36,060
fascinated by it uh one of those recent

926
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:38,519
ones I did was something called Louis

927
00:34:36,059 --> 00:34:39,119
the 13th OG Kush

928
00:34:38,519 --> 00:34:40,980
um

929
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:44,519
and I did a review on it and you can see

930
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:46,619
that on our Channel and it was you know

931
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:49,320
I did the review on it was at least it

932
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:51,179
was a very it was an OG Kush the the

933
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:54,000
grow was decent of it the handling of it

934
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:55,619
was absolutely horrible if I was an

935
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,780
owner of a company I would never put

936
00:34:55,619 --> 00:35:01,380
weed that looked like that in bags and

937
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:03,960
sell it like no way in hell but

938
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:05,820
because it was better than the other OG

939
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:08,760
cushions I had bought which it was a

940
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:10,260
terrible margin of of it was bad it's

941
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,220
Bleak out there

942
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:13,680
um

943
00:35:11,219 --> 00:35:15,598
I got a second one and I got it for a

944
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:17,338
few reasons one my chick really likes OG

945
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,780
Kush and that was the closest one there

946
00:35:17,338 --> 00:35:20,219
was and she's like I want that one that

947
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:22,440
one's helping me right now so I was like

948
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:23,759
it's ugly but all right whatever so we

949
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:26,220
got it

950
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,960
and I quickly to illustrate real quick

951
00:35:26,219 --> 00:35:30,779
I'm gonna pop these up on the screen so

952
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,699
that there is some kind of um

953
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:34,800
so you guys can have some kind of idea

954
00:35:32,699 --> 00:35:36,480
of what I'm talking about here where is

955
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,880
so here

956
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,039
uh can you see it is it showing up yep

957
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,300
okay good yep we're good so here we have

958
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:42,960
the first batch

959
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,480
um

960
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,639
it's not particularly wonderful looking

961
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:49,800
as you can tell it's

962
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:53,578
it's dark green it's been handled the

963
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:56,339
oils are smashed it's not I mean come on

964
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:58,320
you don't put this in a package but it

965
00:35:56,338 --> 00:36:00,179
was actually decent to smoke oddly

966
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,980
enough because uh you know looks aren't

967
00:36:00,179 --> 00:36:04,559
necessarily everything here's the second

968
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:06,358
batch that I got now as you can tell

969
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:07,739
this is not the same but this is not

970
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:10,259
even the same structure this looks like

971
00:36:07,739 --> 00:36:12,239
a gg4 hybrid to me I would say and from

972
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:14,160
the smell of it it was kind of berry

973
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:16,979
Gorilla Glue

974
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:18,838
so at this point

975
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:21,240
my lady

976
00:36:18,838 --> 00:36:22,679
I run into the the problem that I that I

977
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:25,500
was initially trying to figure out for

978
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:26,940
people my lady liked the other Louis

979
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,800
because it helped her headache at the

980
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:33,179
time and

981
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,920
I got a second bag one week not even a

982
00:36:33,179 --> 00:36:39,539
week I think it was three days from the

983
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:41,099
last one and same name same batch this

984
00:36:39,539 --> 00:36:44,039
is what shows up

985
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:46,079
and it's nothing like the first one from

986
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:48,900
the same batch same bag same company

987
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:50,820
same delivery service everything

988
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,838
so at this point I'm like okay now I

989
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:54,359
want to see how they're going to handle

990
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:55,559
this because I wonder how often this

991
00:36:54,358 --> 00:36:57,358
comes up that someone's like hey you

992
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:59,519
didn't give me the you didn't give me

993
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:01,380
real Louis the 13th OG

994
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:03,059
I doubt that ever happens like where

995
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,680
people like can identify a strainer like

996
00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:07,259
this isn't it you know like does that

997
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:09,118
happen I don't think so yeah it's always

998
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:10,740
hit a mouse about that too

999
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,660
I hit him up as just you know just any

1000
00:37:10,739 --> 00:37:14,039
random dude and I hit up the the

1001
00:37:12,659 --> 00:37:15,659
delivery service and actually they were

1002
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:17,159
fast to respond

1003
00:37:15,659 --> 00:37:18,779
um and they were like okay well I need

1004
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:19,739
to contact the owner of this company and

1005
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:22,200
I'll let him know that there was an

1006
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:23,219
issue so the owner of that company and

1007
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:24,899
uh

1008
00:37:23,219 --> 00:37:26,759
you know I'll leave them nameless for

1009
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:29,160
now but you can see it in the review uh

1010
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:31,140
wrote me back and he said hi this is

1011
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:33,838
blank from

1012
00:37:31,139 --> 00:37:35,400
our friends at blank told us that you

1013
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:37,019
were unhappy with a flower purchase and

1014
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,820
I'm so sorry to hear that

1015
00:37:37,019 --> 00:37:40,440
I have told them that we will totally

1016
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:42,480
have them switch out the King Louie

1017
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:45,358
flower bag and you can pick any of the

1018
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,280
other flavors we did a different cut of

1019
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:50,279
King Louis OG this time around because

1020
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:52,140
we always package fresh to order we have

1021
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:54,300
about five different in-house Growers

1022
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:57,059
that we rotate flavors with based on

1023
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:59,400
harvests where is it so we can keep the

1024
00:37:57,059 --> 00:38:01,940
same flavors in rotation and guarantee

1025
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:05,220
freshness

1026
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:06,599
uh it's definitely an OG but not the

1027
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:08,519
same cut as before

1028
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:10,200
sorry for the inconvenience we always

1029
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:12,000
aim to please our patients and would

1030
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:13,739
never want you to walk away unsatisfied

1031
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,199
hope you have a great rest of your day

1032
00:38:13,739 --> 00:38:18,659
and and they have been notified with the

1033
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:19,319
deliveries to switch it out for you so I

1034
00:38:18,659 --> 00:38:21,598
said

1035
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:23,700
makes sense then I appreciate the

1036
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,440
response on why medicine can't be relied

1037
00:38:23,699 --> 00:38:27,960
on to be consistent

1038
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,280
I was wondering why that would be so

1039
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,920
vastly different

1040
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,720
as a seed maker that's an aspect I look

1041
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,880
at I forget from the commercial

1042
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:39,299
cultivation side how that goes multiple

1043
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:40,380
Growers pushing to one spot Etc and the

1044
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:43,019
reason I said this is because I wanted

1045
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:45,240
him to admit yeah I'm just a [ __ ]

1046
00:38:43,019 --> 00:38:47,639
marketing guy I'm pushing other people

1047
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:49,379
that are actually Growers flower I don't

1048
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:51,239
know what the hell I'm talking about but

1049
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:54,059
he doubled down

1050
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:57,539
he said as you know

1051
00:38:54,059 --> 00:39:00,299
with breeding different phenotypes come

1052
00:38:57,539 --> 00:39:01,920
out expressed differently we try to be

1053
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:04,320
as consistent as possible but there

1054
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,900
being so many phenotypes of classic

1055
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,400
strains some Growers prefer to stick

1056
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:10,139
with certain phinos that respond better

1057
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,480
to their formula or their growing Style

1058
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:14,460
thank you for being understanding and

1059
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,260
sorry about the confusion we would never

1060
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:18,480
want patients to think that we are doing

1061
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:20,160
a bait and switch

1062
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,159
that was that

1063
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:24,838
I guess I I did thank him and say no I'm

1064
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:26,940
not interested in a replacement that's

1065
00:39:24,838 --> 00:39:28,019
not why I did this and I never got the

1066
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:29,280
replacement because I just wasn't

1067
00:39:28,019 --> 00:39:31,079
interested and see if you'd actually

1068
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:33,119
follow through with that but I was

1069
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:36,180
interested in his response since Louie

1070
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:38,099
OG is a cut a clone only not a seed line

1071
00:39:36,179 --> 00:39:39,659
there are not multiple phenotypes of it

1072
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:41,579
it can't express differently but it

1073
00:39:39,659 --> 00:39:43,319
would not turn from OG cushion to Barry

1074
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:44,880
and Gorilla Glue

1075
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:46,320
just wouldn't happen that's just yeah to

1076
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,760
me that's just some very slippery

1077
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,500
rhetoric

1078
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,280
um it is and it's similar to what I'm

1079
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,838
saying

1080
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,940
it was similar to what I was saying to

1081
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:57,420
you about like uh

1082
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:59,820
if you're like a scammy seed dealer seed

1083
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:01,619
maker you can just pretend that like oh

1084
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:03,119
it's because you missed up and at this

1085
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:05,039
point of the process or this or that

1086
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:08,579
this one is kind of like

1087
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:11,119
I guess praying Chinese he tried to use

1088
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:13,800
breeders speak on me he's like well yeah

1089
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:16,380
you know type in variation

1090
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,880
yeah but also like praying on like

1091
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:20,579
ignorance no your ignorance because yeah

1092
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:22,500
it doesn't make sense like to say you

1093
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:24,539
can't just say it's a clone but also

1094
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:27,900
it's not a clone it's actually

1095
00:40:24,539 --> 00:40:30,179
yeah a bunch of different uh

1096
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:32,579
yeah none of it made any [ __ ] sense

1097
00:40:30,179 --> 00:40:33,838
so like how can he say he did not bait

1098
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:35,640
and switch knowing that that's not Louis

1099
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:37,139
the 13th OG

1100
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:40,920
it's like literally that's what he said

1101
00:40:37,139 --> 00:40:44,098
specifically it's a different cut of OG

1102
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:46,800
so why would you put it in a bag when

1103
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:48,420
the end goal on your packaging says that

1104
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:52,320
this is Medical

1105
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:54,659
and that to me is like the the one

1106
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,640
factor that kills me because the only

1107
00:40:54,659 --> 00:40:58,440
reason that we have ever been able in

1108
00:40:56,639 --> 00:41:01,139
California to be able to grow this plant

1109
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:03,900
with any kind of like safety or

1110
00:41:01,139 --> 00:41:05,460
Safeguard or any safeness in our hearts

1111
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:08,160
is because of the medical community

1112
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:10,619
terminally ill patients cancer patients

1113
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:12,239
people like that pushing super hard to

1114
00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:14,579
make this available and it was all done

1115
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:16,319
off their backs and at this point they

1116
00:41:14,579 --> 00:41:19,220
can't even go and get reliable medicine

1117
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:22,619
from these places at a reasonable price

1118
00:41:19,219 --> 00:41:24,019
that's done you know so to me it's just

1119
00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:27,660
like a

1120
00:41:24,019 --> 00:41:29,639
so many things have gone so wrong but

1121
00:41:27,659 --> 00:41:31,858
it's being carried as being done right

1122
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:33,659
everywhere and people don't even know

1123
00:41:31,858 --> 00:41:34,920
that there are issues going on they

1124
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:36,480
don't even know that there are questions

1125
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,920
to ask they don't know about these

1126
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,199
variables there's a lot of assumptions

1127
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:43,500
along the way and if there's anything

1128
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:45,659
that I if I can twist anything in my

1129
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:47,039
whole career it would be to flip that on

1130
00:41:45,659 --> 00:41:49,920
its head and make people see it for what

1131
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:52,559
it is now that we the the guy himself

1132
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,838
has given us an insight into what his

1133
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:57,000
game is actually like

1134
00:41:54,838 --> 00:41:58,619
um I wanted to bring it back to seeds

1135
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,300
for a moment again yeah even though

1136
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:02,460
we've talked about this many times but

1137
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:04,920
the obvious analogy I was drawing with

1138
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:08,099
the watch the whole watch thing right is

1139
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:11,460
that in some situations these seeds are

1140
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:13,619
being wholesaled white labeled by some

1141
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:15,358
nameless Source somewhere

1142
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:18,059
people are

1143
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:20,699
getting a hold of these seeds rebranding

1144
00:42:18,059 --> 00:42:22,679
them repackaging them

1145
00:42:20,699 --> 00:42:25,439
remarketing them or sorry not

1146
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:29,039
remarketing but marketing them

1147
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:31,019
um and remarketing in many cases

1148
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:33,239
remarketing absolutely there's a lot of

1149
00:42:31,019 --> 00:42:35,519
times when they're buying the bulk seeds

1150
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:37,739
from a bulk seller they're not buying

1151
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:41,519
the strain that they're selling they're

1152
00:42:37,739 --> 00:42:43,019
buying something that maybe maybe

1153
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:44,820
pulls the strain they're selling and

1154
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:47,940
sometimes in many cases in many

1155
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:50,400
companies maybe not I mean you know like

1156
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:54,119
maybe not have you ever seen Acapulco

1157
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:57,358
Gold flower you know 10 weeks look like

1158
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:59,400
that all dense no 60 70 days close

1159
00:42:57,358 --> 00:43:02,159
enough I mean

1160
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:04,139
just one of many examples you know like

1161
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:05,879
things that people can easily point to

1162
00:43:04,139 --> 00:43:07,199
and be like okay purple punch we know

1163
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,880
what purple punch looks like it has a

1164
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:12,118
very specific look and a resin profile

1165
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,880
yeah that's not it

1166
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:16,858
that's not it and like

1167
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,420
it's just not and like but they still

1168
00:43:16,858 --> 00:43:20,818
list here genetics Granddaddy Purple

1169
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:24,358
Larry OG so they're giving the genetics

1170
00:43:20,818 --> 00:43:26,579
um from from uh uh uh

1171
00:43:24,358 --> 00:43:29,400
oh it'll come back to me

1172
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:30,839
the the actual reader can we spend a bit

1173
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,059
of time here can you go and look at like

1174
00:43:30,838 --> 00:43:35,400
him come down yeah oh yeah let's do that

1175
00:43:33,059 --> 00:43:36,599
I think I the more I thought about it

1176
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,858
when we when you mentioned I was like

1177
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:40,318
dude we need to pull this up because

1178
00:43:37,858 --> 00:43:42,299
because they are funny dude the biggest

1179
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:44,159
offenders in my opinion of this let's

1180
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:46,440
see where's their chem dog do they not

1181
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:48,299
have it do they have a search

1182
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:51,420
let's see yeah they let's see let's just

1183
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:52,920
do the the search for the addish mood

1184
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,900
let's see what their search shows for

1185
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:56,639
Kim dog or is it

1186
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:59,519
a search

1187
00:43:56,639 --> 00:44:04,019
can't I should dawg that's probably the

1188
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:05,699
best bet probably oh wow I'm none no

1189
00:44:04,019 --> 00:44:08,460
just just go chem and see what happens

1190
00:44:05,699 --> 00:44:10,379
yeah that's a good idea yeah

1191
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:12,780
all right what do we have we have Cam

1192
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:14,099
dog from blimbern oh my God look at this

1193
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:16,880
thing

1194
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:23,099
narrow leafed

1195
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:24,358
nice and genetics clone of chem 91. what

1196
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:27,300
look at this

1197
00:44:24,358 --> 00:44:30,119
look this is

1198
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:32,099
yeah blim burn seeds so there's one chem

1199
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:34,980
dog you have a a shout out here's

1200
00:44:32,099 --> 00:44:37,019
Bloomberg's Ken four which you couldn't

1201
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:39,659
tell anything from this this is way too

1202
00:44:37,019 --> 00:44:42,619
early but yeah no definitely not

1203
00:44:39,659 --> 00:44:42,618
chem forward

1204
00:44:44,338 --> 00:44:50,219
Oh my Jesus Christ can we go to bindings

1205
00:44:48,358 --> 00:44:51,539
actually I know you I know this money is

1206
00:44:50,219 --> 00:44:53,879
on here but can you go to the actual

1207
00:44:51,539 --> 00:44:56,099
Barney's website

1208
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:58,680
oh yeah see

1209
00:44:56,099 --> 00:45:01,380
is it still showing the search page

1210
00:44:58,679 --> 00:45:02,818
uh is it on that same page it's on the

1211
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:04,079
same page you were on before yeah okay

1212
00:45:02,818 --> 00:45:07,279
yeah hold on a second I might have to

1213
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:07,280
switch things real quick

1214
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:11,940
um

1215
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:14,900
stop screen present share screen and

1216
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:14,900
where's Barney's

1217
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:24,420
you know there it is sure here we go

1218
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:26,219
there we go good old Barney

1219
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:29,159
all right let's go chem again let's go

1220
00:45:26,219 --> 00:45:31,019
let's just do a little chem survey here

1221
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:34,199
I don't know anything this is gonna be

1222
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:37,139
real fun that's all okay Kim try that

1223
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:39,960
again Kim oh there's no Kim here on

1224
00:45:37,139 --> 00:45:43,279
Barney's Farm it's uh Kim the closest

1225
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:43,280
you're gonna get is like GMO

1226
00:45:44,179 --> 00:45:49,019
that picture actually looks like GMO

1227
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:52,019
which is funny so I think that they're

1228
00:45:49,019 --> 00:45:53,000
probably like using a GMO hybrid for the

1229
00:45:52,019 --> 00:45:55,259
picture

1230
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,358
what's another really recognizable one

1231
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:59,040
what about the OG or something oh yeah

1232
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:00,838
OG Kush is super rich see if Barney's

1233
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:03,059
Farm ever got themselves a real live OG

1234
00:46:00,838 --> 00:46:04,799
Kush

1235
00:46:03,059 --> 00:46:07,318
at least in pictures we can see let's

1236
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,660
see Bubba Kush see all results bub is

1237
00:46:07,318 --> 00:46:11,759
another easy one let's see OG Kush Auto

1238
00:46:09,659 --> 00:46:13,618
it actually looks like an OG Kush plant

1239
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,500
in the picture too but it it looks like

1240
00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:17,818
a boofy ass OG Kush but yeah

1241
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:19,019
you can see the shape that football

1242
00:46:17,818 --> 00:46:20,039
shape

1243
00:46:19,019 --> 00:46:21,960
yeah

1244
00:46:20,039 --> 00:46:23,639
you also see that in day record too that

1245
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:25,380
similar shape of the bud

1246
00:46:23,639 --> 00:46:27,118
very very heavy and prominent in day

1247
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:29,539
record except day wrecker has a more

1248
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:32,760
chem 91 uh

1249
00:46:29,539 --> 00:46:34,679
Bud type and like has that leaf

1250
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:36,780
cannibalism stuff yeah whenever I talk

1251
00:46:34,679 --> 00:46:38,639
about football shapes on OG that's what

1252
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:40,740
I mean that

1253
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:43,019
so I just wanted to interject and say

1254
00:46:40,739 --> 00:46:45,419
that like in cannabis it's not quite as

1255
00:46:43,019 --> 00:46:48,358
extreme yet I believe as the watch story

1256
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:50,579
that I told like as far as I know no

1257
00:46:48,358 --> 00:46:52,019
one's doing Drop Shipping

1258
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:54,660
yet

1259
00:46:52,019 --> 00:46:56,880
but it's probably not far away the way

1260
00:46:54,659 --> 00:46:59,940
things oh it it's very it's gonna happen

1261
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:02,160
soon so the main thing that was going on

1262
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:03,480
for a long time was in the 2000s a

1263
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:06,179
company

1264
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:07,400
in Spain started and they were supplying

1265
00:47:06,179 --> 00:47:09,659
Barney's Farm

1266
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:12,838
greenhouse seeds

1267
00:47:09,659 --> 00:47:14,159
Scentsy Nirvana and several others all

1268
00:47:12,838 --> 00:47:16,259
the main ones that they were they were

1269
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:18,358
supplying it was one company with a list

1270
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:20,400
of like very femini seeds that they

1271
00:47:18,358 --> 00:47:22,858
could choose from uh

1272
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,420
they're and obviously when this started

1273
00:47:22,858 --> 00:47:26,338
to make them millions of dollars really

1274
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:28,619
fast other companies popped up that were

1275
00:47:26,338 --> 00:47:32,460
bigger and came and that's when

1276
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:35,579
popped up and almost anything you buy

1277
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:37,019
from Barney's Farm any of these guys has

1278
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:40,560
come from

1279
00:47:37,019 --> 00:47:41,880
the past 15 years all of it was supplied

1280
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:44,940
by them

1281
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:46,380
um so yeah it who knows what you get me

1282
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:48,240
in they don't really care but that was

1283
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:50,760
that was as close to drop shipping as it

1284
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:51,539
got but at some point they got lit up

1285
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,520
um

1286
00:47:51,539 --> 00:47:54,900
and what was funny was not fun if none

1287
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:57,420
of it's funny when people get lit up

1288
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:58,858
like that but the odd part about it was

1289
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:01,318
when

1290
00:47:58,858 --> 00:48:03,358
got hit by the span Spanish authorities

1291
00:48:01,318 --> 00:48:05,159
their site went down they're not cycling

1292
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:07,139
down they put a warning up on their side

1293
00:48:05,159 --> 00:48:08,460
about it saying like uh you know this

1294
00:48:07,139 --> 00:48:11,219
has been

1295
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:13,019
taken offline The Identical message was

1296
00:48:11,219 --> 00:48:14,459
up on

1297
00:48:13,019 --> 00:48:15,659
this website because they're the same

1298
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:17,760
company

1299
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:19,799
and a lot of people don't know that and

1300
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,960
it's a Spanish company you know there's

1301
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:24,780
there are good decent people who are

1302
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:27,480
they own it but like are they breeding

1303
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:29,160
maybe one might make some seeds every

1304
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,780
now and then but do they is that the

1305
00:48:29,159 --> 00:48:32,519
seeds they're selling now that's where

1306
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:33,960
it gets hairy you know like are they

1307
00:48:32,519 --> 00:48:35,400
doing their own projects and breeding

1308
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,960
and into weed probably

1309
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:39,480
is that what they're selling is that the

1310
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:41,519
majority of seeds they're selling

1311
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:43,858
and as much as I like the guys that's

1312
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:46,199
that's that's the honest truth on that

1313
00:48:43,858 --> 00:48:47,639
and they know it yeah in the in in the

1314
00:48:46,199 --> 00:48:50,039
watch thing I think I mentioned that

1315
00:48:47,639 --> 00:48:51,960
like she basically

1316
00:48:50,039 --> 00:48:53,519
came to the conclusion that a whole

1317
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:55,619
bunch of these different shops were

1318
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:57,780
actually just run by the same person

1319
00:48:55,619 --> 00:48:59,338
and they just each of them had different

1320
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:01,019
branding

1321
00:48:59,338 --> 00:49:03,179
um but it was the same same person

1322
00:49:01,019 --> 00:49:04,500
running all of it

1323
00:49:03,179 --> 00:49:07,559
and just getting it from the same

1324
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:09,059
warehouse yeah yeah and you know in the

1325
00:49:07,559 --> 00:49:11,400
US it's starting to happen we're seeing

1326
00:49:09,059 --> 00:49:14,039
these big old seed makers pop up in like

1327
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:16,500
Salinas Santa Barbara doing these

1328
00:49:14,039 --> 00:49:18,420
massive Femme pollinations outdoors and

1329
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:19,920
selling these as Femme seeds for cookies

1330
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:22,318
or for

1331
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:25,619
that's where all those seeds come from

1332
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:27,900
doesn't they're all just fem boofy

1333
00:49:25,619 --> 00:49:30,119
outdoor produced and these guys are

1334
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:31,920
these reps of this company are nowhere

1335
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:34,079
near this [ __ ] dude they don't the seeds

1336
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:36,260
don't touch their [ __ ] hands

1337
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:40,140
they aren't selecting

1338
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:41,579
one big smoke and mirrors campaign and

1339
00:49:40,139 --> 00:49:42,900
like you know like I see the comments

1340
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:44,280
with people right people get pissed at

1341
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,838
me all the time because they say I have

1342
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,980
nothing nice to say about other breeders

1343
00:49:45,838 --> 00:49:48,239
but I don't think I'm talking about

1344
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:50,280
other breeders I think I'm talking about

1345
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:51,838
people that sell seeds when I talk about

1346
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:54,240
other breeders I speak with admiration

1347
00:49:51,838 --> 00:49:55,739
and respect because it's it's hard it's

1348
00:49:54,239 --> 00:49:56,818
the heart we should just we may as well

1349
00:49:55,739 --> 00:49:59,879
just start calling these people drop

1350
00:49:56,818 --> 00:50:02,338
shippers yeah realistically yeah drop

1351
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:04,140
shippers they are it that's it marketing

1352
00:50:02,338 --> 00:50:04,739
drop shippers

1353
00:50:04,139 --> 00:50:06,900
um

1354
00:50:04,739 --> 00:50:09,000
um I did want you to look at one more

1355
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:11,400
website because this one has some

1356
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,980
personal significance to me okay I

1357
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,700
posted it in the in the chat in our chat

1358
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:16,139
here

1359
00:50:14,699 --> 00:50:17,818
I don't know if you can pull it out but

1360
00:50:16,139 --> 00:50:21,420
I'll give a bit of context

1361
00:50:17,818 --> 00:50:24,239
so before I've found the Syndicate I was

1362
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:28,680
on a forum I'm not gonna name the Forum

1363
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:31,979
okay but this forum was hooked up to

1364
00:50:28,679 --> 00:50:34,440
this website oh look at this website

1365
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:36,960
dude it looks like it's made by Bots for

1366
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:38,099
Bots these are all the the Barney farm

1367
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,679
pictures

1368
00:50:38,099 --> 00:50:42,960
they're old pictures I recognize them

1369
00:50:40,679 --> 00:50:45,539
but look at the aesthetic of the website

1370
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:47,519
dude like oh yeah it doesn't look like

1371
00:50:45,539 --> 00:50:49,380
it's it's for humans or that it was by

1372
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:51,900
humans yeah it looks like the most

1373
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:55,019
generic

1374
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:57,358
um and so this forum that I was on was

1375
00:50:55,019 --> 00:51:00,358
basically trying to funnel these white

1376
00:50:57,358 --> 00:51:01,619
label seeds down their four members

1377
00:51:00,358 --> 00:51:03,838
throats

1378
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:06,059
and you know this was like a major

1379
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:10,318
sponsor saying hey you can get like

1380
00:51:06,059 --> 00:51:12,960
cookie s ones from weed seeds Express no

1381
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:15,779
okay they ran a mild strain cool

1382
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:19,440
everyone was growing these seeds and

1383
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:21,540
everyone was so happy about it I just

1384
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,099
but that's it right like because no one

1385
00:51:21,539 --> 00:51:25,920
that has experience was going to be

1386
00:51:23,099 --> 00:51:27,780
going buying these and and spending

1387
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,858
their money here so the only people they

1388
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:31,019
were going to be getting are people that

1389
00:51:28,858 --> 00:51:32,519
are new that are so happy that they've

1390
00:51:31,019 --> 00:51:34,380
gotten through their first run of

1391
00:51:32,519 --> 00:51:36,960
something they can smoke regardless of

1392
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:39,300
quality because they're new like that

1393
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:43,579
it's gonna work it's always gonna work

1394
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:43,579
it's [ __ ] yeah it's preying on people

1395
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:49,260
look at that dude look at that I mean

1396
00:51:47,338 --> 00:51:51,659
the other thing I think that freaks me

1397
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:54,140
out is that this is this website is just

1398
00:51:51,659 --> 00:51:57,299
one example of like [ __ ] thousands

1399
00:51:54,139 --> 00:51:59,879
Skittles uh just as generic and as

1400
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:01,460
faceless as this look what they did to

1401
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:03,660
Green

1402
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:04,760
crackers they chose for Green Crack

1403
00:52:03,659 --> 00:52:06,480
Jesus

1404
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:08,280
[Music]

1405
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,019
did they get OG Kush right they didn't

1406
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:12,559
even put a picture of OG Kush under OG

1407
00:52:10,019 --> 00:52:12,559
Kush bro

1408
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:17,579
but that but that goes to show you like

1409
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,318
the people that are putting these

1410
00:52:17,579 --> 00:52:21,359
strains together and these sites

1411
00:52:19,318 --> 00:52:23,219
together they don't even know enough to

1412
00:52:21,358 --> 00:52:25,318
use a picture of OG Kush they don't know

1413
00:52:23,219 --> 00:52:27,118
what OG Kush looks like and that's

1414
00:52:25,318 --> 00:52:28,800
that's to me like that's one of those

1415
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:29,880
keys it's like well dude if your breeder

1416
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,079
doesn't know what OG Kush looks like

1417
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:33,059
probably should be buying seeds from

1418
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:36,420
them but if this is being shoved down

1419
00:52:33,059 --> 00:52:38,760
your throat at some [ __ ] forums you

1420
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:40,200
know why wouldn't this be the Forum says

1421
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:43,680
that's what people use right they got

1422
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:45,558
peanut butter prep after all

1423
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:50,578
wow

1424
00:52:45,559 --> 00:52:52,440
oh this poor Plant oh my God

1425
00:52:50,579 --> 00:52:55,019
yeah there's another one Amsterdam

1426
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:57,780
marijuana seeds isn't that another one

1427
00:52:55,019 --> 00:53:00,119
bro there's so many man like yeah this

1428
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:02,339
is the one engineering sea Bank name you

1429
00:53:00,119 --> 00:53:04,079
can think of probably exists

1430
00:53:02,338 --> 00:53:06,299
I think it was this one it was the one

1431
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:08,519
that's been around like forever and is

1432
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:11,720
never [ __ ] off Amsterdam marijuana

1433
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:11,719
seeds these guys

1434
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:18,539
Girl Scout cookies extreme uh we can't

1435
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:21,838
see the tab I think oh that's why yo

1436
00:53:18,539 --> 00:53:23,639
Google yeah that's why let's see

1437
00:53:21,838 --> 00:53:25,318
but this is the one like whenever I hear

1438
00:53:23,639 --> 00:53:27,838
people talking about like their their

1439
00:53:25,318 --> 00:53:29,818
first experiences usually for some

1440
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:31,500
reason they end up at uh Amsterdam

1441
00:53:29,818 --> 00:53:34,619
marijuana seeds and see if this is the

1442
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:37,858
one yeah I mean look at that

1443
00:53:34,619 --> 00:53:40,200
just a horrible horrible plants I

1444
00:53:37,858 --> 00:53:42,598
wouldn't want to grow that

1445
00:53:40,199 --> 00:53:45,000
yeah the website says generic as the

1446
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:46,859
last one as well yeah it's the same kind

1447
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
of [ __ ] man

1448
00:53:46,858 --> 00:53:50,279
yeah

1449
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,318
it's okay like I want people to have

1450
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:53,640
better than this I do and I don't want

1451
00:53:52,318 --> 00:53:56,579
this to be the first place that they go

1452
00:53:53,639 --> 00:53:57,900
and get ripped off you know like for

1453
00:53:56,579 --> 00:54:01,099
People's First seed buying experience

1454
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:01,099
shouldn't be getting ripped off

1455
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:06,659
we almost treat it now like it's the

1456
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,039
norm like if you just start you're gonna

1457
00:54:06,659 --> 00:54:10,139
get ripped off and then hopefully you

1458
00:54:08,039 --> 00:54:12,779
learn and then you stop getting ripped

1459
00:54:10,139 --> 00:54:14,400
off that's like with your norm and it's

1460
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:15,900
sad because it is the norm like we see

1461
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,000
it when people come to our

1462
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:19,559
um our Discord now like that's the first

1463
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,239
thing we hear is bro you don't know how

1464
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:23,220
many times I got ripped off before I got

1465
00:54:21,239 --> 00:54:24,719
here

1466
00:54:23,219 --> 00:54:26,939
oh my God look at the plant on the

1467
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:29,659
screen bro look at this look how Taco

1468
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:29,659
those leaves are

1469
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:36,838
no hope

1470
00:54:33,539 --> 00:54:39,838
yeah I hope for any of them

1471
00:54:36,838 --> 00:54:42,960
but yeah like was there anything like I

1472
00:54:39,838 --> 00:54:45,000
you go you go first no no no no go ahead

1473
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:47,880
I was just gonna say like I think you

1474
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:50,400
also did want to talk more about

1475
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:52,079
collectives as middlemen within the

1476
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:54,358
context of flower

1477
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:57,359
um but we can also keep bagging on these

1478
00:54:54,358 --> 00:54:59,279
these websites I could do this endlessly

1479
00:54:57,358 --> 00:55:01,259
bro like it's gonna have to be its own

1480
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:03,059
section on the show one day because it's

1481
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:06,119
just like you can go through these sites

1482
00:55:03,059 --> 00:55:08,940
and and literally help people like give

1483
00:55:06,119 --> 00:55:10,980
them sets of logic to use like as I'm

1484
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:13,200
breaking down this specific strain on

1485
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:15,240
this page I can explain why all the

1486
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:17,098
things that I look at that are are key

1487
00:55:15,239 --> 00:55:18,598
factors to me and why this is fake like

1488
00:55:17,099 --> 00:55:19,559
what would trigger this for me as a

1489
00:55:18,599 --> 00:55:21,240
person who's been in this business a

1490
00:55:19,559 --> 00:55:22,500
long time why would I not look at that

1491
00:55:21,239 --> 00:55:23,939
and see it's fake and I think that would

1492
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:26,280
that might be an important tool for

1493
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:27,539
people but I don't know I think a lot of

1494
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:30,059
people just want their handheld and

1495
00:55:27,539 --> 00:55:31,858
asked like is it fake or not and at that

1496
00:55:30,059 --> 00:55:33,660
point again you're relying on the faith

1497
00:55:31,858 --> 00:55:35,519
of someone whether it's me or someone

1498
00:55:33,659 --> 00:55:37,139
else you're asking someone else and it's

1499
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:39,179
always better to have the logic Tools in

1500
00:55:37,139 --> 00:55:41,098
your in your box so you're not getting

1501
00:55:39,179 --> 00:55:44,338
my agenda you're not getting anyone's

1502
00:55:41,099 --> 00:55:46,980
agenda I think we want to get towards

1503
00:55:44,338 --> 00:55:48,719
that that that process of thinking uh

1504
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:50,818
towards the end I think you did set out

1505
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:53,578
some points about it that's right but

1506
00:55:50,818 --> 00:55:54,960
how about we return to Flowerland for a

1507
00:55:53,579 --> 00:55:56,640
bit because you didn't want to talk

1508
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:58,500
about

1509
00:55:56,639 --> 00:56:00,179
Flowerland uh you didn't want to talk

1510
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:02,099
about collectives and the kind of role

1511
00:56:00,179 --> 00:56:05,338
that they've had as middlemen within

1512
00:56:02,099 --> 00:56:07,200
flower like the context of flower okay

1513
00:56:05,338 --> 00:56:09,659
so with the I think this is where it's

1514
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:11,519
at with the uh yeah with the burgeoning

1515
00:56:09,659 --> 00:56:13,799
of the gray the gray quasi legal scene

1516
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:16,559
we started seeing collectives with menus

1517
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:18,359
of options and we saw more Growers start

1518
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:20,160
in the field more availability and less

1519
00:56:18,358 --> 00:56:23,279
knowledge about the actual crops so the

1520
00:56:20,159 --> 00:56:26,039
menus have grown substantially

1521
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:28,260
um uh it's just a long list of names to

1522
00:56:26,039 --> 00:56:30,900
a lot of people and and this it wasn't

1523
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:32,040
initially the way it always was like at

1524
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:33,660
the beginning of uh California

1525
00:56:32,039 --> 00:56:35,338
Collective summer it was like Scentsy

1526
00:56:33,659 --> 00:56:36,539
star Big Bud there was like seven or

1527
00:56:35,338 --> 00:56:38,099
eight you could get Urban Poison

1528
00:56:36,539 --> 00:56:41,579
blueberry

1529
00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:43,140
a few more white widow White Rhino

1530
00:56:41,579 --> 00:56:44,760
but that's generally what you would

1531
00:56:43,139 --> 00:56:46,379
expect it wasn't a large menu thread

1532
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:49,800
interface

1533
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:52,740
um and now we have a middleman between

1534
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:54,599
between the grower the person growing

1535
00:56:52,739 --> 00:56:55,979
the crops and popping the seeds possibly

1536
00:56:54,599 --> 00:56:57,180
even popping the seeds because sometimes

1537
00:56:55,980 --> 00:57:00,059
the grower isn't even the person who

1538
00:56:57,179 --> 00:57:01,318
pops the seeds or sources the clones and

1539
00:57:00,059 --> 00:57:04,760
then we have

1540
00:57:01,318 --> 00:57:07,739
another middleman in between the flower

1541
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:09,420
and the end user so that's a whole

1542
00:57:07,739 --> 00:57:12,479
another variable

1543
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:14,639
and let's see uh each Collective

1544
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:15,900
dispensary is working with many Growers

1545
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:18,179
as the person

1546
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:20,039
um talked about in that text

1547
00:57:18,179 --> 00:57:22,858
they said specifically we are working

1548
00:57:20,039 --> 00:57:26,460
with many Growers and we filter it into

1549
00:57:22,858 --> 00:57:28,739
one spot being the mylar packaging place

1550
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:30,539
where they stamp their label they

1551
00:57:28,739 --> 00:57:31,379
stamped The Strain name on it all that

1552
00:57:30,539 --> 00:57:35,759
stuff

1553
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:39,300
many Growers one spot all of whom have

1554
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:42,059
individuals agenda individual agendas to

1555
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:43,800
move weed from their pockets

1556
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:45,780
um to the collective at the highest

1557
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:48,420
price point possible

1558
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:50,579
so the collective intern is also wanting

1559
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:52,920
to make points on their packages so they

1560
00:57:50,579 --> 00:57:55,019
also have an agenda to maximize the name

1561
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:57,900
value to Move It from the pockets to the

1562
00:57:55,019 --> 00:57:59,818
retail customers pockets

1563
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:04,318
with name value

1564
00:57:59,818 --> 00:58:05,659
and hype and and social media Instagram

1565
00:58:04,318 --> 00:58:09,900
Twitter

1566
00:58:05,659 --> 00:58:13,618
uh Snapchat the invention of Snapchat I

1567
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:16,920
mean names have gone and become far more

1568
00:58:13,619 --> 00:58:18,720
important in the sale than anything

1569
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:21,599
except for pictures

1570
00:58:18,719 --> 00:58:24,058
and pictures are not worth a thousand

1571
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:27,119
words anymore with with the invention of

1572
00:58:24,059 --> 00:58:28,740
AI pictures the invention of just you

1573
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:30,838
know like people just taking each

1574
00:58:28,739 --> 00:58:33,000
other's pictures yeah just saying yeah

1575
00:58:30,838 --> 00:58:34,920
yeah it's just not it doesn't tell the

1576
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:37,559
tale anymore

1577
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:41,338
um let's see what else we got yeah it's

1578
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:44,640
just it's there are so many agendas for

1579
00:58:41,338 --> 00:58:46,858
maximizing value and and getting points

1580
00:58:44,639 --> 00:58:48,719
off a package and and that's the term

1581
00:58:46,858 --> 00:58:50,940
that we use in cannabis and it's used in

1582
00:58:48,719 --> 00:58:52,318
many other areas you know but like

1583
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:54,059
there's points on a package there's a

1584
00:58:52,318 --> 00:58:56,039
finite number let's say you the there's

1585
00:58:54,059 --> 00:58:57,359
another number of you can uh amount you

1586
00:58:56,039 --> 00:59:02,039
can get off this

1587
00:58:57,358 --> 00:59:04,500
um package is three thousand uh dinero I

1588
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:07,318
don't know and and I don't want to get

1589
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:10,079
flagged for something and um

1590
00:59:07,318 --> 00:59:12,239
and everybody's trying to get their

1591
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:14,818
piece out of that three thousand so

1592
00:59:12,239 --> 00:59:16,679
there's a finite number of percentages

1593
00:59:14,818 --> 00:59:19,199
you know and everybody's trying to

1594
00:59:16,679 --> 00:59:21,960
maximize their value out of this so at

1595
00:59:19,199 --> 00:59:24,439
some point they start adding on uh

1596
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:24,440
what's it called

1597
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:29,400
fake value the best way into putting it

1598
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:30,720
they're adding on fake values so now

1599
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:32,940
it's not just three thousand let's let's

1600
00:59:30,719 --> 00:59:34,379
just let's let's add a different name to

1601
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:36,179
it now it's got four thousand a pound

1602
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:39,119
now this is more interesting to all of

1603
00:59:36,179 --> 00:59:40,440
us along the way right but what if we

1604
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:43,740
you know

1605
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:45,539
change a picture too now five thousand a

1606
00:59:43,739 --> 00:59:47,338
pound so there's all these different

1607
00:59:45,539 --> 00:59:49,739
agendas along the way and each person is

1608
00:59:47,338 --> 00:59:51,420
trying to maximize value at each turn

1609
00:59:49,739 --> 00:59:54,000
and

1610
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:55,980
it's just a lot of human error and Faith

1611
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,420
to put in a lot of people who don't

1612
00:59:55,980 --> 01:00:00,659
necessarily

1613
00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:03,900
have any reason to have the history in

1614
01:00:00,659 --> 01:00:05,098
mind or research in mind like none of

1615
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:08,220
that comes into play when it comes to

1616
01:00:05,099 --> 01:00:10,260
the wallet just to be really uh bold

1617
01:00:08,219 --> 01:00:11,519
here you you mean like someone's grown

1618
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:12,660
something but then they're like oh it's

1619
01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:15,659
not selling we're just going to call it

1620
01:00:12,659 --> 01:00:17,578
gelato instead yes and then raise the

1621
01:00:15,659 --> 01:00:19,798
price kind of thing well at least then

1622
01:00:17,579 --> 01:00:21,780
be able to move it so we can move this

1623
01:00:19,798 --> 01:00:23,219
at three thousand pounds gelato or uh

1624
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:27,500
let's say we can move this 300 000 a

1625
01:00:23,219 --> 01:00:27,500
pound into screen crack okay well

1626
01:00:27,659 --> 01:00:32,519
there's only three thousand to spread

1627
01:00:29,099 --> 01:00:33,720
between us so yeah you know gelato is

1628
01:00:32,519 --> 01:00:34,980
kind of a hot name let's move it to that

1629
01:00:33,719 --> 01:00:37,078
well now there's four thousand a pound

1630
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:38,219
yeah now that we call it gelato we can

1631
01:00:37,079 --> 01:00:40,140
move from four thousand account now

1632
01:00:38,219 --> 01:00:41,639
things are looking up everybody's morals

1633
01:00:40,139 --> 01:00:43,798
become more fluid at that point right

1634
01:00:41,639 --> 01:00:46,078
history research none of that makes any

1635
01:00:43,798 --> 01:00:47,880
sense the end user not having their

1636
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:49,920
headache or not throwing up it at the

1637
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:51,539
end of the day a lot less importance

1638
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:53,159
yeah

1639
01:00:51,539 --> 01:00:55,199
that are completely irrelevant not

1640
01:00:53,159 --> 01:00:57,118
important just not relevant whatsoever

1641
01:00:55,199 --> 01:00:58,259
it never gets taken into account I was

1642
01:00:57,119 --> 01:01:00,180
going to extend what you were saying

1643
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:02,460
earlier as well about how okay

1644
01:01:00,179 --> 01:01:04,679
now we're saying the names don't really

1645
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:07,380
mean enough the pictures don't mean

1646
01:01:04,679 --> 01:01:08,940
enough even what they're writing about

1647
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:11,640
what they're selling doesn't mean enough

1648
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:13,920
and then it's like I think what makes

1649
01:01:11,639 --> 01:01:15,239
people the next thing that people go to

1650
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:19,079
is

1651
01:01:15,239 --> 01:01:22,679
uh who's repping them on social media

1652
01:01:19,079 --> 01:01:24,720
yeah for example there's a big one and

1653
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:27,239
like like the watch thing right I kind

1654
01:01:24,719 --> 01:01:29,159
of pointed out that like even if people

1655
01:01:27,239 --> 01:01:31,500
aren't actually happy with what they've

1656
01:01:29,159 --> 01:01:34,318
got there's a symbiotic relationship

1657
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:36,358
here that could be at play where

1658
01:01:34,318 --> 01:01:37,858
the People The Growers quote unquote or

1659
01:01:36,358 --> 01:01:39,358
the consumers of the flower quote

1660
01:01:37,858 --> 01:01:41,480
unquote

1661
01:01:39,358 --> 01:01:41,480
um

1662
01:01:41,519 --> 01:01:46,500
have an incentive to still share the

1663
01:01:44,818 --> 01:01:49,940
product

1664
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:52,079
um if they want exposure themselves from

1665
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:55,980
the place they're either buying the

1666
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:59,880
seeds or flour from and so they then now

1667
01:01:55,980 --> 01:02:01,679
have like their own entrenched agenda

1668
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:04,680
um regardless of the quality of the

1669
01:02:01,679 --> 01:02:07,440
seeds or flour because now they they can

1670
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:10,440
be promoted if they are promoting this

1671
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:13,260
thing they themselves can get like

1672
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:15,838
you know clout out of it but conceivably

1673
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:18,140
well I mean that's to me how the the

1674
01:02:15,838 --> 01:02:18,139
whole

1675
01:02:18,719 --> 01:02:23,578
in that whole industry was built it was

1676
01:02:21,298 --> 01:02:27,059
a bunch of cosines off of shitty strains

1677
01:02:23,579 --> 01:02:29,460
not one breeder in the mix in my opinion

1678
01:02:27,059 --> 01:02:32,400
um it was people with big social media

1679
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:35,119
accounts you know like it started off to

1680
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:37,980
me like just for example with the the

1681
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:40,920
example with why yeast wonderful

1682
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:43,559
wonderful Dude made seeds did real

1683
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:46,920
selections made real crosses and he had

1684
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:48,960
a marketing guy then that marketing guy

1685
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:50,700
was a better talker behind the scenes

1686
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:52,260
not necessarily like physically a talker

1687
01:02:50,699 --> 01:02:57,058
that guy I can't talk for [ __ ] but he

1688
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:58,980
was a better liar schmoozer and sneakier

1689
01:02:57,059 --> 01:03:00,420
so while the man doing the work was

1690
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:03,000
making these pretty decent looking

1691
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:04,798
strains the person that was doing the

1692
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:09,179
deals on the back end was moving up the

1693
01:03:04,798 --> 01:03:13,380
Fuji and the marketing guy became

1694
01:03:09,179 --> 01:03:15,239
the breeder by just snaking his own

1695
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:17,760
breeder out and then figuring out that

1696
01:03:15,239 --> 01:03:19,798
you can buy bulk seeds and sell them

1697
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:21,240
that's how that's that's how that works

1698
01:03:19,798 --> 01:03:23,460
and that's how

1699
01:03:21,239 --> 01:03:25,679
and and the the thing that that killed

1700
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:27,900
me was that I every time I saw someone

1701
01:03:25,679 --> 01:03:30,539
supporting that specific company after

1702
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:32,099
this it happened to me it was like you

1703
01:03:30,539 --> 01:03:35,099
are spending money

1704
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:36,420
against breeders you're spending money

1705
01:03:35,099 --> 01:03:38,280
against breeding because what you're

1706
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:41,099
telling the whole community and by doing

1707
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:44,400
this is that we prop up guys that are

1708
01:03:41,099 --> 01:03:46,380
marketers that put push breeders out and

1709
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:48,420
that sell us [ __ ] and sell slides

1710
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:51,180
that's what we prop up that's what we're

1711
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:53,639
about so that's how I looked at it from

1712
01:03:51,179 --> 01:03:55,440
my uh perspective and obviously that's

1713
01:03:53,639 --> 01:03:58,679
not that's not realistic obviously

1714
01:03:55,440 --> 01:04:00,420
people didn't know all the backstory but

1715
01:03:58,679 --> 01:04:02,578
it also comes down to the point of like

1716
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:04,079
who's going to tell the backstory who

1717
01:04:02,579 --> 01:04:05,460
wants to take all that heat for telling

1718
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:07,260
the back story who wants to be the

1719
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:10,260
person telling everyone at every angle

1720
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:13,740
that you know and Santa's dead

1721
01:04:10,260 --> 01:04:15,839
this is not a fun position to be in

1722
01:04:13,739 --> 01:04:17,578
um you know like I always said I always

1723
01:04:15,838 --> 01:04:20,039
used to tell people I get mad and say do

1724
01:04:17,579 --> 01:04:22,260
your research do your research figure it

1725
01:04:20,039 --> 01:04:23,818
out and then at one point I realized

1726
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:26,400
there's nowhere for people to go do

1727
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:28,079
research anymore on these people

1728
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:30,780
yeah just not

1729
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:32,880
okay so I think we're getting towards

1730
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:35,819
what we might want to recommend to

1731
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:38,220
people as like a process or you know at

1732
01:04:35,818 --> 01:04:40,019
least generally to go through if you are

1733
01:04:38,219 --> 01:04:41,818
unsure about a product

1734
01:04:40,019 --> 01:04:44,280
but I think also

1735
01:04:41,818 --> 01:04:46,739
maybe I just do a little summary of what

1736
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:49,200
of kind of like the conditions that we

1737
01:04:46,739 --> 01:04:52,139
the sub-optimal conditions that we've

1738
01:04:49,199 --> 01:04:54,298
outlined in terms of the flower and Seed

1739
01:04:52,139 --> 01:04:56,759
markets yeah so

1740
01:04:54,298 --> 01:04:58,500
again we're just pointing it out in the

1741
01:04:56,760 --> 01:05:00,839
seed Market and the flower market

1742
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:04,500
there's a whole supply chain

1743
01:05:00,838 --> 01:05:06,179
potentially of different actors uh who

1744
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:08,880
each have different agendas at different

1745
01:05:06,179 --> 01:05:12,779
stages of the chain

1746
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:13,500
um there is the possibility of like

1747
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:15,298
um

1748
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:17,699
was I going to say

1749
01:05:15,298 --> 01:05:19,318
uh if you're a grower like I mentioned

1750
01:05:17,699 --> 01:05:21,500
and we're growing talking about Growing

1751
01:05:19,318 --> 01:05:24,480
Seeds your ability to kind of like

1752
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:26,159
properly vet

1753
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:28,079
uh what you're growing is really

1754
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:29,639
difficult just due to the nature of the

1755
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:31,740
plant and the complexity of all the

1756
01:05:29,639 --> 01:05:33,480
different stages that

1757
01:05:31,739 --> 01:05:35,338
um the plant and the flower have to go

1758
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:40,500
through

1759
01:05:35,338 --> 01:05:42,900
um there is the issue of like provenance

1760
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:45,838
there there's one other issue too

1761
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:49,139
and and you kind of gesture to it but it

1762
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:51,599
is the fact that there is a good

1763
01:05:49,139 --> 01:05:53,219
you know eight months to your period

1764
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:56,700
before you see the the actual flower

1765
01:05:53,219 --> 01:05:58,980
from the seeds and during that time it's

1766
01:05:56,699 --> 01:06:01,919
eight to eight months to a year if you

1767
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:03,480
pop it right away that you've gone from

1768
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:05,519
the purchase like do you even talk to

1769
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:06,599
that breeder anymore like you know what

1770
01:06:05,519 --> 01:06:08,579
I mean like will they have any

1771
01:06:06,599 --> 01:06:10,140
communication with you at that point is

1772
01:06:08,579 --> 01:06:12,119
it does it matter all that does that

1773
01:06:10,139 --> 01:06:13,379
piss you off anymore the you're so far

1774
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:15,298
removed from the purchase is it really

1775
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:16,858
worth the effort to go you know what I

1776
01:06:15,298 --> 01:06:19,679
mean so there's a lot of factors that

1777
01:06:16,858 --> 01:06:20,759
come into play about why this this scam

1778
01:06:19,679 --> 01:06:22,558
works

1779
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:26,700
essentially

1780
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:28,740
yeah many uh basically many what's a

1781
01:06:26,699 --> 01:06:31,858
good term for this

1782
01:06:28,739 --> 01:06:35,038
there are many gaps

1783
01:06:31,858 --> 01:06:37,318
uh uh between

1784
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:39,660
yeah they're just like so many gaps in

1785
01:06:37,318 --> 01:06:41,338
in these like chains and and like chains

1786
01:06:39,659 --> 01:06:45,179
of production and Supply

1787
01:06:41,338 --> 01:06:47,659
um that where uncertainty and dishonesty

1788
01:06:45,179 --> 01:06:47,659
can enter

1789
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:52,318
those gaps aren't really that well known

1790
01:06:50,338 --> 01:06:53,639
like outside of our Discord and our

1791
01:06:52,318 --> 01:06:55,619
friends and our friend group and some

1792
01:06:53,639 --> 01:06:57,719
seed makers like most people don't know

1793
01:06:55,619 --> 01:06:59,400
that you know this company is not making

1794
01:06:57,719 --> 01:07:01,558
their own seeds most people don't know

1795
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:03,358
that this breeder doesn't even grow this

1796
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:04,798
breeder doesn't even smoke let alone

1797
01:07:03,358 --> 01:07:06,659
grow you know like they don't know any

1798
01:07:04,798 --> 01:07:10,679
of that stuff

1799
01:07:06,659 --> 01:07:13,798
um but but it exists it does exist

1800
01:07:10,679 --> 01:07:16,019
okay so I think at this point people

1801
01:07:13,798 --> 01:07:17,699
listening in who are learning or hearing

1802
01:07:16,019 --> 01:07:20,579
about this for the first time might

1803
01:07:17,699 --> 01:07:22,439
start feeling really uh

1804
01:07:20,579 --> 01:07:26,700
how would I put it really disillusions

1805
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:28,440
yes um about the whole thing which is a

1806
01:07:26,699 --> 01:07:31,798
fair feeling like it it is

1807
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:34,440
dissolutioning it is really depressing

1808
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:36,179
um but I also think that we do want it

1809
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:39,298
to say that

1810
01:07:36,179 --> 01:07:41,899
you can do something about it right yeah

1811
01:07:39,298 --> 01:07:41,900
absolutely

1812
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:47,220
yeah maybe we can start digging into the

1813
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:50,160
possible ways

1814
01:07:47,219 --> 01:07:51,838
that you can try to verify that what

1815
01:07:50,159 --> 01:07:53,639
you've bought whether it's flour or

1816
01:07:51,838 --> 01:07:55,500
seeds

1817
01:07:53,639 --> 01:07:56,940
um is legitimate

1818
01:07:55,500 --> 01:07:57,539
okay

1819
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:59,460
um

1820
01:07:57,539 --> 01:08:00,900
I'm actually interested to hear from

1821
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:02,818
your point of view

1822
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:04,858
what you've learned up till this point

1823
01:08:02,818 --> 01:08:07,338
where you would start right now like

1824
01:08:04,858 --> 01:08:07,338
let's say

1825
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:12,539
um

1826
01:08:08,519 --> 01:08:14,159
you wanted to buy something that

1827
01:08:12,539 --> 01:08:16,560
had

1828
01:08:14,159 --> 01:08:18,179
from basically some kind of skunky

1829
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:20,219
undertone

1830
01:08:18,179 --> 01:08:21,838
where where would you start to research

1831
01:08:20,219 --> 01:08:23,579
because that's a really that's where a

1832
01:08:21,838 --> 01:08:25,439
lot of people start it's exceptionally

1833
01:08:23,579 --> 01:08:26,759
hard to research skunky anything because

1834
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:29,419
there are so many con artists running

1835
01:08:26,759 --> 01:08:29,420
around with that

1836
01:08:29,698 --> 01:08:34,198
man I yeah I don't know if I could

1837
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:35,759
and meet uh

1838
01:08:34,198 --> 01:08:37,259
you're smart dude you can answer this

1839
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:39,238
definitely

1840
01:08:37,259 --> 01:08:40,140
like what would you start so let's do

1841
01:08:39,238 --> 01:08:42,659
that now

1842
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:44,039
I think with the knowledge that I have

1843
01:08:42,659 --> 01:08:44,880
now

1844
01:08:44,039 --> 01:08:47,278
um

1845
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:49,440
number one I think I know a bit better

1846
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:52,620
which

1847
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:54,358
which clones or lines to look at or at

1848
01:08:52,619 --> 01:08:56,159
least which names to look for to begin

1849
01:08:54,359 --> 01:08:58,620
with you know even if I didn't have

1850
01:08:56,159 --> 01:09:00,539
skunk you know in my super skunk in mind

1851
01:08:58,619 --> 01:09:02,519
I think I would know okay

1852
01:09:00,539 --> 01:09:04,019
let's start sniffing around cam let's

1853
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:05,819
look around diesel let's look around

1854
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:07,739
diesel

1855
01:09:05,819 --> 01:09:09,539
um sure I can look for Super Skunk as

1856
01:09:07,738 --> 01:09:11,218
well I mean so there's there's kind of

1857
01:09:09,539 --> 01:09:13,738
like me knowing that's that's smart

1858
01:09:11,219 --> 01:09:15,838
basically like some strain history yeah

1859
01:09:13,738 --> 01:09:19,139
that's one aspect of it the second

1860
01:09:15,838 --> 01:09:21,359
aspect is now knowing networks of people

1861
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:23,880
and knowing the people who are involved

1862
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:25,679
given the history that's the next place

1863
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:27,539
I would look

1864
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:28,920
how did you get to the point where you

1865
01:09:27,539 --> 01:09:31,140
were studying the history though because

1866
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:34,199
I mean you have to go somewhere sure

1867
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:36,600
sure so I think the first thing was like

1868
01:09:34,198 --> 01:09:40,019
me trolling through all these [ __ ]

1869
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:42,420
you know white label seat sites and at

1870
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:44,719
least starting to get what the big names

1871
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:47,520
seem to be that was like

1872
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:50,520
pre-pre-learning right prede Syndicate

1873
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:52,259
that's just made up of picking up data

1874
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:54,840
yeah that one's more about like

1875
01:09:52,259 --> 01:09:57,119
analyzing frequencies of names right

1876
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:59,219
imagine being like okay OG Kush is

1877
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:00,539
clearly a big name chem dog clearly a

1878
01:09:59,219 --> 01:10:01,920
big name like that kind of thing that's

1879
01:10:00,539 --> 01:10:04,619
how I started

1880
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:06,060
and then I think it wasn't long after

1881
01:10:04,619 --> 01:10:07,439
that I started getting into people's

1882
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:10,260
reviews

1883
01:10:07,439 --> 01:10:11,579
like strain reviews on YouTube now you

1884
01:10:10,260 --> 01:10:14,520
know stuff like what you're doing now

1885
01:10:11,579 --> 01:10:17,519
but way worse yeah oh yeah um okay

1886
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:19,500
because even in there I was like this is

1887
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:23,580
so variable and it just sounds like

1888
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:25,979
complete rubbish like so many of them

1889
01:10:23,579 --> 01:10:28,800
and I think that's when I started to get

1890
01:10:25,979 --> 01:10:30,899
towards more like long-form media like

1891
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:34,679
uh conversations with breeders

1892
01:10:30,899 --> 01:10:36,119
conversations with um Growers

1893
01:10:34,679 --> 01:10:37,380
um and eventually find my way to breed

1894
01:10:36,119 --> 01:10:39,359
of Syndicate

1895
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:40,380
um but it was around that point that

1896
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:44,359
basically started getting me interested

1897
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:44,359
in what the oral histories were

1898
01:10:44,579 --> 01:10:49,500
what what made you decide to uh

1899
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:51,300
like

1900
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:53,399
kind of settle at breeder Syndicate

1901
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:55,380
because that that is I mean most people

1902
01:10:53,399 --> 01:10:56,698
you know that this these guys suck too

1903
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:59,640
you know what I mean like I can

1904
01:10:56,698 --> 01:11:02,039
generalize here I think that at breed is

1905
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:04,320
Syndicate you could actually try to

1906
01:11:02,039 --> 01:11:06,000
trace lines and I don't mean lines of

1907
01:11:04,319 --> 01:11:10,259
like in terms of like seed lines I just

1908
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:12,119
mean like lines of like logic yeah and

1909
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:14,880
actually get somewhere like you could

1910
01:11:12,119 --> 01:11:16,920
actually find a person and actually ask

1911
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:20,039
them things and they would they would

1912
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:22,859
tell you things yeah whereas like I when

1913
01:11:20,039 --> 01:11:25,560
you look elsewhere you just come up to

1914
01:11:22,859 --> 01:11:27,059
you just get didn't right it was like it

1915
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:30,060
was like the journalist looking for the

1916
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:34,080
source of the watches you would just it

1917
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:35,520
would just be this endless like uh

1918
01:11:34,079 --> 01:11:37,380
yeah there's no way you could have

1919
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:38,520
surfaces there's no way you could have

1920
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:40,859
gotten to

1921
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:42,540
the end of the day unless you had like

1922
01:11:40,859 --> 01:11:43,920
connections and connections into the

1923
01:11:42,539 --> 01:11:45,779
seed bank there's no way there's nothing

1924
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:47,940
saying anywhere like these seeds are

1925
01:11:45,779 --> 01:11:51,119
actually made by you know

1926
01:11:47,939 --> 01:11:52,559
yeah interesting so the the other way I

1927
01:11:51,119 --> 01:11:55,260
looked at it was

1928
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:57,719
is the person making these seats

1929
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:59,460
one like a like have they published

1930
01:11:57,719 --> 01:12:01,679
anything about what they've done yeah

1931
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:04,140
had they told any stories about their

1932
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:06,719
process have they said have they

1933
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:07,380
documented in any form like

1934
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:10,859
um

1935
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:13,260
yeah either provenance or process you

1936
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:16,500
know either one yeah and often even that

1937
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:19,079
criteria people fail yeah um

1938
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:22,020
and then the third thing if and if not

1939
01:12:19,079 --> 01:12:23,340
that can I even identify a person in

1940
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:26,159
this whole thing is that are they even

1941
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:28,380
individual names being mentioned or is

1942
01:12:26,158 --> 01:12:30,899
it just a faceless organization and most

1943
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:31,920
of the entities faceless yeah as an

1944
01:12:30,899 --> 01:12:34,439
entity

1945
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:36,359
so again let me I'll recap okay it's

1946
01:12:34,439 --> 01:12:37,259
like

1947
01:12:36,359 --> 01:12:39,779
um

1948
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:43,440
one is there a line of uh thought or

1949
01:12:39,779 --> 01:12:46,079
logic I can trace two is there any

1950
01:12:43,439 --> 01:12:49,079
mention of provenance or history three

1951
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:52,260
is any mention of a breathing process or

1952
01:12:49,079 --> 01:12:54,500
seed making process and four are these

1953
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:57,840
people even people that I can identify

1954
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:59,880
yeah that's a big one

1955
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:01,260
and so that is like outside of having

1956
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:03,119
access to something like breed of

1957
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:05,520
Syndicate I think that's a that's

1958
01:13:03,119 --> 01:13:07,439
something that you can follow whether or

1959
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:09,659
not you have access to people like Matt

1960
01:13:07,439 --> 01:13:12,299
yeah um

1961
01:13:09,658 --> 01:13:15,259
but I'm curious now man what about your

1962
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:15,260
opinion on like

1963
01:13:15,359 --> 01:13:20,519
uh trying to verify

1964
01:13:18,359 --> 01:13:22,679
something you're thinking about buying

1965
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:24,000
or a company that you're interested in

1966
01:13:22,679 --> 01:13:26,940
or

1967
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:30,420
that is so hard for me that's so hard

1968
01:13:26,939 --> 01:13:32,279
for me because I'm so biased now like

1969
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:33,539
and and I have to I have to think about

1970
01:13:32,279 --> 01:13:35,840
this a lot

1971
01:13:33,539 --> 01:13:38,880
because when people ask me about someone

1972
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:40,140
I don't want to if I don't like the

1973
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:42,960
human

1974
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:46,199
it's different than not liking or them

1975
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:47,760
not being decent at their job if that

1976
01:13:46,198 --> 01:13:50,158
makes sense because there are people

1977
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:52,020
that like I don't get along with that

1978
01:13:50,158 --> 01:13:54,420
are pretty good at [ __ ] making seeds

1979
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:56,940
and and are legitimate and not Liars we

1980
01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:58,619
just don't get along you know

1981
01:13:56,939 --> 01:14:00,839
um so that part's that part's been

1982
01:13:58,619 --> 01:14:02,340
really hard for me to divide because

1983
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:04,800
usually if I don't like someone I don't

1984
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:08,039
support them period

1985
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:09,719
um yep I mean I think one thing that I

1986
01:14:08,039 --> 01:14:11,640
can probably guess is really important

1987
01:14:09,719 --> 01:14:14,340
for you is just be able to have a

1988
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:16,739
conversation with the person who at

1989
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:17,699
least seems to be the responsible person

1990
01:14:16,738 --> 01:14:19,198
um like

1991
01:14:17,698 --> 01:14:21,299
if you're not happy with seeds I imagine

1992
01:14:19,198 --> 01:14:23,399
for you the important thing is to talk

1993
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:24,260
to the seed maker and see what they have

1994
01:14:23,399 --> 01:14:27,420
to say

1995
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:30,119
with the flower yeah I want them to be

1996
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:32,460
smarter than me at this and not to say

1997
01:14:30,119 --> 01:14:34,619
they got to be Geniuses I'm not genius

1998
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:36,000
at all I think I'm very basic at it

1999
01:14:34,619 --> 01:14:39,179
there's people that

2000
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:41,039
you know can speak circles around me all

2001
01:14:39,179 --> 01:14:42,179
day when it comes to breeding but not

2002
01:14:41,039 --> 01:14:43,979
even necessarily smart I mean just be

2003
01:14:42,179 --> 01:14:47,158
able to communicate

2004
01:14:43,979 --> 01:14:49,259
basic basic [ __ ] like I can because I'm

2005
01:14:47,158 --> 01:14:51,719
basic and if they communicate with me

2006
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:53,820
basically then it's great

2007
01:14:51,719 --> 01:14:57,300
um I was taught I told you yesterday

2008
01:14:53,819 --> 01:14:58,619
um I had a conversation with uh the rs11

2009
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:01,500
guy

2010
01:14:58,619 --> 01:15:04,500
yeah he totally could talk

2011
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:06,359
speak on any level about breeding why he

2012
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:08,399
selected what he did how many he did

2013
01:15:06,359 --> 01:15:09,839
what he was doing at the time you know

2014
01:15:08,399 --> 01:15:11,819
like all the things around it the things

2015
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:14,159
that like when you actually put the time

2016
01:15:11,819 --> 01:15:16,799
in and and it put in you know years to

2017
01:15:14,158 --> 01:15:18,179
breeding like you start at least with me

2018
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:20,159
and a lot of my friends we start

2019
01:15:18,179 --> 01:15:21,779
referring to things in our past by what

2020
01:15:20,158 --> 01:15:23,399
we were growing at that time like that's

2021
01:15:21,779 --> 01:15:25,019
how we measure the time in our life it's

2022
01:15:23,399 --> 01:15:27,119
based on what our Cycles are growing

2023
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:29,100
were because it's just the one constant

2024
01:15:27,119 --> 01:15:30,539
in our lives and when you start hearing

2025
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:32,880
people talk like that then you know it's

2026
01:15:30,539 --> 01:15:35,880
very legitimately they're they're being

2027
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:38,819
growing their being because it becomes

2028
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:39,960
their basis for time in life you know so

2029
01:15:38,819 --> 01:15:42,299
that's one of those things I look for

2030
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:44,579
and I noticed that yesterday and he's he

2031
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:46,500
he's a totally different type of um

2032
01:15:44,579 --> 01:15:49,559
breeder in that he uses you know more

2033
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:51,238
modern lines he's doing modern work and

2034
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:53,039
but we're still able to communicate on

2035
01:15:51,238 --> 01:15:54,658
that level and I thought it was pretty

2036
01:15:53,039 --> 01:15:58,319
cool because it's been a long time since

2037
01:15:54,658 --> 01:16:01,079
I've met a newer person that can do that

2038
01:15:58,319 --> 01:16:02,460
yeah and I think this is part of your

2039
01:16:01,079 --> 01:16:03,719
larger point of actually just getting to

2040
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:05,460
know these people

2041
01:16:03,719 --> 01:16:08,640
yeah get to know the people you're

2042
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:10,319
buying stuff from this is this was this

2043
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:12,539
conversation wasn't even about like

2044
01:16:10,319 --> 01:16:15,179
necessarily for the show at first like

2045
01:16:12,539 --> 01:16:18,420
it was it was because I it all started

2046
01:16:15,179 --> 01:16:20,940
out when I started seeing guava

2047
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:22,500
the name guava pop up everywhere oh yeah

2048
01:16:20,939 --> 01:16:24,839
that's right I forgot about that yeah

2049
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:26,819
during my era guava usually meant

2050
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:28,500
startup like it was it was star dog

2051
01:16:26,819 --> 01:16:31,019
guava cut was in it and they called it

2052
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:33,960
guava something or it was like a mango

2053
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:36,060
smelling plant okay so I started going

2054
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:37,679
on some a hunt trying to figure out what

2055
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:39,900
guava was because I kept singing

2056
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:41,880
everything including the rs11 the pink

2057
01:16:39,899 --> 01:16:42,839
guava so that's what kind of sent me on

2058
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:44,579
that trail

2059
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:46,260
and to this day like some people say

2060
01:16:44,579 --> 01:16:47,939
it's gelato something some people say

2061
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:50,460
it's sure something I have no clue but

2062
01:16:47,939 --> 01:16:53,879
all I know is it's not guava e at all

2063
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:56,640
but um I am interested to try the pink

2064
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:59,219
guava now though after hearing uh Dio

2065
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:00,780
explain it that sounds cool but

2066
01:16:59,219 --> 01:17:02,279
um yeah after trying a bunch of

2067
01:17:00,779 --> 01:17:03,658
different strawberry guava pineapple

2068
01:17:02,279 --> 01:17:06,719
guava none of them being pineapple

2069
01:17:03,658 --> 01:17:09,119
strawberry or guava it was a trip it's a

2070
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:12,000
trip and that was kind of what even got

2071
01:17:09,119 --> 01:17:14,579
me thinking down this process was why

2072
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,020
why this meant something else to me this

2073
01:17:14,579 --> 01:17:17,640
guadala means something totally

2074
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:19,980
different to a whole generation of

2075
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:22,199
breeders why does it mean this now and

2076
01:17:19,979 --> 01:17:24,000
what does it mean now and that's where

2077
01:17:22,198 --> 01:17:26,158
it kind of started you know this little

2078
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,779
journey this show uh initiating

2079
01:17:26,158 --> 01:17:29,579
conversations with like Clearwater

2080
01:17:27,779 --> 01:17:31,559
genetics he was one of the people I went

2081
01:17:29,579 --> 01:17:34,559
and actually went into his Discord to do

2082
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:36,300
research on guava because I knew that

2083
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:38,640
our Discord probably wouldn't be a good

2084
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:40,920
place to do research on Modern strains

2085
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:42,360
you know like I'm not someone you can

2086
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:43,500
ask about modern strains and I don't

2087
01:17:42,359 --> 01:17:45,960
know a lot of people in there that are

2088
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:47,939
like that's their thing but I noticed

2089
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:49,439
Clearwater genetics had used it and a

2090
01:17:47,939 --> 01:17:52,259
bunch of stuff so I figured I'd go in

2091
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:55,198
his Discord and ask and uh yeah he said

2092
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:57,000
gelato something very polite guy so you

2093
01:17:55,198 --> 01:17:59,279
know that was one step I took in just

2094
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:01,859
trying to research it's one one data

2095
01:17:59,279 --> 01:18:04,319
point one person using the the line's uh

2096
01:18:01,859 --> 01:18:05,880
perspective I don't know how experienced

2097
01:18:04,319 --> 01:18:07,799
a breeding or history or any of that he

2098
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:09,239
is at research but it's at least a data

2099
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:12,779
point that I can take and say okay this

2100
01:18:09,238 --> 01:18:14,939
breeder you know a said this reader B

2101
01:18:12,779 --> 01:18:16,920
said this reader Z said this this person

2102
01:18:14,939 --> 01:18:18,779
has been around this long does this much

2103
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:20,279
research more reliable therefore this

2104
01:18:18,779 --> 01:18:22,380
one is probably most likely the answer

2105
01:18:20,279 --> 01:18:23,880
that's how I kind of break down my data

2106
01:18:22,380 --> 01:18:25,260
and that was how I went about it with

2107
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:27,659
guava

2108
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:30,060
yeah and I I'll add that like that

2109
01:18:27,658 --> 01:18:32,479
that's a really good point as well uh

2110
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:34,980
being able to have

2111
01:18:32,479 --> 01:18:37,738
multiple uh

2112
01:18:34,979 --> 01:18:40,559
multiple perspectives on the same thing

2113
01:18:37,738 --> 01:18:43,559
that you can help to use verify that one

2114
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:45,239
thing whether it's like

2115
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:46,800
um yeah I mean obviously there are

2116
01:18:45,238 --> 01:18:49,379
limits to that too like I pointed out

2117
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:52,440
you know that example of like social

2118
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:54,719
media influencers and these fake stores

2119
01:18:52,439 --> 01:18:57,479
kind of you know being in like the

2120
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:59,039
double cosine yeah the double cosine so

2121
01:18:57,479 --> 01:19:01,139
you do have to be careful of that still

2122
01:18:59,039 --> 01:19:04,260
but I think

2123
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:07,140
having multiple perspectives where you

2124
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:09,239
can sort of discern that there aren't

2125
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:11,460
the same agendas in operation across

2126
01:19:09,238 --> 01:19:13,500
those perspectives

2127
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:15,179
um definitely tell you something it's

2128
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:16,859
not necessarily enough to confirm

2129
01:19:15,179 --> 01:19:18,179
everything but it clear it definitely

2130
01:19:16,859 --> 01:19:20,039
helps a lot

2131
01:19:18,179 --> 01:19:24,000
yeah I mean it's like a like with a map

2132
01:19:20,039 --> 01:19:26,279
when you triangulate points or um yes or

2133
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,020
like in in a story you know if you have

2134
01:19:26,279 --> 01:19:30,179
two people that are unknown to each

2135
01:19:28,020 --> 01:19:33,360
other telling two very unique statement

2136
01:19:30,179 --> 01:19:35,399
or two very similar statements some very

2137
01:19:33,359 --> 01:19:37,079
unique points you know like that that

2138
01:19:35,399 --> 01:19:38,819
stands out stuff like that you know

2139
01:19:37,079 --> 01:19:41,579
stands out quite a bit and gives more

2140
01:19:38,819 --> 01:19:44,880
relevancy and to the data I think

2141
01:19:41,579 --> 01:19:46,920
usually not always but yeah

2142
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:48,719
because really I mean I've been scared

2143
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:51,179
to use these terms but we are actually

2144
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:53,158
addressing a much larger issue that you

2145
01:19:51,179 --> 01:19:54,179
know the world is still dealing with

2146
01:19:53,158 --> 01:19:56,099
which is

2147
01:19:54,179 --> 01:19:59,579
uh what they call like a post-truth

2148
01:19:56,100 --> 01:20:02,460
world uh where we have to face the

2149
01:19:59,579 --> 01:20:03,658
uncertainty of information almost now as

2150
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:05,698
a mundane

2151
01:20:03,658 --> 01:20:07,500
uh issue

2152
01:20:05,698 --> 01:20:10,339
um and a pervasive issue

2153
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:12,719
and you know one of the

2154
01:20:10,340 --> 01:20:14,279
it's sad though because I just don't I

2155
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:16,920
don't know that this wasn't always the

2156
01:20:14,279 --> 01:20:19,979
case you know I just think it's become

2157
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:23,579
in people's faces

2158
01:20:19,979 --> 01:20:25,139
but yeah it I think it's always been the

2159
01:20:23,579 --> 01:20:27,479
case even with our most popular most

2160
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:29,640
famous book ever you know it's just like

2161
01:20:27,479 --> 01:20:32,339
it's never been the case where

2162
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:34,380
everything is as presented

2163
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:36,179
I I think that we can still point to

2164
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:37,859
reasons why it's been accelerated though

2165
01:20:36,179 --> 01:20:39,179
or galvanized like obviously the

2166
01:20:37,859 --> 01:20:41,519
internet

2167
01:20:39,179 --> 01:20:45,539
um being able to have like e-commerce

2168
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:48,780
you know like virtual shops social media

2169
01:20:45,539 --> 01:20:52,859
obviously specifically as well

2170
01:20:48,779 --> 01:20:54,559
um we mentioned the credit sure uh

2171
01:20:52,859 --> 01:20:57,839
Reddit did you mean do you think no no

2172
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:58,739
credit like uh digital currency the fact

2173
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:01,020
that you don't have to have hard

2174
01:20:58,738 --> 01:21:03,658
currency exchange hand to hand

2175
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:05,580
yep big one

2176
01:21:03,658 --> 01:21:08,279
um I had another big one right the

2177
01:21:05,579 --> 01:21:12,719
Cannabis itself like I pointed out it

2178
01:21:08,279 --> 01:21:16,019
being first of all a very complex uh

2179
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:18,899
process of production but also a very

2180
01:21:16,020 --> 01:21:20,520
complex process of like judgment

2181
01:21:18,899 --> 01:21:23,339
yeah um

2182
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:25,699
yeah and so all of those things compound

2183
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:27,260
like to produce this like

2184
01:21:25,698 --> 01:21:31,219
very

2185
01:21:27,260 --> 01:21:31,219
unstable information space

2186
01:21:31,319 --> 01:21:34,500
um

2187
01:21:32,579 --> 01:21:36,539
yeah definitely

2188
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:37,439
yeah but sorry we were we were kind of

2189
01:21:36,539 --> 01:21:39,359
like

2190
01:21:37,439 --> 01:21:41,519
getting into a more prescriptive mode of

2191
01:21:39,359 --> 01:21:43,198
like trying to give people suggestions

2192
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:45,239
on how they've actually verify

2193
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:47,359
information and I think the last thing

2194
01:21:45,238 --> 01:21:49,678
we pointed out was like you said

2195
01:21:47,359 --> 01:21:53,279
multiple perspectives

2196
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:56,219
uh diff not different agendas

2197
01:21:53,279 --> 01:21:56,819
um looking for triangulation

2198
01:21:56,219 --> 01:21:58,619
um

2199
01:21:56,819 --> 01:22:02,099
but what about something like Community

2200
01:21:58,619 --> 01:22:03,658
met like what do you think about so

2201
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:06,719
coming back to the breed of Syndicate

2202
01:22:03,658 --> 01:22:08,158
right like how important is it do you

2203
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:10,319
think to have a community of people who

2204
01:22:08,158 --> 01:22:12,059
are like oh basically looking for the

2205
01:22:10,319 --> 01:22:16,679
truth

2206
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:19,140
it again it's like I I really truly feel

2207
01:22:16,679 --> 01:22:21,539
and I'm sure any parent of any group

2208
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:24,420
that they build feels this way that it

2209
01:22:21,539 --> 01:22:27,600
is such an anomaly because it exists in

2210
01:22:24,420 --> 01:22:29,520
a in a vacuum of tons of forums that

2211
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:31,860
have existed online since the beginning

2212
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:36,480
of Canada seeds being sold online

2213
01:22:31,859 --> 01:22:39,179
and I have never seen a place that works

2214
01:22:36,479 --> 01:22:41,698
like ours ever there's never been one I

2215
01:22:39,179 --> 01:22:43,199
don't care there's no not even a close

2216
01:22:41,698 --> 01:22:45,359
comparison by any stretch the

2217
01:22:43,198 --> 01:22:47,519
imagination almost every single Forum

2218
01:22:45,359 --> 01:22:49,920
typically and I don't remember any seed

2219
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:51,960
bank owners that I ever liked or got

2220
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:54,179
along with that I thought wow these are

2221
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:58,380
really good dudes that ran forums not

2222
01:22:54,179 --> 01:23:00,480
one not one and a lot of times it was

2223
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:03,179
very us or them

2224
01:23:00,479 --> 01:23:05,099
our way or the highway

2225
01:23:03,179 --> 01:23:07,380
um if one of our breeders doesn't like

2226
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:10,800
you you're [ __ ] dead to us you know

2227
01:23:07,380 --> 01:23:12,779
type thing so while

2228
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:15,480
those information spaces are important

2229
01:23:12,779 --> 01:23:18,859
Community is obviously important when

2230
01:23:15,479 --> 01:23:22,439
you can do it right but it can also

2231
01:23:18,859 --> 01:23:25,738
be so just this bully mentality of just

2232
01:23:22,439 --> 01:23:30,479
stupidity and just in itself be its own

2233
01:23:25,738 --> 01:23:33,059
Mark pool like pool of marks to scam and

2234
01:23:30,479 --> 01:23:34,678
it's yeah it it's scary because you can

2235
01:23:33,060 --> 01:23:36,840
put yourself in almost like a cult

2236
01:23:34,679 --> 01:23:38,219
situation in some of these forms with

2237
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:39,900
the way it turned out just shift

2238
01:23:38,219 --> 01:23:42,359
shoveling your money every time someone

2239
01:23:39,899 --> 01:23:45,599
does a drop because the Forum owner says

2240
01:23:42,359 --> 01:23:46,500
it's legit Bam Bam Bam Bam and like I

2241
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:48,840
was actually thinking about double

2242
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:50,939
cosines going on

2243
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:54,600
yeah I was chatting with Shawnee about

2244
01:23:50,939 --> 01:23:55,678
one of these forums and um I I had it

2245
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:57,659
popped into mind that these are almost

2246
01:23:55,679 --> 01:24:00,119
like little like feudal systems where

2247
01:23:57,658 --> 01:24:03,119
you have like the Lord You Know The

2248
01:24:00,119 --> 01:24:05,880
Forum owner the the sponsors and then

2249
01:24:03,119 --> 01:24:07,979
kind of like the like The Peasants the

2250
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:10,079
the people who are like forced almost

2251
01:24:07,979 --> 01:24:11,279
forced to grow

2252
01:24:10,079 --> 01:24:13,319
um you know what they're being told to

2253
01:24:11,279 --> 01:24:16,079
grow yeah

2254
01:24:13,319 --> 01:24:18,119
and getting otherwise like banned if you

2255
01:24:16,079 --> 01:24:20,279
don't you know you don't comply

2256
01:24:18,119 --> 01:24:22,679
yeah it's it's tough too because even

2257
01:24:20,279 --> 01:24:25,619
even with our Discord there's always

2258
01:24:22,679 --> 01:24:28,560
going to be a kind of um attitude or

2259
01:24:25,619 --> 01:24:30,840
theme right that goes along with it and

2260
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:33,239
ours has typically been like keeping

2261
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:36,539
scammers out of our community with that

2262
01:24:33,238 --> 01:24:38,698
said there are people that maybe we know

2263
01:24:36,539 --> 01:24:40,920
or to us we have the knowledge that are

2264
01:24:38,698 --> 01:24:42,359
scammers but other people don't and they

2265
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:43,199
come in thinking that these are good

2266
01:24:42,359 --> 01:24:45,599
people

2267
01:24:43,198 --> 01:24:48,779
and come in promoting that scammer's

2268
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:51,060
agenda and get pushed out real fast from

2269
01:24:48,779 --> 01:24:53,039
our group you know and to the that

2270
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:54,420
person's perspective they may be looking

2271
01:24:53,039 --> 01:24:55,738
at it like

2272
01:24:54,420 --> 01:24:56,880
we're just as bad as all these other

2273
01:24:55,738 --> 01:24:58,559
forms because obviously we have an

2274
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:01,140
agenda we're not letting them push the

2275
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:03,780
agenda for this particular person

2276
01:25:01,140 --> 01:25:05,100
so it a lot of it is perspective too you

2277
01:25:03,779 --> 01:25:08,219
know like

2278
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:10,320
I just happen to know I came in a long

2279
01:25:08,219 --> 01:25:12,359
time ago and happened to know a lot of

2280
01:25:10,319 --> 01:25:14,639
these people really intimately in person

2281
01:25:12,359 --> 01:25:16,500
it's not just business to business back

2282
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:18,060
then there were so few of us that a lot

2283
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:20,158
of us knew each other person to person

2284
01:25:18,060 --> 01:25:23,219
we dealt with each other at conventions

2285
01:25:20,158 --> 01:25:26,219
Emerald cups all that stuff some of us

2286
01:25:23,219 --> 01:25:27,719
were good friends over years time some

2287
01:25:26,219 --> 01:25:29,460
of us were just acquaintances over years

2288
01:25:27,719 --> 01:25:32,279
time but got to know each other pretty

2289
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:34,079
well you know so it's it's not just

2290
01:25:32,279 --> 01:25:35,519
business to business when I comment on a

2291
01:25:34,079 --> 01:25:37,319
lot of people and and like I was saying

2292
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:39,840
earlier when you're talking about like

2293
01:25:37,319 --> 01:25:41,099
growing British stuff or uh and when I

2294
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:43,560
was talking about good person versus

2295
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:46,260
good genetics for me it's sometimes it

2296
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:48,600
can be so hard because I'm so biased by

2297
01:25:46,260 --> 01:25:51,420
being so in the middle of the the social

2298
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:53,400
scenario of breeding and Seed making of

2299
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:56,579
course yeah

2300
01:25:53,399 --> 01:25:59,099
it doesn't help me for for bias you know

2301
01:25:56,579 --> 01:26:00,840
what I mean because but I do as much as

2302
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:02,400
I can I try to be transparent in

2303
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:04,679
perspective and keep perspective on that

2304
01:26:02,399 --> 01:26:07,679
for people when I talk about a breeder

2305
01:26:04,679 --> 01:26:09,420
and not liking them if it's someone that

2306
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:11,399
I like their their actual gear I'll

2307
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:13,139
point it out you know like I try to be

2308
01:26:11,399 --> 01:26:14,819
cognizant of what I'm saying when I'm

2309
01:26:13,139 --> 01:26:17,460
saying it how I say it because I know

2310
01:26:14,819 --> 01:26:19,019
some people take that to heart

2311
01:26:17,460 --> 01:26:21,359
you know

2312
01:26:19,020 --> 01:26:23,219
I'll also add that like I think having a

2313
01:26:21,359 --> 01:26:24,539
strong community that you can largely

2314
01:26:23,219 --> 01:26:27,779
Trust

2315
01:26:24,539 --> 01:26:30,300
embodies a lot of what uh embodies a lot

2316
01:26:27,779 --> 01:26:31,800
of the process already of what we were

2317
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:34,619
uh

2318
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:37,079
uh kind of recommending before like in a

2319
01:26:34,619 --> 01:26:39,960
community you have the opportunity to a

2320
01:26:37,079 --> 01:26:42,479
get multiple perspectives you get to

2321
01:26:39,960 --> 01:26:44,639
have extended conversations and why I

2322
01:26:42,479 --> 01:26:47,218
say extended like

2323
01:26:44,639 --> 01:26:49,319
um as a key part of this is that

2324
01:26:47,219 --> 01:26:51,920
over time when you're talking to the

2325
01:26:49,319 --> 01:26:54,359
same people you start to discern

2326
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:57,060
patterns yeah you start to be able to

2327
01:26:54,359 --> 01:26:59,219
know whether what they say is consistent

2328
01:26:57,060 --> 01:27:02,400
reliable

2329
01:26:59,219 --> 01:27:04,319
and so you have having these sustained

2330
01:27:02,399 --> 01:27:06,259
interactions with multiple people who

2331
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:09,299
all have different agendas and different

2332
01:27:06,260 --> 01:27:12,600
you know growing situations and contexts

2333
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:16,079
it's much easier to come to you know

2334
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:18,420
more reliable truths let's say because

2335
01:27:16,079 --> 01:27:20,460
we don't want to say that like you can

2336
01:27:18,420 --> 01:27:23,460
either you get perfect information or

2337
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:26,219
you get uh false information it's always

2338
01:27:23,460 --> 01:27:28,859
going to be somewhere in between

2339
01:27:26,219 --> 01:27:30,899
you know like truth unfortunately no

2340
01:27:28,859 --> 01:27:34,139
longer is like an absolute

2341
01:27:30,899 --> 01:27:36,719
thing it's not like true or false it's

2342
01:27:34,139 --> 01:27:39,900
almost like we now have degrees of truth

2343
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:42,119
yes and degrees of strength of Truth and

2344
01:27:39,899 --> 01:27:45,119
so if there's a piece of information

2345
01:27:42,119 --> 01:27:46,619
that again is verified by multiple

2346
01:27:45,119 --> 01:27:49,198
people and again you know they don't

2347
01:27:46,619 --> 01:27:50,760
have a shared agenda we can probably say

2348
01:27:49,198 --> 01:27:54,359
that that is

2349
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:56,280
a more reliable truth than one that is

2350
01:27:54,359 --> 01:27:57,779
maybe spoken by one person who has an

2351
01:27:56,279 --> 01:28:00,359
obvious agenda right I think there's

2352
01:27:57,779 --> 01:28:03,559
just an obvious example yeah and so a

2353
01:28:00,359 --> 01:28:03,559
community again

2354
01:28:03,719 --> 01:28:06,300
helps you

2355
01:28:05,579 --> 01:28:08,639
um

2356
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:12,440
definitely kind of like speeds up any of

2357
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:12,440
these processes of verifying information

2358
01:28:12,779 --> 01:28:17,219
absolutely

2359
01:28:14,279 --> 01:28:19,559
um you know like thinking about it like

2360
01:28:17,219 --> 01:28:22,020
when you brought up Community my first

2361
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:23,760
instinct is to like

2362
01:28:22,020 --> 01:28:25,440
push back from that because it'd be very

2363
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:27,719
easy to be like yeah no our discord's

2364
01:28:25,439 --> 01:28:30,178
the way you know it would be very easy

2365
01:28:27,719 --> 01:28:32,639
to do that but at the same time I'm also

2366
01:28:30,179 --> 01:28:35,219
very big about like in communities there

2367
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:37,859
can't be pedestals and I think um

2368
01:28:35,219 --> 01:28:39,420
that's something else people really need

2369
01:28:37,859 --> 01:28:42,238
to take into account Even in our own

2370
01:28:39,420 --> 01:28:43,920
Discord like I try to make try to be

2371
01:28:42,238 --> 01:28:46,319
very human there like people know I'm

2372
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:48,420
just a [ __ ] up like everyone else and I

2373
01:28:46,319 --> 01:28:49,738
always [ __ ] up so

2374
01:28:48,420 --> 01:28:52,260
um I think that's important part of the

2375
01:28:49,738 --> 01:28:55,379
community too is that that it's a

2376
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:58,860
community not a oligarchy or something

2377
01:28:55,380 --> 01:29:00,539
weird you know like a dictatorship uh

2378
01:28:58,859 --> 01:29:01,979
it's very important know and know the

2379
01:29:00,539 --> 01:29:03,840
difference between that and know what

2380
01:29:01,979 --> 01:29:06,119
you're in the middle of and always keep

2381
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:07,500
up keep a very good perspective around

2382
01:29:06,119 --> 01:29:10,019
you with who you're surrounding yourself

2383
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:12,300
with more importantly

2384
01:29:10,020 --> 01:29:14,699
I was gonna point out and I think this

2385
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:16,739
could almost be his own episode but I

2386
01:29:14,698 --> 01:29:19,079
kind of wanted to point out what I think

2387
01:29:16,738 --> 01:29:19,879
are symptoms of the not very good

2388
01:29:19,079 --> 01:29:22,859
Community

2389
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:25,859
uh I.E like a lot of the discords that I

2390
01:29:22,859 --> 01:29:28,019
have seen like so in breed of Syndicate

2391
01:29:25,859 --> 01:29:30,139
again what I was trying to draw your

2392
01:29:28,020 --> 01:29:32,639
attention to was having sustained

2393
01:29:30,139 --> 01:29:33,840
extended conversations with the same

2394
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:36,480
people

2395
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:39,840
now what you find in most other discords

2396
01:29:36,479 --> 01:29:42,359
is that there is communication but is

2397
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:43,380
often really fragmented like you don't

2398
01:29:42,359 --> 01:29:46,319
really have the same people

2399
01:29:43,380 --> 01:29:48,179
participating all the time you have kind

2400
01:29:46,319 --> 01:29:50,698
of random one-off interactions with

2401
01:29:48,179 --> 01:29:52,980
random people and there's just no

2402
01:29:50,698 --> 01:29:56,219
continuity

2403
01:29:52,979 --> 01:29:58,259
and I think so if you get validation in

2404
01:29:56,219 --> 01:30:00,179
that kind of context I'd be much less

2405
01:29:58,260 --> 01:30:01,260
willing to trust the information there

2406
01:30:00,179 --> 01:30:05,279
because

2407
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:07,199
you just don't have uh again a the

2408
01:30:05,279 --> 01:30:08,939
duration of interactions the the the

2409
01:30:07,198 --> 01:30:11,039
kind of like extended repeated

2410
01:30:08,939 --> 01:30:14,819
interactions

2411
01:30:11,039 --> 01:30:16,619
um and uh therefore you can't it's very

2412
01:30:14,819 --> 01:30:18,479
hard to verify what you're hearing from

2413
01:30:16,619 --> 01:30:20,760
them you know

2414
01:30:18,479 --> 01:30:22,819
yeah I've I've just been recently

2415
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:26,520
learning about the discords that exist

2416
01:30:22,819 --> 01:30:28,979
as clone Gathering stations have you

2417
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:31,980
heard about these places like the cell

2418
01:30:28,979 --> 01:30:34,500
phone yeah um I'm new to that

2419
01:30:31,979 --> 01:30:36,000
that was very new to me and one of the

2420
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:37,920
guys that's a moderator and a few of

2421
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,560
these and I were having a conversation

2422
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:43,260
really smart nice dude he seems like

2423
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:45,480
he's like he's genuinely interested in

2424
01:30:43,260 --> 01:30:47,880
collecting clones for the purpose of

2425
01:30:45,479 --> 01:30:49,619
getting data points to experience them

2426
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:50,880
learn them you know things like that

2427
01:30:49,619 --> 01:30:53,039
that's a great reason to get into

2428
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:54,960
collecting clones I totally admire that

2429
01:30:53,039 --> 01:30:57,539
it's why I got into it it's why a lot of

2430
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:59,100
people do and I cannot [ __ ] on that at

2431
01:30:57,539 --> 01:31:00,238
all I don't [ __ ] on clone collecting

2432
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:02,460
whatsoever even though I don't

2433
01:31:00,238 --> 01:31:06,619
necessarily do anymore but

2434
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:09,658
like these clone collecting places

2435
01:31:06,619 --> 01:31:11,760
what I'm learning is that the people in

2436
01:31:09,658 --> 01:31:13,799
these don't understand that the people

2437
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:17,699
holding these old clones

2438
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:20,460
don't interact with groups that sell

2439
01:31:17,698 --> 01:31:22,379
their old clones because that's not how

2440
01:31:20,460 --> 01:31:26,279
it was ever these were things that were

2441
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:28,380
gifted and shared and gifted and when

2442
01:31:26,279 --> 01:31:29,759
someone takes a gift or something that

2443
01:31:28,380 --> 01:31:32,100
you're sharing with them

2444
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:34,560
like that's in your circle and like a

2445
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:37,320
familial type thing and sell it they're

2446
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:39,060
usually it s nade out like they're cut

2447
01:31:37,319 --> 01:31:41,158
off from the group that's how things go

2448
01:31:39,060 --> 01:31:42,480
over time and it's not a hoarding thing

2449
01:31:41,158 --> 01:31:45,059
it's just a completely different

2450
01:31:42,479 --> 01:31:46,619
mentality on how groups are built how

2451
01:31:45,060 --> 01:31:47,880
apprenticeship like how apprenticeship

2452
01:31:46,619 --> 01:31:50,099
Works

2453
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:52,199
um friendships are built how trust is

2454
01:31:50,100 --> 01:31:55,020
built over time because a lot of times

2455
01:31:52,198 --> 01:31:56,698
if you're if you're learning someone you

2456
01:31:55,020 --> 01:31:58,139
share a clone with them they don't ever

2457
01:31:56,698 --> 01:32:00,299
[ __ ] you on that clone they never pass

2458
01:31:58,139 --> 01:32:01,920
it out or any of that you know that you

2459
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:04,340
know you can trust them with a little

2460
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:07,079
more and that's how trust and love and

2461
01:32:04,340 --> 01:32:09,360
friendships are built over time so

2462
01:32:07,079 --> 01:32:11,819
that's what a lot of these people are

2463
01:32:09,359 --> 01:32:14,039
missing in these cut organizations and

2464
01:32:11,819 --> 01:32:15,899
don't get that the people that actually

2465
01:32:14,039 --> 01:32:18,179
own the cuts with the provenance and the

2466
01:32:15,899 --> 01:32:19,859
in the good provenance that they want

2467
01:32:18,179 --> 01:32:21,359
aren't going to be interacting with the

2468
01:32:19,859 --> 01:32:24,119
groups who let these cuts out in the

2469
01:32:21,359 --> 01:32:25,559
community so when they're spending these

2470
01:32:24,119 --> 01:32:27,420
you know several hundred dollars

2471
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:28,860
thousands and sometimes on these clones

2472
01:32:27,420 --> 01:32:30,840
that they're hoping are real and aren't

2473
01:32:28,859 --> 01:32:33,059
and they're wondering why this happens

2474
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:34,380
it's because they're completely missing

2475
01:32:33,060 --> 01:32:36,600
the point

2476
01:32:34,380 --> 01:32:37,800
um I think you know clone trading is

2477
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:38,400
great

2478
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:41,520
um

2479
01:32:38,399 --> 01:32:42,839
I I just gave clones to people because I

2480
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:44,400
didn't really give a [ __ ] about that in

2481
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:46,560
the end like I just didn't I gave away

2482
01:32:44,399 --> 01:32:49,500
all of my clones and realized that like

2483
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:51,900
I can pop seeds and find whatever I got

2484
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:53,819
out of that mindset but I get it and I

2485
01:32:51,899 --> 01:32:55,619
think it's a sum of it is because I I

2486
01:32:53,819 --> 01:32:57,179
have those data points now and and

2487
01:32:55,619 --> 01:32:59,219
they're in my brain and they'll be there

2488
01:32:57,179 --> 01:33:00,719
forever and everybody I think if you're

2489
01:32:59,219 --> 01:33:03,480
going to take green seriously needs some

2490
01:33:00,719 --> 01:33:04,859
of those data points but know how to get

2491
01:33:03,479 --> 01:33:06,059
to that point and if you're in one of

2492
01:33:04,859 --> 01:33:07,439
those groups and you're seeing that go

2493
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:10,020
down

2494
01:33:07,439 --> 01:33:12,719
um kind of have some some

2495
01:33:10,020 --> 01:33:14,100
Spidey senses go off a little bit of

2496
01:33:12,719 --> 01:33:16,260
when it comes to the provenance part

2497
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:17,820
because these guys don't have access to

2498
01:33:16,260 --> 01:33:19,500
that they don't have access to a lot of

2499
01:33:17,819 --> 01:33:21,059
what they're claiming to and if they do

2500
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:23,698
have some of these clones

2501
01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:25,139
they probably got it in Shady ways and

2502
01:33:23,698 --> 01:33:26,399
it's going to lead to bad provenance and

2503
01:33:25,139 --> 01:33:28,020
you're going to get stuck in a wall

2504
01:33:26,399 --> 01:33:29,219
where like you're gonna be like well how

2505
01:33:28,020 --> 01:33:30,360
can I prove that this is what you're

2506
01:33:29,219 --> 01:33:32,698
telling me and that I paid all this

2507
01:33:30,359 --> 01:33:36,000
money for well you know it looks like it

2508
01:33:32,698 --> 01:33:37,500
the best we can do you know so keep all

2509
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:39,899
that in mind

2510
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:40,800
I did also want to speak to a bit of a

2511
01:33:39,899 --> 01:33:42,719
like

2512
01:33:40,800 --> 01:33:45,420
I don't know Paradox is the right word

2513
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:47,100
with clones but I know that one of the

2514
01:33:45,420 --> 01:33:48,840
one of the messages that you had for

2515
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:51,659
this season was about

2516
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:54,239
trying to escape this like clone

2517
01:33:51,658 --> 01:33:55,460
fetishization right yeah this is the

2518
01:33:54,238 --> 01:33:57,959
elite clone finish

2519
01:33:55,460 --> 01:33:59,399
but and so on the one hand it's like

2520
01:33:57,960 --> 01:34:00,840
yeah you know

2521
01:33:59,399 --> 01:34:03,899
um

2522
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:06,119
uh goddess dead kind of vibe you know uh

2523
01:34:03,899 --> 01:34:07,679
and we're all like past that but it's

2524
01:34:06,119 --> 01:34:09,539
also like

2525
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:12,000
clones are dead but also long-lived

2526
01:34:09,539 --> 01:34:15,658
clones because given how poor the

2527
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:18,238
information game is sometimes if you

2528
01:34:15,658 --> 01:34:19,920
have a verified clone it is one of the

2529
01:34:18,238 --> 01:34:22,259
few

2530
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:23,819
um reliable data points that you have

2531
01:34:22,260 --> 01:34:25,739
like it's an index it's kind of like

2532
01:34:23,819 --> 01:34:27,599
what you were saying so it's they're a

2533
01:34:25,738 --> 01:34:29,218
bit of a gift curse like I know this is

2534
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:29,820
its own topic like

2535
01:34:29,219 --> 01:34:31,859
um

2536
01:34:29,819 --> 01:34:33,299
you know clones versus seeds and all

2537
01:34:31,859 --> 01:34:35,219
that that will I'm sure we'll get to

2538
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:38,460
that probably in another episode now um

2539
01:34:35,219 --> 01:34:40,739
yeah but they are still extremely

2540
01:34:38,460 --> 01:34:42,359
important but they are also the cause of

2541
01:34:40,738 --> 01:34:45,000
a lot of

2542
01:34:42,359 --> 01:34:47,819
terrible [ __ ] so it really I mean

2543
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:50,100
because at the end of the day clones are

2544
01:34:47,819 --> 01:34:53,119
just one or two or you know a group

2545
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:55,440
selection that they feel

2546
01:34:53,119 --> 01:34:57,238
represents what they were going for best

2547
01:34:55,439 --> 01:34:59,279
or that they think the market will like

2548
01:34:57,238 --> 01:35:01,259
Best But at the end of the day that's

2549
01:34:59,279 --> 01:35:05,099
you know like who is doing the selecting

2550
01:35:01,260 --> 01:35:06,539
how how researched are they how how well

2551
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:08,520
versed are they how experienced are they

2552
01:35:06,539 --> 01:35:11,698
do they are they do they smoke weed even

2553
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:13,500
that's again do they smoke [ __ ] weed

2554
01:35:11,698 --> 01:35:15,359
even because a lot of these guys don't

2555
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:17,819
how are they doing or selecting you know

2556
01:35:15,359 --> 01:35:19,799
do they have experience smoking weed a

2557
01:35:17,819 --> 01:35:22,500
lot of these guys never even have they

2558
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:24,659
have no interest in it you know it just

2559
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:27,600
another commodity

2560
01:35:24,658 --> 01:35:29,339
but yeah no I it clones are very hard

2561
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:30,780
it's hard because there are good data

2562
01:35:29,340 --> 01:35:32,639
points to be gotten from them you know

2563
01:35:30,779 --> 01:35:34,019
like I recommend people run cheese and

2564
01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:36,300
stuff like that so that they have that

2565
01:35:34,020 --> 01:35:40,139
data point for skunk one or

2566
01:35:36,300 --> 01:35:41,460
sour okay one chemd but the it's worth

2567
01:35:40,139 --> 01:35:44,279
saying obviously and then this is going

2568
01:35:41,460 --> 01:35:47,158
to be obvious thing to say but the same

2569
01:35:44,279 --> 01:35:49,559
the same problems that affect your

2570
01:35:47,158 --> 01:35:52,198
ability to discern authenticity in flour

2571
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:55,320
and seeds obviously affects clone sales

2572
01:35:52,198 --> 01:35:58,379
as well so absolutely absolutely and

2573
01:35:55,319 --> 01:36:00,299
there are you know like the one great

2574
01:35:58,380 --> 01:36:02,639
thing about cannabis being a very modern

2575
01:36:00,300 --> 01:36:04,020
like our scene being very modern is that

2576
01:36:02,639 --> 01:36:06,179
a lot of these guys that did this

2577
01:36:04,020 --> 01:36:08,159
elections some of those guys still have

2578
01:36:06,179 --> 01:36:11,460
those cuts in their hand never lost them

2579
01:36:08,158 --> 01:36:12,839
and that's like like with art if you

2580
01:36:11,460 --> 01:36:14,460
were going to an artist for a painting

2581
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:16,800
you'd want to go to the first the person

2582
01:36:14,460 --> 01:36:19,079
who did it the most reliable person go

2583
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:20,460
to the source and uh yeah I mean

2584
01:36:19,079 --> 01:36:22,260
cannabis is young enough to where a lot

2585
01:36:20,460 --> 01:36:24,658
of clones can still be gotten that way

2586
01:36:22,260 --> 01:36:26,940
you know

2587
01:36:24,658 --> 01:36:28,738
yeah I actually think okay actually this

2588
01:36:26,939 --> 01:36:31,138
is I think this is an important anecdote

2589
01:36:28,738 --> 01:36:34,198
from my personal Journey sure I think

2590
01:36:31,139 --> 01:36:36,480
early on I had given up

2591
01:36:34,198 --> 01:36:38,399
all

2592
01:36:36,479 --> 01:36:39,899
I think I'd given up on the on the

2593
01:36:38,399 --> 01:36:42,960
possibility of actually talking to

2594
01:36:39,899 --> 01:36:45,299
someone who was

2595
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:47,399
who had any relationship to these clones

2596
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:49,380
at all I basically just thought it

2597
01:36:47,399 --> 01:36:50,939
wasn't possible yeah like everything

2598
01:36:49,380 --> 01:36:53,760
that I saw on the internet I was just

2599
01:36:50,939 --> 01:36:56,819
like nothing feels like I can actually

2600
01:36:53,760 --> 01:37:01,500
connect to the real people behind all of

2601
01:36:56,819 --> 01:37:04,679
this it actually felt yeah but

2602
01:37:01,500 --> 01:37:07,079
it didn't also take that long to find

2603
01:37:04,679 --> 01:37:10,800
some people like Brita Center okay and

2604
01:37:07,079 --> 01:37:13,139
be like oh wow they are real people

2605
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:15,779
um behind some of these things and yeah

2606
01:37:13,139 --> 01:37:17,819
eventually you can find them um

2607
01:37:15,779 --> 01:37:19,619
so I think I think with the craziest

2608
01:37:17,819 --> 01:37:22,439
part about the whole clone collecting

2609
01:37:19,619 --> 01:37:24,420
scene is is if you really break it down

2610
01:37:22,439 --> 01:37:25,619
like and you get really good at figuring

2611
01:37:24,420 --> 01:37:27,658
out who

2612
01:37:25,619 --> 01:37:29,519
who has done the best research who is

2613
01:37:27,658 --> 01:37:32,219
the most fastidious about provenance

2614
01:37:29,520 --> 01:37:33,960
about keeping their plants healthy how

2615
01:37:32,219 --> 01:37:37,079
long they've been kept alive keeping

2616
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:40,439
tags right there's like

2617
01:37:37,079 --> 01:37:42,179
four maybe people that have this large

2618
01:37:40,439 --> 01:37:44,099
collection of all these clones

2619
01:37:42,179 --> 01:37:45,899
throughout our community that are

2620
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:47,280
keeping them that are reliable for all

2621
01:37:45,899 --> 01:37:50,638
of their clones because they're just

2622
01:37:47,279 --> 01:37:52,679
consistent like four four people and

2623
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:55,500
that's out of our whole world of

2624
01:37:52,679 --> 01:37:57,119
cannabis four that I can count and in

2625
01:37:55,500 --> 01:38:00,060
all of my research and I'm not one of

2626
01:37:57,119 --> 01:38:02,519
them to four

2627
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:04,560
you know yeah like that's that's that's

2628
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:06,060
scary that should be scary and very in

2629
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:08,100
and people are going to say that that's

2630
01:38:06,060 --> 01:38:09,960
not realistic but it's true it is a

2631
01:38:08,100 --> 01:38:11,100
thousand percent true there's there's

2632
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:13,920
four people

2633
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:17,159
and we're lucky to have them very

2634
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:19,260
yeah that's crazy to think about yeah

2635
01:38:17,158 --> 01:38:21,960
all the Breeders all the seed makers out

2636
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:24,860
there tens of thousands there's four

2637
01:38:21,960 --> 01:38:24,859
four people

2638
01:38:25,079 --> 01:38:28,079
mind-blowing

2639
01:38:28,198 --> 01:38:33,559
I wanted to zoom out a bit and just

2640
01:38:30,359 --> 01:38:33,559
think about like

2641
01:38:33,719 --> 01:38:37,079
I think like Matt mentioned and we've

2642
01:38:35,939 --> 01:38:38,039
probably mentioned that multiple times

2643
01:38:37,079 --> 01:38:40,500
like

2644
01:38:38,039 --> 01:38:41,819
one of the pivots that we're making this

2645
01:38:40,500 --> 01:38:43,738
season

2646
01:38:41,819 --> 01:38:46,859
is

2647
01:38:43,738 --> 01:38:49,259
to help encourage people to to think

2648
01:38:46,859 --> 01:38:51,238
about what they are buying and whether

2649
01:38:49,260 --> 01:38:53,100
or not what they are buying is legit and

2650
01:38:51,238 --> 01:38:54,539
how they can know whether something that

2651
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:57,179
they're buying is legit

2652
01:38:54,539 --> 01:38:59,579
and then the other major theme

2653
01:38:57,179 --> 01:39:01,500
is this whole tension with clones and I

2654
01:38:59,579 --> 01:39:03,719
think obviously we touched on the former

2655
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:06,179
that that's this whole episode but I

2656
01:39:03,719 --> 01:39:08,579
think we'll probably come back to like

2657
01:39:06,179 --> 01:39:11,520
seeds versus clones like another time

2658
01:39:08,579 --> 01:39:12,899
yeah yeah that's fine I think yeah I

2659
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:15,000
think that could be a full episode in

2660
01:39:12,899 --> 01:39:17,879
itself yeah it is yeah it's a huge thing

2661
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:20,158
in of itself because like that for that

2662
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:23,159
latter topic you know a lot of people

2663
01:39:20,158 --> 01:39:25,138
who don't like this show uh what they

2664
01:39:23,158 --> 01:39:27,299
like to say is you're kind of just

2665
01:39:25,139 --> 01:39:29,880
ruining our fun like does history

2666
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:32,279
actually matter that much when I can

2667
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:34,020
still find good [ __ ] and it's kind of a

2668
01:39:32,279 --> 01:39:35,579
fair point I think it's sort of a fair

2669
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:37,620
criticism

2670
01:39:35,579 --> 01:39:39,179
um but we probably need to evaluate what

2671
01:39:37,619 --> 01:39:40,260
the trade-offs actually are so they're

2672
01:39:39,179 --> 01:39:42,539
obviously going to be trade-offs of

2673
01:39:40,260 --> 01:39:44,460
people who are very fastidious about

2674
01:39:42,539 --> 01:39:45,960
provenance and they're going to be

2675
01:39:44,460 --> 01:39:47,279
trade-offs with people who don't care at

2676
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:48,179
all and just looking for quote unquote

2677
01:39:47,279 --> 01:39:50,519
fire

2678
01:39:48,179 --> 01:39:52,980
I think both lines of thinking are

2679
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:56,760
actually sort of legit and I think we

2680
01:39:52,979 --> 01:39:58,500
could cover that in another time sure

2681
01:39:56,760 --> 01:39:59,579
and think about what the pros and cons

2682
01:39:58,500 --> 01:40:01,679
are

2683
01:39:59,579 --> 01:40:03,600
yeah

2684
01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:05,039
but man man I don't know we've said

2685
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:07,199
quite a lot this is quite a dense

2686
01:40:05,039 --> 01:40:10,019
episode and I also feel like I have

2687
01:40:07,198 --> 01:40:11,698
repeated myself a lot but no just to

2688
01:40:10,020 --> 01:40:14,520
make sure that like we really really

2689
01:40:11,698 --> 01:40:16,919
drill these points home because I think

2690
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:18,239
what men I also discovering is that so

2691
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:19,020
many people somehow still don't know

2692
01:40:18,238 --> 01:40:22,979
this

2693
01:40:19,020 --> 01:40:25,260
yeah it never ceases to amaze me it

2694
01:40:22,979 --> 01:40:28,319
never ceases to amaze me uh a few things

2695
01:40:25,260 --> 01:40:29,760
yeah one so one at how many of the

2696
01:40:28,319 --> 01:40:32,158
scammers that continue to scam over the

2697
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:34,139
years that always blows my Minds because

2698
01:40:32,158 --> 01:40:36,719
it's the same people but they had it

2699
01:40:34,139 --> 01:40:38,940
figured out early on that like there's a

2700
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:40,800
cycle of new Growers always coming in

2701
01:40:38,939 --> 01:40:42,658
and as long as they could nail those new

2702
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:45,300
people they have a constant influx of

2703
01:40:42,658 --> 01:40:47,158
new customers so that's one of the main

2704
01:40:45,300 --> 01:40:49,020
things the other thing that always blew

2705
01:40:47,158 --> 01:40:52,198
my mind was constantly having to explain

2706
01:40:49,020 --> 01:40:53,100
to people that there are bulk seed

2707
01:40:52,198 --> 01:40:56,099
makers

2708
01:40:53,100 --> 01:40:59,159
and they Supply most of the market that

2709
01:40:56,100 --> 01:41:01,620
part that part I I always think is gonna

2710
01:40:59,158 --> 01:41:03,420
like be someday be like common knowledge

2711
01:41:01,619 --> 01:41:04,920
because it's like that in a lot of

2712
01:41:03,420 --> 01:41:07,199
Industries but for some reason in

2713
01:41:04,920 --> 01:41:09,600
cannabis it's just like

2714
01:41:07,198 --> 01:41:11,698
not known still no matter how many times

2715
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:14,039
it's said or reiterated

2716
01:41:11,698 --> 01:41:17,460
I think we did a whole show on it too

2717
01:41:14,039 --> 01:41:19,738
like the the worst kept secret of our

2718
01:41:17,460 --> 01:41:21,719
business you know yeah it's still not

2719
01:41:19,738 --> 01:41:24,839
that well known

2720
01:41:21,719 --> 01:41:26,939
yep absolutely absolutely and and like

2721
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:30,539
with the watch analogy if you broaden

2722
01:41:26,939 --> 01:41:33,000
like uh this inquiry towards like

2723
01:41:30,539 --> 01:41:34,618
various forms of Commerce online you

2724
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:38,340
will see the same patterns playing out

2725
01:41:34,618 --> 01:41:40,679
it's just that cannabis like from for

2726
01:41:38,340 --> 01:41:43,800
reasons I've mentioned multiple times

2727
01:41:40,679 --> 01:41:47,100
just is like even more susceptible

2728
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:49,739
to these scams and like exploitations

2729
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:53,159
than other products sure gray Market

2730
01:41:49,738 --> 01:41:56,279
means that there's no like real legal uh

2731
01:41:53,158 --> 01:41:58,259
recompense so it's going to draw in a

2732
01:41:56,279 --> 01:42:00,059
lot of people whose only intention is to

2733
01:41:58,260 --> 01:42:02,699
scam because they know that they can

2734
01:42:00,060 --> 01:42:03,840
legally get away with it and most people

2735
01:42:02,698 --> 01:42:06,059
like

2736
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:07,800
especially like white collar criminals

2737
01:42:06,060 --> 01:42:09,300
that's what they live for you know

2738
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:11,100
they're

2739
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:13,560
that's their scam that's what they do

2740
01:42:11,100 --> 01:42:15,480
and and being in a gray Market just kind

2741
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:17,820
of opens it up to people like that

2742
01:42:15,479 --> 01:42:19,500
that'll that'll that we're too scared to

2743
01:42:17,819 --> 01:42:21,479
grow but they can kind of [ __ ] around in

2744
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:24,539
this room they'll get in there

2745
01:42:21,479 --> 01:42:26,638
and uh yeah and that's why it does it

2746
01:42:24,539 --> 01:42:28,319
and let me just black hat for a moment

2747
01:42:26,639 --> 01:42:30,719
and just and just explain like I'll

2748
01:42:28,319 --> 01:42:33,118
unpack this okay you want to start your

2749
01:42:30,719 --> 01:42:35,460
own brand it's so easy to set up

2750
01:42:33,118 --> 01:42:37,618
something on Shopify go steal a bunch of

2751
01:42:35,460 --> 01:42:39,060
pictures from someone else go steal a

2752
01:42:37,618 --> 01:42:42,359
bunch of writing from someone else or

2753
01:42:39,060 --> 01:42:44,400
use chat GPT to invent some story for

2754
01:42:42,359 --> 01:42:46,679
your company

2755
01:42:44,399 --> 01:42:49,259
um go buy some bulk seeds that are

2756
01:42:46,679 --> 01:42:51,658
really cheap from some random place

2757
01:42:49,260 --> 01:42:53,639
uh set up an Instagram account and

2758
01:42:51,658 --> 01:42:56,399
you're you're Gucci like you could do

2759
01:42:53,639 --> 01:42:59,819
this like a day or two easy you know

2760
01:42:56,399 --> 01:43:01,500
easy and if you're smart like you can

2761
01:42:59,819 --> 01:43:03,420
definitely trick people and obviously

2762
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:05,880
I'm not saying this to encourage you to

2763
01:43:03,420 --> 01:43:06,899
do it but just showing you how easy it

2764
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:09,480
actually is

2765
01:43:06,899 --> 01:43:11,158
yeah the one thing it's scary the one

2766
01:43:09,479 --> 01:43:13,799
thing that sucks though is that I'm not

2767
01:43:11,158 --> 01:43:15,960
going anywhere and everybody got to get

2768
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:17,579
it past me and that sucks because it

2769
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:19,920
doesn't happen very often and we

2770
01:43:17,579 --> 01:43:21,719
obviously outlined some of the steps

2771
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:23,399
that we think you could take

2772
01:43:21,719 --> 01:43:25,679
um in your own you know in your own

2773
01:43:23,399 --> 01:43:27,238
searches

2774
01:43:25,679 --> 01:43:28,800
um but yeah I'd also be interested to

2775
01:43:27,238 --> 01:43:30,959
hear like if other people have other

2776
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:33,000
ideas for how you

2777
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:34,439
you know how you can best verify any

2778
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,639
piece of information you know within

2779
01:43:34,439 --> 01:43:37,678
cannabis

2780
01:43:35,639 --> 01:43:39,960
um I'd love to hear more suggestions

2781
01:43:37,679 --> 01:43:41,819
yeah I'd also like to hear it for more

2782
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:44,639
from the people that really hate what I

2783
01:43:41,819 --> 01:43:46,799
have to say like if you think that my

2784
01:43:44,639 --> 01:43:48,960
advice was kind of shitty like what what

2785
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:51,659
are the steps you use to to do it better

2786
01:43:48,960 --> 01:43:53,279
like you know because maybe people are

2787
01:43:51,658 --> 01:43:54,960
doing it better than my advice and maybe

2788
01:43:53,279 --> 01:43:56,519
I could be giving better advice on it so

2789
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:57,480
leave the comments below I'd love to

2790
01:43:56,520 --> 01:44:00,119
hear it

2791
01:43:57,479 --> 01:44:02,099
yeah because ultimately you know it's a

2792
01:44:00,118 --> 01:44:04,738
very complex again subjective thing

2793
01:44:02,100 --> 01:44:06,960
judgment is subjective you know like

2794
01:44:04,738 --> 01:44:08,339
evaluating these things is really

2795
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:10,859
subjective so

2796
01:44:08,340 --> 01:44:13,440
I think we want to just like generate

2797
01:44:10,859 --> 01:44:15,599
more of this conversation and provoke

2798
01:44:13,439 --> 01:44:17,099
more of this thinking

2799
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:18,659
um because that's that's what's

2800
01:44:17,100 --> 01:44:21,780
important it's not necessarily about

2801
01:44:18,658 --> 01:44:23,759
like making specific points it's about

2802
01:44:21,779 --> 01:44:25,319
ensuring that everyone is on this well

2803
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:27,300
more people are on this journey of

2804
01:44:25,319 --> 01:44:28,979
excellence and so forth trying to figure

2805
01:44:27,300 --> 01:44:31,820
this out

2806
01:44:28,979 --> 01:44:31,819
yeah exactly

2807
01:44:31,939 --> 01:44:40,738
no I just totally get that on accidents

2808
01:44:36,020 --> 01:44:43,020
I was like it's gonna ramble

2809
01:44:40,738 --> 01:44:44,519
yeah and otherwise I think that's more

2810
01:44:43,020 --> 01:44:46,020
or less what I have to say otherwise I'm

2811
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:48,480
just going to keep repeating myself over

2812
01:44:46,020 --> 01:44:51,420
and over again yeah and the same like

2813
01:44:48,479 --> 01:44:54,118
you know there are Avenues to be able to

2814
01:44:51,420 --> 01:44:55,800
do the research I highly suggest like

2815
01:44:54,118 --> 01:44:58,019
don't even just use breeder Syndicate

2816
01:44:55,800 --> 01:45:00,179
like go pick up marijuana botany go pick

2817
01:44:58,020 --> 01:45:03,179
cannabis ethnobotany and evolution from

2818
01:45:00,179 --> 01:45:05,039
from Merlin and Clark learn that and

2819
01:45:03,179 --> 01:45:06,960
that will give you everything you need

2820
01:45:05,039 --> 01:45:08,939
to know if you really truly understand

2821
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:10,500
those books that will give you

2822
01:45:08,939 --> 01:45:13,618
everything you need to know to start

2823
01:45:10,500 --> 01:45:16,020
breaking down at least uh breeders speak

2824
01:45:13,618 --> 01:45:17,939
when people like you know for instance

2825
01:45:16,020 --> 01:45:19,380
this person that I wrote earlier that

2826
01:45:17,939 --> 01:45:20,779
said oh well you know there are

2827
01:45:19,380 --> 01:45:23,039
phenotypes

2828
01:45:20,779 --> 01:45:24,599
you can you can counter that real fast

2829
01:45:23,039 --> 01:45:26,279
and you'll know what what is [ __ ]

2830
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:28,320
with it what is it I highly recommend

2831
01:45:26,279 --> 01:45:32,340
just just start there

2832
01:45:28,319 --> 01:45:34,799
yeah and also like the more diverse your

2833
01:45:32,340 --> 01:45:37,079
sources of information

2834
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:38,639
um the better an idea you'll get of what

2835
01:45:37,079 --> 01:45:40,859
is consistent across those different

2836
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:42,000
sources of information

2837
01:45:40,859 --> 01:45:43,380
um like going back to what Matt was

2838
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:45,359
saying about triangulate like

2839
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:47,400
triangulating something you know if you

2840
01:45:45,359 --> 01:45:49,439
read a whole bunch of texts you see some

2841
01:45:47,399 --> 01:45:52,259
of the same Concepts recur

2842
01:45:49,439 --> 01:45:54,359
that probably makes it a higher

2843
01:45:52,260 --> 01:45:56,100
likelihood that that is reliable

2844
01:45:54,359 --> 01:45:58,439
yeah and and the one other thing I'll

2845
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:59,760
add is philos is not reliable data and I

2846
01:45:58,439 --> 01:46:01,678
should have said that somewhere in the

2847
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:03,719
beginning because people are still using

2848
01:46:01,679 --> 01:46:05,399
that reliable data but please no no you

2849
01:46:03,719 --> 01:46:07,439
know what it's fine because we're going

2850
01:46:05,399 --> 01:46:08,879
to have an episode on the Codex where

2851
01:46:07,439 --> 01:46:12,000
all of this will be brought into

2852
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:13,440
question again into context because it

2853
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:15,960
is something that people use these data

2854
01:46:13,439 --> 01:46:17,879
points and I just remember like most

2855
01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:19,380
people again don't know the whole story

2856
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:22,199
behind that and how it all broke down

2857
01:46:19,380 --> 01:46:23,639
and why they closed up genetic shock

2858
01:46:22,198 --> 01:46:26,039
Etc testing

2859
01:46:23,639 --> 01:46:29,840
for the Codex episode

2860
01:46:26,039 --> 01:46:33,359
um we can talk about Leafly strain Lee

2861
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:36,079
philos seed finder we can go over all

2862
01:46:33,359 --> 01:46:36,079
those things yeah

2863
01:46:36,179 --> 01:46:42,420
yeah all right

2864
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:44,820
so uh anything else you want to get in

2865
01:46:42,420 --> 01:46:46,800
no man yeah I don't wanna yeah I don't

2866
01:46:44,819 --> 01:46:48,420
want to repeat myself again

2867
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:51,119
um you weren't reviewing something for

2868
01:46:48,420 --> 01:46:51,840
this one were you no no no reviews this

2869
01:46:51,118 --> 01:46:54,899
time

2870
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:57,119
um yeah no it was just the the Louie

2871
01:46:54,899 --> 01:46:59,158
thing I wanted to cover basically but

2872
01:46:57,118 --> 01:47:00,719
other than that you know we have uh we

2873
01:46:59,158 --> 01:47:02,579
had our new high and Lonesome drop over

2874
01:47:00,719 --> 01:47:04,260
our righteats.com into the Appalachia

2875
01:47:02,579 --> 01:47:07,439
the Green Crack BX

2876
01:47:04,260 --> 01:47:10,260
um we had Kim dog dbx and some of those

2877
01:47:07,439 --> 01:47:13,259
are going to be restocked soon uh yeah

2878
01:47:10,260 --> 01:47:15,480
uh pack have some new uh feminized Santa

2879
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:17,340
Cruz Blue Dream legitimate Blue Dream

2880
01:47:15,479 --> 01:47:19,379
crosses coming out soon I know some of

2881
01:47:17,340 --> 01:47:21,000
those are popping up on our patreon 50

2882
01:47:19,380 --> 01:47:23,219
tier

2883
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:24,658
um as far as like uh testers going out

2884
01:47:23,219 --> 01:47:26,279
there and stuff so there's all kinds of

2885
01:47:24,658 --> 01:47:28,198
fun stuff going on

2886
01:47:26,279 --> 01:47:30,899
um Pico's getting a bunch of badass new

2887
01:47:28,198 --> 01:47:34,019
modern Femme stuff in the patreon packs

2888
01:47:30,899 --> 01:47:35,399
as well so thanks to Pico pandas helped

2889
01:47:34,020 --> 01:47:37,260
out everybody's helping out with the

2890
01:47:35,399 --> 01:47:39,259
patreon packs now it's getting real

2891
01:47:37,260 --> 01:47:42,239
exciting over there in the 50 tier

2892
01:47:39,260 --> 01:47:43,920
and I think that's it just keep your

2893
01:47:42,238 --> 01:47:45,718
eyes posted for the reviews I'm going to

2894
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:47,940
be doing more of the legit or not and

2895
01:47:45,719 --> 01:47:49,679
just regular

2896
01:47:47,939 --> 01:47:51,779
um Regular flower reviews on Modern

2897
01:47:49,679 --> 01:47:53,579
strain so I can actually break down and

2898
01:47:51,779 --> 01:47:54,840
tell you what someone who's smoked weed

2899
01:47:53,579 --> 01:47:55,559
for a long time and has a lot of

2900
01:47:54,840 --> 01:47:57,960
experience with a lot of different

2901
01:47:55,560 --> 01:48:00,060
strains how I sense these strains what I

2902
01:47:57,960 --> 01:48:01,800
get from it the high the scents all that

2903
01:48:00,060 --> 01:48:04,020
stuff so hopefully that helps everyone

2904
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:06,539
out somewhere I think we actually got a

2905
01:48:04,020 --> 01:48:08,699
new idea for legit or not as well as in

2906
01:48:06,539 --> 01:48:10,920
like another form of that same series

2907
01:48:08,698 --> 01:48:13,500
could also be you reviewing seed banks

2908
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:15,480
right oh yes

2909
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:16,979
so I think that'd be fun and even if

2910
01:48:15,479 --> 01:48:18,899
it's like whether it's you're going by

2911
01:48:16,979 --> 01:48:21,059
like today we're going to do Barney's

2912
01:48:18,899 --> 01:48:23,339
Farm or the alternative being like let's

2913
01:48:21,060 --> 01:48:25,139
look at all the different chems quote

2914
01:48:23,340 --> 01:48:26,520
unquote that are being sold across these

2915
01:48:25,139 --> 01:48:28,380
different seed banks I think there are

2916
01:48:26,520 --> 01:48:31,080
lots of cool possibilities for us for

2917
01:48:28,380 --> 01:48:32,760
those episodes yeah so if you hear that

2918
01:48:31,079 --> 01:48:34,198
you like that idea leave a comment below

2919
01:48:32,760 --> 01:48:35,699
and let us know you like that idea too

2920
01:48:34,198 --> 01:48:37,319
because if I see a bunch of you like

2921
01:48:35,698 --> 01:48:38,399
that I'll get i'll get on it and see

2922
01:48:37,319 --> 01:48:40,079
what we can figure out because I think

2923
01:48:38,399 --> 01:48:42,599
it'd be very uh enlightened for some

2924
01:48:40,079 --> 01:48:45,118
people maybe hopefully

2925
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:46,739
anyway yeah righteous.com go buy her

2926
01:48:45,118 --> 01:48:49,079
spray feminized spray for making all

2927
01:48:46,738 --> 01:48:51,178
your own femini seeds at home it is easy

2928
01:48:49,079 --> 01:48:53,579
enough for you to do at home it's not

2929
01:48:51,179 --> 01:48:55,380
too hard this phrase ready-made

2930
01:48:53,579 --> 01:48:58,260
um you just mix it mixing instructions

2931
01:48:55,380 --> 01:49:02,039
come with it Shake It Up spray that's it

2932
01:48:58,260 --> 01:49:03,900
and uh for me thank you everyone here at

2933
01:49:02,039 --> 01:49:06,539
breeder Syndicate thank you and we love

2934
01:49:03,899 --> 01:49:08,939
you thousand thank you for your time

2935
01:49:06,539 --> 01:49:10,679
thank you very much

2936
01:49:08,939 --> 01:49:13,158
cheers everyone

2937
01:49:10,679 --> 01:49:13,158
second

2938
01:49:13,618 --> 01:49:17,759
