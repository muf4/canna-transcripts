1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,759
ready go

2
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:18,799
[Music]

3
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:31,140
so

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:31,140
[Music]

5
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,719
welcome to breeder syndicate

6
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,640
good evening everyone welcome to reader

7
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,320
syndicate i'm here with uh our other

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,679
host natso i don't even like calling you

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,840
a co-host because you're you're really

10
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:45,519
just the other host yeah the other host

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,719
indeed

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,120
all right

13
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,558
so today we're gonna cover um

14
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:54,959
uh cannabis breeding as it was back

15
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,718
in the dutch era mostly in pre-dutch era

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,198
and a little bit after and why it

17
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,120
matters today and why how we apply that

18
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:03,119
to what we're working with today we're

19
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:05,438
going to try to take you through like

20
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,359
some early days of breeding kind of up

21
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:10,000
to what we've already done so far which

22
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:10,959
is like the the 80s holland era and that

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,400
style

24
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,879
and then we'll move forward onto

25
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,159
different stuff later and so we we

26
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,079
thought about like

27
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,080
um i don't exactly know how much time

28
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,359
we'll spend on each specific topic but

29
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,959
we thought about like it might be

30
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:24,239
interesting to

31
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:25,519
um

32
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,280
we thought it might be interesting to

33
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:29,759
talk about how we got here as far as

34
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,799
breeding techniques yeah i see in the

35
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,239
comments

36
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,759
we have people know where we're going we

37
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:35,118
have to know where we came from i think

38
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,159
yeah exactly

39
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:39,040
so

40
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,719
um you know the the easiest way you know

41
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,479
we won't we could spend an enormous

42
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:43,920
amount of time on how cannabis moved

43
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:45,118
around places

44
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,680
um but

45
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:49,359
you know the basic premise is that for

46
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,920
most of the like what we consider to be

47
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,680
like the land race regions right when

48
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,000
people were starting to get imports into

49
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,000
america they were coming from mexico

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,399
yeah uh colombia

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
panama jamaica

52
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,079
thailand cambodia laos um

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
you know those type of places

54
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:10,639
and they were importing seeded weed

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,400
right and so how did those farmers how

56
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,479
did those farmers get to the point where

57
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,959
they were growing tons of cannabis and

58
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:18,799
exporting it to our region right

59
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,800
well basically it's at some point in the

60
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,800
past we don't need to spend a super

61
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,719
amount of time on this but

62
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,080
you know somewhere humans figured out

63
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:29,280
the thc had cool effects yeah it gets

64
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,440
[ __ ] up

65
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,919
you know by by a lot of by a lot of

66
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:35,759
people you know um you know humans

67
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:37,598
started interacting with plants and the

68
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:39,039
nature around them they started figuring

69
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:40,719
out which ones were good to eat which

70
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:42,959
ones were good for health which ones did

71
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:45,598
this which ones did that and so on a

72
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,680
certain level there was a point where

73
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:49,518
um people figured out that you know

74
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,519
marijuana that you know the wild

75
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,000
marijuana strains had some effects

76
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,039
whether it was like hand-rubbed shiraz

77
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,639
uh making hashish by rubbing buds and

78
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,318
then getting it on their hands and then

79
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:02,719
rubbing it off and smoking it or

80
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:04,719
consuming it or various aspects like

81
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,719
that people started to sort out that

82
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,800
this was a useful plan

83
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,479
right yeah and so like just every other

84
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,879
kind of useful plant from corn to

85
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:15,359
watermelons to anything else people

86
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:16,719
started messing with it to get more of

87
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,040
what they wanted

88
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:21,840
yeah right and so we what we think is is

89
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:23,199
we think as as you go from wild

90
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,439
populations

91
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:27,439
right that um

92
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:30,158
that uh started that humans started

93
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:33,120
interacting with to planted populations

94
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:35,598
of cannabis by humans

95
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,360
what we assume is the traditional method

96
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:38,479
is that people would go out into these

97
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,680
fields

98
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:43,598
and they would pick uh females that they

99
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,120
liked the smell they liked the structure

100
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,199
they liked whatever it was about it

101
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,200
maybe they liked it at increased thc

102
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,039
compared to its neighbors sure and they

103
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,719
would keep those plants

104
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,959
and then therefore next year they would

105
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:57,598
plant a bunch of seeds from their

106
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,920
favorite females yeah right and so then

107
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:02,878
over time year after year generation

108
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:05,359
after generation humans started slowly

109
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:07,039
improving their local gene pool

110
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,000
and breeding it towards things they

111
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,079
wanted

112
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,039
yeah maybe it was terps back then

113
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,840
although they obviously wouldn't have

114
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:16,000
called it that aromas effects

115
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,840
weight you know finished who knows

116
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,079
different farmers i'm sure had vastly

117
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,239
different things but you know farmers

118
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,319
back then seed collecting was part of

119
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,639
the the way they grew everything

120
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:29,759
so you picked your favorite plants they

121
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,360
were seeded and you grew that next year

122
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,360
and then over time

123
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,520
uh humans started having a massive

124
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,280
impact on what kind of

125
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:38,240
you know what kind of plants were being

126
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:40,000
grown

127
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,840
because they'd done this selection over

128
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,680
time over time over time and that pretty

129
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:46,319
much i think happened

130
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,120
um virtually everywhere

131
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:51,199
anywhere cannabis was endemic sure yeah

132
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,879
i mean it's it's kind of not well known

133
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,040
but just really quickly

134
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:57,759
they think that cannabis sort of started

135
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,600
in the highland areas around china

136
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,600
tibetan plateau

137
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,840
um you know that kind of region it went

138
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,000
down into india it went down into

139
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:08,638
pakistan and afghanistan

140
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
and about 2 700 years ago

141
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,879
we have verifiable evidence that the

142
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,439
scythians who were like central steppy

143
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:20,240
people were using it in their culture

144
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:23,759
that it was being used in the very

145
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:26,000
northern parts of afghanistan and in

146
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,439
certain parts of the caucus mountains

147
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,879
uh and then also we've they found thc

148
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:37,439
burned in temples about 60 miles south

149
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:37,439
of jerusalem about 2 700 years ago

150
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:41,839
so

151
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,519
right so there's so there's a situation

152
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:46,399
where obviously like we have we don't

153
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:47,599
know how long ago it started but

154
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:50,799
china

155
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,560
and uh tibet and the caucus mountains

156
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,720
and where israel is right now are

157
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,519
obviously pretty far far apart from each

158
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,840
other

159
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:59,758
especially from the way that people got

160
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:03,279
around at the time which was you know

161
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:05,360
camels horses donkeys etc right so so

162
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,399
smoking and consuming either hash or

163
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,038
cannabis

164
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:11,359
um is at least 3 000 years old

165
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:12,719
documented in multiple spots yeah

166
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,479
probably goes back

167
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,680
significantly farther than that we just

168
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:18,079
haven't found

169
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,038
absolute evidence that it occurred

170
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:23,839
sure um and so you know then you have

171
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:25,759
then you have a scenario in which um so

172
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:28,000
that's kind of how it start starts up in

173
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,080
tibet and china area it comes down into

174
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,319
pakistan india afghanistan it starts

175
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:36,719
going into iran and the middle east

176
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:39,680
then it goes down into uh into africa

177
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,840
right yeah um in russia it turns into

178
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,800
what becomes known as ruder alice

179
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:45,519
uh

180
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,520
and um

181
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,199
so

182
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:52,879
so then so then there's uh you know the

183
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:55,439
the weird part is the americas

184
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,719
right is how it got to america uh it

185
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:59,199
seems like

186
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,120
um although this isn't 100 verified but

187
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,800
it seems like that most of the stuff

188
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,879
that ended up in america

189
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,038
came along with the conquistadors and

190
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,879
then later the slave trade

191
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:11,199
uh it seems like a bunch of hemp hemp

192
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,240
was obviously used for most rope most

193
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,360
sales

194
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,400
i was sailors brought it with them um

195
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,598
everywhere

196
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:19,519
because it was like if you got

197
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:21,360
shipwrecked or something you might need

198
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:23,519
to grow a crop of hemp to turn it into

199
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,439
sales or rope again so you could get off

200
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:26,959
your island or wherever you were

201
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,598
um so

202
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:31,758
you know uh hemp was hemp was critical

203
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:33,360
to that era's

204
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,280
trade and so it was kind of broad

205
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,800
everywhere so it seems like

206
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:40,638
uh to brazil

207
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,319
to the caribbean to mexico when they

208
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,360
when they start talking about that kind

209
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,560
of thing

210
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,960
genetically

211
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,199
most cannabis from those regions ties

212
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:50,079
back to some kind of african

213
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,879
yeah

214
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:53,439
right

215
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,039
another weird thing and uh there's

216
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:58,160
there's not a lot of evidence to back

217
00:07:55,038 --> 00:08:00,639
this up but the strange thing is is when

218
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,400
they did genetic work on panamanian and

219
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,000
colombian

220
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:06,799
that has to

221
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,360
tie back to uh

222
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,079
um to southeast asia

223
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,000
yeah okay which is weird and so i only

224
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:15,439
have like one little tidbit on that and

225
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,360
it has nothing to do with cannabis

226
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:19,279
necessarily but obviously

227
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,919
at some point um

228
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:24,399
if that if it's true and the genetics of

229
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:26,959
panama and colombia tie back to more

230
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:28,638
southeast asia region then somehow it

231
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:31,198
had to get from there to

232
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,440
from southeast asia to the western half

233
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,200
of south america right

234
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,000
and so there's essentially two options

235
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,158
either

236
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,799
it happened once the spanish and others

237
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:42,559
started trading with the east

238
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,278
after the conquests

239
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:48,079
or there's another interesting thing

240
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:49,360
where there's pacific islanders

241
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,240
and some others that they've done

242
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,080
genetic testing on in southeast asia and

243
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,519
some of these islands where they have

244
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:00,080
discovered pre-columbian um indian

245
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,959
people's dna

246
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,200
uh in these pacific islanders from about

247
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:08,479
1100 or 1200 a.d

248
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:11,278
oh wow so we know for a fact because

249
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,879
they interbred they had babies with them

250
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:17,439
they implanted some of their dna from

251
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:20,559
pre-columbian peoples into pacific

252
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,560
islanders and so we know for a fact

253
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:25,439
that hundreds of years three four

254
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,919
hundred years perhaps before uh columbus

255
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,399
sailed and discovered and rediscovered

256
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:33,039
uh the caribbean and americas

257
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,759
um there was some kind of trade or at

258
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:38,559
least inter relationships between the

259
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:40,159
pacific islanders and the panamanian and

260
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,199
colombian peoples

261
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:43,679
um

262
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,959
if people are [ __ ] they're probably

263
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:48,559
smoking yeah and and since we know that

264
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:51,599
that hamilton

265
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:54,239
was absolutely was absolutely required

266
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,080
for sailing uh it makes sense that it

267
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,120
theoretically could have been required

268
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,519
for sailing um back then and they they

269
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,360
traded some of these pre-columbian

270
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,078
indigenous peoples that were sailing out

271
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,600
to the pacific islands um they traded

272
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:09,278
them some seeds

273
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,120
and the seeds would be necessary on both

274
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:13,039
ports if they're going both places and

275
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,879
so that's not proof we have guaranteed

276
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:16,958
proof that they were interbreeding in

277
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:18,879
1100 a.d because of the way dna and

278
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:20,639
genetics works so we know that there was

279
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:23,120
trade ongoing

280
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:25,360
um we don't know exactly when

281
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,919
but uh it does seem like colombian and

282
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,079
panamanian tie in somehow to the

283
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:33,519
southeast asia portion of the gene pool

284
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:35,120
not the african where mexican jamaican

285
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,600
the island weed

286
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,600
the stuff that's on the eastern side of

287
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,959
south america that all seems to come

288
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,560
from

289
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:44,000
african origins

290
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,399
which makes sense because there wasn't

291
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,039
just a mammoth amount of trade both

292
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:52,000
slave and otherwise coming over from all

293
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:53,278
portions of africa over to the new world

294
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,799
yeah right

295
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,078
um and so we know some of it was

296
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:58,399
introduced then

297
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:00,399
it's entirely possible that that some of

298
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,559
it was introduced earlier i mean you

299
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,958
know some of this some of this stuff is

300
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:07,119
not poorly poorly you know documents

301
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:09,439
poorly documented for lack of a better

302
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,440
term uh you know the conquistadors

303
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,440
burned most of the writings

304
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,720
of the mayans and the aztecs and the

305
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,240
other peoples because they thought they

306
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,079
were devil works so

307
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,320
most of their knowledge was sort of lost

308
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:21,439
so who knows maybe they even had it

309
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,680
written down

310
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,800
uh and we just don't know

311
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:27,278
so

312
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,958
you fast forward again and you have

313
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:30,000
these various people in these various

314
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:32,078
regions

315
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,039
that are improving their own genetic

316
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:35,278
stock

317
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:37,278
the people in thailand the people in wow

318
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:40,320
the people in mexico the people in

319
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:42,000
colombia they're growing their stock

320
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,079
they are working with what them and

321
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,759
other local farmers in their area have

322
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:47,278
access to right

323
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:48,319
and they're breeding it every year and

324
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:49,600
that's where

325
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,240
all of these

326
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,079
varietals kind of came from um obviously

327
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,278
it was all seeded weed

328
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:59,359
um you know there was uh you know and

329
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:01,360
there was two distinct cultures going on

330
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,240
too right maybe we should mention this

331
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,320
so

332
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,879
in the north indian pakistan and

333
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,399
afghanistan regions it was primarily a

334
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:09,278
hashish culture

335
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,839
so

336
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:12,799
they viewed the plant as essentially i

337
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,880
don't want to say they beat it as

338
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:17,359
garbage but they viewed it as as a way

339
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:19,519
to get a hold of the trichomes

340
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,120
yeah whether they did hand rub like i

341
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,278
was talking about or whether they did

342
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,560
dry sift or whatever method they used to

343
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:26,799
extract it

344
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:29,599
uh they thought that the proper use of

345
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:32,639
cannabis was to turn it into hash

346
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:36,159
yeah um you know and so but then you go

347
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:38,480
to lao or cambodia or thailand or mexico

348
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:40,958
or colombia these kind of places

349
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,839
they smoked flour

350
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:45,119
so you had some groups breeding for

351
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,959
specific

352
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,120
basically hash plants

353
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:53,199
right and then you had some groups

354
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,078
breeding for smokable flower yeah

355
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,519
right

356
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:56,479
and those were the kind of those were

357
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,320
the kind of

358
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,839
selections that people were making back

359
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,920
then right

360
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,560
and then you know uh

361
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:07,199
obviously like america is founded on

362
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:09,199
capitalistic principles right and so if

363
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,639
there's a demand somewhere and there's a

364
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,320
supply somewhere else adam smith says

365
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,039
that the invisible hand should come

366
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:20,959
along and get the supply from where it

367
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:22,958
is to where the demand is right so you

368
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:24,719
have all these regions that we've talked

369
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:26,479
about have been probably improving their

370
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,160
crops year to year they're saving their

371
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,920
best seed like they do with their food

372
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:32,159
crops they're slowly improving their

373
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:34,000
genetic lines but there's really not a

374
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:36,240
lot of interaction between them and

375
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,480
other groups they're kind of growing

376
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,560
what's available in their area

377
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,399
except except for the one thing we we

378
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,958
had talked about i believe it's

379
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,120
referenced in rob clark's hashish book

380
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:49,278
except in afghanistan where they were

381
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,078
importing they had learned the trade of

382
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:54,720
uh of of hand rubbing and hash

383
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:56,239
collecting via the root from india so

384
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,759
most of the stuff during that time they

385
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,919
were importing indian uh uh more sativa

386
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:03,838
type narrow leaf varieties to

387
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:05,278
afghanistan because that's what the

388
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,519
indians were using to make their hash

389
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:09,600
and they weren't using their afghanis in

390
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,198
their fields yet they they weren't using

391
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,800
those to

392
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:14,000
get the trichomes collect and make the

393
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:15,439
hash they were actually using indian

394
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,078
sativas during that time and it wasn't

395
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,560
until more modern uh

396
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:22,719
the past 1950 when they started using

397
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:24,319
collecting their own varieties so maybe

398
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,399
a better way to more accurate way to

399
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,839
state it would just say that like we

400
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,559
can't discount that there was some

401
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,720
regional trading going on sure right

402
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:34,399
between say you know india pakistan

403
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,079
afghanistan they're all connected to one

404
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,839
another you can kind of go back and

405
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:39,759
forth

406
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,440
there could be panamanian and colombian

407
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:43,278
going back and forth there could be some

408
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,000
caribbean exchanges

409
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:47,759
but in general there wasn't caribbean

410
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,240
trading with thailand

411
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:52,399
yeah with afghanistan there wasn't like

412
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,039
different regions of the world

413
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,958
the regions themselves mixed a bit you

414
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:58,480
know it's obviously not written down so

415
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:00,958
it's really hard to determine with any

416
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,920
kind of factual basis how it exactly

417
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,078
occurred

418
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:06,958
um but you have all these

419
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:08,078
over all hundreds of years by the time

420
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:11,198
that like

421
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:13,439
america gets involved you have all these

422
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:15,039
uh weed cultures

423
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,120
that have developed around the world

424
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:19,679
some of them are hash cultures some of

425
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,600
them are smokable flower cultures so

426
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:24,319
obviously they made different decisions

427
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,800
on their strains based on

428
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,480
uh you know whether they wanted to smoke

429
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:31,679
flower or whether they wanted to to

430
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,839
create a hash plant sure um and

431
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,278
you know prohibition was was fully going

432
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,399
on in america

433
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:39,278
and

434
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,799
um you know invisible hand comes in and

435
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:42,559
there's a bunch of people in america

436
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:45,599
that want to smoke pot

437
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:46,799
musicians jazz artists

438
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,519
hippies

439
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:51,519
uh counterculture beatnecks

440
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,959
various various types of people get

441
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,959
introduced to it

442
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:56,479
most likely mota

443
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:58,000
uh probably most people's first

444
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,759
experiences with it were probably

445
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,679
mexican

446
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,199
coming into the country

447
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:05,758
there was a lot of you know back and

448
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:07,599
flow over the border uh with mexican

449
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,519
like you know farmworking and stuff like

450
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,000
that they probably brought it with them

451
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,799
there's definitely records of of famous

452
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,440
jazz people smoking in the 20s and 30s

453
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:18,719
looking at jazz cabbage yeah you know i

454
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,000
mean obviously it was it was a big

455
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,399
enough issue

456
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,360
that uh they decided to do some crazy

457
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,240
prohibition in the late 1930s

458
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,360
um

459
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,639
up till that point and uh so

460
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,800
so then you have a situation where you

461
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,320
start hitting like what matters to most

462
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:36,240
people i think

463
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,639
uh with with this way that we've kind of

464
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,639
brought ourselves to here is that

465
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,278
various entrepreneurs

466
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,159
decided to start sourcing

467
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:47,439
weed

468
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:49,278
from various countries that grew weed

469
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,079
and figure out a way to get it into

470
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:53,519
america and sell it for a high dollar to

471
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:55,758
american people

472
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,399
and the difference in profit between

473
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:01,360
buying it from a thai farmer

474
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,639
to selling it to a guy that lives in

475
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,640
venice beach

476
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,038
was extremely high

477
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,439
so there was a lot of economic incentive

478
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:12,160
for these people to start figuring out

479
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,160
ways to smuggle it into the country and

480
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,199
and feed the demand

481
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,319
right yes

482
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,439
and so

483
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:20,959
uh sadly uh one thing that was so we

484
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,160
start getting imports right we start

485
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,679
getting

486
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,199
we start getting imports and we start

487
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,360
getting things from

488
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,679
uh panama people start smuggling from

489
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,439
panama and colombia people certainly

490
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,559
start smuggling from jamaica and other

491
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,600
caribbean

492
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:36,160
islands

493
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:36,159
mexico

494
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,320
hawaii

495
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:42,240
um you know asia there's some pretty

496
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:45,119
famous smugglers that were working in

497
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,519
thailand and cambodia and lao

498
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:49,599
in the 60s and they start you know all

499
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:52,160
the famous stuff you've heard about uh

500
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:53,599
colombian gold panama red

501
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,600
thai sticks

502
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:57,199
every every um

503
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:58,480
i'm sure matt can think of some others

504
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,440
there's a bunch of them

505
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,360
uh

506
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,240
jamaican lambs bread

mexican um you know mexican stuff was

510
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:12,639
generally named by region you had

511
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:15,599
mitchell khan you had oaxacan you had

512
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,960
this you had aaron yeah you had various

513
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:18,798
things and that's kind of like those

514
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,240
were the first names

515
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:23,200
that you would get

516
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,960
um you know the very first names of weed

517
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,960
was like where it's from

518
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:31,279
and maybe some nickname like maybe

519
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,759
maybe they dried colombian gold

520
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:35,599
into a brownish gold color

521
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:37,839
and then there was panamanian red and it

522
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:39,279
had red hair or there was this and you

523
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:41,839
know they wrapped they wrapped in

524
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:44,319
thailand they wrapped the loose buds

525
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:46,240
around sticks to make it like a more

526
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:48,558
these go from like a super leafy

527
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,319
hermaphroditic loose flowers and they'd

528
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:52,558
pack them tight to make it into

529
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:54,720
something and you get thai stick and so

530
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:56,720
all the original names they're not

531
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,319
really strained names they're like this

532
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,319
is where it's from

533
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,480
and this is its nickname that we gave to

534
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:05,200
it from where it's from possibly a color

535
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,839
or smell or some other attribute yeah

536
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,880
yeah you know or a rhyme

537
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:13,119
yeah right maui wowie yeah exactly they

538
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,080
guaranteed picked it because it rhymed

539
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:17,279
yep that was that's the reason right

540
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:18,639
and so

541
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:20,960
you know um

542
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,400
and so that's when so that's when like

543
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,200
the the breeding that everybody is

544
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,679
familiar with kind of starts

545
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,640
yeah right you've got all this seated

546
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,160
weed

547
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,960
coming into

548
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:36,720
america from all these regions i named

549
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:39,200
southeast asia the caribbean uh mexico

550
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,919
america you know south america that type

551
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,840
of thing and as you know i mean for the

552
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,759
younger cats out there

553
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:49,119
you know i used to sit there with my

554
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:51,519
head down and a tray at an angle and you

555
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:53,038
would break your weed up here

556
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:56,000
right and then that allowed all the

557
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:57,599
seeds to roll down the tray and collect

558
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,599
at the bottom lip of the tray as you

559
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:01,119
broke up all your herb

560
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:03,439
right and then you'd have a bunch of

561
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:05,199
fluffed up herb for a bowl or a bong or

562
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,640
rolling a joint or something along those

563
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,558
lines right

564
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:12,559
um and so everybody got free seeds

565
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:13,359
right free seeds we weren't really too

566
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:14,879
much

567
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:16,719
we weren't really too much of a hash

568
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,240
culture and that's part of the reason

569
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:22,480
why and then also hash is his trichomes

570
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,359
separated from the flower and the such

571
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,200
so

572
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:27,839
everything that was coming into america

573
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,880
at first was various kinds of sativas

574
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:31,199
yes

575
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,640
because the sativas were the butts

576
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,279
you know yeah and if you were getting

577
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,679
imported afghan of afghani

578
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:39,119
indica hash you were getting blocks of

579
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,720
hash yeah

580
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:42,558
you weren't getting afghan blood like

581
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,880
that important yeah it didn't come with

582
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:47,200
free seats yeah yeah there was no

583
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,159
receipts no there was sometimes the

584
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,240
random seed in the brick hatch

585
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,960
the random bud i mean there's a famous

586
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:58,079
actually uh there's some serious debate

587
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,720
in europe over uh over there's two camps

588
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:03,038
basically on the on the white widow camp

589
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,319
there's uh you know uh just so and the

590
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:07,200
only reason why i bring that up is

591
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:08,960
because there's a guy over there ingemar

592
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,880
uh and one of the one of the stories

593
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,720
about how white widow happened is like

594
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,760
the founding part of white widow is he

595
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,600
was breaking up a block of imported hash

596
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:21,519
and some seeds fell out

597
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:23,918
yeah and he got an original afghan from

598
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:27,200
some region out of that block of seeds

599
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:29,038
yeah so it was rare um

600
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,720
you know there was some hash being

601
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:33,279
imported into america

602
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,720
but like i said you know it uh it didn't

603
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:36,960
come with free seats

604
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,360
yeah where um there was no seedless in

605
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,600
any of these other regions so all the

606
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:42,798
sativas that we were importing came with

607
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:45,599
receipt

608
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:47,119
yes and that free seed is the start of

609
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:48,480
every famous breeder you've ever heard

610
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:50,319
of journey

611
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,038
yes for the most for the most yeah it

612
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:54,319
really is yeah it is so people start

613
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:57,359
smoking weed

614
00:21:54,319 --> 00:22:00,158
right people start liking the weed

615
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:01,759
and then some people have get the idea

616
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,760
i have these seeds

617
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:05,599
i wonder what would happen if i started

618
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:07,919
growing my own weed

619
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:09,279
right and then there's places some of

620
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,240
them are pretty famous the emerald

621
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:12,319
triangle

622
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,839
trinity county humboldt county mendocino

623
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:17,439
county where i live

624
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:20,639
um the central coast san francisco uh

625
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:23,120
santa cruz area of bakersfield yeah of

626
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,919
california yes legendarily

627
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:27,439
you know basically anywhere where it was

628
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,880
mountainous

629
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,120
remote

630
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,440
people weren't gonna find it

631
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:35,038
and the climate was cool i'm not saying

632
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,480
people weren't doing it in other parts

633
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:37,279
of the country because of course they

634
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,960
were

635
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:40,960
um but

636
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,319
uh you know wherever people could start

637
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,558
to get away with it with their with

638
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:46,879
their imports they start growing it yeah

639
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:48,480
and mecca's were built and mecca's will

640
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,840
build and then the only reason why i

641
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,599
brought up those regions is because

642
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:53,439
enough people in those regions all

643
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:55,038
decided to start doing

644
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,240
then it started the beginnings of

645
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:57,839
american

646
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,759
growing culture

647
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:02,158
sure right if you're growing in upstate

648
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:03,759
new york or oklahoma or florida or some

649
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,120
[ __ ] um

650
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:06,079
you're probably trying to keep it pretty

651
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:08,158
small

652
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:09,839
yeah you know there was definitely some

653
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,840
stuff with hippies in santa cruz and

654
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:14,000
mendocino county and central coast and

655
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:16,079
different areas that um they were a

656
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,359
little bit more open with each other

657
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:19,519
uh and so there was a little bit more

658
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:21,839
trading going on and a little bit more

659
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:23,519
of a culture started to develop where in

660
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:25,839
some of the other more harsh police

661
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:27,599
state regions of the united states

662
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:29,599
that were a lot more populated it was a

663
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:33,199
lot more secretive and you know circles

664
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:35,439
were even smaller right sure so

665
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,600
you know people start growing seed

666
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,038
probably with varying success

667
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:42,079
and

668
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:44,000
they start discovering stuff

669
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:46,158
right they start discovering that when

670
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,960
you grow thai and you go colombian

671
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:51,600
boy is it hard to finish in america yeah

672
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,319
very you know the stuff wants to go till

673
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:55,359
december january our weather doesn't go

674
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:56,158
that long

675
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:58,079
um

676
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,760
people start having issues

677
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:01,359
with getting you know because if you

678
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:02,839
could grow weed from the seed then you

679
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:04,158
could get free weed

680
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:06,079
yeah and you wouldn't have to be buying

681
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,679
it what does this pre-weed look like

682
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:09,278
when it hasn't been compressed and

683
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:12,960
bailed and shipped

684
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:14,240
from you know international locations

685
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,200
what would it be like if you got it

686
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,480
fresh

687
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,519
so yeah the initial success for people

688
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,599
was

689
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:23,839
um you know people people could get the

690
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:26,000
mexicans to finish

691
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:27,599
because the mexicans typically were

692
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,079
farther away from the equator and they

693
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:31,599
were a little shorter right and they had

694
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:34,158
significant struggles getting the

695
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:35,839
colombian and the panama and the

696
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,600
ties and the different stuff like that

697
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:39,599
to finish right yeah

698
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:41,678
so this this this is where people start

699
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:44,480
to get the idea of like i got some thai

700
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:47,038
stick or i got some colombian gold and i

701
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,880
got some oaxacan right

702
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:51,359
and what happens if i grow them up when

703
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,360
i cross them

704
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:55,439
yeah that's that's basically the start

705
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:58,000
of american breeding that's the that's

706
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,679
the the honest to god that's the start

707
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,119
of how everybody in america started

708
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,400
breeding things right

709
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:05,359
and i'm not going to say america is

710
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,360
unique but it is rare in the sense that

711
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:08,479
america is the plate or one of the

712
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:10,240
places

713
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,200
where for the first time in hundreds of

714
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,759
years

715
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,600
people started crossing these wildly

716
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:18,000
different gene pools

717
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:19,678
from these different regions together

718
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,839
yes

719
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,278
right um i think i think the way you put

720
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:25,359
it the other night and i wrote it down

721
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:26,880
because it was it was worded very well

722
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:28,558
whoever and wherever the weed was

723
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,320
becoming imported the most that's where

724
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:31,200
the weed was blended together the first

725
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:32,079
time

726
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,960
right

727
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:37,519
and that's that's well put that and so

728
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,319
you know um and so there's

729
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:41,200
so

730
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:43,038
so yeah so basically um

731
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,720
you know there's uh you know there's

732
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:45,919
some pretty famous stuff that started

733
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,278
happening then

734
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,799
uh people started getting these

735
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:50,640
different these different things they

736
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:53,519
started breeding them together

737
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:56,880
um they started experimenting with stuff

738
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:58,960
um in the san francisco bay area and in

739
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:02,400
santa cruz and stuff like what became

740
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:04,880
known as hayes started which according

741
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,798
to sam and others was essentially

742
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,159
colombian by colombian

743
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:09,839
um

744
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,360
you know and uh but you needed a

745
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:13,119
greenhouse

746
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:14,639
you needed you they figured with some of

747
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:17,038
these some of these land races you

748
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,759
needed to grow it in a mild climate

749
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:21,359
which the central coast and uh the bay

750
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:23,278
area definitely had

751
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:25,199
and you needed you needed some way to

752
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:27,519
protect it from the weather and give it

753
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,679
maybe some heat or some whatever and and

754
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:32,558
and finish it right

755
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,919
so they start crossing things yeah one

756
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:36,240
of the famous people that started

757
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,200
crossing things is a guy named rob clark

758
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,159
right yes

759
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,080
uh rob has some very famous stuff that

760
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,520
he did he started crossing colombians

761
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:45,759
and mexicans

762
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:48,079
uh because mexicans finished quite

763
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:50,240
faster and so he was trying to get the

764
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:52,480
qualities of the two and get something

765
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,519
that would finish in california yeah

766
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,640
right

767
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:56,639
and so

768
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,559
they start breeding obviously sam skunk

769
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,080
man is breeding obviously there's other

770
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:02,480
various people that are popping and

771
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:04,879
doing all kinds of stuff a lot of the

772
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,720
the oldest and most legendary names that

773
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,480
we know yes

774
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,798
are from this era

775
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,200
sure they're from this like pioneer

776
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:14,558
take some thai take some cambodian cross

777
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,480
them together cross it with some

778
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:17,759
colombian cross it with some mexican

779
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,519
cross it with some this cross some

780
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:21,200
jamaican buy this

781
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:22,158
you know trade some seeds with your

782
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,080
friend

783
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,799
um and

784
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:28,319
you know uh so that's kind of like the

785
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:31,440
start of

786
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:34,398
like uh cannabis growing in america

787
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:38,240
yes on any kind of scale and

788
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:40,558
so even when i started in the early 90s

789
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,159
um i still have them some over there

790
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:43,119
there's i got like three books that i

791
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,159
bought

792
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:48,398
uh knowledge was extremely limited there

793
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,640
was no internet there was no forums

794
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:53,119
there was no foreign

795
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,640
no and so and so even for me in the 90s

796
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:57,839
think about how difficult it must have

797
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,919
been um for the people in the 70s that

798
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:01,519
had even less knowledge oh i'm sure

799
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,880
right because one of the things i'll

800
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:05,200
hold it up right now one of the things

801
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,720
that taught me breeding

802
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,159
was this

803
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,798
the bible

804
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:13,120
this is the bible uh rob clark

805
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:15,918
took his experience with growing a bunch

806
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:17,439
of weed and breeding a bunch of weed and

807
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:20,799
he figured out

808
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,159
how marijuana grows how it breeds how it

809
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:24,079
triggers

810
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,480
all the different traits the different

811
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:28,079
traits and he wrote this

812
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,038
i mean matt's right he wrote sort of a

813
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:32,079
bible

814
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:34,480
yeah right he wrote a basic bible so

815
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:35,759
when i started out i was able to buy

816
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,399
this bible

817
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:40,158
when i got interested in weed and i was

818
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:41,359
able to read this book over and over and

819
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,559
over again

820
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:45,599
and it taught me a ton about how to grow

821
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:46,398
cannabis

822
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,719
yeah

823
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:50,079
i'm sure matt had the same experience

824
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,839
most readers

825
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:55,278
most breeders that get curious about

826
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:56,879
breeding um you've read rob clark's book

827
00:28:55,278 --> 00:28:58,640
yeah if you're a seed maker and you

828
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,039
actually are passionate and want to

829
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,960
learn and and make things better you

830
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:04,879
almost everyone eventually runs into rob

831
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,240
clark's work and eventually i think with

832
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,840
the breeder syndicate thing one of the

833
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:12,720
plans is to do for patreon a course

834
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:15,439
based on uh cannabis evolution and

835
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,200
ethnobotany uh rob clark gave us his

836
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,960
permission to use that for a course so i

837
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,558
thought that would be pretty cool to do

838
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,319
yeah and so he i mean i don't need to go

839
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:24,798
through all of it but he started talking

840
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:27,359
about the differences in latitude

841
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:29,278
and you know finish times and the

842
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:31,439
differences in the various kinds of

843
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:32,398
cannabis and regions and what to expect

844
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,120
from them

845
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:37,278
how to make seed how to make seed mature

846
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:39,519
like really like and so you know he

847
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:42,798
deserves an enormous amount of credit

848
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:45,038
sure uh because i'm sure there was an

849
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:47,278
enormous amount of [ __ ] ups

850
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:50,240
yeah in order to learn breeding when

851
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:52,079
breeding is 90 fuck-ups there was uh

852
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,159
there was a there was a you know they

853
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:56,079
had to learn all that and they had to

854
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,799
they had to put that down into some kind

855
00:29:56,079 --> 00:30:01,839
of information base and i'm sure his

856
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:03,119
journey to learn was significantly

857
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:04,798
harder

858
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:07,519
uh than the people that came after him

859
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:09,200
i'm sure because there was no

860
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:11,119
books for him to buy

861
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,600
exactly right i mean i don't think there

862
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:15,599
was any cannabis books in the 60s and

863
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:18,240
you know there was

864
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:20,240
not breeding i mean in the 70s it sort

865
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,200
of exploded a little bit

866
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,399
um steve murphy uh who we've talked

867
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,038
about

868
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:29,278
murphy stevens it was his pen name but

869
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:33,119
you know the gentleman that gave the

870
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:35,599
afghani seeds to uh seattle uh greg

871
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:38,879
which he used to create what we know as

872
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:41,678
northern lights uh he wrote some i think

873
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:45,840
like by 74

874
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:47,840
73 74 ish he had some books out uh mel

875
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:50,319
frank and ed rosenthal

876
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:53,359
started contributing some stuff uh there

877
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:55,759
was uh uh since mella tips

878
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:56,558
um there was high times

879
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:58,558
uh

880
00:30:56,558 --> 00:30:59,918
there was various other magazines

881
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:01,918
there's all kinds yeah there was all

882
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:04,080
kinds of things so people started

883
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:06,159
70s is where all of a sudden there

884
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:08,319
starts to be like um

885
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:11,200
information coming out that people can

886
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:12,798
access and they don't have to like learn

887
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,558
from scratch

888
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:17,359
or what their neighbor knows or what

889
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:19,038
their buddy that got them into it knows

890
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:22,719
yeah right

891
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:25,679
and uh and so and so you know rob uh rob

892
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,600
did things like rob crossed colombian

893
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:30,080
and mexican

894
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:30,959
right robin and sam skunk man are

895
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:33,599
friends

896
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,319
you know skunk one is

897
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:39,119
afghan by colombian mexican

898
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:41,519
yeah you know they start blending things

899
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:43,199
um longer things with shorter things

900
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:45,278
they start playing they start looking to

901
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,278
see can i get the traits of this mexican

902
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:49,359
with the traits of this colombian

903
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:51,200
can i get this tie to stop herming and

904
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:53,519
not take seven months

905
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:56,399
yeah i uh can i this

906
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:58,558
structure to the tie the blood structure

907
00:31:56,398 --> 00:32:01,918
all that type of stuff and so

908
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:02,798
you know and then um so people so people

909
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,159
start

910
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:06,558
um

911
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,640
uh crossing these things right

912
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:10,480
and so maybe this is a good time

913
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,240
so that that's what's really happening

914
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,599
in the i don't know exactly when it

915
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,599
started happening in the 60s um but it

916
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:19,759
definitely was happening in the 60s to

917
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:20,959
some degree it accelerated greatly in

918
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:23,119
the 70s

919
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,120
one second i'm just going to chime in um

920
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:26,639
greg actually said i studied luther

921
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:28,319
burbank and then bought all of rob's

922
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:31,200
books burbank worked with cannabis in

923
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:33,678
california yeah so there you go even

924
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,720
even somebody like greg who's i consider

925
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:39,679
to be a very early pioneer oh yeah doing

926
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,120
a lot of stuff uh rob's work helped him

927
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,278
you know um

928
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:45,839
and so that's kind of and that's that's

929
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:48,079
also a theme that i'd like to say uh you

930
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:49,759
know right now is that and this remains

931
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:52,240
true no matter what episode we're gonna

932
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:53,278
chat about is that every single breeder

933
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,679
out there

934
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:57,200
stands on the shoulders of the people

935
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:59,440
that came before them

936
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,679
whether it's whether it's the seeds and

937
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,720
the genetics they have access to whether

938
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:07,360
it's the forums or books or knowledge

939
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,759
from older cats there was a wave of

940
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:11,839
pioneers that really figured it out and

941
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:14,240
then every generation after that every

942
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:17,119
group after that they got to take

943
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,720
their work in genetics and improve it or

944
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:20,959
mess it up you know it was the case

945
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,240
maybe depending on your opinion right

946
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,919
yeah but they also got a bunch of

947
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,480
knowledge by the time a lot of you guys

948
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:28,960
on this that are listening got into it

949
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,880
there was probably forums you could go

950
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,960
there with breeding forums i mean you go

951
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,039
on the breeding forum of overgrow and

952
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,200
there's sam skunk man and camara and

953
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:40,319
people that have a lot of knowledge you

954
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,399
start reading that um and you know the

955
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:44,000
internet books started putting the

956
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:47,038
knowledge out there in a way for people

957
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,558
to really access which really sped up

958
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:52,558
the time it took you know um

959
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:53,519
you know on a i mean on a previous

960
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:55,599
interview

961
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,679
uh that you know greg's on this when

962
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:59,839
when uh matt interviewed greg i mean

963
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:02,159
greg spoke about you know they got some

964
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:04,959
afghan beans uh that were extremely

965
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:07,440
limited from uh steve murphy and they

966
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,358
crossed them to themselves and then they

967
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,559
basically crossed them with every sativa

968
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:15,679
they knew of yeah hawaiians colombians

969
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:18,078
thais you know lots of mexicans lots of

970
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,918
mexicans lots of this lots of that they

971
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,919
were just everybody was just playing

972
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:24,239
around with and that's the other part

973
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:26,319
that people need to know right is that

974
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:27,678
nobody knew what an afghan by mexican

975
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,240
would look like

976
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:32,240
yeah it hadn't happened not yet they

977
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:33,678
knew what colombian by mexican would

978
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:36,158
look like because that hadn't happened

979
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:38,320
either so a lot of these pioneers

980
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,000
they're taking you know rob's like i

981
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,919
wonder if i took colombian and mexican

982
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,320
and crossed it what does that look like

983
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:46,719
yeah you know and then maybe later on

984
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,879
when skunk one is born sam is like hey i

985
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:51,358
got access to some afghans

986
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:53,519
let's cross this afghan into your skunk

987
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:55,759
into your you know your colombian

988
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:58,480
mexican maybe that'll shorten it up even

989
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,320
earlier and it'll be done in october

990
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,639
and this and i think this is a good

991
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,920
segue into talking about how breeding

992
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:07,759
for uh just to see what happens um

993
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,760
turned into breeding for traits as they

994
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,200
learn these traits as they as they saw

995
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,880
you know this one's purple this one

996
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:15,039
smells like watermelon this one smells

997
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,519
like cereal they started learning well

998
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:19,358
if we combine these traits you know

999
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:21,199
let's let's see if we can get this trait

1000
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:22,480
to pop out if we cross this and this and

1001
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:24,719
they started

1002
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,119
going and actually having a purpose for

1003
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:28,480
breeding uh with cannabis and finding

1004
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,480
out that there were these traits that

1005
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,599
they could follow long flowering short

1006
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,599
flowering colors smell taste high all of

1007
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,440
it and it went from seeing what can

1008
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:40,400
happen to a real

1009
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,559
purpose a real purpose yes and so i

1010
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,720
think probably the two traits

1011
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:45,679
in the beginning that people were after

1012
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:47,519
was

1013
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:49,118
i like the way this weed tastes and

1014
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:51,119
smokes

1015
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:53,200
it won't finish where i live

1016
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,280
yeah how do i get it to finish

1017
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:58,319
where i live because a lot of this stuff

1018
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:00,240
like panamanian uh colombian the

1019
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,880
southeast asian stuff is all very near

1020
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:04,799
the equator it takes a long time uh

1021
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,599
america is not particularly near the

1022
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:10,000
equator um you know so they had to

1023
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:12,480
figure out how do i blend stuff to get

1024
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,920
the stuff i like and be able to grow it

1025
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,639
in my region

1026
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,760
yeah

1027
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:18,159
right and obviously there's a big

1028
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,240
financial incentive in that too

1029
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:21,358
right because you don't have to import

1030
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:23,679
it it doesn't have to come through

1031
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:24,960
customs and that's kind of where green

1032
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:28,639
bud was born

1033
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:30,079
yes right uh you know the way that most

1034
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:31,759
of these traditional cultures they

1035
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:33,920
didn't have air-conditioned dry rooms or

1036
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,760
anything like that a lot of them dried

1037
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,960
hanging in the woods a lot of them dried

1038
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,480
in the sun

1039
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,838
a lot of them dried it and then

1040
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,320
key load it

1041
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:46,639
right and then it begins to ferment

1042
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,720
and it gets wrapped up in plastic for

1043
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:51,039
weeks or months and then shipped for

1044
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:53,439
some period of time you know if you were

1045
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:55,039
lucky maybe you got some green mexican

1046
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,400
that was only lightly compressed that

1047
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:59,519
they figured out some way to get it

1048
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,440
across the border without smooshing it

1049
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:03,599
into a block that you could cut with a

1050
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,159
knife uh yeah you can actually like

1051
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:09,280
break it up into actual buds instead of

1052
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:10,559
it just being like a flat mass

1053
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,400
um

1054
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:14,239
you know and so that's where you know

1055
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:17,280
greg steve murphy was breeding in the

1056
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:19,279
70s uh greg and his whole pacific

1057
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,240
northwest crew

1058
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:24,800
the you know most people in california

1059
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:27,039
were breeding either outdoor or in

1060
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,119
greenhouses yes

1061
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:30,800
uh the indoor wave was still and maybe

1062
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:34,000
this is a good segue

1063
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:36,720
um for a second i printed out this thing

1064
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,760
and uh you can't really see it so i'm

1065
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:39,838
just going to read it because it's

1066
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,640
really really dark

1067
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:44,000
this is a this is a seed catalog

1068
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:47,358
um

1069
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,639
you know uh from 1981 it's tied into sam

1070
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:52,639
and his crew

1071
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:55,199
we assume um but it lists uh strains in

1072
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:57,598
order of of when they matured october

1073
00:37:55,199 --> 00:38:00,239
november and december and it lists like

1074
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:02,559
what so it gives you a snapshot of what

1075
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:05,358
people were actually working with right

1076
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:06,400
yeah and uh so i'll read it to you in

1077
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:09,920
october

1078
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:13,280
you had afghani one afghani two afghani

1079
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,920
two purple skunk one skunk two

1080
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:18,640
yep that's all they list five things

1081
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,960
before that finish before halloween yeah

1082
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:23,039
the faster finishing right then you have

1083
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:27,119
november right

1084
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:28,400
nepali malawi nepali afghani malawi

1085
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,800
nepali

1086
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:33,200
early haze by afghani

1087
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,400
yeah and those are done hopefully by

1088
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:36,639
thanksgiving

1089
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,838
yep and then here comes the mother lode

1090
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:40,799
of everything

1091
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:43,039
and i'll say on this list it says all

1092
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,760
the above can be grown outside in most

1093
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:48,400
years in the sf bay area and that's the

1094
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,320
october and the november stuff right and

1095
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,680
then below it it says

1096
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,400
all below

1097
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:56,319
require a greenhouse to finish in the

1098
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,320
san francisco bay area

1099
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:02,240
yeah and now you've got south indian one

1100
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:05,760
two three original haze 1-4 burning bush

1101
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:08,879
nepali haze haze nepali nepali hay south

1102

burning bush by south hayes

1106
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:22,000
uh by south indian haze and then you

1107
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:23,440
even have one category matures in

1108
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,079
january

1109
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:28,720
extra late new year's haze

1110
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:30,720
yeah i bet

1111
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:31,519
maybe when people are listening to that

1112
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:34,559
right

1113
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:35,838
yeah and uh you're uh you're realizing

1114
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:37,838
that oh my god everything that they're

1115
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:39,519
mentioning other than afghani and skunk

1116
00:39:37,838 --> 00:39:41,358
i've never had

1117
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:44,239
yeah i don't have i don't i don't i

1118
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:46,639
don't malawi and nepali and

1119
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:47,759
haze thai nepali and this and that and

1120
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:49,039
everything else

1121
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,960
um

1122
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:52,480
there's a bunch of um

1123
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,960
there's a bunch of stuff like that so

1124
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,800
that gives you like a snapshot of like

1125
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,639
these are what the breeders back then

1126
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,920
were crossing to each other

1127
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:01,920
yeah

1128
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,880
right which is super different

1129
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,519
okay

1130
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,358
and so you know um

1131
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:08,960
maybe we can mention this even though it

1132
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:11,279
kind of like it fits in but it kind of

1133
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,519
doesn't but the reason why we're talking

1134
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,000
about all this stuff is that basically

1135
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:18,079
like every 10 years in my opinion

1136
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,039
cannabis reinvents itself

1137
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:23,440
yes and absolutely and what was common

1138
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:25,358
becomes uncommon or rare

1139
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,000
yeah and then you go 20 years from that

1140
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:30,480
point and what becomes uncommon or rare

1141
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,358
becomes like impossible

1142
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,119
yeah

1143
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:35,358
you know uh

1144
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:38,318
matt and i were recently looking at

1145
00:40:35,358 --> 00:40:39,598
somebody's freezer collection that they

1146
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:41,279
had been gifted

1147
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,800
it was a big collection it was super

1148
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,760
impressive it was really exciting to

1149
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:47,760
look through and most of it was from 08

1150
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,079
to 2012.

1151
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:51,760
yeah and i was selecting heavily during

1152
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,359
that time and that so that was matt's

1153
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,440
kind of era when he was really

1154
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:58,000
collecting a ton and stuff and

1155
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:02,000
and it's amazing that it's it's only 10

1156
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,440
to 13 14 years later and 98 of that

1157
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,119
stuff that's on the list you couldn't

1158
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,639
buy today if you wanted to

1159
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:08,160
yeah and you'd be lucky to find a

1160
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:10,400
reproduction if you were lucky you'd be

1161
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:12,000
lucky to find a reproduction you know

1162
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,280
and there's some famous people on there

1163
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,079
like you know a bunch of stuff that

1164
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,000
people found fire og rascal work

1165
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,800
he had tons of awesome [ __ ] back then

1166
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,639
too and nowadays like i i even still

1167
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,079
look out for like white oracle and white

1168
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:25,920
master and a few things when i see them

1169
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:27,440
in lists but they're they're not common

1170
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,400
and he was selling tons of those packs

1171
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,240
back then

1172
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,160
you know he was killing it still

1173
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:35,838
probably is so all this stuff that we're

1174
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:38,078
talking about right is that you know um

1175
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:40,318
what's common in this in the 60s and 70s

1176
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:42,480
becomes uncommon common in the 80s

1177
00:41:40,318 --> 00:41:45,599
almost unheard of in the 90s

1178
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:48,159
a unicorn by by today and that just

1179
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:49,440
keeps happening right every every 10 or

1180
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:51,279
15 years

1181
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,480
uh what you used to be able to get easy

1182
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,800
access to

1183
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,880
becomes super hard to find right sure

1184
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,560
but then every generation those 10 or 15

1185
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,640
years they're building

1186
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:03,039
on certain things like i mentioned that

1187
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:06,078
list there's a series of afghanis that

1188
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:08,079
made it over to neville and sssc there's

1189
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:09,680
this there's hazes there's skunks

1190
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,800
there's different things that happened

1191
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:13,759
in that

1192
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,839
in that era that survived sure right but

1193
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,119
most of the stuff on that list you've

1194
00:42:15,838 --> 00:42:19,599
never smoked

1195
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:21,680
yeah i've never smoked yeah you know

1196
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:23,119
i've never smoked burning bush by nepali

1197
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:25,519
myself

1198
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:27,440
bush is i don't i've never seen it i've

1199
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:29,759
heard it was maybe a vegetable i've

1200
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:32,079
heard i've heard it was a pre-pre to

1201
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,560
haze you know it was an early

1202
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:37,119
you know but but you know these names

1203
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:38,960
south indian stuff like that um you know

1204
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:41,119
they they just didn't they just that but

1205
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:42,000
that's what they were growing

1206
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:43,680
so

1207
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,400
all these guys what that shows you is

1208
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:48,000
that all these guys um

1209
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,119
all these guys were basically breeding

1210
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,800
sativas

1211
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:52,559
yeah

1212
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,920
right that's the majority of that list

1213
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:58,159
was some sativas there's a couple

1214
00:42:53,920 --> 00:43:00,880
afghanis even skunk one was 75 sativa

1215
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:02,879
yeah it was a blend of mexican colombian

1216
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,039
and a little bit of afghan

1217
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,920
so it was still even heavily influenced

1218
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:06,880
right

1219
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,318
um

1220
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,720
and so

1221
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:12,960
sam skunk man became very famous in that

1222
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:16,639
era that's where you know he he says he

1223
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,880
started breeding his skunk one in 1975.

1224
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:21,279
um you know he bred it for eight or ten

1225
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:23,358
years before he brought it to uh

1226
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,640
california brought it from california to

1227
00:43:23,358 --> 00:43:27,759
amsterdam

1228
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:30,318
uh mel frank was working with an afghan

1229
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,880
that got named afghani one that he got

1230
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:34,960
from another bay area breeder uh who had

1231
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,119
gotten some afghani seeds

1232
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,599
um he got some durban poison that he was

1233
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:42,160
working in the 70s they were breeding

1234
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:43,680
some other stuff like that rob clark was

1235
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:46,239
obviously busy

1236
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:48,480
um in uh you know seattle greg's neck of

1237
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:50,879
the woods they had somehow come across

1238
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,599
some afghan and they were also blending

1239
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,800
in

1240
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:54,960
um

1241
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,720
so you know all the various sativas that

1242
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,720
people had then

1243
00:43:56,719 --> 00:44:00,559
in hawaii you know people call stuff

1244
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:05,279
hawaiian but there obviously is no

1245
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:07,199
hawaiian yeah uh 98 of the species uh on

1246
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:09,119
hawaii are not native

1247
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:12,159
um because it's an island in the middle

1248
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:13,920
of nowhere uh that created by a volcano

1249
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:15,679
yeah but people started bringing

1250
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,440
colombian it's very tropical people

1251
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:19,358
started bringing thai and colombian and

1252
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,079
afghans and mexicans there and blending

1253
00:44:19,358 --> 00:44:21,920
them

1254
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:23,920
and growing them on the islands and then

1255
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,720
they became known as hawaiian

1256
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,159
yep

1257
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:29,039
you know even though there are there's

1258
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:30,639
no hawaiian genetics there's a blending

1259
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:34,519
of sativas

1260
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:34,519

this week so we might as well chat at

1288
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:50,559
that so fast forward a bit people are

1289
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:54,079
doing all this stuff in the 70s

1290
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:55,199
and um you know in the uh in the late

1291
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:57,039
70s

1292
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:59,118
uh things were really blowing up people

1293
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:01,279
were doing all kinds of stuff together

1294
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:02,640
um and very in these various regions i

1295
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:03,920
was talking about it was really

1296
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:06,799
advancing

1297
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:09,519
uh then carter loses the election

1298
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:12,400
reagan gets uh reagan gets involved

1299
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:15,039
and the war on drugs gets ramped up

1300
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,800
and the world goes to [ __ ] for from the

1301
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:17,519
from where it had been the penalties are

1302
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,519
yeah

1303
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:23,039
they start putting more money into it

1304
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:24,639
and uh they start flying

1305
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:27,039
they start taking helicopters and they

1306
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:29,679
start flying in hawaii they start flying

1307
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:31,440
in mendocino county they start flying in

1308
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:32,480
the central valley and some of this

1309
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,519
stuff right

1310
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,440
and so

1311
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:37,358
what that does is that all of a sudden

1312
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,639
all these guys are growing all this weed

1313
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:39,838
and they're growing in the mountain

1314
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:41,759
regions and they're growing it in

1315
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:43,119
valleys and stuff like that

1316
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,359
and they're not too concerned because

1317
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:47,519
nobody's looking for them and then also

1318
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:49,679
there's a helicopter flying overhead

1319
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:51,519
sure and they got a big field that

1320
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:52,799
nobody's ever bothered with before and

1321
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:53,759
they get in trouble

1322
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,800
right

1323
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,760
so pressure starts happening right

1324
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,519
so

1325
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,520
you know they start hunting it

1326
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:02,719
uh people start getting in trouble

1327
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:04,960
and then

1328
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:07,439
this is when so we mentioned before

1329
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,800
steve murphy's book um and stuff like

1330
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,318
that but

1331
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,318
people were on the what's called the

1332
00:47:10,318 --> 00:47:14,239
hippie hashish trail

1333
00:47:12,318 --> 00:47:15,759
where people were traveling to nepal

1334
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:17,118
people were traveling to india people

1335
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,040
were traveling to the hindu kush

1336
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:21,039
mountains they were meeting up with

1337
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:23,519
tribal you know people and stuff like

1338
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:26,480
that and so there was some small amount

1339
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:29,280
of afghan seeds and indicas that started

1340
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:31,760
making its way into america yeah mostly

1341
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,839
only to breeder circles certainly not to

1342
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,280
consumers the way every bag of every

1343
00:47:33,838 --> 00:47:36,880
sack of weed you bought had a bunch of

1344
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,880
seeds in it for free

1345
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,838
but they started trickling in smuggling

1346
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,960
style

1347
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:45,599
to trinity humboldt mendocino to the bay

1348
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:48,159
area to various other places

1349
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:52,160
um you know in in steve murphy's book

1350
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:53,199
you see some broadleaf afghans in 74. uh

1351
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:56,639
obviously

1352
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:59,199
uh you know uh you know seattle greg uh

1353
00:47:56,639 --> 00:48:01,679
was working with some of this stuff

1354
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:03,838
um and so the the big advantage in the

1355
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:05,440
beginning to people was that you start

1356
00:48:03,838 --> 00:48:07,279
crossing these afghans into some of

1357
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,880
these sativas and now maybe you're

1358
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,519
getting stuff that's finishing you know

1359
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:14,240
the more heavy afghan you select you're

1360
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:16,559
finishing in september or october

1361
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:17,838
sure and one second i just want to make

1362
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:19,680
sure everybody's really paying close

1363
00:48:17,838 --> 00:48:21,759
attention to this part because i found

1364
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:24,960
one of the biggest uh myths in cannabis

1365
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:27,119
is that afghanis existed in our culture

1366
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:29,199
you know in just as long as sativas and

1367
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:31,358
as long as we've been smoking or

1368
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:33,679
narrow leafs you know people didn't know

1369
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:34,880
that afghanis came as a late entry so

1370
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:37,759
when you see a lot of these people

1371
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:40,240
making claims about 60s afghanis and 50s

1372
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,680
afghanis it's very easy to discount with

1373
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:42,558
history

1374
00:48:41,679 --> 00:48:43,759
so

1375
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:46,400
while

1376
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:48,319
seed of sativas like we said before

1377
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,119
we're getting imported by the literal

1378
00:48:48,318 --> 00:48:50,880
ton

1379
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:53,280
with every bag of weed you bought you

1380
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:55,519
got uh seeds of seeds

1381
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,200
and the the indica stuff was being

1382
00:48:55,519 --> 00:48:58,719
brought back by smugglers and what i

1383
00:48:57,199 --> 00:48:59,838
would imagine would be relatively small

1384
00:48:58,719 --> 00:49:02,879
amounts

1385
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:04,639
uh you know in his interview uh you know

1386
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,400
greg told you that he got a whopping

1387
00:49:04,639 --> 00:49:09,279
four afghan seeds

1388
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:11,680
yeah whopping a whopping four you know

1389
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:13,359
um and the biggest problem that you know

1390
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:15,279
you grow in afghanistan and you and you

1391
00:49:13,358 --> 00:49:16,558
grow in the hindu kush mountains it's

1392
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:19,280
obviously colder there and it's

1393
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:20,559
extremely dry so people start growing in

1394
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,079
america

1395
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:25,119
and they rot

1396
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:27,119
yeah the sativas were grown in tropical

1397
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:29,838
much more humid regions they had a lot

1398
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:31,280
of genetic resistance to rot and so a

1399
00:49:29,838 --> 00:49:32,880
lot of the things that people were

1400
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,559
trying to figure out is

1401
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,480
they can grow these afghans and they're

1402
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:39,119
like oh my god it's an amazing beautiful

1403
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,960
frosty crazy looking weed yeah and it's

1404
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:42,880
not done and you get some weather and

1405
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,480
all of a sudden it rots them and it has

1406
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,400
a totally different high than a lot of

1407
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:48,880
people are used to yeah people go from

1408
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:52,079
an up energetic kind of zippy high

1409
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:54,720
somewhat psychedelic lack of this that

1410
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:57,920
indicas come with much more couch lock

1411
00:49:54,719 --> 00:50:00,000
much more heaviness much more limitation

1412
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,838
so a lot of the early smokers

1413
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,318
didn't like indica

1414
00:50:01,838 --> 00:50:06,558
yeah it clashed so hard with what they

1415
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:08,880
were used to as buds

1416
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:11,359
yeah and the effect they weren't super

1417
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:13,440
into it but from a growers perspective

1418
00:50:11,358 --> 00:50:16,000
since i read all that stuff

1419
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:18,720
you know going from november december

1420
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,318
harvest to september october harvest

1421
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:21,919
when you have police pressure becomes

1422
00:50:20,318 --> 00:50:23,279
extremely important

1423
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,440
yeah

1424
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,559
right

1425
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,800
and so

1426
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:31,519
you know i maybe we should talk very

1427
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:34,720
briefly um because it's a pretty simple

1428
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:36,880
subject but when i moved to mendo in the

1429
00:50:34,719 --> 00:50:38,399
late 90s people still mostly grew from

1430
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:39,838
seed outside

1431
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,318
and the traditional way that you grew

1432
00:50:39,838 --> 00:50:45,119
from seed was that you would grow some

1433
00:50:42,318 --> 00:50:47,279
seed you would pick your males you would

1434
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:49,440
take your males to like a kind of a

1435
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,359
darker part of your hill somewhere and

1436
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,599
you would stash them

1437
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:56,558
away from your females you would grow

1438
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:59,039
your females in some patches right

1439
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:01,680
and then you'd collect pollen and you'd

1440
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:03,920
go take this pollen from all your males

1441
00:51:01,679 --> 00:51:06,239
and you'd brush it on some of the lower

1442
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,358
branches of your favorite females from

1443
00:51:06,239 --> 00:51:10,159
that year

1444
00:51:07,358 --> 00:51:12,159
yeah and i believe that's how the vast

1445
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:14,239
majority of breeding occurred even when

1446
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:17,358
you look at like rob clark's book he

1447
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:19,919
talks about like putting like a a paper

1448
00:51:17,358 --> 00:51:22,558
bag paper bag the paper bag with a with

1449
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:24,880
a tie over specific branches and putting

1450
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:27,440
one on the bag you know even talks about

1451
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:29,200
like gluing a strip of clear plastic so

1452
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,318
that it gets some sun on it while it's

1453
00:51:29,199 --> 00:51:31,679
doing this

1454
00:51:30,318 --> 00:51:34,318
yeah

1455
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:37,199
all that type of stuff and so most most

1456
00:51:34,318 --> 00:51:38,880
70s breeding in america was

1457
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:40,879
pollinating the bottoms of stuff you

1458
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,920
were intending on selling

1459
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,920
yeah

1460
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,960
and then keeping it

1461
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:47,039
yeah right

1462
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:49,039
and then you know with the police

1463
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:50,880
pressure and stuff like that that's

1464
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:52,000
really where modern modern breeding

1465
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,400
starts

1466
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,920
yeah okay so

1467
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,720
um

1468
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:01,440
70s breeding not exclusively but

1469
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:02,799
essentially was the vast majority was

1470
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:05,039
seasonally

1471
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:07,599
they would pollinate their best females

1472
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:09,199
with males they had kept somewhere else

1473
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:11,200
yeah right

1474
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:13,598
with the advent of indoor lights and the

1475
00:52:11,199 --> 00:52:14,318
advent of hydroponics stores and people

1476
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:16,800
like

1477
00:52:14,318 --> 00:52:19,519
uh and growing in the pacific northwest

1478
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,880
like we've talked about multiple times

1479
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:22,480
people started to do some of this

1480
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:25,039
breeding inside

1481
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:26,639
yeah they started doing it away from the

1482
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:30,480
helicopters

1483
00:52:26,639 --> 00:52:33,199
away from away from the lights away from

1484
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:36,400
the ability to get caught and it also it

1485
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:38,239
also enabled um people to do more than

1486
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,519
one breeding a year

1487
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:41,598
yeah yeah

1488
00:52:39,519 --> 00:52:43,679
i mean back a lot today

1489
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:45,280
back in the day you got like you got one

1490
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:47,838
shot

1491
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,839
right yeah that that's that's what you

1492
00:52:47,838 --> 00:52:51,519
got you all of a sudden you go indoor

1493
00:52:49,838 --> 00:52:53,759
and now as you know you can get four or

1494
00:52:51,519 --> 00:52:55,599
five shots if you want

1495
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,920
yeah you know right

1496
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:59,280
and so that's when that's when you know

1497
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:01,280
prohibition

1498
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:03,359
really forced people to start going

1499
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:05,200
inside

1500
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:08,880
and going inside

1501
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:10,159
is obviously how 99 of modern breeding

1502
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,318
occurs

1503
00:53:10,159 --> 00:53:13,920
yeah i would say

1504
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:16,239
you know there's not i mean there are

1505
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:18,800
some people that still breed outdoor

1506
00:53:16,239 --> 00:53:21,279
and i would say most people breed

1507
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:23,680
outdoor in modern times because it's

1508
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,880
much more cheap to make seeds that way i

1509
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:26,000
think the ones that take it very

1510
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:28,240
seriously and are doing actual

1511
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,719
selections do it indoors but generally

1512
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:32,719
speaking must do it outdoor you know

1513
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:34,959
maybe i should rephrase it most of the

1514
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:37,519
seeds that you guys have access to that

1515
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,720
you can buy currently were probably made

1516
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:41,199
indoor

1517
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:42,799
no you know you don't think so no not at

1518
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:44,480
all

1519
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:48,160
it's all done outdoor and greenhouse

1520
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:49,039
yeah 99 of it 99 of it

1521
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:50,318
yeah

1522
00:53:49,039 --> 00:53:51,679
yeah even today

1523
00:53:50,318 --> 00:53:53,679
even today most of the seeds that people

1524
00:53:51,679 --> 00:53:54,799
buy are going to be coming from

1525
00:53:53,679 --> 00:53:57,118
places

1526
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,318
see big seed banks from the uk maybe

1527
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,318
stuff like that

1528
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:03,679
so i the way i was looking at it is most

1529
00:54:00,318 --> 00:54:05,838
of the most of the small and and

1530
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:08,159
most of the hype breeders that people

1531
00:54:05,838 --> 00:54:09,440
are actually buying a bunch of packs of

1532
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:11,679
these days

1533
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:13,599
they're you know um they're mostly doing

1534
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:14,558
they were mostly doing it in indoor

1535
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:16,160
scenes

1536
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:17,440
um some of them were doing it in

1537
00:54:16,159 --> 00:54:19,440
greenhouses

1538
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:21,519
um certainly he's correct in the sense

1539
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:23,599
that like if i'm only talking about what

1540
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:25,440
most people have access to obviously

1541
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:27,519
when it comes to like all the mexican

1542
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,119
and all the traditional stuff and some

1543
00:54:27,519 --> 00:54:31,920
of the stuff that's going on in europe

1544
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:34,000
at a larger scale uh where legality is

1545
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:36,318
different like switzerland or spain

1546
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,079
they're still probably using greenhouses

1547
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:39,358
that's like 95 percent of the market

1548
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:41,680
though

1549
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:44,639
for america i think yeah

1550
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:47,118
oh yeah no no american american boutique

1551
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:48,719
breeding is still small market um

1552
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:50,318
and even then a lot of these guys are

1553
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:52,719
doing it outdoors making the seats

1554
00:54:50,318 --> 00:54:54,639
outdoors and crazy crazy places that you

1555
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:57,039
can never imagine you can never imagine

1556
00:54:54,639 --> 00:54:58,558
so small small greenhouses

1557
00:54:57,039 --> 00:55:00,159
tucked away

1558
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:04,720
make the most amount of seeds and and

1559
00:55:00,159 --> 00:55:04,719
that's i think for during the uh

1560
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:11,039
early to late

1561
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:12,639
up to 2008 2009 a lot of the boutique

1562
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:15,519
breeders were all doing it indoors

1563
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:15,519
indoors yes

1564
00:55:15,838 --> 00:55:20,880
that was a poorly phrased way to say

1565
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:23,358
sure that from the 80s 90s and the first

1566
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,480
10 years the 2000s for about a 30 year

1567
00:55:23,358 --> 00:55:26,318
period

1568
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:28,798
prohibition had a lot of breeding

1569
00:55:26,318 --> 00:55:31,279
happening indoors exactly a lot of your

1570
00:55:28,798 --> 00:55:33,838
famous strains that you know of uh

1571
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,798
whether they were from sssc or from

1572
00:55:33,838 --> 00:55:38,078
neville

1573
00:55:34,798 --> 00:55:40,159
or from smaller breeders in america

1574
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:43,280
all the northern lights work all that

1575
00:55:40,159 --> 00:55:45,440
type of stuff the prohibition was heavy

1576
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:48,559
the legality was still not spread out

1577
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:51,679
very much and so for three decades

1578
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:53,040
um the vast majority of of breeding that

1579
00:55:51,679 --> 00:55:56,078
we're aware of

1580
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:58,400
uh did did happen inside yeah and now

1581
00:55:56,079 --> 00:56:00,640
it's opened up again uh you know in

1582
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:02,318
various ways in the last you know 10 or

1583
00:56:00,639 --> 00:56:04,318
15 years and it's beginning to shift

1584
00:56:02,318 --> 00:56:05,920
yeah it took legalities changing in the

1585
00:56:04,318 --> 00:56:07,599
u.s though really i think that's what

1586
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,680
changed it when people were able to grow

1587
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:11,599
outdoor and not get popped for it they

1588
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:13,279
realized that the amount of seed you can

1589
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:16,079
make outdoor versus indoors is

1590
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:18,240
monumental but pollen pollen control is

1591
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:21,119
totally a different subject control is

1592
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:23,118
hard um not and now and pollen viability

1593
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:25,280
is hard too i mean i know people that

1594
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:26,160
have tried to throw off huge greenhouse

1595
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:28,720
runs

1596
00:56:26,159 --> 00:56:31,598
and their greenhouse is too moist and

1597
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:33,118
pollen doesn't like heat light or water

1598
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:35,280
and i've seen a bunch of people have a

1599
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:37,280
bunch of failure uh because they weren't

1600
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:39,200
able to control their humidity

1601
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:41,760
uh in their greenhouse and they think

1602
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:44,159
i'm gonna make 15 million seeds

1603
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:46,240
and they make 80 000

1604
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:48,239
yeah which is still a lot but it's a far

1605
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:50,159
cry from 15 million because they lost

1606
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:51,039
control of their humidity

1607
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:51,838
so

1608
00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:53,440
um

1609
00:56:51,838 --> 00:56:56,798
you know part of the

1610
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:58,480
so this is kind of taking us up to like

1611
00:56:56,798 --> 00:57:00,639
people are getting busted

1612
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:03,358
everything bad things are happening and

1613
00:57:00,639 --> 00:57:05,118
a lot of these american breeders okay

1614
00:57:03,358 --> 00:57:07,279
and this is what segways into what we've

1615
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:09,838
done the last few shows a bunch of these

1616
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:11,920
american breeders start fleeing

1617
00:57:09,838 --> 00:57:14,159
where it's hot and uncomfortable which

1618
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:16,798
is reagan america

1619
00:57:14,159 --> 00:57:18,639
to where it's more comfortable which is

1620
00:57:16,798 --> 00:57:21,358
europe holland

1621
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:23,199
right rob yeah and ends up in hop going

1622
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:24,960
into holland sam

1623
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:26,798
uh jim what all these guys are bringing

1624
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:30,240
that's why neville and all these groups

1625
00:57:26,798 --> 00:57:31,920
got access to it uh was not because that

1626
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:33,838
all these guys wanted to share it was

1627
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:36,159
because they were seeking a new place to

1628
00:57:33,838 --> 00:57:38,838
continue doing what they were doing

1629
00:57:36,159 --> 00:57:41,679
yeah it got real pop it got real

1630
00:57:38,838 --> 00:57:43,920
problematic in the early in the early to

1631
00:57:41,679 --> 00:57:46,719
mid 80s late 80s

1632
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:48,400
um i mean you know uh to bring up

1633
00:57:46,719 --> 00:57:49,439
seattle greg again he you know he

1634
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,960
mentioned on

1635
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,358
when you interviewed him that by the

1636
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:55,599
late 80s a rolling series of busts had

1637
00:57:53,358 --> 00:57:57,358
pretty much taken out his whole crew

1638
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:58,480
yeah all the work that they had done had

1639
00:57:57,358 --> 00:58:00,798
been lost

1640
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:02,400
yeah to them you know luckily he shared

1641
00:58:00,798 --> 00:58:03,280
it with people in holland

1642
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:06,720
um

1643
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:08,640
you know sam skunkman and rob and mel

1644
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:10,318
and ed and

1645
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:12,400
these different names that shared things

1646
00:58:10,318 --> 00:58:14,159
with groups they did so because it was

1647
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:16,160
getting uncomfortably hot to do it where

1648
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:17,039
they lived

1649
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:18,798
right

1650
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:20,400
and they were trying to they were trying

1651
00:58:18,798 --> 00:58:22,798
to figure out where to do it and so that

1652
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,240
kind of segues us into

1653
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:26,079
what we what we talked about which is

1654
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:28,558
kind of where we were at of

1655
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:31,599
this is how breeding got

1656
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:34,720
and then with sssc and with neville and

1657
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:37,599
with other groups and that whole era

1658
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:39,759
not only because holland has you know um

1659
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:42,240
not the greatest weather uh but also for

1660
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:43,520
clandestine reasons and simplicity and

1661
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:46,159
everything like that

1662
00:58:43,519 --> 00:58:48,639
most of the breeding in the 80s and 90s

1663
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:50,960
at least by the mid 80s uh through the

1664
00:58:48,639 --> 00:58:51,759
90s uh was indoor

1665
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,920
yes

1666
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:56,640
you know the famous strains uh you know

1667
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:59,280
sour diesel was made inside a lot of the

1668
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:01,920
famous pops that happened uh that came

1669
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:03,359
about 90s weed was coming from indoor

1670
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,480
right that was where people could get

1671
00:59:03,358 --> 00:59:06,558
away with it

1672
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:08,960
um people were able to grow in the 60s

1673
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:10,480
and 70s for a while freely and then the

1674
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:12,240
cops found out what they were doing and

1675
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,760
they started looking for it and it

1676
00:59:12,239 --> 00:59:15,118
became much more difficult to get away

1677
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,400
with it

1678
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:18,160
and uh

1679
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,680
and so then people responded to that

1680
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:21,279
police pressure

1681
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:22,639
by hiding it

1682
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:24,720
yep

1683
00:59:22,639 --> 00:59:27,039
and then we went from sort of like

1684
00:59:24,719 --> 00:59:29,039
yearly breeding outside and in

1685
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:30,880
greenhouses to

1686
00:59:29,039 --> 00:59:32,159
much more cracks at the same thing you

1687
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:35,039
could breed you could set up different

1688
00:59:32,159 --> 00:59:36,719
rooms it's probably very unlikely that

1689
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:38,480
somebody like neville or somebody like

1690
00:59:36,719 --> 00:59:40,159
the super sativa seed club group would

1691
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,440
have been able to offer as many strains

1692
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:44,480
as they did

1693
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:46,159
oh yeah without individual rooms yeah

1694
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,838
the amount you know matt and i were

1695
00:59:46,159 --> 00:59:49,118
joking about the amount of pollen

1696
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:51,838
contamination

1697
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:53,119
that could have been possible back then

1698
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:54,639
yeah you know but certainly if you were

1699
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:56,318
trying to do it outside in greenhouse

1700
00:59:54,639 --> 00:59:58,558
you're limited to one

1701
00:59:56,318 --> 01:00:00,239
you know one set of pollen

1702
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:01,599
yeah otherwise it's just going to be

1703
01:00:00,239 --> 01:00:03,358
you're just going to have pollen grains

1704
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:04,880
flying around and who now knows what is

1705
01:00:03,358 --> 01:00:06,798
happening playing who's your daddy with

1706
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:09,039
seeds like a lot of these guys do now

1707
01:00:06,798 --> 01:00:11,119
yeah right you know so indoor gardening

1708
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:11,920
also allowed people to

1709
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:13,039
uh

1710
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:14,798
you know

1711
01:00:13,039 --> 01:00:16,558
it allowed people to do multiple

1712
01:00:14,798 --> 01:00:20,318
different lines you could offer skunk

1713
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:23,040
one and durbin and nl5 haze and nl5

1714
01:00:20,318 --> 01:00:24,480
skunk one and you could have

1715
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:26,400
you know i don't exactly know the size

1716
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:27,519
of these people's rooms but

1717
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,760
it's probably not that much different

1718
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:32,480
than it was today some bedrooms

1719
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:34,880
yeah closets some garages

1720
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:35,679
you know some converted spaces

1721
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:37,440
yeah

1722
01:00:35,679 --> 01:00:39,199
and that's kind of like

1723
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:41,119
that kind of like brings us from like

1724
01:00:39,199 --> 01:00:43,598
where we were

1725
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:44,880
importing you know uh indigenous

1726
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:47,280
people's weed

1727
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:49,358
uh to like how people first bred in the

1728
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:50,798
70s to how it changed and police

1729
01:00:49,358 --> 01:00:52,159
pressure kind of led us to like where

1730
01:00:50,798 --> 01:00:54,559
we're at today

1731
01:00:52,159 --> 01:00:56,719
yep um you know that's kind of that's

1732
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:58,720
that's kind of the arc and that kind of

1733
01:00:56,719 --> 01:01:00,719
leads us right into what we talked about

1734
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:02,798
at length the last two episodes of how

1735
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:03,759
neville was doing all his work

1736
01:01:02,798 --> 01:01:05,519
yeah

1737
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:07,920
they were uh

1738
01:01:05,519 --> 01:01:08,798
you know they moved it inside

1739
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:11,119
you know

1740
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:12,719
so i don't know maybe we can pause since

1741
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:14,240
we're how long in now an hour and 10

1742
01:01:12,719 --> 01:01:15,039
minutes hour and 20 yeah

1743
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:17,358
yeah

1744
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:18,880
maybe we can pause and we can start i

1745
01:01:17,358 --> 01:01:20,078
don't know can you see questions because

1746
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:23,039
you're yeah i can see questions this

1747
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:25,440
time yeah so maybe we should uh maybe we

1748
01:01:23,039 --> 01:01:27,599
should start an order on the votes

1749
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,720
aspect yep

1750
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:30,720
all right

1751
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:33,039
there you go uh what are each of your

1752
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:34,719
guys daily driver strains right now and

1753
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:36,239
what do you like about the strains to

1754
01:01:34,719 --> 01:01:39,358
use them every day

1755
01:01:36,239 --> 01:01:40,959
go ahead uh what's your what's your

1756
01:01:39,358 --> 01:01:42,639
normal daily driver like uh not

1757
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:44,318
necessarily today but your normal one

1758
01:01:42,639 --> 01:01:46,798
that you you would grab if you had it

1759
01:01:44,318 --> 01:01:49,039
every time so i like you know i think

1760
01:01:46,798 --> 01:01:52,559
it's pretty obvious to people i like

1761
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:54,719
uh sour diesels and chems and headbands

1762
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:56,960
um you know i like strains that have a

1763
01:01:54,719 --> 01:01:58,879
potent and unique high

1764
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:00,880
and i also like strains that i can smoke

1765
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:02,318
every day and they get me high yeah

1766
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:04,240
there's a lot of strains out there that

1767
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:06,318
get you pretty high the first number of

1768
01:02:04,239 --> 01:02:07,838
days you smoke them and then you kind of

1769
01:02:06,318 --> 01:02:09,038
plateau on them

1770
01:02:07,838 --> 01:02:10,159
and they don't take you to where you

1771
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:12,640
need to be

1772
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:14,639
yeah on a daily basis so i like strains

1773
01:02:12,639 --> 01:02:16,480
that have lasting power and the ability

1774
01:02:14,639 --> 01:02:17,920
to like get me high the way i like every

1775
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:21,199
day

1776
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:23,280
and there is no i mean the chem 91 makes

1777
01:02:21,199 --> 01:02:26,078
me feel like i'm a stone teenager about

1778
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:28,640
to watch a comedy eating popcorn and

1779
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:29,760
make them it's a warm fuzzy comforting

1780
01:02:28,639 --> 01:02:33,199
buzz

1781
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:36,480
you know uh nl5 hazes can make me feel

1782
01:02:33,199 --> 01:02:38,719
up energetic maybe a little paranoid

1783
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:40,240
um you know different types of things to

1784
01:02:38,719 --> 01:02:41,679
be honest there are certain things that

1785
01:02:40,239 --> 01:02:44,479
are quite famous

1786
01:02:41,679 --> 01:02:46,558
that i find have a boring high

1787
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:49,358
you know so um

1788
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:52,720
chems headbands sour diesels

1789
01:02:49,358 --> 01:02:54,480
uh you know sativas that type of thing

1790
01:02:52,719 --> 01:02:56,719
uh you know it depends on my mood

1791
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:58,960
obviously i don't want to smoke uh you

1792
01:02:56,719 --> 01:03:01,439
know a high-end sativa like dog [ __ ]

1793
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:03,358
like at 11 30 at night right before bed

1794
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:05,119
because i might like set my mind off

1795
01:03:03,358 --> 01:03:05,920
until 1am

1796
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:06,960
but

1797
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:08,880
uh yeah

1798
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:10,880
chems headbands diesels that's what i

1799
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:13,680
like what do you like matt

1800
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:16,559
um i'm pretty uh obvious with mine like

1801
01:03:13,679 --> 01:03:18,798
i'm a blueberry thing and i like the

1802
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:21,519
different ties they seemed

1803
01:03:18,798 --> 01:03:23,358
afghanis were most afghanis

1804
01:03:21,519 --> 01:03:26,239
it's generally speaking broadly if

1805
01:03:23,358 --> 01:03:28,078
afghanistan to relax people and and you

1806
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:30,000
know ease them in that [ __ ] me up that

1807
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:31,599
[ __ ] makes me stay in my head it's like

1808
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,838
living in your [ __ ] head and hating

1809
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:35,680
life so i tend to like the ties they're

1810
01:03:33,838 --> 01:03:37,599
really light i like lighter highs so if

1811
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:39,919
i have to punch someone i can still i

1812
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:42,079
don't like to be disabled you know so

1813
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:43,920
that's typically what i like

1814
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:45,039
and one point that we should make is

1815
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,400
that uh

1816
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:47,680
you know we have some really good

1817
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:49,680
friends where some of my favorite

1818
01:03:47,679 --> 01:03:51,279
strains they dislike they don't dislike

1819
01:03:49,679 --> 01:03:52,960
them they breed with them but they don't

1820
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:54,400
think they're high very much

1821
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:55,760
and so there is

1822
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:58,000
you know everybody thinks what happens

1823
01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:00,640
to me is normal

1824
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,159
but with weed it's not normal people can

1825
01:04:00,639 --> 01:04:03,199
have different effects i know people you

1826
01:04:02,159 --> 01:04:04,558
know there might be people that have a

1827
01:04:03,199 --> 01:04:07,358
little add

1828
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:10,160
that they smoke a racy sativa and they

1829
01:04:07,358 --> 01:04:12,000
feel calm and relaxed and mellow

1830
01:04:10,159 --> 01:04:13,358
where they smoke an afghan and it makes

1831
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,639
them want to jump out of their skin and

1832
01:04:13,358 --> 01:04:16,318
climb up a wall

1833
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:17,598
yeah where an afghan for me makes me

1834
01:04:16,318 --> 01:04:19,759
want to like lean back and eat some

1835
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:21,599
popcorn and mellow out and laugh

1836
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:23,280
yeah an afghan makes me want it like

1837
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:26,400
would make me like think about chopping

1838
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:29,599
down my grow you know like paranoia yeah

1839
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:32,160
so so it's kind of it is very individual

1840
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:33,760
it's it doesn't affect people the same

1841
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:34,719
the next question is what in your

1842
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:36,640
opinion

1843
01:04:34,719 --> 01:04:37,919
was the most prominent strain to come

1844
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:41,358
out of holland

1845
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:43,838
in the 90s other than kim nl hayes and

1846
01:04:41,358 --> 01:04:46,078
skunk

1847
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:46,078
boy

1848
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,720
boy

1849
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:54,159
well

1850
01:04:50,719 --> 01:04:55,519
i mean was a big one for me one of my

1851
01:04:54,159 --> 01:04:58,558
one that i was really interested in was

1852
01:04:55,519 --> 01:05:01,519
purple star and that was a uh a dutch

1853
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:03,519
purple afghani of some sort

1854
01:05:01,519 --> 01:05:05,119
um you know this is kind of cheating

1855
01:05:03,519 --> 01:05:06,079
because i kind of think it's like modern

1856
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:08,640
skunk

1857
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:10,720
but certainly in the 90s uh you know

1858
01:05:08,639 --> 01:05:13,679
sour diesel in america

1859
01:05:10,719 --> 01:05:15,519
um became you know it's it's a it's

1860
01:05:13,679 --> 01:05:17,440
possibly a blend of chem and skunks so

1861
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:18,798
maybe that's not the same but it is it

1862
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:20,639
is different it's not either one of

1863
01:05:18,798 --> 01:05:22,559
those things that's its own thing and it

1864
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:25,440
became one of the most popular strains

1865
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:28,000
in america during that time frame

1866
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:30,480
um you know it's hard because when you

1867
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,920
say nl haze and skunk

1868
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:34,079
there's a lot of things that have at

1869
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:36,639
least one of those components in them

1870
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:38,000
yeah you know very hard not to name one

1871
01:05:36,639 --> 01:05:41,038
yeah it's very hard not to name

1872
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,880
something that doesn't happen

1873
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:44,640
uh you know but but if you're gonna name

1874
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:48,318
some of that stuff you could probably

1875
01:05:44,639 --> 01:05:49,679
throw in uh the white family that came

1876
01:05:48,318 --> 01:05:50,960
out of holland you know i mean in the

1877
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:53,440
mid 90s

1878
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:56,400
the white widow the great white shark

1879
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:58,798
the white russian uh that whole line it

1880
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:00,160
doesn't have any nl haze or skunk that

1881
01:05:58,798 --> 01:06:01,440
we're aware of

1882
01:06:00,159 --> 01:06:02,798
yeah

1883
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:04,960
you know it was completely it was

1884
01:06:02,798 --> 01:06:06,798
different genetics uh it was extremely

1885
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:08,880
popular it was all over high times it

1886
01:06:06,798 --> 01:06:11,519
was winning cups yeah it was getting

1887
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:13,200
blended into all kinds of stuff

1888
01:06:11,519 --> 01:06:15,440
when i first started growing white widow

1889
01:06:13,199 --> 01:06:16,558
and white rhino were the ones you know

1890
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:19,440
like that's what people were talking

1891
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:21,680
about yeah um you know another thing is

1892
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:23,679
uh this this kind of i think this angers

1893
01:06:21,679 --> 01:06:26,719
dj but um

1894
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:30,000
you know dj gave uh dj gave tony from

1895
01:06:26,719 --> 01:06:32,399
sag martha a bunch of blueberry lines

1896
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,559
and sag martha started selling blueberry

1897
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:37,039
and probably for most people that was

1898
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:39,680
their first ability to actually purchase

1899
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:41,359
those lines yeah um he didn't you know

1900
01:06:39,679 --> 01:06:43,440
if he was giving it to friends or people

1901
01:06:41,358 --> 01:06:44,239
in his small network it certainly wasn't

1902
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,798
as

1903
01:06:44,239 --> 01:06:49,279
prevalent as giving it to sag martha

1904
01:06:46,798 --> 01:06:51,199
yeah and later later on in the 90s after

1905
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:52,640
he had soured on sag martha i believe

1906
01:06:51,199 --> 01:06:53,519
dutch passion

1907
01:06:52,639 --> 01:06:56,159
uh

1908
01:06:53,519 --> 01:06:58,480
took over some of his blueberry work and

1909
01:06:56,159 --> 01:07:00,399
stuff like that and so

1910
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:03,199
whether or not he is appreciative of

1911
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:06,720
that or not certainly sag martha and

1912
01:07:03,199 --> 01:07:10,000
dutch passion and their breadth of sales

1913
01:07:06,719 --> 01:07:12,000
put blueberry and those lines on the map

1914
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,480
they did it gave people access to them

1915
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,079
it gave people the ability to buy them

1916
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:18,719
you know it made them it made him

1917
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:20,400
essentially forum famous when cannabis

1918
01:07:18,719 --> 01:07:21,838
world and overgrow were happening

1919
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:24,559
because all of a sudden you could get

1920
01:07:21,838 --> 01:07:26,239
these like these cool sounding strains

1921
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:28,720
with these pretty colors

1922
01:07:26,239 --> 01:07:29,679
all that kind of stuff was going on so

1923
01:07:28,719 --> 01:07:31,919
um

1924
01:07:29,679 --> 01:07:34,000
those were those were pretty famous

1925
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:35,920
you'd have to say they certainly caught

1926
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:39,679
americans attention

1927
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:40,798
um and they're also not nl chem haze or

1928
01:07:39,679 --> 01:07:42,558
skunk

1929
01:07:40,798 --> 01:07:44,639
yep but for the most part most famous

1930
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:47,119
things have a little chem

1931
01:07:44,639 --> 01:07:48,558
haze skunk or net l in them you know

1932
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:50,079
he's the building these are the building

1933
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:51,920
block strains so it's hard to get away

1934
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:53,440
from them

1935
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:55,280
all matt

1936
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:57,200

1939
01:07:59,838 --> 01:08:05,358
uh the only thing i know for sure pretty

1940
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:06,640
sure is uh the jimbo used uh williams

1941
01:08:05,358 --> 01:08:09,038

01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:14,880
wonder it hard to say hard to say

1945
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:16,319
his story

1946
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:18,000
did change based on who we told but that

1947
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:19,440
was intentional he did not want people

1948
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,600
recreating it

1949
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:24,000
that that cut was kept very tight until

1950
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:25,440
uh several years after his passing and

1951
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,560
it is now

1952
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:30,318
out there um his sister has the

1953
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:32,159

1957
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:39,199

1959
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:42,960
so yeah pogba breast one of my favorite

1960
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:44,880
all-time strains i believe crd

1961
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:46,239
underscore sd is going to be doing some

1962
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:48,000
stuff with the hogs breath family to

1963
01:08:46,238 --> 01:08:49,198
bring it back again

1964
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,679
all right

1965
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:54,158
can you guys talk about the 88 g13 hash

1966
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:56,000
plant the indian worked with not bread

1967
01:08:54,158 --> 01:08:58,238
please bodhi uses it as a male and i

1968
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,359
believe haze man or someone else even

1969
01:08:58,238 --> 01:09:02,318
though they weren't supposed to be

1970
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:04,560
released pure yeah um the the g13 hash

1971
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:07,039
plant was selected in uh from supposedly

1972
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:08,880
bought 1988 by a scentsy which was not

1973
01:09:07,039 --> 01:09:10,880
the case um

1974
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:13,039
and

1975
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:15,039
and that was by swampy who was an old

1976
01:09:13,039 --> 01:09:16,880
overgrown member indian was his friend

1977
01:09:15,039 --> 01:09:18,560
uh indian gets his name attached a lot

1978
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:20,239
of stuff but what ends up happening is

1979
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:21,839
he asks other breeders to send him

1980
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:23,599
precedes he distributes them without the

1981
01:09:21,838 --> 01:09:25,359
breeder's name and it gets his name got

1982
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:28,159
stuck with it again like the ada g13

1983
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:30,640
hash plant um but it is it is the g13

1984
01:09:28,158 --> 01:09:32,639
hash blend aka mr nice

1985
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:34,960
that seed bank or was it dizzy bank

1986
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:36,719
distributed 88 was it 88 so there's

1987
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:38,960
there's a couple things with this that

1988
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:40,399
i'll throw in uh one

1989
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:43,759
is that

1990
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:47,519
there is no 88 g13 hash plant in the sea

1991
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:50,319
bank it comes out in 89 yeah um so you

1992
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:53,600
know once a year uh anyway but

1993
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:56,400
and um from my understanding uh it had

1994
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:57,199
been sort of bred to f4 before bodhi got

1995
01:09:56,399 --> 01:09:58,719
it

1996
01:09:57,198 --> 01:10:00,238
and bodhi

1997
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:01,760
cracked him and

1998
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:04,959
did some he didn't realize it had been

1999
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:07,520
bred to f4 and bottlenecked a bit so he

2000
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:09,439
got it and he bred it and he bred it a

2001
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:10,719
few times and he realized that all the

2002
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:12,158
breeding work that he had done with it

2003
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:14,399
was kind of bunk

2004
01:10:12,158 --> 01:10:16,238
and his best work

2005
01:10:14,399 --> 01:10:18,238
with it which is what he crossed

2006
01:10:16,238 --> 01:10:21,519
everything to and everybody has access

2007
01:10:18,238 --> 01:10:23,599
to was actually the initial seed pop

2008
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:25,280
he did better with the initial batch of

2009
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:27,199
seeds that he got because they'd already

2010
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:28,880
been heavily selected for

2011
01:10:27,198 --> 01:10:31,439
then him trying to work within the

2012
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:34,400
narrow pool post that he thought he was

2013
01:10:31,439 --> 01:10:37,039
going f you know f1 to f3 maybe yeah he

2014
01:10:34,399 --> 01:10:39,119
was really going like f5 to f8

2015
01:10:37,039 --> 01:10:40,640
yeah and that's a big difference right

2016
01:10:39,119 --> 01:10:42,000
that doesn't mean so i think most of

2017
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:44,000
what you're getting when you get stuff

2018
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,279
from bodhi is the initial batch of seeds

2019
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,119
that he had got that had already been

2020
01:10:45,279 --> 01:10:47,920
narrowed down

2021
01:10:47,119 --> 01:10:49,760
and

2022
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:52,158
i don't know when they came from they

2023
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:54,960
didn't come from 1988

2024
01:10:52,158 --> 01:10:58,639
they were sold in 89 and in 90. they

2025
01:10:54,960 --> 01:11:00,960
were not sold by scentsy um and i don't

2026
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:02,800
think until uh they needed mr nice i

2027
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:04,560
believe until they named it mr nice and

2028
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:06,640
matt and i discovered that that didn't

2029
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:10,320
pop up in a scentsy catalog until almost

2030
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:12,560
1999. yeah that's a long time so it was

2031
01:11:10,319 --> 01:11:15,519
available for two years from neville's

2032
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:17,679
seed bank in 89 and 90. i believe that's

2033
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:19,679
probably where they come from

2034
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:21,119
uh it was probably a pack or two that

2035
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:23,600
the guy bred with

2036
01:11:21,119 --> 01:11:25,359
you know honestly and so that's not that

2037
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:28,000
big of a selection pool

2038
01:11:25,359 --> 01:11:29,359
uh and that's the it's obviously you

2039
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:32,000
know i mean podi's had some great

2040
01:11:29,359 --> 01:11:33,920
success breeding with some of that

2041
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,600
uh it's also probably one of those ones

2042
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:36,960
where there's not a bunch of places to

2043
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:39,199
go with it

2044
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:42,000
yeah it kind of is what it is

2045
01:11:39,198 --> 01:11:43,039
the breed's very dominant um it's pretty

2046
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,719
purple

2047
01:11:43,039 --> 01:11:46,880
smaller butted uh some are some are

2048
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:48,880
large yielding but i i believe the one

2049
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:50,880
that the male the buddha uses imparts

2050
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:53,199
purple traits the deadly gmail i think

2051
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:55,520
he calls it and also uh for those that

2052
01:11:53,198 --> 01:11:58,158
don't know swampy who originally put out

2053
01:11:55,520 --> 01:12:00,400
those g13 hash plant seeds he also did a

2054
01:11:58,158 --> 01:12:02,960
cross called free leonard and that was

2055
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:04,000
the g13 hash plant butterscotch wine i

2056
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:05,039
believe the butterscotch wine was a

2057
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,560
female

2058
01:12:05,039 --> 01:12:08,560
yeah

2059
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:10,239
and that was phenomenal

2060
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:12,080
phenomenal um

2061
01:12:10,238 --> 01:12:13,919
who was it was it oren that worked with

2062
01:12:12,079 --> 01:12:15,439
it i think uh

2063
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:17,359
yeah oren worked with it for a little

2064
01:12:15,439 --> 01:12:19,839
bit and has done some cool [ __ ] with it

2065
01:12:17,359 --> 01:12:21,759
um it made his caramel line and a lot of

2066
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:24,159
people have since used the caramel linen

2067
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:25,920
and you know yeah

2068
01:12:24,158 --> 01:12:27,599
that's about all i can go

2069
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:29,119
the next question we'll go over very

2070
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:30,640
quickly because i think matt and i will

2071
01:12:29,119 --> 01:12:32,079
both kind of want to punt on it but

2072
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:33,840
we'll see

2073
01:12:32,079 --> 01:12:35,359
did barney's farm ever have their own

2074
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:37,840
in-house breeders have they always been

2075
01:12:35,359 --> 01:12:39,519
a bulk seed reseller uh i don't think

2076
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:41,840
mata and i have a super high opinion of

2077
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:42,640
barney's um i think they've always kind

2078
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:45,440
of been

2079
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:48,079
a serious seller i think they came in

2080
01:12:45,439 --> 01:12:49,839
very late to the game when the dutch

2081
01:12:48,079 --> 01:12:51,920
scene had already been significantly

2082
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:54,560
reduced from its golden and even silver

2083
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:56,560
era they kind of came in at the at the

2084
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:58,400
tail end of all that

2085
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:00,640
uh i don't know anybody that has

2086
01:12:58,399 --> 01:13:01,920
actually bred for them doesn't mean that

2087
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:03,600
they didn't have a little bit of their

2088
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:05,440
own house stuff doesn't mean you

2089
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:07,360
couldn't have found good stuff

2090
01:13:05,439 --> 01:13:09,759
uh certainly most of the dutch seed

2091
01:13:07,359 --> 01:13:11,759
banks in the last 10 years have have

2092
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:14,000
certainly fallen off from what they were

2093
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:16,079
previous to that in terms of what people

2094
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,760
find from them so

2095
01:13:16,079 --> 01:13:20,399
uh next question

2096
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:22,480
longitudinally on seeds and pollen

2097
01:13:20,399 --> 01:13:24,879
uh one is quite easy

2098
01:13:22,479 --> 01:13:27,839
if you put seeds in the fridge

2099
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:28,960
and or the freezer um you can extend

2100
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:31,119
their life

2101
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:33,119
excel you know by quite a bit and that's

2102
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:35,920
pretty standard just about every breeder

2103
01:13:33,119 --> 01:13:36,880
i know that wants longevity on his seeds

2104
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:39,119
um

2105
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:40,480
they uh

2106
01:13:39,119 --> 01:13:42,158
you know they put them in the freezer or

2107
01:13:40,479 --> 01:13:42,959
the fridge

2108
01:13:42,158 --> 01:13:43,759
right

2109
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,520
yeah

2110
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:48,480
i'm just trying to read the questions no

2111
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:49,840
the pollen the pollen um matt can speak

2112
01:13:48,479 --> 01:13:51,839
to this i'm sure

2113
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:55,679
pollen is a lot more delicate than seeds

2114
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:58,159
it has a lot more limited shelf life and

2115
01:13:55,679 --> 01:14:00,640
in rob's first book they talk about you

2116
01:13:58,158 --> 01:14:02,960
know baking some flour in the in the

2117
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:05,600
oven you know and then mixing that flour

2118
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:07,039
either 10 or 100 to one and then

2119
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:08,159
freezing that

2120
01:14:07,039 --> 01:14:10,640
um

2121
01:14:08,158 --> 01:14:14,719
you know uh pollen is a lot if you're

2122
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:17,440
heat light water all kills it um it's a

2123
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:18,560
lot less viable than a hard seed to keep

2124
01:14:17,439 --> 01:14:20,158
alive

2125
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:21,199
so uh

2126
01:14:20,158 --> 01:14:23,119
you know

2127
01:14:21,198 --> 01:14:24,879
that's all i'll say about that any any

2128
01:14:23,119 --> 01:14:25,760
way you want to store pollen that's not

2129
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:27,760
fresh

2130
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:29,199
there's various ways to go about it if

2131
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:30,960
they're all iffy

2132
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:32,799
people have some greater success than

2133
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:34,719
others

2134
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:36,159
next couple questions uh ignore it

2135
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:38,800
ignore a few of these because they're

2136
01:14:36,158 --> 01:14:41,920
just nothing yeah i can't i'm not gonna

2137
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:44,560
you know t tk og urkel sour diesel those

2138
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:46,560
are all their own longer things anyway

2139
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:48,640
uh do you think mendo perf is possibly

2140
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:50,880
related to the purple skunk it was only

2141
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:52,640
available in the original 85 catalog and

2142
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:54,480
it being inbred for eight years and the

2143
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:55,920
sativa effects of the purple hindu fish

2144
01:14:54,479 --> 01:14:57,599
type plant with those purple flowers

2145
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:58,880
sounds similar

2146
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:02,400
you know

2147
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:04,560
um like a lot of 90s stuff that you get

2148
01:15:02,399 --> 01:15:07,119
the lineage and the back story that you

2149
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:09,120
would prefer to come along with it

2150
01:15:07,119 --> 01:15:10,800
is not there

2151
01:15:09,119 --> 01:15:13,119
the only information that i have that i

2152
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:15,440
think is factual about the mendo perps

2153
01:15:13,119 --> 01:15:18,319
is that the guy that i got it from

2154
01:15:15,439 --> 01:15:21,519
grew it in the late 70s in kovalev which

2155
01:15:18,319 --> 01:15:23,039
is a remote valley in mendocino county

2156
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:24,560
i don't know anything other about it

2157
01:15:23,039 --> 01:15:26,960
besides that i don't know there's a

2158
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:29,679
famous poha purple isn't there i mean

2159
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:31,359
there you know there was it's sort of

2160
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:33,440
you know and part of the reason why part

2161
01:15:31,359 --> 01:15:35,599
of the i should say this too is that um

2162
01:15:33,439 --> 01:15:37,519
a lot of land race stuff that we were

2163
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:40,800
talking about a lot of it tested between

2164
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:43,040
7 and 15 thc and it was really the

2165
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:45,520
blending of these various land races and

2166
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:47,279
afghans and these hybridizations that

2167
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:50,320
really started bumping us up into the

2168
01:15:47,279 --> 01:15:51,279
higher teens lower 20s mid 20s type of

2169
01:15:50,319 --> 01:15:53,519
thing

2170
01:15:51,279 --> 01:15:55,198
and so the mendo perps while it has

2171
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:57,920
amazing qualities

2172
01:15:55,198 --> 01:15:59,279
um it has very low thc it's probably

2173
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:01,440
somewhere between

2174
01:15:59,279 --> 01:16:02,719
eight and twelve percent if you're not

2175
01:16:01,439 --> 01:16:05,919
bumping it up

2176
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:07,520
um which actually kind of lends it lends

2177
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:08,719
to its truth that it could be an

2178
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:11,120
original

2179
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:12,640
land race brought over um but i don't

2180
01:16:11,119 --> 01:16:14,319
have a regional origin

2181
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:15,760
uh the only thing i've ever smelled in

2182
01:16:14,319 --> 01:16:17,599
my entire life that smelled like the

2183
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:20,079
mendo perps was the

2184
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:23,039
nepalese temple balls that i got from

2185
01:16:20,079 --> 01:16:25,119
hash smugglers in amsterdam

2186
01:16:23,039 --> 01:16:27,359
i thought that it might be nepalese

2187
01:16:25,119 --> 01:16:29,599
because of that but i have absolutely

2188
01:16:27,359 --> 01:16:31,359
zero evidence pointing one way or the

2189
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:32,560
other other than the fact that it's

2190
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:35,039
purple

2191
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:37,120
alright

2192
01:16:35,039 --> 01:16:39,039
i don't think it's purple skunk simply

2193
01:16:37,119 --> 01:16:41,840
because matt and i have grown tons of

2194
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:43,600
skunks various kinds of guns

2195
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:45,679
it doesn't really have any other skunk

2196
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:47,679
characteristics i think sparkle is

2197
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:50,480
purple skunk i really genuinely do i

2198
01:16:47,679 --> 01:16:53,199
know uh csi probably i think he is uh

2199
01:16:50,479 --> 01:16:54,319
more akin to something x18 or ptk

2200
01:16:53,198 --> 01:16:56,479
something like that

2201
01:16:54,319 --> 01:16:57,920
i think it's purple skunk one purple but

2202
01:16:56,479 --> 01:16:58,959
i do not think mendo purposes purple

2203
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:01,600
skunk

2204
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:04,480
um okay so here's some funny ones what's

2205
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:06,880
my favorite color in weed

2206
01:17:04,479 --> 01:17:09,919
uh you know uh

2207
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:12,880
don't say green well i mean you know

2208
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:15,119
it's uh it's you know i i do okay here's

2209
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:17,199
the thing i do think that purple is

2210
01:17:15,119 --> 01:17:19,679
extremely physically attractive to look

2211
01:17:17,198 --> 01:17:22,319
at i do think that the cookies

2212
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:25,119
and that the stuff from dj short and his

2213
01:17:22,319 --> 01:17:28,319
son jd can be extremely beautiful the

2214
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:30,719
lavenders the pinks the blues

2215
01:17:28,319 --> 01:17:34,000
i think the mendo perps is beautiful

2216
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:36,960
do i think that those kinds of weed uh

2217
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:38,158
are as potent and as strong as the green

2218
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:39,439
weed

2219
01:17:38,158 --> 01:17:42,238
no

2220
01:17:39,439 --> 01:17:44,799
no no so if you like very light to

2221
01:17:42,238 --> 01:17:47,439
moderate potency it could be your thing

2222
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:49,199
but literally every potent strain that i

2223
01:17:47,439 --> 01:17:51,599
hold and care for

2224
01:17:49,198 --> 01:17:53,759
um is some shade of green

2225
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:56,079
yeah i i want to see purples i need that

2226
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:58,000
aesthetic oh my gosh

2227
01:17:56,079 --> 01:18:00,158
i would love people i would love people

2228
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,520
to breed an extremely high potent

2229
01:18:00,158 --> 01:18:03,759
potency purple

2230
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:06,480
i haven't seen it i've seen a few the

2231
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:08,880
the purple unicorn was the chem d

2232
01:18:06,479 --> 01:18:10,959
blackberry widow from jojo rizzo it was

2233
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:13,440
the first time i got kmd potency in a

2234
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:15,119
just stark purple plant yeah i'm sure it

2235
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:16,639
could exist i'm just saying as far as

2236
01:18:15,119 --> 01:18:18,800
most purple things that you're aware of

2237
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:20,159
it's not relevant they tend to be they

2238
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:22,400
tend to be lighter

2239
01:18:20,158 --> 01:18:25,719
yeah this is a good one the the golden

2240
01:18:22,399 --> 01:18:25,719
age of canada

2241
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,439
gonna you know i'll talk about this one

2242
01:18:28,158 --> 01:18:31,119
for a minute because

2243
01:18:29,439 --> 01:18:33,039
this one's kind of dear to my heart and

2244
01:18:31,119 --> 01:18:35,198
maybe it's just because i was young

2245
01:18:33,039 --> 01:18:36,319
but i think the 90s was the golden age

2246
01:18:35,198 --> 01:18:37,198
of cannabis

2247
01:18:36,319 --> 01:18:38,880
um

2248
01:18:37,198 --> 01:18:40,399
you know i still think that we could go

2249
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:43,119
into another golden age i don't think

2250
01:18:40,399 --> 01:18:44,879
it's like it's it's unachievable but the

2251
01:18:43,119 --> 01:18:46,559
reason i think it was the golden age is

2252
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:48,159
because it was like the first poly

2253
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:51,199
hybrid era

2254
01:18:48,158 --> 01:18:53,198
right things were less inbred um you

2255
01:18:51,198 --> 01:18:54,960
know there was a lot more f1s and

2256
01:18:53,198 --> 01:18:56,479
various poly hybrids coming out that

2257
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:59,198
were quite potent

2258
01:18:56,479 --> 01:19:02,639
and the you know the chems the sour

2259
01:18:59,198 --> 01:19:05,359
diesels the nl5 hazes like most of our

2260
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:06,480
fame like very extremely famous that the

2261
01:19:05,359 --> 01:19:08,880
cushes

2262
01:19:06,479 --> 01:19:12,000
they all originate from that era

2263
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:12,960
and people are still using a lot of 90s

2264
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,279
cuts

2265
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:16,880
um in their breed work

2266
01:19:15,279 --> 01:19:18,719
they're some of the most common cuts to

2267
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:21,520
use they're sort of the backbone of our

2268
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:22,880
modern industry is 90s cuts

2269
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:25,360
uh and the other thing i think that

2270
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:28,560
makes 90s cuts different is that 90s was

2271
01:19:25,359 --> 01:19:31,039
the last era before the the name game

2272
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:33,039
and matt can speak to this extensively

2273
01:19:31,039 --> 01:19:33,920
but one of the downsides to the name

2274
01:19:33,039 --> 01:19:36,238
game

2275
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:39,039
is that every time a famous name or a

2276
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:41,198
famous craze happens with cannabis

2277
01:19:39,039 --> 01:19:43,279
so many cool unique things that were

2278
01:19:41,198 --> 01:19:45,759
easy to sell

2279
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:47,599
before get pushed to the wayside because

2280
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:48,480
as soon as something becomes not easy to

2281
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,920
sell

2282
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:52,479
the amount of people that are willing to

2283
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:53,440
hold on to it becomes tiny

2284
01:19:52,479 --> 01:19:55,678
so

2285
01:19:53,439 --> 01:19:57,279
you know um i'll give you guys a perfect

2286
01:19:55,679 --> 01:19:59,520
example you know i live in mendocino

2287
01:19:57,279 --> 01:20:00,439
county when the when the purple craze

2288
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:02,080
hit and

2289
01:20:00,439 --> 01:20:04,639
040506

2290
01:20:02,079 --> 01:20:06,719
and everybody wanted to grow grape ape

2291
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:09,119
urkel lavender

2292
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:10,480
uh you know so on and so forth there was

2293
01:20:09,119 --> 01:20:12,399
all these hill people that had been

2294
01:20:10,479 --> 01:20:14,638
growing all these killer strains for a

2295
01:20:12,399 --> 01:20:15,920
long time and easily selling them

2296
01:20:14,639 --> 01:20:18,719
and then they couldn't sell them and

2297
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:21,039
their neighbor was like hey

2298
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:22,960
you grow this urkel i'll sell as many of

2299
01:20:21,039 --> 01:20:25,359
them as you can get every gram

2300
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:26,800
every gram you go give me your urkel and

2301
01:20:25,359 --> 01:20:29,119
so all these strains start to get

2302
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:31,600
dropped and so a lot a lot of the reason

2303
01:20:29,119 --> 01:20:33,519
why we still breed with 90s work is

2304
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:35,679
because that's when the that's before

2305
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:37,679
the bottlenecking happened

2306
01:20:35,679 --> 01:20:40,000
and now if you look at what people are

2307
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:42,480
selling now all these boutique breeders

2308
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:45,198
every famous thing gets crossed to every

2309
01:20:42,479 --> 01:20:46,959
famous thing yeah so sour got crossed to

2310
01:20:45,198 --> 01:20:49,519
everything kush got crossed to

2311
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:51,840
everything cookies got crossed to

2312
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:53,280
everything skittles

2313
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:55,440
you name it then they start getting

2314
01:20:53,279 --> 01:20:57,198
crossed to each other from both sides

2315
01:20:55,439 --> 01:21:00,559
again

2316
01:20:57,198 --> 01:21:03,519
by this by this you know cherry pie by

2317
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:07,039
cushmance by wedding cake by

2318
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:08,400
and it's all the same blend of the same

2319
01:21:07,039 --> 01:21:10,319
30 cuts

2320
01:21:08,399 --> 01:21:12,079
unintentional inbreeding

2321
01:21:10,319 --> 01:21:13,599
unintentional inbreeding because and

2322
01:21:12,079 --> 01:21:14,639
that's and i don't mean to call out

2323
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:16,560
breeders

2324
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:18,639
because that's what the public wants

2325
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:20,960
yeah yeah too

2326
01:21:18,639 --> 01:21:22,560
um soma definitely

2327
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:23,920
soma definitely had some worthwhile

2328
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:26,639
offerings

2329
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:29,199
um his lavender stuff was worthwhile

2330
01:21:26,639 --> 01:21:29,199
declining

2331
01:21:30,079 --> 01:21:34,719
he got some g13 by hayes a from neville

2332
01:21:33,039 --> 01:21:37,279
that he used as a male in some of his

2333
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:39,198
sativa lines and a lot of that came out

2334
01:21:37,279 --> 01:21:41,039
to produce a lot of the cbd lines later

2335
01:21:39,198 --> 01:21:43,279
on that g13 hayes

2336
01:21:41,039 --> 01:21:46,800
so uh you know when i used to go to

2337
01:21:43,279 --> 01:21:48,399
amsterdam uh you could buy his his bud

2338
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:50,719
from the dam crane which was one of the

2339
01:21:48,399 --> 01:21:53,279
nicer coffee shops in amsterdam

2340
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:55,198
he grew good weed um some of his weed

2341
01:21:53,279 --> 01:21:57,279
was quite popular it was a little

2342
01:21:55,198 --> 01:21:59,839
different um

2343
01:21:57,279 --> 01:22:01,279
that's because he keeped it first

2344
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:03,520
you know i try to be nice to people but

2345
01:22:01,279 --> 01:22:05,759
he was and he was a little notorious for

2346
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:07,520
potentially running his tumblr for two

2347
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:09,280
or three minutes before he put it in the

2348
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:10,560
bag to sell the thing so he could

2349
01:22:09,279 --> 01:22:12,158
collect keith

2350
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:14,639
that's for real

2351
01:22:12,158 --> 01:22:16,158
uh who is a legitimate source for nl1

2352
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:18,719
nlc's

2353
01:22:16,158 --> 01:22:20,799
the problem when i mentioned earlier on

2354
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:23,198
the podcast which is like every five or

2355
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:25,520
ten years weed reinvents itself

2356
01:22:23,198 --> 01:22:28,319
you can go look at almost all of these

2357
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:30,800
catalogs from the 90s and it is almost

2358
01:22:28,319 --> 01:22:33,439
impossible to find the vast majority of

2359
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:35,679
these lines in seed form

2360
01:22:33,439 --> 01:22:38,638
unhybridized pure

2361
01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:40,319
skunk you know i mean it just is it's it

2362
01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:43,279
sucks to say it but

2363
01:22:40,319 --> 01:22:45,920
um every 10 years stuff becomes rare

2364
01:22:43,279 --> 01:22:48,079
that's the 90s now that's you know 25

2365
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:49,600
years ago plus

2366
01:22:48,079 --> 01:22:52,719
most of the stuff that was available in

2367
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:55,440
the 90s is no longer available today

2368
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:57,520
you can't get it um it exists in various

2369
01:22:55,439 --> 01:23:00,479
hybrids i have i have a tendency to

2370
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:01,840
think that bubba kush is has heavy nl1

2371
01:23:00,479 --> 01:23:02,718
influence

2372
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:04,319
um

2373
01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:06,639
you know so i think some of this stuff

2374
01:23:04,319 --> 01:23:08,639
exists in different names

2375
01:23:06,639 --> 01:23:10,960
um but that's the sad part if you don't

2376
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:13,279
buy it and store it uh you might want it

2377
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:14,399
later on and you can't get it

2378
01:23:13,279 --> 01:23:16,880
yep

2379
01:23:14,399 --> 01:23:18,799
history of the 1979 christmas tree i'm

2380
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:21,840
gonna skip that one maybe i don't know

2381
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:23,679
it maybe if csi comes on at some point

2382
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:25,039
um

2383
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:27,289
uh

2384
01:23:25,039 --> 01:23:28,800
aspiring breeders um

2385
01:23:27,289 --> 01:23:31,039
[Music]

2386
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:32,800
i'll uh skip that one too not because

2387
01:23:31,039 --> 01:23:35,039
not because it's a bad question but it's

2388
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:37,279
kind of complicated yeah

2389
01:23:35,039 --> 01:23:38,399
i haven't heard of any bud called ufo in

2390
01:23:37,279 --> 01:23:41,599
florida

2391
01:23:38,399 --> 01:23:41,599
nope um

2392
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:47,280
i don't know anything about freeze

2393
01:23:45,198 --> 01:23:48,719
drying cannabis i know there's companies

2394
01:23:47,279 --> 01:23:49,679
out there

2395
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:51,679
you know

2396
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:53,760
there's there's companies that are

2397
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:56,960
that are claiming that freeze drying is

2398
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:58,639
amazing uh i have specific methods of

2399
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:00,560
drying and it certainly doesn't involve

2400
01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:02,239
freeze drying

2401
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:04,159
uh here's a good one when and who

2402
01:24:02,238 --> 01:24:06,319
started making feminized seeds dutch

2403
01:24:04,158 --> 01:24:07,839
passion off uh gives themselves credit

2404
01:24:06,319 --> 01:24:10,079
for it but it was actually a man named

2405
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:12,960
mohan ram and i can't remember something

2406
01:24:10,079 --> 01:24:15,279
set a ctt they were first doing the the

2407
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:17,760
scientific spare experiments on plant

2408
01:24:15,279 --> 01:24:22,479
reversal using cobalt

2409
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:22,480
colloidal sgs and several other methods

2410
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:26,320
um

2411
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:27,760
okay so here's something that's

2412
01:24:26,319 --> 01:24:28,719
interesting

2413
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:31,199
um

2414
01:24:28,719 --> 01:24:32,639
i uh we'll skip a couple of these not

2415
01:24:31,198 --> 01:24:34,158
because they're not nice questions but i

2416
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:35,920
don't know anything about the new york

2417
01:24:34,158 --> 01:24:37,679
recreational

2418
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:40,639
rules or anything like that i don't know

2419
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:42,840
anything about the new uh uh attorney

2420
01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:44,400
general for our state yet

2421
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:45,679
um

2422
01:24:44,399 --> 01:24:47,519
you know

2423
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:49,440
uh

2424
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:50,560
central american cannabis what's the

2425
01:24:49,439 --> 01:24:53,279
importance of it i mean it's very

2426
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:54,400
important um mexican is is central

2427
01:24:53,279 --> 01:24:56,479
america

2428
01:24:54,399 --> 01:24:58,000
uh and mexican has been bred into all

2429
01:24:56,479 --> 01:25:00,319
kinds of stuff

2430
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:02,158
that we use the other central american

2431
01:25:00,319 --> 01:25:04,079
countries not so much

2432
01:25:02,158 --> 01:25:05,920
um it does exist

2433
01:25:04,079 --> 01:25:07,600
but it certainly didn't have the impact

2434
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:09,199
in terms of breeders working with it

2435
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:10,719
there's certainly honduran and el

2436
01:25:09,198 --> 01:25:12,719
salvadorian and

2437
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:14,800
you know that kind of thing

2438
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:15,920
panama's also is also technically

2439
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:16,880
central

2440
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:19,760
um

2441
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:21,359
is also technically central america so

2442
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:23,280
uh the two famous ones from central

2443
01:25:21,359 --> 01:25:24,960
america that have a lot of influence and

2444
01:25:23,279 --> 01:25:28,800
have been bred into a bunch are mexican

2445
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:30,000
and panamanian yeah um

2446
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:31,119
let's see

2447
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,600
cubing

2448
01:25:31,119 --> 01:25:35,920
cubing is sort of bxing

2449
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:38,639
in a way it's kind of giving [ __ ]

2450
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:40,480
concept but

2451
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:43,440
yeah cubing is is

2452
01:25:40,479 --> 01:25:46,399
great if you have a true f1

2453
01:25:43,439 --> 01:25:48,238
and you want to isolate a single

2454
01:25:46,399 --> 01:25:49,920
one or two traits that that that's

2455
01:25:48,238 --> 01:25:52,079
effective and then you cube then you

2456
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:55,359
then you cross forward that's that's

2457
01:25:52,079 --> 01:25:57,840
generally how it works um however i

2458
01:25:55,359 --> 01:25:59,759
always give this example every time

2459
01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:02,159
people tend to think of c99 when they

2460
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:04,400
hear cubing because it was back crossed

2461
01:26:02,158 --> 01:26:07,119
three or four times um i can't remember

2462
01:26:04,399 --> 01:26:08,879
what the claim was from seoul but it was

2463
01:26:07,119 --> 01:26:11,119
all [ __ ] anyways but

2464
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:12,560
in a sense in a sense you don't want to

2465
01:26:11,119 --> 01:26:14,479
take a line that has

2466
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:16,159
[ __ ] a thousand phenos and try to

2467
01:26:14,479 --> 01:26:17,919
cube it you're not gonna get anywhere in

2468
01:26:16,158 --> 01:26:20,158
four steps back

2469
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:22,000
to isolate all the traits like that and

2470
01:26:20,158 --> 01:26:24,719
a lot of people confuse that cubing

2471
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:26,639
isolate a few traits crossing forward

2472
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:28,399
isolate multiple traits

2473
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:29,520
that's that's really the the best way i

2474
01:26:28,399 --> 01:26:31,279
can describe it

2475
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:32,880
um that kind of ends most of the

2476
01:26:31,279 --> 01:26:35,359
questions i think for this week there's

2477
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:36,480
a few we didn't get to urkel is potent

2478
01:26:35,359 --> 01:26:40,158
no

2479
01:26:36,479 --> 01:26:40,158
i don't think urkel is super potent

2480
01:26:40,399 --> 01:26:43,599
but other people might think so i

2481
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:45,039
definitely think it's one of them

2482
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:47,199
i think it's one of the more potent

2483
01:26:45,039 --> 01:26:49,519
purples but i would not put it up

2484
01:26:47,198 --> 01:26:51,439
against the more i would not even

2485
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:52,800
remotely it wouldn't be in my top 10 or

2486
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:56,238
even 20

2487
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:58,000
uh most potent strains that i've tried

2488
01:26:56,238 --> 01:27:00,559
it's one of the top 10 that will

2489
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:03,198
instantly give me paranoia any time

2490
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:06,000
i mean you know

2491
01:27:03,198 --> 01:27:07,759
it's just the way it goes with my brain

2492
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:09,439
yeah there's a guy there's a there's a

2493
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:11,119
gentleman asking about do you think

2494
01:27:09,439 --> 01:27:12,158
landry seeds are still good at the

2495
01:27:11,119 --> 01:27:14,079
source

2496
01:27:12,158 --> 01:27:16,000
um you know i don't know anything about

2497
01:27:14,079 --> 01:27:17,679
those guys but i certainly

2498
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:19,840
support people going around in

2499
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:21,279
afghanistan and pakistan

2500
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:23,199
is he talking about a specific company

2501
01:27:21,279 --> 01:27:25,599
or is he talking about i think there's a

2502
01:27:23,198 --> 01:27:27,678
company called land race seeds that yeah

2503
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:29,199
that brings stuff over from afghanistan

2504
01:27:27,679 --> 01:27:30,079
and pakistan

2505
01:27:29,198 --> 01:27:31,919
um

2506
01:27:30,079 --> 01:27:34,238
it's not that easy for white people to

2507
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:36,079
go there and collect things right now

2508
01:27:34,238 --> 01:27:37,519
and when we went to war with them for a

2509
01:27:36,079 --> 01:27:39,439
couple decades and so it's a little

2510
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:41,440
sketchy with the taliban and stuff and

2511
01:27:39,439 --> 01:27:43,279
so the fact that you have people that

2512
01:27:41,439 --> 01:27:45,439
are going to collect and send seeds i

2513
01:27:43,279 --> 01:27:48,559
don't know what will come of it but it's

2514
01:27:45,439 --> 01:27:49,919
definitely an access point um and we'll

2515
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:51,039
go from there

2516
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:53,359
uh

2517
01:27:51,039 --> 01:27:56,319
you know and uh

2518
01:27:53,359 --> 01:27:57,599
the difference in early colombian haze

2519
01:27:56,319 --> 01:27:59,519
i think the difference in early

2520
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:02,560
colombian haze and why it was better was

2521
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:04,480
it was just raw crosses and less inbred

2522
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:07,039
i think there was a lot of mistakes made

2523
01:28:04,479 --> 01:28:08,879
in the 70s on accident as people learned

2524
01:28:07,039 --> 01:28:11,679
they didn't use large enough population

2525
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:13,520
sizes i think it's been documented

2526
01:28:11,679 --> 01:28:15,840
that a lot of the best phenos that the

2527
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:18,480
haze guys liked started disappearing in

2528
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:21,440
the mid to late 70s because they made

2529
01:28:18,479 --> 01:28:22,559
some some poor choices with selections

2530
01:28:21,439 --> 01:28:23,759
and they weren't sure what they were

2531
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:26,320
doing

2532
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:28,480
um you know the south indian stuff has

2533
01:28:26,319 --> 01:28:30,960
kind of been debunked now sam is saying

2534
01:28:28,479 --> 01:28:33,119
that it was always colo by colo

2535
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:35,760
yeah which is colombian by colombian

2536
01:28:33,119 --> 01:28:37,198
he's saying that the this four-way blend

2537
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:38,960
is a bunch of bunk

2538
01:28:37,198 --> 01:28:40,559
uh and it's not true

2539
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:43,920
um so

2540
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:44,800
uh i can't i can't speak to that

2541
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:46,239
um

2542
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:48,639
so i don't know you know i mean here we

2543
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:51,119
are as that's basically the

2544
01:28:48,639 --> 01:28:52,480
end of the questions there's

2545
01:28:51,119 --> 01:28:54,719
you know there's a guy that said that

2546
01:28:52,479 --> 01:28:57,919
mexico is north america

2547
01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:59,359
uh i'm aware that uh that uh that they

2548
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:01,359
don't consider central america a

2549
01:28:59,359 --> 01:29:03,039
continent but since the question was

2550
01:29:01,359 --> 01:29:05,759
asked about what came from central

2551
01:29:03,039 --> 01:29:07,279
america that was beneficial

2552
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:09,039
you know if people are talking about

2553
01:29:07,279 --> 01:29:10,479
central america it's pretty much panama

2554
01:29:09,039 --> 01:29:12,399
to mexico

2555
01:29:10,479 --> 01:29:15,359
i realize it's all either north or south

2556
01:29:12,399 --> 01:29:17,279
america as the way that uh geography

2557
01:29:15,359 --> 01:29:18,880
would work i was just trying to answer

2558
01:29:17,279 --> 01:29:21,119
the question

2559
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:23,279
the durbin stuff we're going to ignore

2560
01:29:21,119 --> 01:29:24,960
simply we have some stuff coming up that

2561
01:29:23,279 --> 01:29:26,880
i think will shed a lot more light on

2562
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:29,279
the durbin thing next week and so i

2563
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:30,319
don't want to chat on that

2564
01:29:29,279 --> 01:29:32,158
two weeks

2565
01:29:30,319 --> 01:29:33,759
two weeks something like something

2566
01:29:32,158 --> 01:29:34,559
relatively close there'll be some really

2567
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:37,199
good

2568
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:38,639
new information

2569
01:29:37,198 --> 01:29:41,039
i think we can talk about it now since

2570
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:42,079
it's most of it's in the can um is that

2571
01:29:41,039 --> 01:29:43,679
you want to talk about it real quick

2572
01:29:42,079 --> 01:29:46,238
just plug it yeah

2573
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:49,039
we could plug it really quick so um

2574
01:29:46,238 --> 01:29:50,879
you know we uh we we were blessed and we

2575
01:29:49,039 --> 01:29:51,679
have been able to interview

2576
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:52,560
um

2577
01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:56,399
the

2578
01:29:52,560 --> 01:30:00,000
the founder of super sativa seed club uh

2579
01:29:56,399 --> 01:30:02,399
and um as part of our like 80s breeding

2580
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,000
program neville's obviously passed so we

2581
01:30:02,399 --> 01:30:05,920
weren't able to interview him but you

2582
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,679
know neville and super sativa seed club

2583
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:10,319
were the two largest ones

2584
01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:11,679
and we have a quite long interview

2585
01:30:10,319 --> 01:30:13,599
coming that we're going to be giving

2586
01:30:11,679 --> 01:30:15,679
some context to where we asked him a

2587
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:18,480
bunch of questions about some very

2588
01:30:15,679 --> 01:30:20,800
famous trains what it was like back then

2589
01:30:18,479 --> 01:30:23,599
um a lot of cool stuff a lot of stuff

2590
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:26,079
that surprised even matt and myself uh

2591
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:27,280
new information he was super engaging

2592
01:30:26,079 --> 01:30:29,439
and cool

2593
01:30:27,279 --> 01:30:31,519
uh i'm really excited about it we gotta

2594
01:30:29,439 --> 01:30:34,559
edit it a little bit in various ways

2595
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:37,120
just for uh you know but um

2596
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:38,480
there's a lot of myth busted there's a

2597
01:30:37,119 --> 01:30:39,599
lot of there's a lot of stuff that's

2598
01:30:38,479 --> 01:30:40,718
going to come out that's super neat

2599
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:42,159
there's a lot of stuff that's going to

2600
01:30:40,719 --> 01:30:43,840
come out that

2601
01:30:42,158 --> 01:30:45,439
you know

2602
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:47,199
that might make people sad or flip some

2603
01:30:45,439 --> 01:30:48,399
stories that have been kind of accepted

2604
01:30:47,198 --> 01:30:49,279
on their head

2605
01:30:48,399 --> 01:30:51,039
um

2606
01:30:49,279 --> 01:30:54,319
you know i think uh

2607
01:30:51,039 --> 01:30:56,560
the durbin thing is interesting you know

2608
01:30:54,319 --> 01:30:59,759
um you know and so we'll we'll sort of

2609
01:30:56,560 --> 01:31:01,679
save that that for that but uh the

2610
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:03,199
durban story is a little wider than we

2611
01:31:01,679 --> 01:31:05,199
once thought

2612
01:31:03,198 --> 01:31:06,799
let's put it that way so yeah we do have

2613
01:31:05,198 --> 01:31:09,919
that interview coming it should be great

2614
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:11,920
he was super cool to chat with us uh

2615
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:14,079
he'll really flesh out what life was

2616
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:16,399
like back then and what breeding was

2617
01:31:14,079 --> 01:31:19,439
like and he was one of the two biggest

2618
01:31:16,399 --> 01:31:21,119
seed banks in the world in the 80s

2619
01:31:19,439 --> 01:31:23,039
so we're really excited to be able to

2620
01:31:21,119 --> 01:31:24,158
bring that stuff to you guys in the near

2621
01:31:23,039 --> 01:31:26,000
future

2622
01:31:24,158 --> 01:31:27,920

um

2628
01:31:34,319 --> 01:31:37,759
that kind of takes us to sort of the end

2629
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:38,960
of like our arc here we answered a bunch

2630
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:39,920
of questions

2631
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:42,079

and we're actually like i just bought a

2656
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:29,439
new mic that i couldn't use this time

2657
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:31,198
and a few other things so it does cost

2658
01:32:29,439 --> 01:32:32,960
money the more you support the more we

2659
01:32:31,198 --> 01:32:34,399

and we can do more giveaways and cool

2661
01:32:34,399 --> 01:32:39,679
[ __ ] so yeah let's just throw some one

2662
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:41,760
basic plug is that uh you know if you

2663
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:43,359
guys can't figure out how to join you

2664
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:44,079
can always send a

2665
01:32:43,359 --> 01:32:48,880
a

2666
01:32:44,079 --> 01:32:51,359
dm to matt or myself on ig or readers

2667
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:52,960
or breeder syndicate will share the link

2668
01:32:51,359 --> 01:32:55,279
uh that'll take you right to where you

2669
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:57,198
need to be uh you know we have our own

2670
01:32:55,279 --> 01:32:59,039
like we have our own chat in there where

2671
01:32:57,198 --> 01:33:00,879
you can ask us questions all the time

2672
01:32:59,039 --> 01:33:02,639
and we we chop it up with people on a

2673
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:04,400
much more regular basis

2674
01:33:02,639 --> 01:33:06,159
uh our point to all this is to get

2675
01:33:04,399 --> 01:33:07,679
information out there and talk about the

2676
01:33:06,158 --> 01:33:08,399
stuff that interests us

2677
01:33:07,679 --> 01:33:10,800
so

2678
01:33:08,399 --> 01:33:13,198
um yeah if you can't find it for some

2679
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:14,639
