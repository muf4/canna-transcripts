world my way to save the

world um one of the other ones that like

12
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:56,759
visually like I don't know I'm very

13
00:00:54,119 --> 00:01:00,000
visual uh when it comes to cannabis like

14
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:01,159
I was always into purple and um notar

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,238
because of the high or anything it's

16
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:06,000
just I like the color purple a lot and I

17
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:07,959
like to surrounded by you know aesthetic

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,599
beauty is the cool I don't how you

19
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:12,719
pronoun the Kumon how do you pronounce

20
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:14,519
that oh koni yeah Kumon what can you

21
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:17,239
tell me about that line I mean that's a

22
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:20,000
striking picture on the site oh yeah

23
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:24,118
yeah um so I mean the one thing to bear

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,200
in mind is like um purple color you know

25
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:27,599
it's very common in cannabis I think

26
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,079
precisely for the reasons you're saying

27
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:33,118
you like it people just do like the

28
00:01:29,078 --> 00:01:35,719
color um and it's really quite uh

29
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:38,280
typical to find populations

30
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:39,879
that of one land raced where like you

31
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,719
know half of the population or whatever

32
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:44,239
is purple half is green so kamani is

33
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,438
defin and the same as with high and TI

34
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:48,118
so like kamani definitely like I don't

35
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:49,839
know actually what percentage it would

36
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:53,118
be but I mean I'm sure it's controlled

37
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,960
by some Ali or whatever yeah but of any

38
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:58,599
field of typical commanding uh field

39
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,478
there'll be like you know a percentage

40
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:03,718
of them will be per

41
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:07,640
plants uh sometimes that's temperature

42
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:10,038
related um and the kamani okay so that's

43
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,919
a very different type of plant from the

44
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:14,439
Highland High so kamani is like a a

45
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:18,919
kamani is a multi-purpose

46
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:22,400
Himalayan land race that's for fiber and

47
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:25,958
for culinary seed

48
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:29,120
and uh hand rubbed for hash you know

49
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:30,560
yeah it's not not intended for producing

50
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,719
s

51
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,680
there's no culture of that at all in in

52
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:38,840
the in the Himalayas in that area of the

53
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:42,480
Himalayas so

54
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,158
um uh it's going to again break down to

55
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:45,719
type one type two type three chemot

56
00:02:44,158 --> 00:02:48,840
types I would expect if you actually

57
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:51,560
looked at the fields and so some plants

58
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,158
um will be useless for smoking as as bad

59
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,039
and then others you could begin a

60
00:02:54,158 --> 00:02:58,158
breeding project with to bring them up

61
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:03,120
to being like strong type one if you

62
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:05,158
actually wanted to yeah um and uh I

63
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,799
think generally the males are what's

64
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:11,878
primarily used for for fiber

65
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:14,560
production um like they'll these days

66
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:16,840
like most people don't actually in the

67
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,280
village do the work of like reting the

68
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,959
hemp and like turning it into yeah um

69
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:28,438
cordage or whatever but it used to be

70
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:29,920
like 100 plus years ago that um most

71
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:31,598
people in the Himalayas would wear

72
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:35,238
clothes made out of hemp they'd make

73
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:38,919
shoes using hemp they'd tether all their

74
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:42,719
livestock using hemp um cordage so it

75
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:45,199
was a really crucial plant for them at

76
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:48,199
that point but again one of these sort

77
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:50,238
of status social status

78
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:53,759
considerations that comes into play

79
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,840
around cannabis is that having clothes

80
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:58,359
that were made from Himalayan hemp was a

81
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,640
marker of not being like a high class

82
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:04,239
person in the Himalayas you know oh

83
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:06,279
interesting yeah yeah so typical you

84
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,959
know kind of situation where you have

85
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,719
the original community of the Himalayas

86
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:12,920
that were doing all we using hemp as

87
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:14,919
their primary textile plant then you had

88
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:17,399
waves of immigration coming up from the

89
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:19,918
planes of kind of

90
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:22,638
Hindu um

91
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:27,198
Hindu brahin and stuff

92
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:28,800
and um then you have this kind of class

93
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,319
distinction that gets made between

94
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,759
people who wear cotton clothes and

95
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:35,918
people who wear H clothes and so even in

96
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:37,439
come on today like um you know there's a

97
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:40,519
if you look in the old 19th century

98
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:44,279
stuff there was a specific kind of

99
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:47,279
kown curse or or you know like sort of a

100
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:49,319
swearing type phrase that basically said

101
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:51,359
you know like I hope your I hope hemp

102
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:52,079
Grows All Around your house basically

103
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,800
you

104
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:57,758
know it's sort of like basically you

105
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,199
know it was it was a marker of being a

106
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,560
of a of a lower status group so that or

107
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:05,038
C would be the people who were

108
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,199
associated with growing him can still do

109
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:08,959
primarily do that people would call him

110
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:14,439
like Bahari or or whatever it would be

111
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:17,319
the mountain um local people who mostly

112
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:19,560
grow it and I've seen friends of mine up

113
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:22,599
there who are from the more kind of

114
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:26,560
landowner aristocratic type communities

115
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:28,120
who i' sometimes would like um have like

116
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,478
bags of seeds I collected whilst I was

117
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,680
staying at their gas houses and stuff

118
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:33,318
and would just kind of you know be

119
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,879
chucking them around the place on the

120
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:36,680
off chance they' germinate and they'd

121
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:39,159
always like make a point of like killing

122
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,000
any of of the seedlings because they

123
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,600
just it wasn't even a legal thing it's

124
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
just like they're too Posh to have this

125
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:50,039
grow around yeah it's like really you

126
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,600
know it's it's a nightmare but um uh and

127
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:53,560
yeah so comman is like that type of

128
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,039
plant essentially

129
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:58,319
uh I I don't know to what extent there

130
00:05:56,038 --> 00:06:01,719
might be spiritual or kind of

131
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:03,039
sacramental use associ iated with it but

132
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,280
definitely if you go into some of the

133
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:10,399
Shiva temples you will see like people

134
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:12,638
in cound who will offer you know flowers

135
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:15,519
of cannabis to to Shiva and stuff along

136
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:18,199
with theur and these kind of things so

137
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:20,120
it's definitely a a thing about how old

138
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:21,800
it is I don't know you know a lot of

139
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,478
these areas would have been Buddhist if

140
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,160
you went way back you know before they

141
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:28,478
were Hindu and and some of them would

142
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,479
have been kind of animist like kind of

143
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:32,719
worshiping Sun God and stuff like

144
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:35,079
possibly kind of iranic syian type

145
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,599
connections oh yeah yeah yeah if you go

146
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:40,839
into the temples in kamam like uh you

147
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:44,279
can see the sun Gods often have like

148
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:47,318
these uh caral length kind of uh riding

149
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:50,879
boots you know yeah which you don't see

150
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:53,400
on any other kind of deities in uh in in

151
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:56,199
the Hindu Pantheon but the solar Gods

152
00:06:53,399 --> 00:07:00,279
who definitely have a connection to

153
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:03,879
iranic kind of Central Asian cultures

154
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:08,000
uh uh have these uh riding boots you

155
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:10,759
know which could be a connection to cyan

156
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,680
culture yeah that's fascinating I love I

157
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:16,598
love uh learning about that specific

158
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:22,360
culture like Syrian saman all that yeah

159
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:25,079
cyan cyan sort of um cyan like uh

160
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:28,280
um uh you know it's the one ancient

161
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:30,079
culture where there's a very definite

162
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:31,719
undeniable h

163
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:34,159
cannabis connection you know like

164
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:38,599
obviously with Herodotus and and the

165
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:41,720
finds in the Pam and stuff of these and

166
00:07:38,598 --> 00:07:44,959
the Alti which are all unequivocally

167
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:48,480
cyan like archaeology in the in the

168
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:49,638
burials and stuff uh the materials and

169
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,039
[Music]

170
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:56,560
um uh that's sort of 500 BC is and there

171
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:58,639
was a you know so it's these are a kind

172
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,158
of culture zone of deian really like

173
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,120
went all the way from the frontiers of

174
00:08:00,158 --> 00:08:05,000
China all the way to the frontiers of

175
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:08,158
Europe um so you know you got the find

176
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,319
the the the the documentation from

177
00:08:08,158 --> 00:08:11,680
Herodotus north of the Black Sea in

178
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,639
what's sort of Ukraine and Southern

179
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,319
Russia saying yeah these people are

180
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:19,519
fumigating with cannabis that's kind of

181
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:23,879
450 BC then you've got the very very

182
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:26,079
closely dated sort of 400 BC is 450 Bish

183
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:29,599
finds in paser and the AL as cidian

184
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:31,878
where they actually have the tripod type

185
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:33,399
kit exactly as described by Herodotus

186
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:36,278
even though it's like thousands of

187
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:38,958
kilometers east but it's again syan

188
00:08:36,278 --> 00:08:40,719
syian territory then you've got um

189
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,478
that's in paser in the alai and then

190
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,680
just south from there a few thousand

191
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,200
kilometers you've got um the findes in

192
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:49,319
the Eastern pamier just near shinjang of

193
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,680
the

194
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,720
fumigation uh devices which again

195
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:56,599
definitely

196
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:59,120
cian uh based on the material in the

197
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,360
burials which have cannabis all over

198
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,360
them and then possibly you've got stavol

199
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,278
as well in which is Southern Russia just

200
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,839
north of Caucasus which again is syian

201
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:10,159
where you've got like cannabis and opium

202
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:14,079
on these uh drinking vessels is probably

203
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:16,120
what they are again 400 500 BC so you've

204
00:09:14,078 --> 00:09:17,399
got four kind of fines which you can say

205
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,039
yeah these are definitely cyan and

206
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:21,120
they're spread right across the syian

207
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:24,519
culture Zone in the Iron Age and then

208
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:27,480
during that period to get it back to cam

209
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:30,480
during that period you had the expansion

210
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,800
of the aid Empire which was essentially

211
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,480
a syian project even though we call it

212
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:37,159
Persian yeah the expansion of the

213
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,839
accumulate Empire right up into the

214
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:41,519
Indus region of India and probably

215
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,519
across there and they installed all

216
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:47,839
these satraps like local govern

217
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:50,759
Governors who were cians and during that

218
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:56,120
same period talking 500 BC you have this

219
00:09:50,759 --> 00:10:00,278
um fines of uh reting Lakes suddenly

220
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:04,159
becoming very active up in the in the

221
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:06,759
uh Gangi Source River Rivers up in Cal

222
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:09,120
and GW type area it's gell but it's the

223
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:11,679
same bit of the Himalayas you suddenly

224
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:16,278
have this massive increase in using of

225
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:18,719
these Lakes to rot uh cannabis to make

226
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:21,879
cordage or textiles

227
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:25,079
using uh cannabis fibers

228
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:27,200
so is it connected to the akid conquest

229
00:10:25,078 --> 00:10:30,759
who [ __ ] knows but it seems highly

230
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:33,480
plausible and certainly Indian botanists

231
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:36,439
are inclined to think that it was cians

232
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:41,519
who or at least very at very least cians

233
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:45,880
were involved in the rise of cannabis to

234
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:47,679
become a widely cultivated crop in in in

235
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:49,958
the Himalayas because it it certainly

236
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:52,838
correlates in terms of the dates when

237
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:55,078
you start seeing it appearing you know

238
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:56,920
in similarly in napole it's the same

239
00:10:55,078 --> 00:11:00,958
kind of period when you find

240
00:10:56,919 --> 00:11:04,159
these uh indications of people moving

241
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:06,879
seeds around into the kig gandaki sort

242
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:08,799
of area which is the one of the main

243
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,600
routes you would take to go from Central

244
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:13,679
Asia through Tibet down into Nepal you

245
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:16,519
suddenly find these uh fires with clear

246
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:21,439
sort of what look like people eating

247
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:24,159
seeds and stuff yeah around 400 BC is so

248
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,920
um yeah maybe the cool thing is all this

249
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:27,838
is sort of speculation but there's going

250
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,799
to be a whole bunch of genomics work

251
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:34,079
coming out next year that

252
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:37,039
should be sufficiently granular to start

253
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:38,879
seeing how these populations fit

254
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:41,519
together you know was

255
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:45,120
it was was is are there independent

256
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,959
centers of domestication where you know

257
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,799
was was Cannabis domesticated in the

258
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:52,518
Himalayas independently or was it

259
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:53,359
introduced as I suspect yeah you know

260
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:57,399
was

261
00:11:53,360 --> 00:12:00,720
it so anyway um but yeah there's

262
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:03,799
definitely like a PL plausible Central

263
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,879
Asian I mean the Himalayas in a cannabis

264
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:09,559
perspective is Central Asia but yeah um

265
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:12,240
it's plausibly kind of uh quite closely

266
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:15,958
tied to uh

267
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:18,879
Northern uh more Northern groups by

268
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:19,679
iranic kind of groups like The cians

269
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:22,919
that's

270
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:24,599
fascinating yeah um one one thing I I I

271
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:27,919
definitely want to ask you about is some

272
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:30,159
of the Greek accessions you have oh yeah

273
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:32,519
yeah I'm not familiar with Greek

274
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:35,278
cannabis at all um I do have some in the

275
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:37,039
freezer but I haven't I haven't ran any

276
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:39,720
um what can you tell me about some of

277
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:41,958
those um

278
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,879
so grece is another one it's funny kind

279
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:45,159
of like because it it links into what

280
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:47,919
we've been talking about with the cians

281
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:50,519
in the sense that I was thinking um yeah

282
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:53,639
they they documented the Herodotus

283
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:56,240
documented all that um s cannabis

284
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:58,720
culture way way back but in terms of

285
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,198
what you have with u land races that you

286
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,079
can find in Greece these days or or

287
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:06,039
could find um they're a much more recent

288
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:07,278
phenomenon I suspect although again this

289
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:09,198
is one of these things that you actually

290
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:11,958
need genomics to really establish what

291
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:14,799
their ultimate origin is but certainly

292
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:17,078
the historical evidence from the 19th

293
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:19,919
century is that there was a big

294
00:13:17,078 --> 00:13:21,599
introduction of seeds to Greece by uh

295
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:23,519
these kind of smuggling networks that

296
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:28,040
operated out of Lebanon and Egypt and

297
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:30,480
places and turkey and so on who um when

298
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:32,559
um

299
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,120
let's like uh anyway there were seeds

300
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:36,198
were brought in to give to Farmers who

301
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:39,159
were taught how to grow and you know dry

302
00:13:36,198 --> 00:13:41,759
C hash and stuff in order to supply the

303
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:43,519
market in Egypt because there was a huge

304
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:48,120
huge demand from Egypt like the big

305
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:52,000
centers of demand for for um uh for for

306
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:54,399
cannabis drugs were um northern India

307
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,440
and Egypt in terms of globally you know

308
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,240
these were the huge because these huge

309
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:02,199
cities like Alexandria and Cairo and

310
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,560
sure you know there was massive Urban

311
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:07,078
centers where there was this big demand

312
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:10,359
for for hash and things and um so there

313
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:12,758
was a ban imposed on Egypt in in Egypt

314
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,360
which meant that the production shifted

315
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:17,320
to Greece and they would just ship it

316
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:19,919
across from Greece to drop it on the

317
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:22,560
coast in in what's now places like Libya

318
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:24,399
and then just bring it in and um so the

319
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:26,958
types of plants were basically the types

320
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,360
of plants that the were being cultivated

321
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:30,518
in Lebanon and and places and Egypt and

322
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,879
so on so that you know they would just

323
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:34,399
bring the seed all the evidence suggests

324
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:37,278
that seeds were brought from places like

325
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:40,278
that to Egypt and certainly the plants

326
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:42,078
are very closely related they're like

327
00:14:40,278 --> 00:14:46,519
kind of like

328
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:49,078
uh you know uh they're semi dwarf mostly

329
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:51,600
like uh you know so they sort of stay

330
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:53,399
under two meters yeah somewhere between

331
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,120
like sometimes you know some individuals

332
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:56,240
can be like less than a meter even if

333
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,078
you give them

334
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:04,039
space but uh you know not not more than

335
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:07,719
two meters would be normal and

336
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:10,719
um they're definitely the same broad

337
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:15,720
group as what you'd find in Egypt

338
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:18,680
Lebanon Syria turkey Morocco the thing

339
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:23,560
to bear in mind is that like

340
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:25,559
um the sea was the main way to move

341
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:29,159
stuff around you know so these things

342
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:30,879
did move around by land but as with um

343
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:32,719
thinking about tropical saas you know

344
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:34,559
the Bay of Bengal was this huge sort of

345
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,519
point of which all these genetics were

346
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:41,399
swirling around you know people were

347
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:44,360
importing uh cannabis from somatra to to

348
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:48,318
India in the 17th century and similarly

349
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:50,360
people were moving hash around this the

350
00:15:48,318 --> 00:15:51,799
the Eastern Mediterranean a lot and

351
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,919
consequently people who were involved in

352
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:56,679
making money out of it were sometimes

353
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:59,559
moving the seeds around you know yeah so

354
00:15:56,679 --> 00:16:02,879
was definitely this very very clear

355
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:06,119
there was an intentional introduction of

356
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:09,559
you know um levantine or whatever land

357
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:12,000
races to uh gree by these smuggling

358
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:13,758
networks and um they're kind of like

359
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,240
indicas basically in the sense that we

360
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,240
would think of an Inda but they tend to

361
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,759
be more narrow leafleted and effect wise

362
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,879
they're more

363
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:25,399
um they don't have such a strong

364
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:27,360
sedative tendency and so some officios

365
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:29,240
call them like compact sativas because

366
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,159
the leaflets tend to be on the narrow

367
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:34,278
side yeah um and the effect tends to be

368
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:36,198
more sort of typically tends to be more

369
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:39,559
euphoric but all that's that said you

370
00:16:36,198 --> 00:16:42,078
know you can get very kind of funky

371
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:44,078
indic smells out of things like moloo

372
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:46,399
and stuff which is one of the ones we've

373
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:48,399
got um and the other big thing to bear

374
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:52,519
in mind with Greek Land races is that

375
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:57,399
they've had at least like probably

376
00:16:52,519 --> 00:17:00,600
getting on for a century now of um being

377
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:04,038
used as bird rather than hash because

378
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:06,640
once the prohibition came in in the 19

379
00:17:04,038 --> 00:17:10,359
late 1930s in

380
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:14,400
Greece uh really got enforced quite

381
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:18,438
heavily people had an incentive to use

382
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:20,038
the plants as Bud rather than hash so

383
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:21,360
once you've got that culture of using

384
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:23,279
the plants as bud you have a much

385
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,958
stronger selective pressure for potency

386
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:28,038
because you keep the seeds from the good

387
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:32,200
stuff yep so in general they're more

388
00:17:28,038 --> 00:17:33,319
potent compared to Afghan land races so

389
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,798
you know they're good they're good for

390
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:37,839
that reason for Western Growers who are

391
00:17:35,798 --> 00:17:39,480
wanting to grow since and then plus they

392
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:42,480
have another Advantage which is their

393
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:46,599
very early finishing so they finish much

394
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:48,440
earlier than Afghan stuff so real Afghan

395
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:50,599
real Afghan real Hindu Kush plants are

396
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,480
not as early as people tend to assume

397
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:55,839
like the reason we have all these

398
00:17:52,480 --> 00:18:00,240
early uh Afghans is because people have

399
00:17:55,839 --> 00:18:03,839
selected it for it actually if you you

400
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:06,558
grow a field of real Afghan land races

401
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:09,480
and a field of real Greek or Syrian or

402
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:12,119
lebanes whatever land races side by side

403
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:15,599
in you know 40 degrees north whatever

404
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:17,399
the Greek stuff will be finished by late

405
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:19,759
August early September whereas the

406
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:23,720
Afghans can be going right into late

407
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:26,079
October you know yeah so so

408
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,279
um they're good for that as well the

409
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:29,759
Greek plants and they're really

410
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:32,279
interesting like there's some indication

411
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:34,759
that they may have more complicated

412
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:35,960
Heritage than I've implied you know they

413
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:38,599
some of them could have been coming

414
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:40,600
through the Balkans from turkey and

415
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:44,599
places to Greece it's quite possible

416
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:48,678
that there's a much earlier lineage than

417
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:51,480
the um the hash

418
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:54,519
era you know when I talked about the

419
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:59,839
bringing seeds that was 1860s 1880s kind

420
00:18:54,519 --> 00:19:03,918
of era whereas there's been Turkish um

421
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:06,079
um uh influence cannabis wise in Eastern

422
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:09,480
Europe you know going way back to the

423
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:13,240
15th century at least you know yeah

424
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:16,558
because there big kind of um association

425
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:18,880
between radical kind of Sufi dervish

426
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:22,079
type culture in cannabis that that that

427
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,960
goes way back to the ottoman era um you

428
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:26,720
know and the

429
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:29,558
Turkish conquest of of Istanbul

430
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:32,120
Constantinople whatever and yeah that um

431
00:19:29,558 --> 00:19:34,960
beachi and the military units of the

432
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:37,959
Ottoman Empire were very very strongly

433
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,440
associated with cannabis and they were

434
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,880
feature in places like Albania going way

435
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,960
back you know so I'm pretty sure there

436
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:47,080
would have been cannabis grown back in

437
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,679
in Eastern Europe like Balkans bits of

438
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:52,918
Eastern Europe way back but we just

439
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,679
don't know much about it and again it's

440
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:57,759
one of those things that the G genomics

441
00:19:54,679 --> 00:20:01,720
can piece together but if you look at

442
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:04,879
camata red is one of these Greek Str Nam

443
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:08,440
have yeah so I I don't know

444
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:11,039
about that one is I don't know about

445
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,480
how pristine that is necessarily but on

446
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:16,000
the sort of phos Galaxy they didn't have

447
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:19,960
anything else on their data base that is

448
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,159
very closely connected to it and um that

449
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:26,720
doesn't mean much necessarily because

450
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:29,480
it's not a comprehensive sure C of the

451
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,400
Cannabis genome but uh it's a yeah it's

452
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:34,519
another curious one I suspect it's more

453
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:36,840
modern creation but we've got moloo

454
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:40,480
we've got one from creit we've got an

455
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:43,199
one from the um Arcadian which is really

456
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,159
from the real kind of like m is from

457
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:49,558
really from the real kind of historic

458
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:51,760
hash producing areas of the 19th century

459
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:53,599
um yeah I recommend people check them

460
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:55,798
out you know like

461
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:58,399
um

462
00:20:55,798 --> 00:20:59,879
they're much more suited to what most

463
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:04,360
people people are growing

464
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:06,240
for yeah yeah they sound fascinating um

465
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:08,359
yeah and of course like you know we've

466
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,679
talked a lot about the the land race and

467
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:13,519
and heirloom type varieties but um you

468
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,440
also have stuff like uh some of the

469
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:20,200
Dutch stuff that like the the 90s Master

470
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:23,200
Kush the Afghan was that a positronics

471
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:26,759
one or a different one or

472
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:28,798
oh like I made this decision way back to

473
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:30,038
put that extra a in there it's just it's

474
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:32,960
spelled in Dutch and that's how it was

475
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:34,798
written on the packet and um it was

476
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,278
designed to like emphasize that the

477
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:39,400
Afghan 90 was just designed to

478
00:21:36,278 --> 00:21:43,119
emphasized that it's like a Dutch Afghan

479
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:46,240
you know rather than um but uh yeah so

480
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:49,038
it's a whole bunch of material that like

481
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:52,759
we we got like in the

482
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:55,400
um on like a trip sort of to the to

483
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:57,158
Amsterdam in like late 80s early 90s

484
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:00,000
like some of the people who I worked

485
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:01,400
with were over there in that era I I

486
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,558
don't think it's positronics like we

487
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,759
just don't know the thing to bear in

488
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:07,639
mind is like in that time in the in

489
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:09,720
Holland you could just go and just buy

490
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,759
like clones of the of someone on the

491
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,519
street you know yeah like literally the

492
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:15,400
people stand around at like festivals

493
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:18,000
like I've got video of it on one the

494
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:21,679
other site of like people just selling

495
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,119
skunk cuttings like Street and you could

496
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,240
just go into the coffee shops and like a

497
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:26,038
lot of the coffee shops back then were

498
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,440
just like a [ __ ] Caravan or something

499
00:22:26,038 --> 00:22:30,240
like someone just parked up like a

500
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,080
trailer and just opened a coffee shop

501
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,599
and people were just sign up there who

502
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:37,199
were like working um on you know for

503
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:40,879
some of the seed companies or had their

504
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,840
own projects going and just selling

505
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:46,760
these under like

506
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:48,480
under I I genuinely like we nobody can

507
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:50,359
remember what the brand was that this

508
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,599
was sold as but it was like a very kind

509
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:56,639
of low low

510
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:57,959
budget um freelance selling guys you

511
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,919
know selling this stuff just in his like

512
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,640
homemade packs you know but they were

513
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:06,400
all what was going around in like' 8990

514
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:09,120
so it's like Master Kush skunk special

515
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,080
um we've got like a skunk ha all all

516
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:13,000
that stuff from that era like that you

517
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:15,879
would see on the menus in in the like

518
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,558
late 80s early 90s you know Durban yeah

519
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:21,640
Durban skunk skun you saw that yeah

520
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:23,480
we've got like other stuff there was

521
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:25,000
like a there was just like I know from

522
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:28,038
having been there from as like as like

523
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,640
92 93 I guess would be my first I'd have

524
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:33,079
been like 15 or something first time I

525
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:35,799
went there and uh 145 I can't remember

526
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:37,240
and and uh and there was like all the

527
00:23:35,798 --> 00:23:39,119
things you would see on the menu back

528
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,240
then you know and some of them have been

529
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:43,000
like rebranded we tend to call them like

530
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:47,440
cushies and stuff now but you'd even see

531
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:50,200
like chatr chraa CH not CH but

532
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,798
like yeah would be one of the ones you'd

533
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,200
see yeah so yeah so you remember as well

534
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:55,839
yeah and it's like there's just a

535
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,960
certain staple of stuff and we've got

536
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:59,599
like a pretty good representation of all

537
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,519
of those it's just a question of like

538
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:05,719
how many of them we can get to germinate

539
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:07,599
now out of the packs you know so some of

540
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,960
them we'd have to had to do as feminized

541
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:11,199
just because we just didn't get males

542
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:15,120
and stuff you know but

543
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:17,480
still you got feminized now right like

544
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:20,399
you've been working a lot more femin

545
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,480
stuff uh I just made a category for it

546
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,200
because I was getting tired of people

547
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,000
writing to me asking like have we got

548
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,519
feminized seeds or do we do feminized

549
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:30,720
seeds yeah and um so I just made it like

550
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:34,240
specific category for it but some of it

551
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,360
is just because some of them like the PE

552
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:39,839
with freak Show and things made just

553
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:42,158
because people want them feminized and

554
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:44,359
like the Dutch stuff though we've had to

555
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,840
feminize them sometimes because we just

556
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:50,038
didn't get any males you know you get

557
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:52,720
like yeah yeah a handful of these to put

558
00:24:50,038 --> 00:24:55,000
and uh it's like

559
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:58,440
what I think in future we'll make some

560
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,159
regular ones based on whatever we can

561
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:03,360
find that's as close as we can get

562
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:06,159
to the

563
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:09,519
uh like so for the Durban we we did

564
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,960
cross it with the the Nirvana Durban gun

565
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:13,440
because it just seemed that of all of

566
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,558
the ones available is actually truest to

567
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:19,159
the original

568
00:25:15,558 --> 00:25:23,720
um uh stuff that was in Holland back

569
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:25,200
then you know yeah um but uh yeah you

570
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,558
know it's going to be interesting like

571
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,919
again I'm going to try and get like

572
00:25:27,558 --> 00:25:32,240
genomics proper hardcore genomics work

573
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:35,360
done on all of those as well because it

574
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,798
could be quite a useful reference um

575
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:39,639
absolutely P um you know I mean the

576
00:25:37,798 --> 00:25:42,480
original Dutch stuff we've got from the

577
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:44,600
90s because could be quite handy for

578
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,640
like mapping everything out if they

579
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:50,798
are it's super important to be like for

580
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:54,000
for any genomics database to have that

581
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:58,679
stuff because it's it is the backbone

582
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:00,000
ENT out yeah yeah yeah yeah like it

583
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:02,919
would be good to actually really get

584
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,720
that spelled out as clearly as possible

585
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:07,600
for some of the younger folks involved

586
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,919
because I just think so many people

587
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:11,639
don't so many people come into growing

588
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:15,120
with this sense that like all these

589
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:18,640
names correspond to some Botanical

590
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:21,038
reality when actually probably probably

591
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,840
there's about like 10 names that

592
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:26,759
actually have any meaningful

593
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:28,519
basis yeah especially as as the Spanish

594
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:32,599
got involved too with the uh white

595
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:35,359
labeling and that that yeah that changed

596
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:37,719
everything yeah and the thing the thing

597
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:40,759
is I mean I think the Spanish stuff is

598
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:44,000
good because it is just good to have

599
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:46,558
like as much diversity of different

600
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,200
people doing stuff yep but I get a

601
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:52,839
little frustrated with the fact that so

602
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:55,200
much of the ostensible land race stuff

603
00:26:52,839 --> 00:26:56,839
that's going around in Spain is just

604
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,840
stuff that's been hit with like Northern

605
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:03,599
Lights or skunk

606
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:03,599
whatever um I get that you know it's

607
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:08,200
like some people justify that in terms

608
00:27:06,398 --> 00:27:09,599
of meeting their customers halfway it's

609
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,440
like come on my customers aren't like

610
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:15,240
nerds you know just tell them it's but

611
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:17,759
it's like yeah kind of but also you know

612
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:20,079
there's an ecological issue going on

613
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:22,960
here which is like actually cannabis is

614
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:26,480
like no exception in terms of the

615
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:29,759
massive loss of biodiversity that's yep

616
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,038
probably going on and and certainly no

617
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:32,960
it is going on in terms of what's

618
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:35,319
cultivated and

619
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,360
um uh you

620
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:40,798
know I think you've got to actually take

621
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:44,558
a bit of responsibility with educating

622
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:46,519
your customer base absolutely in terms

623
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:48,319
like they you can't expect them to to

624
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:50,000
spend hours digging through the

625
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:51,759
literature like just tell them straight

626
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,278
up this is actually something we've

627
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:59,000
crossed out across Northern Lights and

628
00:27:55,278 --> 00:28:02,000
whatever um that distinctions important

629
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,159
especially if it dominates it you know

630
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,679
yeah well I mean thing is a lot of it a

631
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:06,240
lot of it though like I've actually kind

632
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:07,840
of actually had discussions with it with

633
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,960
some of the Spanish guys and they've

634
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:10,519
been like yeah yeah but we've taken it

635
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,720
through like five generations since and

636
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:14,960
it's all like leans really heavily

637
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,200
towards the original land race like yeah

638
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,440
okay yeah that's great but still just

639
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,798
put it in the description yeah like how

640
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,759
hard is

641
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:25,558
that they they they used to but then

642
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:26,960
like there's a point where suddenly like

643
00:28:25,558 --> 00:28:28,519
the land race became this really big

644
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,919
thing and they just like [ __ ] cut it

645
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:34,240
all out it's like guys come

646
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,759
on is there anything you wanted to

647
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,480
highlight specifically that you've been

648
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:40,240
working on lately or any of the the

649
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,000
stuff that you've put up recently or

650
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,319
anything yeah anything at all that you

651
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,038
want to highlight um I mean the one of

652
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:49,200
the really exciting things is that there

653
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:52,119
will be some papers coming out studies

654
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:55,399
coming out over the next sort of half a

655
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:59,119
year to a year of like really seriously

656
00:28:55,398 --> 00:29:02,398
high quality genomics work

657
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:06,278
I I I sent in all of the material I've

658
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:12,199
got uh to these projects and they will

659
00:29:06,278 --> 00:29:14,599
be producing like what should be the

660
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,519
first really good quality like Pang

661
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:18,480
genome for cannabis like the whole

662
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:22,159
species essentially that would be

663
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,679
amazing and um on the basis of that

664
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,399
we'll have some like

665
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,200
publicly

666
00:29:25,398 --> 00:29:32,038
um uh it'll all be publicly available

667
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:34,880
data and and also some breeding tools

668
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:38,038
based on that that you can basically

669
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,440
send in you you can you can use to

670
00:29:38,038 --> 00:29:42,398
really know like you can really start

671
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:45,798
establishing genuine

672
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:48,319
pedigrees and um this is ideally ideally

673
00:29:45,798 --> 00:29:51,798
you know what will be achieved and then

674
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:53,798
ultimate strain nerd [ __ ] yeah yeah

675
00:29:51,798 --> 00:29:56,240
essentially yeah so for just people who

676
00:29:53,798 --> 00:29:58,158
have just a end as an end in itself The

677
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,880
Strain nerd stuff but also actually for

678
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,799
the serious breeding work you can use

679
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:06,080
these things well so you can really know

680
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:08,879
what you've got and really start like uh

681
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:11,918
catching up on like the seven eight last

682
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:15,320
decades that cannabis has had in in some

683
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:19,000
respects compared to other crops so um

684
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:24,240
yeah um there'll be some really good

685
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:26,960
uh uh tools available to let people you

686
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,880
know basically even even if you're you

687
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,200
know you can have like kind of the

688
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,960
equivalent this again ideally like

689
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,480
equivalent level of quality of

690
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,720
information about what you've got that

691
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,399
like [ __ ] Monsanto has even if you're

692
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,000
just like a a small business you know

693
00:30:39,398 --> 00:30:43,239
you can you can access access this stuff

694
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,880
so it's hope going to like level the

695
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:49,319
playing field for for people who are

696
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:51,640
involved in in uh in uh in cannabis

697
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:54,038
breeding you know which is which is be

698
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:58,240
nice given how money has made the

699
00:30:54,038 --> 00:31:00,839
playing Feld very not [ __ ] level um

700
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,480
already but um I would definitely say

701
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:05,439
that that your company caters to

702
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,360
breeders which is uh I wish more

703
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,798
companies would like that's that's

704
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:12,439
something that should be coveted you

705
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:14,558
know to to have actual breeders wanting

706
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:17,960
your stuff should you know I think that

707
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:20,480
lends a lot of credibility I I mean

708
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,240
ideally that would be what it is the

709
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,440
there is there are so many barriers

710
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:28,200
still um which

711
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:32,440
are which are which are in in the way in

712
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:34,558
terms of to have the you know even for

713
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:37,519
like projects which have got like big

714
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:39,918
money involved it's classic kind of

715
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,720
story is that a lot of germplasm I'm

716
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,880
talking other crops now as well has just

717
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:47,399
vanished over the years because there's

718
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:50,760
just sheer economics of actually

719
00:31:47,398 --> 00:31:52,398
utilizing this material is really

720
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:55,919
[ __ ] challenging it's like if you've

721
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:58,079
got uh however many acres of land

722
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,360
available to you to be growing on how

723
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:02,759
much of that are you going to set aside

724
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:04,678
to actually like work a land race

725
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:11,240
absolutely you know and not just

726
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:12,720
outcross and stuff yep um so you know uh

727
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,278
there are shortcuts now you can take

728
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,839
like this kind of pre-breeding you know

729
00:32:14,278 --> 00:32:19,278
where you where you try and kind of move

730
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:21,879
the useful ales from one land race into

731
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:23,278
like an established cultiva or from a

732
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:25,360
feral population into an established

733
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:27,519
cultiv like you try and basically take

734
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:29,319
some handy traits like drought

735
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:31,679
resistance or disease resistance like

736
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:34,798
powdery mil resistance or like whatever

737
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:36,278
smell or whatever you're looking to like

738
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:39,440
Aroma you're looking for whatever you

739
00:32:36,278 --> 00:32:40,839
can shortcut you know from the land race

740
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,480
to the cultivar so that's that kind of

741
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:44,959
thing but it's very seldom you get

742
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,278
anyone actually kind of just like in

743
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,000
breeding with

744
00:32:46,278 --> 00:32:52,720
one line to create an heirloom it's why

745
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,839
we've got so few kind of actual genuine

746
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:59,319
heirlooms now I mean as far as I know

747
00:32:54,839 --> 00:33:02,839
x18 and deep chunk as far as We Know

748
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:03,839
um genuinely kind of inbred from one

749
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:06,480
land

750
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:07,678
race again just going to take genomics

751
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,038
to actually establish that but the

752
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,240
general consensus is I've never heard

753
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:13,919
anyone like contesting that idea but

754
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:16,960
there aren't many like pure genuine pure

755
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:18,038
sativas around you know even Hayes is is

756
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:22,200
a

757
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:24,480
hybrid sativas and then um most of the

758
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:26,759
sort of ostensible like Jamaican or

759
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,679
African things going around like in

760
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:30,879
Spain they've all been hit with

761
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:32,759
something I don't think many people

762
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:36,159
argue with that I mean you were asking

763
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:39,720
about the unan uh line yeah yeah I mean

764
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:42,600
that's a skunk um cross to something

765
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:45,798
from kind of Border Borderlands of yunan

766
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:48,558
it's not a land race yeah it's uh and

767
00:33:45,798 --> 00:33:50,240
and um there's no uh to the best of my

768
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:52,079
knowledge there's no historic kind of

769
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,440
culture of growing cannabis as a drug in

770
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:56,278
that bit of southern China once you move

771
00:33:54,440 --> 00:34:01,200
across the border into the kind of Thai

772
00:33:56,278 --> 00:34:02,278
like tii Shan Tha Lao Thai areas sure

773
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,480
you get

774
00:34:02,278 --> 00:34:07,960
a there's a kind of gja culture but in

775
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,639
you unan itself has no culture with

776
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:12,918
these things so you know a lot of What's

777
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:15,960
um passed around is is anyway just

778
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:17,480
hybridized stuff I think the most of the

779
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:21,559
notionally

780
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:24,159
Burmese uh lines in North America are

781
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:26,159
hybridized things they don't the B

782
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:29,320
doesn't look anything like the plants

783
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:31,679
we've got from Direct from Burma yeah

784
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,320
yeah there's a lot of the Canadian uh

785
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:36,800
Burmese stuff that I've seen that looks

786
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:39,399
just mostly Afghan yeah yeah I mean

787
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:42,200
Broad Leaf yeah and there's no there's

788
00:34:39,398 --> 00:34:45,078
no there's no um you don't just you just

789
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:46,398
don't get plants in places plants like

790
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:49,480
that are just do

791
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:53,358
not naturally occur in the

792
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:56,199
tropics right not in a monsoon

793
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:58,239
area just any tropical area it's like

794
00:34:56,199 --> 00:35:01,199
there's so many reasons why it's not

795
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:05,598
advantageous to have broad leaflets just

796
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:08,078
get [ __ ] up by the rain yeah pathogens

797
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:12,320
and Broad leaflets are so much easier

798
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:14,519
for insects to to to to work on oh yeah

799
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:18,079
yeah there's all kinds of reasons

800
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:19,759
why you don't get that in the tropical

801
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,839
population

802
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,440
um yeah so so yeah anyway that's the

803
00:35:22,838 --> 00:35:25,519
most interesting thing I think is like

804
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:27,000
hopefully next year is going to be

805
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:32,358
really quite an exciting year in terms

806
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:37,559
of the science of cannabis um and uh

807
00:35:32,358 --> 00:35:40,358
making life much more um easy for people

808
00:35:37,559 --> 00:35:42,679
who are doing reading projects I'm

809
00:35:40,358 --> 00:35:45,358
excited about it I can't wait to see

810
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:47,440
what you do with it yeah yeah well I

811
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:49,000
mean it's not it's it's just it's not me

812
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,240
doing the actual work it's I've just

813
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,239
submitted a whole bunch of uh well okay

814
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:54,639
I've done the work in terms of

815
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:56,399
collecting these things but I've just

816
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:59,559
donated a bunch of material to some

817
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,639
projects and um see what they actually

818
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:03,119
do in terms of making sense of it all

819
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:05,598
but as far as I understand they've got

820
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:08,920
like really really super high quality

821
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:10,880
like long sequences yeah that's

822
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:14,200
important phos didn't do that they did

823
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:16,200
the short SE yeah no this is like Mega

824
00:36:14,199 --> 00:36:19,879
long like ultra high

825
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:23,358
quality and uh you know because the

826
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:25,160
problem with the genomics work to date I

827
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:29,400
mean aside from some sort of ethical

828
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:31,440
issues and stuff is that the reference

829
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,880
genomes that people have been using as

830
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,880
[ __ ] and and there all kinds of

831
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,519
different read depths and all kinds of

832
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:40,960
in congruities between the data sets

833
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:44,119
that just mean that you if you i' I know

834
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:47,280
two groups one mathematician and then

835
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:49,760
another more kind of cannabis Centric

836
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:52,000
group who've done work on the existing

837
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,839
data and just got these completely

838
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,000
like back to front [ __ ] results you

839
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:59,599
know it's like if you if this this Mass

840
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,559
guy is like I'm just going through all

841
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:05,119
this

842
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:06,799
Stu and um and he's like uh all the data

843
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,240
is saying that like the modern hybrids

844
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,960
are like more diverse than the land

845
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:13,639
races and it's like

846
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:15,280
yeah I don't it's you know it made the

847
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:16,679
meded retion is like well that's [ __ ]

848
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,680
what [ __ ] you know it's like no it's

849
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:21,799
just this [ __ ] data of [ __ ] mess

850
00:37:18,679 --> 00:37:23,559
you know yeah and um and uh because

851
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:26,720
you're looking like if you comparable

852
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:28,199
kind of crops just a general point of

853
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:30,279
comparison like if you look at other

854
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:34,399
kind of land

855
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:36,079
race comparisons to Modern material

856
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,000
you're looking like at least like five

857
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,960
times more diversity in the land races

858
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,760
you know yeah and I would expect with

859
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:44,920
cannabis once you factor in like really

860
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,960
weedy populations it's way more [ __ ]

861
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:51,519
diversity in them compared to the modern

862
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:55,519
stuff but again the so much dodgy work

863
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:59,920
or just you know limited quality work

864
00:37:55,519 --> 00:38:02,119
that's been done on on on up to done to

865
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:05,318
date so hopefully next year will be like

866
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:07,039
uh quite a big uh Leap Forward in terms

867
00:38:05,318 --> 00:38:09,519
of making sense of all this stuff you

868
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:10,639
know I truly hope so there's a lot of us

869
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:13,480
that could use

870
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:17,480
that yeah there just like and there's so

871
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:19,800
much so much to be clarified you know

872
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:21,000
like just chatting with these groups as

873
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,839
they're going these people as they're

874
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:27,000
going through all the research it's

875
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:30,400
like um I think one of the first things

876
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:33,039
of my they looked at was like uh that

877
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,280
sudanes ession and they basically were

878
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:37,159
just like uh we're going to like

879
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:39,040
basically have to rewrite our entire

880
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:40,399
genome I don't think I don't know if it

881
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:41,559
was I think it was that one it was just

882
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,960
like yeah it's like the first one they

883
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:44,838
looked at and they're like yeah Cas is

884
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,838
like who we just got like completely off

885
00:38:44,838 --> 00:38:48,799
the charts here and then they looked at

886
00:38:46,838 --> 00:38:51,318
just even just the Milano and Parvati

887
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,640
accessions and that's not even really

888
00:38:51,318 --> 00:38:54,960
like a pure land race and they're like

889
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:57,759
yeah we're finding whole new like sex

890
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:00,760
markers I think it is for sex expression

891
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:05,560
hav't even found before and then like

892
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:07,560
crazy examples of like monoi in in in uh

893
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:09,239
the southeast Asians and in the Afghan

894
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:11,000
and in one of the Greek ones they was

895
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:15,078
finding this

896
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:17,920
like um XY mono like normally you find

897
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:19,880
it on the anyway like males that were

898
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,800
like genetically male showing mono and

899
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:25,119
stuff which is like again super

900
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:27,359
interesting in terms of future breeding

901
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:30,920
possibilities and stuff because

902
00:39:27,358 --> 00:39:33,000
monoicous stuff is a lot easier for many

903
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:34,838
reasons to breed with and work with and

904
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,838
stuff anyway there's all kinds of

905
00:39:34,838 --> 00:39:39,759
possibilities and it's like so much uh

906
00:39:37,838 --> 00:39:42,719
catching up to be

907
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:45,359
done uh with such an important crop

908
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:49,598
that's just been held back

909
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:51,159
massively um and uh yeah it should be

910
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,838
really

911
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:57,039
interesting yeah that sounds

912
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:59,119
fascinating yeah so I have I have a few

913
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:01,039
questions I want to go through just from

914
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:03,640
our our Discord that people wanted to

915
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:08,920
ask I try to go for the best ones

916
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:08,920
because there's quite a few um let's

917
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:14,240
see yeah so most of these uh questions

918
00:40:12,318 --> 00:40:17,079
we've actually covered as a course of

919
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:19,439
just conversing um yeah there's one I

920
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:21,400
mean like almost all of them we covered

921
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,639
just by conversing but one one that I

922
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:25,680
think will be probably the most asked

923
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:28,719
question you probably when you get a lot

924
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:31,318
is from uh CCC and he asked how to keep

925
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:33,439
pure well pure relatively pure uh

926
00:40:31,318 --> 00:40:35,079
sativas manageable indoors do you have

927
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,639
any advice on

928
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:39,599
that

929
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:44,879
um I mean one of the main

930
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:49,000
um tricks people do that I'm aware of is

931
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:52,400
um uh you can use pot size to just

932
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:55,199
control and and and and like because if

933
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:57,480
it's really like a pure straight from a

934
00:40:55,199 --> 00:41:00,559
farmer type sativa it's it's they're

935
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:04,079
going to keep rooting even during

936
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:08,199
flowering you know yeah so

937
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:11,880
um you can just pot up in the kind of

938
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:13,879
second week of flour or so still and you

939
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:16,640
should find that the it will still root

940
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:18,440
into the new compost which can be good

941
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:20,239
as well because it can mean that you

942
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:22,760
don't make the mistake of like

943
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:27,679
overfeeding too much during flour

944
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:30,040
absolutely um and the other thing

945
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:33,318
uh with sativa endorses to try to not

946
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:35,719
overwater them like it's a really

947
00:41:33,318 --> 00:41:39,358
important aspect of of traditional

948
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:42,759
farming of of gja you know s or whatever

949
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:47,960
is the right irrigation schedule

950
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:51,400
so even these days um the good quality

951
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:53,559
uh production in places like LA and

952
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:56,800
stuff is in areas where they've got

953
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:58,078
access to lakes or ponds or streams to

954
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:02,318
irrigate

955
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:06,079
on schedule rather than just allowing

956
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:09,838
rain fed um you

957
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:12,680
know yeah so in other words the the main

958
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:16,159
good quality crop is done from sort of

959
00:42:12,679 --> 00:42:22,039
sewing in mid augusti is and then

960
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:25,078
harvesting kind of Fe February is so you

961
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:28,239
um uh September is or whatever to

962
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:31,640
February marchish basically six months

963
00:42:28,239 --> 00:42:33,358
over the starting at the end of monsoon

964
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:35,000
so you can have a bit of rain whilst the

965
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:37,039
plants are in veg but really once you're

966
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,559
into flow you're looking to like have

967
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:42,599
zero rain ideally and just have

968
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:44,040
irrigation and the mistake people make

969
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:46,400
IND doors is to over water we've already

970
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:47,880
kind of touched on that but um the other

971
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,440
thing is you can if there're are real

972
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:52,440
land race you can prune back pretty

973
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,800
[ __ ] heavily if you want and you can

974
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:58,280
you can you

975
00:42:53,800 --> 00:43:01,280
can um concentrate the uh Bud production

976
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:04,640
into the exactly where you want if you

977
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:07,040
prune carefully and you can prune like

978
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:10,679
quite late on in the cycle of growth

979
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:13,880
still yeah um

980
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:14,960
uh yeah I can't think of other things to

981
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,720
be honest with you I'm not like an

982
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:19,720
expert grower I just know from talking

983
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:21,358
to people and and stuff yeah for sure I

984
00:43:19,719 --> 00:43:22,919
I don't have like a huge amount of

985
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:24,920
opportunities to grow because of the

986
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,800
amount of moving around I do you know

987
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:28,480
yeah yeah you can imagine that makes it

988
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,079
hard

989
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:34,559
I

990
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:37,039
um anyway I yeah it's uh but yes sativas

991
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:40,119
they're not well adapted to in indoors

992
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:43,119
basically as the bottom bottom line

993
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:46,838
really want to be outside and they will

994
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:48,440
um you know the the the type of land

995
00:43:46,838 --> 00:43:51,480
they want to be on is is a really

996
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:55,200
important consideration so in the big

997
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:57,159
Gand growing areas of India um in the

998
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:59,358
late 19th 30 20th century there was

999
00:43:57,159 --> 00:44:00,679
quite a good documentation done of that

1000
00:43:59,358 --> 00:44:05,639
whole economy because it was

1001
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:07,960
economically very significant um and um

1002
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:12,199
the land along the rivers along the

1003
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:16,280
ganes Delta area that was very lomy like

1004
00:44:12,199 --> 00:44:18,159
light Sandy loomes yeah that don't hold

1005
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:22,000
water too much but are very nutrient

1006
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:24,399
Rich were really sought after by people

1007
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,679
who wanted to to to get into commercial

1008
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:29,599
production you know yeah and um there

1009
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:32,919
were techniques which are still used of

1010
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:34,200
of how you prepare the land so you know

1011
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:39,960
still they'll do this still in in

1012
00:44:34,199 --> 00:44:43,960
Southeast Asia as you um create um uh

1013
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:49,318
ridges you know like raised raised beds

1014
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:52,119
like a kind of semi um Circle type shape

1015
00:44:49,318 --> 00:44:54,759
with between them for the water and then

1016
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:56,200
you plant on top of those um half

1017
00:44:54,760 --> 00:45:00,319
circles as it were you know what I mean

1018
00:44:56,199 --> 00:45:02,039
so yeah Cur curved raised bed and so

1019
00:45:00,318 --> 00:45:05,199
that means that you the water runs off

1020
00:45:02,039 --> 00:45:06,599
the roots so the thing you're just

1021
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:09,078
trying to avoid is for the to have the

1022
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:11,880
root sitting in water logged um water

1023
00:45:09,079 --> 00:45:14,119
logged uh land because that yeah

1024
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:17,440
cannabis just does not [ __ ] like that

1025
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:19,358
and it will get it'll get infected and

1026
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,159
there are all kinds of parasites and

1027
00:45:19,358 --> 00:45:23,639
pathogens that were already very well

1028
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:25,719
known back in the in that time which are

1029
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:27,960
even Cann ofis specific forms of powdery

1030
00:45:25,719 --> 00:45:32,358
milu and stuff you know

1031
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:34,559
um and um you know these conversations

1032
00:45:32,358 --> 00:45:38,279
sometimes with people who are like using

1033
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:41,559
these um what is it

1034
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:43,400
natural um sort of what is it some kind

1035
00:45:41,559 --> 00:45:45,519
of like people basically growing in this

1036
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:47,838
like composting compost it's not even

1037
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:51,480
properly comp Korean natural farming

1038
00:45:47,838 --> 00:45:53,078
stuff yeah yeah yeah I get these kind of

1039
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:56,639
emails from people sometimes and it's

1040
00:45:53,079 --> 00:46:00,240
like try and like be as nice as I can

1041
00:45:56,639 --> 00:46:02,118
yeah yeah it's tough like on principle

1042
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:04,719
I'm like all for kind of permac culture

1043
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:06,358
and anything like that it's like but

1044
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:08,759
Jesus man like cannabis does not want to

1045
00:46:06,358 --> 00:46:12,039
be in that kind of [ __ ] situation

1046
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:14,000
this guy writing to me like yeah I've

1047
00:46:12,039 --> 00:46:17,000
created this amazing system where like

1048
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:22,639
the soil is wet

1049
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:25,599
247 like RAC love that right no cannabis

1050
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:27,440
wants to be like they okay with

1051
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:30,039
Hydroponics and stuff maybe they've I

1052
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:32,559
mean I think in over the last 50 60

1053
00:46:30,039 --> 00:46:34,759
years like cannabis in the west has

1054
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:38,079
adapted to all kinds of Mal treatment

1055
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:40,400
but sure absolutely has

1056
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:42,480
ultimately yeah you don't want to be

1057
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:46,480
growing a land race in like

1058
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:50,000
soggy incredibly Rich

1059
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:52,240
compost especially like especially not

1060
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,358
with like stuff like literally rotting

1061
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:56,719
on the

1062
00:46:53,358 --> 00:46:58,400
surface yeah this guys like can you send

1063
00:46:56,719 --> 00:47:00,199
me like a photo and he says your thing

1064
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:04,440
there like [ __ ] cooch grass like

1065
00:47:00,199 --> 00:47:04,439
growing in in the same

1066
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:13,440
pot yeah I mean each their own I guess

1067
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:15,400
but yeah God bless them if someone's ask

1068
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:19,960
opinion I feel I should just tell them

1069
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:21,838
like no yeah just don't grow this

1070
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:23,440
type take

1071
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:26,000
abuse

1072
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,800
yeah um is there any strange you want to

1073
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,280
highlight that you current have for sale

1074
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:32,079
right now or any anything else you want

1075
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:36,880
to talk about and get

1076
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:39,680
in I mean I'm really interested like uh

1077
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:41,440
you can um I we collected a bunch of

1078
00:47:39,679 --> 00:47:45,000
stuff from orisa which is sort of just

1079
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:46,039
south of of Bengal okay which I suspect

1080
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,480
is

1081
00:47:46,039 --> 00:47:54,920
um uh quite um historically significant

1082
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:59,318
um in terms of the development of um of

1083
00:47:54,920 --> 00:48:00,318
sativas like real tropical C land races

1084
00:47:59,318 --> 00:48:03,119
uh you know we were talking about

1085
00:48:00,318 --> 00:48:04,558
there's that um book the kind of

1086
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:06,280
alchemic it's an alchemical book

1087
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:09,000
actually the an and theander is the name

1088
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:11,440
of it um where they describe the cinia

1089
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:15,440
technique that's from around their kind

1090
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:16,920
of andr PES uh barisa area was where

1091
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,559
that was probably

1092
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:20,960
compiled and um I suspect those plants

1093
00:48:19,559 --> 00:48:24,119
are pretty

1094
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:26,440
interesting uh to look at uh they seem

1095
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:29,480
to be like probably more like five

1096
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:34,400
months from seed to harvest uh the ones

1097
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:38,159
we' got and um also

1098
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:42,480
um yeah and and then um planning to have

1099
00:48:38,159 --> 00:48:43,960
some napoi um uh ganja land races

1100
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,679
available soon as well which I think

1101
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:49,400
will be pretty interesting I mean just

1102
00:48:46,679 --> 00:48:52,519
in terms of product stuff like I'm a big

1103
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:54,000
fan of the southeast Asians but the

1104
00:48:52,519 --> 00:48:56,440
because of the Aromas and stuff and I

1105
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,159
think there's been a lot of hybridity

1106
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:00,960
between

1107
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:03,759
possibly like independent centers of

1108
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,960
domestication south of unan with the the

1109
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,880
east

1110
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:11,639
Indian uh sens of domestication I don't

1111
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:15,240
know this is just a hunch but um anyway

1112
00:49:11,639 --> 00:49:17,960
I think these uh actual South Asian land

1113
00:49:15,239 --> 00:49:21,279
races like from Arisa and Andra Pradesh

1114
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:24,599
and um the terai regions of nepool are

1115
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:27,079
worth checking out so we've got already

1116
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:29,519
uh some like da and KH as the name of

1117
00:49:27,079 --> 00:49:30,680
the one from neple that we've got that's

1118
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:33,358
kind

1119
00:49:30,679 --> 00:49:34,960
of uh you could say like been

1120
00:49:33,358 --> 00:49:37,078
domesticated it definitely has been

1121
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,440
domesticated for use as bud not just as

1122
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:42,920
hash yeah and then the orisa one is very

1123
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:44,119
much specifically for bud and um both of

1124
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:48,079
them I think would be really interesting

1125
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:51,640
to look at uh really nice Aromas from

1126
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:53,200
them too as well you know yeah and types

1127
00:49:51,639 --> 00:49:55,480
of effect are really good like very

1128
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:58,719
stimulating and

1129
00:49:55,480 --> 00:50:01,679
positive um it sounds freaking awesome

1130
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:03,639
to be honest yeah yeah I'm quite Kean to

1131
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:05,759
see what the genomics work discovers

1132
00:50:03,639 --> 00:50:10,558
about them because my hunch is they're

1133
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:14,240
probably the uh East India Nepal and

1134
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:18,880
East India are kind of where saas really

1135
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:20,719
originate first we'll see yeah that's so

1136
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:23,358
fascinating I can't wait to see that all

1137
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:26,480
work out um where where should people go

1138
00:50:23,358 --> 00:50:28,798
to buy your seeds uh what's the website

1139
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,838
uh the real seed company.com and then

1140
00:50:28,798 --> 00:50:33,079
for the for the modern stuff is quick

1141
00:50:30,838 --> 00:50:35,400
seeds.com it's a stupid name but it's

1142
00:50:33,079 --> 00:50:37,798
like what I

1143
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:39,960
originally yeah I'd originally planned

1144
00:50:37,798 --> 00:50:41,880
it as like a budget thing I was just
