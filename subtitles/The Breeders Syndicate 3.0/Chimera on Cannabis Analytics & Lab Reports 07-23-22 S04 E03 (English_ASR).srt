00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,919
welcome to breeders syndicate where we

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,359
explore the history of a clandestine

4
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:16,800
scene through the eyes of the folks who

5
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:18,320
lived it i'm matthew owner of riot seeds

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,719
i'll occasionally be joined by my

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,240
co-host not-so-dog breeder and grower

8
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:26,278
from mendocino

9
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:26,278
welcome to the underground

10
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,069
[Music]

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,040
in this episode we will be joined by

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,800
chimera long-time member of the cannabis

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,479
community and a well-respected member of

14
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,078
the breeding community

15
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:45,919
known for his skills in the areas of

16
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,439
neuroscience plant breeding and

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,280
biotechnology

18
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:50,558
this conversation starts already in

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,000
progress

20
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:53,198
important thing is that we go through a

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,840
lab report

22
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:57,759
lab report and show people

23
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,320
what are the things to look at

24
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:01,759
what can you like obviously in a lab

25
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,759
report there's all this built-in

26
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:04,399
information right

27
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:06,879
so

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,478
how can you take that information and

29
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:10,798
essentially infer things about the

30
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:12,879
results or see if you can identify

31
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,280
problems

32
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:17,118
with what the lab has done yeah right

33
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,560
and so you know what you sent me the

34
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,239
other day and i think you got those

35
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,920
posted on your ig or something yeah yeah

36
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:23,519
they're posted on the ig yeah so people

37
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,960
can check those out either now or later

38
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,118
but

39
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:29,919
you know like i said one of the things i

40
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:32,959
said to you back then was that um

41
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,960
it wasn't really

42
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,479
like that was those were results that

43
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,040
somebody had cut and pasted into a

44
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,560
spreadsheet yes yeah so that's an

45
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,399
opportunity for like anybody

46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,159
manipulating yeah yeah anybody can [ __ ]

47
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,320
with it at that point yeah in an excel

48
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,799
spreadsheet eventually

49
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,719
like a legal document in a way

50
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,240
yeah uh well they are they are legal

51
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,478
documents oh they are legal documents

52
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:54,478
yeah

53
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,359
especially when it comes to like you

54
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:58,959
know obviously there's all this

55
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:00,640
environmental testing that needs to be

56
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:03,919
done but yes in the context of

57
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,920
regulations like these are these are

58
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,399
legal documents that certify something

59
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,560
for the purpose of regulations that's

60
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,759
right yeah so that makes sense it's gone

61
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,840
to like a good standard right yeah

62
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:20,519
um i don't know why i'm not having any

63
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,520
luck suddenly sending this thing over

64
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:28,159
let me just do it this way

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,719
all right so that'll bring up a picture

66
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,000
and

67
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,159
you might want to actually go in and

68
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,280
copy the link from the picture

69
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,280
but um

70
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,959
this lab report is called the phytofax

71
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,280
and such artifacts were developed by

72
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,400
napro it's actually it's an image search

73
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,640
i don't know what comes up for you but

74
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,719
it's the top left picture

75
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,399
on that on that okay one sec i gotta

76
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:58,680
switch off here because it it'll it'll

77
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,680
pause me for a second one sec

78
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:18,239
there we go

79
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,920
you look really crazy when you were

80
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,878
frozen like you had this really bizarre

81
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:22,878
look there we go

82
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,280
i don't know if it'll even let me show

83
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,119
pictures on here now

84
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,400
you might just have to copy and paste

85
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,080
the link in or you know what we'll put

86
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,000
it up on our ig after some people yeah

87
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,920
let's put it up on that g after

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,039
um

89
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:38,719
yeah so

90
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:40,479
essentially like

91
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,158
look when you get back when most places

92
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:43,840
give you back a lab report i mean we're

93
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:44,959
looking at

94
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,400
even even if we're just talking

95
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,360
cannabinoids

96
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,680
you're looking at like

97
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,760
minimum 12 chemicals okay

98
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,760
because like i guess it's probably

99
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:56,878
important to talk a little bit about lab

100
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:58,719
testing

101
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:00,158
there's various ways there's different

102
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,479
assays that you can do so there's

103
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:04,959
different tests that you can run to try

104
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,399
and determine the cannabinoid content of

105
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,640
a sample

106
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,879
right yeah um

107
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,839
if you put it into a gc a gc's got

108
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:15,679
something it called

109
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,079
um what is it called the injection port

110
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,600
on a gt it's like putting what you do is

111
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,799
you take up you take

112
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,320
think about you like you got your bud

113
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,519
you put it in some alcohol or some

114
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:25,040
methanol or something that's going to

115
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,359
extract to catch me

116
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,400
you more or less shake it up and then

117
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,040
you take like one microliter

118
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:34,719
of the liquid that has now dissolved so

119
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,120
you got your ethanol but now you've got

120
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,759
all the stuff that came off the plant

121
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,600
yes right in that liquid and so what we

122
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,759
want to do is we take

123
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,840
we take a small sample of that liquid

124
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,000
out call it like a thousandth of a

125
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,918
milliliter milliliter

126
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,519
and that gets injected into this

127
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:52,879
injection port

128
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:55,519
of

129
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:57,040
the of the gas chromatic okay and so

130
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:58,399
what that does is it takes the liquid

131
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,160
that we have with all of our stuff

132
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,159
inside it and it makes it into a vapor

133
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,759
that that injection port is heated like

134
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,000
300 degrees

135
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,360
yeah they are 350 degrees celsius or

136
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,759
whatever so

137
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,960
the point is is when you put that [ __ ]

138
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,120
in

139
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:15,758
in the the liquid or sorry that liquid

140
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,560
into the injector and it becomes a vapor

141
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,560
it automatically decarboxylates yeah

142
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,079
right so you don't you no longer have

143
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,478
because the cannabis plant doesn't make

144
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:25,439
thc it makes thc acid

145
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:27,120
yeah

146
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:29,759
we really want to be able to detect the

147
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,360
compounds as they were in

148
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,479
the in the plant

149
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,000
right yeah

150
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:36,560
because what happens is when stuff gets

151
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,680
decarboxylated a certain percentage of

152
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,439
it

153
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,680
like gets destroyed in the conversion

154
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,680
process it just yeah

155
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,639
right so it's like if you start with

156
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,759
like 100 of thc acid or 100 molecules of

157
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,560
thc acid and say you lose 20 of those

158
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,520
molecules as it gets converted into thc

159
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,600
yeah

160
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:58,240
when you get a report at the end that

161
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,560
shows 80 milligrams of you know thc or

162
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,478
80 units of thc that's not what was

163
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,360
actually in the sample right our testing

164
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:06,959
method has destroyed part of the sample

165
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,560
and so if you go back and look at like

166
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:09,359
all the cannabinoid testing that's been

167
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,720
done

168
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,240
you know in the scientific literature

169
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,319
60s 70s 80s most of it was done on dc

170
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,319
right so the numbers that we see

171
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,879
are going to be lower than really what

172
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,280
was in the plant and so call it like

173
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:24,800
that's interesting roughly after 2000

174
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:26,318
sometime it might have been like late

175
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,720
90s

176
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,120
people started realizing hey now we need

177
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,960
to do this in what's called an hplc or a

178
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,478
high pressure liquid chromatograph

179
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,000
chromatograph

180
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,839
and okay the liquid chromatograph

181
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,079
doesn't do that initial

182
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:42,000
the carboxylation step right because

183
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:44,959
your sample it gets rather going into

184
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,600
ejection in an injection port your micro

185
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:49,120
microliter of liquid sample that we use

186
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,160
to extract you know our extraction

187
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,560
buffer from the plant yeah that gets

188
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,520
injected into like a stream of other

189
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,478
liquid

190
00:06:55,519 --> 00:07:01,439
that runs through the machine at like 25

191
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:03,199
27 30 degrees right maybe 40 degrees

192
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,360
so that's not a big deal that's not

193
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,478
decarboxylating anything so the

194
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,319
chemicals that are in that

195
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:12,800
uh in the hplc and the liquid

196
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,720
chromatograph they don't change right so

197
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,199
what we're getting if we use that method

198
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,880
is an accurate representation of what's

199
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,919
in the

200
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:23,199
uh what's in the sample okay wow okay

201
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:26,000
plant and so it's a much better

202
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,240
technique for using for cannabinoids is

203
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,399
that what they use now

204
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,598
not all labs are the same right so this

205
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:33,359
is kind of the way

206
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:35,279
here's the thing is the la the the

207
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,960
regulations usually say

208
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:39,679
you have to develop a test that will

209
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:41,439
accurately quantify cannabinoids yeah

210
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,918
and that test must be

211
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:45,360
what's called validated and validated

212
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:47,198
just means like you run a set of

213
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,280
experiments using your

214
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,919
your your protocol to show that your

215
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:53,598
protocol is

216
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:55,439
actually measuring what you say it's

217
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:57,360
measuring yes right it's like it's like

218
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:59,759
calibrating your ruler it's like proving

219
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,120
that your ruler is calibrated yeah yeah

220
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,960
right makes sense like you're not saying

221
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,240
stuff's 12 inches when really it's like

222
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:06,079
you know eight and a half inches or

223
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,079
whatever right it's the same kind of

224
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:09,680
thing yeah that's what validation is

225
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:11,680
and so the regulations say you have to

226
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,199
develop a validated method but they

227
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,959
don't tell you you have to use this

228
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,960
exact method with this machine and this

229
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:19,279
column and this solvent and this

230
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:21,359
extraction buffer right and so yeah what

231
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:22,638
ends up happening is every lab develops

232
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,400
and you'll see if you go and ask them

233
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,199
about their methods a lot of them will

234
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:27,439
come back and say well that's

235
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,800
proprietary we can't disclose to you the

236
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:30,639
way we do that

237
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,360
right and that's a bit of a red flag

238
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,599
like if i'm yeah

239
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,879
you know like i'm not a one-off like we

240
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,719
do it in-house because it gets too

241
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:40,479
expensive but you need to do it as a

242
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,479
third party but if i am working in a

243
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,680
with a third-party lab we're not just

244
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,080
running one or two tests like we're

245
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,599
gonna be running hundreds of tests right

246
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,000
so we're essentially paying them to

247
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,480
generate data for us right so

248
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,919
i need to be sure

249
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,519
that the test that you guys are running

250
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:57,439
actually measures what it says so i'll

251
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,759
go in to a lab and say show me all your

252
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,279
validation documents yeah right

253
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:02,639
they won't let you photocopy them take

254
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:04,000
them with you but you can certainly sit

255
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:05,360
down in their office and read through

256
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,480
their method

257
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,919
right and we've done this like when i

258
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,839
was working at napo we did this with

259
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:13,599
multiple different labs because

260
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,399
naper was a research lab and we had

261
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,200
dispensary clients that were

262
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,080
so

263
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,680
you know

264
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,920
growers that we represented would grow

265
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:23,838
the samples we would analyze the results

266
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:26,240
they'd go off to the lab or they go off

267
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,920
the dispensary but the dispensary would

268
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,240
be using like

269
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:33,120
one or two or three of the biggest labs

270
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,200
in california for the same samples right

271
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,639
so we had our data

272
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,399
that we knew was

273
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:40,480
damn solid and we've published the

274
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,240
method so anybody can go and check out

275
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,159
why it's solid

276
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,560
but it's like we had real confidence in

277
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,399
that our results were right but we would

278
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,239
what would happen is because our client

279
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,440
would send off the same sample that we

280
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,278
had data for to multiple labs

281
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:59,200
we would get back

282
00:09:55,278 --> 00:10:00,240
that are essentially duplicate copies of

283
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,720
the same

284
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,879
results yeah but with somebody else's

285
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,560
lab right so it was generated by

286
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:09,039
something else and you'd see

287
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:12,078
oh this lab can identify

288
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:13,439
terpenoline or this lab is confusing cbd

289
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:16,078
and cbg

290
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,160
oh wow right like those are pretty big

291
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:21,120
deals right yeah that's a big deal well

292
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:23,199
yeah again like

293
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,278
99.9 percent of the samples they see are

294
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,278
thc only so it doesn't really matter

295
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:30,000
whether that tiny little blip is cbd or

296
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:31,679
cbg but yeah you know you'd again like

297
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,679
if we're saying that this is a legal

298
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:35,199
document that supports the regulations

299
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:37,278
that are that have been created to

300
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,480
protect cannabis like it's kind of an

301
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:41,919
important thing yeah yeah you think so

302
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,480
so yeah

303
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:46,000
and so in the in the gas chromatography

304
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,879
when they do that kind of sample with

305
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
ethanol is that little tiny one

306
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:54,639
milliliter that they or point whatever

307
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,440
milliliters is that homogeneous enough

308
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:58,879
when they pull it to be a great average

309
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,519
of the sample that they're taking is

310
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:03,120
that is it is that how that works yeah

311
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,039
and it's like that's a very good

312
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,240
question so the sampling of the one

313
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,639
microliter

314
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,680
thing like you can you can imagine that

315
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:11,838
like

316
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:13,759
every step along that process from

317
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,760
taking the flower it actually goes back

318
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:17,120
it's like it starts with the sampling

319
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:19,200
procedure

320
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,799
how did you get the bud out of the bag

321
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,519
that it was grown in or out of the lot

322
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:25,278
that it was grown in okay and so

323
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,480
very often what happens

324
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:27,200
is this is

325
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,639
like

326
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,240
listen everybody's found all sorts of

327
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:33,360
ways to game the system because the

328
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,839
consumer is so thc driven yeah

329
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:39,120
everybody is trying to work every single

330
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,640
snap angle right so for example growers

331
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,720
will go and cherry pick all the biggest

332
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:44,319
nicest beautiful buds out of the thing

333
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,600
the biggest buds are the top of the

334
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,760
plant they get to of course they're

335
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,480
going to have a lot of chemical content

336
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:51,838
right and so if you want a real number

337
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,240
of the batch

338
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,160
we developed a sampling method where you

339
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,079
know you take one bud this big and one

340
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:59,838
bud this big and then one bud this big

341
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:02,078
and they all get combined together or

342
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,079
you know so many grams of each the whole

343
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:06,078
thing gets blended up

344
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:07,519
and and homogenized and then you use

345
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:09,359
that homogenized sample to do your

346
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,799
extraction from right

347
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,320
people dumped it like if you're showing

348
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:14,078
up at fc labs and you're trying to like

349
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,600
get a feed company you're trying to sell

350
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:17,439
a million seeds

351
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,440
they go and they chop off the top this

352
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,200
nice big buds and they trim all the like

353
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,560
the grainy leafy parts off so there's

354
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:27,200
like absolutely nothing but resin yeah

355
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:28,958
and then those pristine beautiful baby

356
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,000
labs go off the samples go off to the

357
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:31,119
left yeah you're going to get a [ __ ]

358
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,360
higher number

359
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,879
right that's that should be obvious but

360
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,240
these are the games that end up getting

361
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,399
played because

362
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,919
the more thc you got in your sample

363
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,519
the better the distributors and the

364
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:43,199
retailers and everybody is you know

365
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,919
anybody that's thc focus they're gonna

366
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,240
get

367
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:48,000
bamboozled from that kind of stuff right

368
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,839
yeah and so like you said there's

369
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,480
there's that's just sampling the flower

370
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,240
now it goes to the lab like maybe the

371
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,320
lab's like getting paid a decent fee and

372
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,799
they like put like an extra you know

373
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,720
point five or five percent extra flour

374
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:02,879
in the scale when they go to do the

375
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,680
extraction buffer like there's there's a

376
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:07,679
million ways between

377
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:09,759
the plants and getting

378
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:12,000
you know that injection going into the

379
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:14,879
injection port ways to manipulate the

380
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,399
sample yeah forget like intentionally

381
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:19,519
manipulating it

382
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,919
there's also like natural variation and

383
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,360
like experimental error that happens

384
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:25,679
yeah that is going to allow that is

385
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,720
going to have on a loud variation and so

386
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,159
one thing we were talking about the

387
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,120
other day is that like for example in

388
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:31,120
canada

389
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:35,360
the regulation says

390
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,959
that the thc content in the flower

391
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,600
um

392
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:41,359
must be whatever's labeled on the on the

393
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,000
bag or the box however it's labeled for

394
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,079
thc content yeah that has to be within

395
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,480
plus or minus 15

396
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:51,759
of the actual amount well so that's like

397
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,560
if it's 20 and it's actual 20

398
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:58,799
15 20 is three so that means

399
00:13:54,559 --> 00:14:01,198
that like 23 to 17 or 17 to 23

400
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:03,679
is actually like that plus or minus 15

401
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:04,799
window on either side of 20 right yeah

402
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:06,719
so

403
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:09,919
like it's important for people to

404
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,920
understand that like

405
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:16,240
with a loud error that's to be expected

406
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,880
there's really no difference between 17

407
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,639
and 23

408
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:24,799
and then and again that would apply like

409
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:27,120
between 30 and 24 right like

410
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:28,639
well yeah as you go up like yeah up to

411
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,039
30 now

412
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:33,519
you know but 50 of 30 is four and a half

413
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:36,480
percent right so you've got like 34

414
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:38,879
percent down to like what is it 26 five

415
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,278
and a half right 25 and a half yeah yeah

416
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:45,039
so like that's a huge [ __ ] rate yeah

417
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:48,159
as you get higher it gets wider yeah

418
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:50,078
and listen that is cannabinoids

419
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:51,759
cannabinoids are typically regulated by

420
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:53,919
regulation like the regulator whoever

421
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:56,399
makes the rules for the you know to set

422
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:59,039
up a legal program says hey can havenoid

423
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:01,120
lab test have to be with plus or minus

424
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:02,879
within plus or minus 15 that's what

425
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,000
that's going to be our allowed range so

426
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:06,159
your

427
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,559
your assay that or that protocol that

428
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:10,159
your lab designs to generate this thing

429
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:11,439
it has to hit between these two goat

430
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:14,000
balls well

431
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,120
like for example terps aren't regulated

432
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,720
in canada

433
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,399
right so they're terms

434
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,160
cannabinoids

435
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,120
no they're not catalyzed okay

436
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:23,039
yeah

437
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,399
their cannabinoids are a specific class

438
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:25,679
that bind to the cannabinoid receptor

439
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,958
and it's arguably like only

440
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:30,319
beta-carotene binds to one of them

441
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,838
so

442
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,079
but they're they're a different chemical

443
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,680
class but like you know all of us all

444
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:37,519
the producers

445
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,599
and retailers they want that terpene

446
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,399
info on the label right because it is

447
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,278
somewhat informative to the consumer so

448
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,320
it's another way that you can

449
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:45,759
differentiate your product say hey

450
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,040
mine's different because this is the

451
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,839
chemical well

452
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:52,319
yeah terpenoids or terpenes aren't

453
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:54,720
regulated in the system like there is no

454
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,480
requirement to analyze and disclose the

455
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,199
amount of terpene content on a flower

456
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,159
it's like it's purely an extra thing

457
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:01,919
yeah

458
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:04,000
so because they're not regulated

459
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,519
molecules there's no [ __ ] regulations

460
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,198
that says

461
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,560
hey it has to be within

462
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:12,240
15 allowable range

463
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:14,000
so in canada

464
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,360
and i'm sure it's i don't know exactly

465
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
what it is it probably varies by

466
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,839
district in the state but at least

467
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,320
because they're not

468
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,240
regulated labs set their own allowable

469
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,199
acceptable rate so

470
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,198
i validated one labs method

471
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:31,679
and i was reading through their

472
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:32,559
described allowable range is 30 plus or

473
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:33,838
minus

474
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,879
jesus

475
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,079
so

476
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:40,480
you've got like let's call it like

477
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:42,000
well let's call it six percent terps

478
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,039
yeah right

479
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,839
a third is like two out of those six so

480
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:49,120
that's essentially saying like

481
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,639
you know two percent on either side of

482
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,600
six that's like from four to eight

483
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,198
percent range yeah that the lab can't

484
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,519
really differentiate between the

485
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:59,439
difference between those two things

486
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,560
right yeah

487
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,079
um

488
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:03,359
like that's a bomb that's a huge bummer

489
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:05,918
i don't think people understand that

490
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,318
because you know when some of these labs

491
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:11,759
publish the results they're like oh you

492
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:14,399
have like three point four seven nine

493
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:17,038
per uh milligrams of

494
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:20,640
3.579

495
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:23,038
um percent mirror scene yeah right well

496
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,160
it's like dude if it's 30

497
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:25,838
off

498
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,919
why the hell are we measuring it down to

499
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:30,159
three decimals yeah that's true that's

500
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,400
wild yeah it's it's intense

501
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,679
right it's like you just it's so dumb

502
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,200
but again

503
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,440
you have to realize there's a difference

504
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,759
between accurately labeling labeling the

505
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,558
information on a product

506
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:44,720
versus how can you stick information on

507
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:47,519
a label of a product to sway a

508
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,319
consumer's buying preference right yeah

509
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,400
um

510
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:53,200
and clearly those aren't the same thing

511
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,200
no right so not at all it's kind of i

512
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,919
think it's really

513
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,679
well

514
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,600
for anybody watching like if you're just

515
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,720
basing things on thc numbers you're

516
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:04,079
getting fooled like you're getting

517
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,120
bamboozled right yeah um

518
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:07,119
you're getting you're having your

519
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:10,000
marketing emotions played with right and

520
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:11,678
this is this is what companies do

521
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,200
um

522
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,798
so understanding that all in context

523
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,640
maybe let's think about going back and

524
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:19,679
looking at like a lab report right and

525
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,520
so

526
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,120
for in the in the numbers that you sent

527
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:25,038
me one of the things i found really

528
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:27,359
interesting was you know whenever i look

529
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:29,519
at a lab report my first thing is

530
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:31,678
i mean like everybody goes to straight

531
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:34,079
to tac or straight to terpene content or

532
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,038
whatever i don't know i go who who's the

533
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,798
lab

534
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:38,720
yeah right who's the lab are these guys

535
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:40,720
trustworthy or not and after like a

536
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,360
thousand lab reports or 2000 lab reports

537
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,200
you start to say hey these guys always

538
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:48,639
have like you know like all of their

539
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,880
roosevelts are like 33 to 38 thc like

540
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,759
yeah

541
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,840
really yeah i applied that same logic

542
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:57,679
rate of things or to seed companies you

543
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:59,199
know like i see them working with things

544
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,960
like 40 different things that have been

545
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,679
non-existent for 40 years and i'm like

546
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,279
okay well full of [ __ ] you know yeah

547
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,400
yeah yeah and it's marketing right and

548
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:08,480
the thing is too like the other thing

549
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,640
you got to keep in mind too it's like

550
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,120
when we see these hchc scores like 30

551
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,360
plus percent thc acid that's a huge

552
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:17,038
amount yeah there really is like a

553
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:20,558
[ __ ] massive amount for a plant to

554
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:23,759
produce that was one flower on one run

555
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:26,319
right that's really what was sampled

556
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:28,079
if you follow that cultivar

557
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:30,399
back through five ten cycles like you'll

558
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:32,399
see 28 26

559
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,080
i'm sure but the one that always appears

560
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,120
on the seed bank

561
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:38,480
package says it's 34 oh yeah yeah right

562
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:40,639
so like

563
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,400
people got to realize that like when

564
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,038
you're being fed one of these numbers

565
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:48,880
especially if it doesn't come on

566
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:50,240
that certified letterhead legal document

567
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,000
and they're fine at the bottom like if

568
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,679
you go down and look at it it's signed

569
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,319
by the laboratory manager right because

570
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,320
again that's part of this

571
00:19:56,319 --> 00:20:00,720
chain of custody thing that happens with

572
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:01,759
regulated ship right yeah

573
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,200
so

574
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:07,679
um yeah so check out the lab okay yeah

575
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,600
secondly

576
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,840
look before even looking at the numbers

577
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,959
like i i was like you know i always want

578
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:14,798
to say

579
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,279
before i can put any confidence in these

580
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:19,359
numbers i need to try and figure out how

581
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:21,519
those numbers were generated yes right

582
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:25,279
and so a lab report should say

583
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:27,038
cannabinoids were were analyzed by hplc

584
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:29,359
so they had a laboratory back and it

585
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:32,000
says cannabinoids are analyzed by gc oh

586
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:33,519
it's like right there i'm like okay well

587
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,798
the cannabinoid numbers could be off by

588
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:37,038
30

589
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:39,519
yeah right because we've done those

590
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:41,839
experiments and you can burn up to 30 or

591
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:44,000
30 of the total cannabinoid content in

592
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:46,000
an injection port of a gc

593
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,839
inject like gcs are not a great

594
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,240
instrument for measuring cannabinoids

595
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:52,399
even though all the analysis like up to

596
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,200
the mid-90s was done that way

597
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,360
right yeah but for terpenes for example

598
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,360
it's actually a great way to do it

599
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:01,119
and so

600
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:03,199
a lot of very good labs what they'll do

601
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:05,199
is they'll do it you'll do your you know

602
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,360
you put your bud grind it up

603
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,798
homogenize it take your sample put in

604
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:10,639
your ethanol or methanol or whatever

605
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:13,119
your extraction buffer is

606
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,880
strip out the contents separate out the

607
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:17,119
solid material now you've got your

608
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,760
little liquid yeah with all your goodies

609
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:19,759
in it right

610
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,919
that often gets split into two different

611
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,400
samples or you will sample two different

612
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:29,759
one microliter amounts from there one

613
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:33,280
goes it gets injected into an hplc

614
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:36,319
for cannabinoid a separate one goes into

615
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:38,399
uh an hpls or sorry a gc for terpenoid

616
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:39,918
or terpene okay okay

617
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,280
we actually used to do two different

618
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:45,759
things when we sent the one off to

619
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:46,960
the the hplc we would take uh your

620
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:49,038
sample out

621
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,200
and then we would take one raw sample

622
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:53,759
out of that subsample and the other one

623
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,080
would get diluted by a factor of 10.

624
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:58,400
so you have nine parts nine microliters

625
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:00,639
of of the solvent mixed in so now what

626
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,360
you do is you have

627
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,480
a diluted sample and a concentrated

628
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:06,879
sample

629
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,319
and so the concentrated sample is good

630
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,840
for

631
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:14,158
all the very small

632
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:16,240
components that exist like you know cbc

633
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,000
the cbg maybe

634
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,519
whatever the little blip cannabinoids

635
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,558
are essentially you've got one that's

636
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:22,158
like really

637
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:24,399
it's like being able to zoom in on those

638
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,400
with a magnifying glass yeah yeah

639
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,240
your diluted sample for the molecules

640
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,080
that are there in abundance

641
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,558
right because if you try to often if you

642
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:34,798
try to cram those like thc like a type

643
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:36,480
one plant that's full of thc you cram

644
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:39,038
that through your hplc and it just it

645
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,120
overloads the detector okay so you

646
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:43,038
wanted it so

647
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:44,879
as you can see all these places are

648
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:47,839
opportunity for error

649
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:51,679
yeah if you do them very very carefully

650
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:53,519
you can actually get incredibly um

651
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,000
incredibly accurate results now if

652
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:58,240
you're like running

653
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,359
a thousand two thousand samples a week

654
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,359
that come into your commercial

655
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:03,359
laboratory in california

656
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:04,798
dude that's like three throughput

657
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:06,240
yeah right so it's like you're you're

658
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:08,240
essentially breaking down how many can i

659
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,079
do in a day okay well if i'm doing that

660
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,079
many a day maybe i don't have the

661
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:13,839
ability to do it quite as accurately

662
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:15,678
yeah right and so these are the

663
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:16,959
decisions that get made in the lab that

664
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,640
no one's thinking about everybody just

665
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,240
thinks you drop down your 120 bucks or

666
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,080
150 bucks and you get a bunch of numbers

667
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,000
back and it's proof of them yeah you

668
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:26,639
just toss it in the machine bam

669
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,159
yeah it's not like that right so

670
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,559
it's just important for people to

671
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,240
understand the context right so

672
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:33,918
do um did you want to go over the

673
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,038
standard what the standard is how it

674
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,200
works

675
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:39,679
yeah so chemicals so any machine has to

676
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,278
be calibrated right

677
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,519
um

678
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:43,519
and

679
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:47,759
how's the best way to explain it when we

680
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:48,960
take you get you so you got your bud

681
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,640
okay get your butt call us our

682
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,720
extraction buffer you put a flower in

683
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,120
there you put in your ethanol and shake

684
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,960
around blah blah blah

685
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:58,719
send out the flower oops say about the

686
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,480
flower i just threw a sample all over

687
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,759
the ground

688
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,558
you said about the flower and you got

689
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:04,960
your

690
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:07,200
your you're left over what we've got is

691
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,798
ethanol or methanol whatever it doesn't

692
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,480
matter your solvent

693
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:12,240
with all the chemicals that we were able

694
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,079
to strip out of the cannabis plant

695
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,519
material so you got turf got all the

696
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:17,839
different cannabinoids

697
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:21,519
a standard like but we don't know how

698
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:23,519
much of everything is in that

699
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:26,639
sample like it's an unknown amount of

700
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:28,319
unknown chemicals in the sample right

701
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,919
and what we need to do is compare it to

702
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:31,038
a known sample

703
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,000
and so

704
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:36,400
you can actually order peer thc from a

705
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,079
lab synthesis company and these

706
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,320
synthesis companies that are allowed to

707
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:42,240
have you know they get a dea license so

708
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:43,278
that like the cops can have and they'll

709
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,798
they'll sell

710
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:47,119
they'll get a dea license so they can

711
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:49,200
synthesize thc and make

712
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:50,959
what are what are known as like a

713
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,120
chemical standard which is usually one

714
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,240
milligram of thc

715
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:58,558
into one milliliter of methanol yeah

716
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,880
well methanol is an alcohol but it's not

717
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:03,440
like ethanol it's poisonous go blind so

718
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,400
the idea is people won't consume it so

719
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,000
it's

720
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,960
so weird that anybody would like

721
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,880
consider the idea to go get thc standard

722
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,400
ethanol and like [ __ ] shoot it or

723
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,480
whatever they're doing and do with it

724
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,720
it's wild yeah but this is what the dea

725
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,360
is the the context of the da's thinking

726
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,798
in progress right like yeah of course

727
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:23,199
thc and someone's gonna try and get high

728
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:26,400
a milligram like dude really yeah you

729
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,558
know like even like a 20 bud is like 200

730
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,480
milligrams yeah right so it's like you

731
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:32,079
really you're going to try to anyway

732
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,599
of course you don't but that's the

733
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:35,278
theory behind it but

734
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:38,240
one milligram

735
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:40,079
in one milliliter of ethanol is legal

736
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,400
yeah right it's legal people can buy and

737
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:44,639
trade it without having licenses

738
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,640
so

739
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,520
now you have your one milligram

740
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:51,278
milliliter you can essentially treat

741
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:53,119
that like your extraction buffer

742
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:53,839
extracted cannabis plant you can take

743
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:56,319
like

744
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:58,480
one microliter out of that milliliter

745
00:25:56,319 --> 00:26:00,960
injected into your hplc and you get a

746
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:04,000
peak of a known amount and you can say

747
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:07,360
okay this peak is i know that it's this

748
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,798
known amount we're putting in boom

749
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:12,639
you know now i can when i run

750
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:14,558
another sample and it has a peak of the

751
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,880
same size i know that it had the

752
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:18,399
equivalent amount of thc so it's a way

753
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,320
that you can calibrate your machines

754
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,000
okay got it and

755
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:23,678
good labs will do what are called check

756
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,440
standards like you run your calibration

757
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,559
curve you get the machine all calibrated

758
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,558
and then like

759
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:29,759
call it every three or five or maybe 10

760
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:31,519
runs

761
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:33,919
rather than running a sample you run

762
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:36,000
your standard through for your standard

763
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,960
mix of terpene standards and cannabinoid

764
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,679
standards

765
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,200
and what that should do is that like

766
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,480
now you have throughout your day you've

767
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,558
got your 100 samples that are going

768
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,480
through the lab say every 10

769
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:48,558
you've got like a snapshot of the

770
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,278
machine in calibration

771
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:51,678
yeah

772
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:52,880
and if it's out you can see oh hey we

773
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,840
caught it while it was getting out of

774
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:58,000
calibration was recalibrated right

775
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:59,839
that makes sense it's an important it's

776
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,359
for any analytical

777
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:03,359
uh endeavor where you're trying to

778
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:05,519
figure out like hey what's this exact

779
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:06,558
amount of compound in a plant or a

780
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:08,319
substance

781
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:09,678
you want to have the ability to compound

782
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:11,519
her to

783
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,880
to validate that number confirm that the

784
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:14,720
amount that you're measuring is actually

785
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,400
what you're measuring right

786
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,798
yeah um

787
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:20,960
so it's a great question because like

788
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:22,798
when our my friend arnold has

789
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,120
a dutch research scientist that was

790
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:27,278
involved in setting up the dutch system

791
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:28,879
and he's a real plant nerd guy and he

792
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:30,798
started doing all this research and he

793
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,480
wanted to to check to see if the

794
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:34,000
standards from the chemical company are

795
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,120
or are what they were you know they're

796
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,960
supposed to be

797
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:38,558
one milligram per milliliter well he did

798
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,798
a whole bunch of tests and showed that

799
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:43,918
the standard when it was actually 88 or

800
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:44,639
0.88 milligrams oh no

801
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,880
so

802
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:50,080
the the the substance that the guys are

803
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,520
selling to all the labs

804
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:53,038
wasn't properly calibrated that means

805
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:55,839
everybody in the industry is off right

806
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:58,079
or everybody yeah that's from most guys

807
00:27:55,839 --> 00:28:01,599
like this is we're talking you know

808
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:03,359
i think this is like 20 2009

809
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:04,719
but two years ago in canada the same

810
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:07,119
thing happened right like somebody

811
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,278
identified that hey you know the restek

812
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:11,199
sample that was restek is a supplier for

813
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:13,119
standards the res tech samples that

814
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,360
everybody uses to calibrate or but half

815
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:17,359
the industry uses calibrate they've been

816
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:19,599
wrong for eight months

817
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:21,599
and they kept that quiet

818
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:23,839
it comes up in the circles but it

819
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:24,719
doesn't like yeah it does come up if you

820
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:26,480
if you're

821
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,480
it listen when that happens they have to

822
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,640
like they're legally didn't send it

823
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,720
required but again you're the support

824
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,640
industry for a regulated system

825
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,079
yeah you [ __ ] up that's affecting

826
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,960
everybody how they're complying with the

827
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:40,960
regulations it's like they are closed

828
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,480
right so it does it does become known to

829
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,278
much lab but again it's the type of

830
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,960
thing that like the labs might

831
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:48,000
they're not required to disclose to the

832
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,200
public

833
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,720
yeah yeah right

834
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,360
they probably should disclose to their

835
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,558
clients but often they don't right yeah

836
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:55,918
um

837
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:57,759
or it can happen that they don't so

838
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,278
anyway like

839
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:00,879
yeah that's a chemical standard and you

840
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:02,398
buy a chemical essentially if you're

841
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,880
calibrating for cannabinoids like you

842
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:06,239
know i was just on the sc lab website

843
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,640
reading over through some of their stuff

844
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,599
they they test for 39 terpenes and

845
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:14,240
terpenoids so they've even

846
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:17,038
they either have a standard mix that a

847
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:19,038
chemical supplier supplies or

848
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:21,278
they buy individually all of those

849
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:22,960
individual terpenes and

850
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:25,440
create their own standard mix that they

851
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,360
use to to calibrate the machine so

852
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,640
you're not only calibrating for thc

853
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:29,759
you're calibrating for terps if you're

854
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,679
running the test

855
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:33,038
every individual terpene

856
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,559
yeah wow

857
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:35,839
yeah and like i said some now they've

858
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:37,599
gotten to the point where

859
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:39,038
like uh you know

860
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:41,119
say

861
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:42,640
res tech or someone one of these terpe

862
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:44,719
or these supply chemical supply

863
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,159
companies that services the medical

864
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,240
cannabis industry

865
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:51,200
they might say hey we've done the mix

866
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,919
for you here's 15 terpenes you know all

867
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,319
the majors or whatever yeah the pioneers

868
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:58,240
trumpetly blah blah blah and you'll buy

869
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:59,599
a pre-mixed

870
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,440
one of those so that you don't have to

871
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:03,599
individually go and create the standard

872
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,159
to put it to calibrate your dc

873
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:08,079
yeah um but again anytime you're buying

874
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,760
a compound that you're not making and

875
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:11,759
you're not quantifying your say itself

876
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:13,519
is a potential source of error

877
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:15,038
yeah absolutely

878
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:16,960
so

879
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:18,960
yeah it's a bit of a deal

880
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,720
so wow so when we started looking at

881
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,720
your results i started going through

882
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,480
them i realized

883
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,919
whoever was generating those results for

884
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,558
one

885
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,559
like again it was data pasted into uh an

886
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:33,359
excel spreadsheet yeah it wasn't even a

887
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:34,960
lab report so like one like right off

888
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:36,798
the bat it's like how much i'm not

889
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,038
saying it was the numbers were wrong but

890
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:40,158
if somebody gave it no yeah my red flags

891
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:42,480
would be like okay

892
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,520
something could be up here yeah the

893
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,038
second thing i went through and i

894
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:46,480
started looking at what's the ratio of

895
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:48,798
thc

896
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,720
um in the plant versus thc acid in the

897
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:52,480
plant as you probably know cannabis

898
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,720
doesn't produce thc it produces the

899
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,159
natural form phc acid

900
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,600
and so

901
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,960
if right right

902
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:00,639
right away if you get a live report back

903
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,840
and there's junk thc in there like i'm

904
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:06,799
talking more than really a percent

905
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:08,079
yeah it's probably been run through a gc

906
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:10,000
so it's like okay

907
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:13,439
if the thc numbers are coming out like

908
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,240
you know 20 thc 25 whatever that's yeah

909
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:19,600
you should see 25 percent thc acid

910
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:21,759
you couldn't see 25 percent thc so

911
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:24,639
right here again like just by that one

912
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:25,839
number you can see oh they measure the

913
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,399
whether or not they measure the

914
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:29,918
cannabinoids through plc or through gc

915
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:31,439
if it's through gc the number is

916
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,278
probably wrong

917
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,080
because again we know that a bunch of it

918
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:38,000
gets destroyed in the injector right so

919
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:40,480
there's things that you can like right

920
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,240
off the top look at you know most people

921
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,000
are looking at the they grab the lab

922
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,798
report they go straight to the thc

923
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,640
number and they're like 32 i'm the best

924
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:50,480
yeah right and it's like that's you

925
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,320
shouldn't be doing that right yeah

926
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,159
looking at the context of what that

927
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:56,158
number means

928
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:57,760
is all the information in this lab

929
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,519
report consistent

930
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:01,519
right and internally consistent like

931
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,120
this between each other

932
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,640
yeah like the queen itself doesn't make

933
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:06,558
sense and so that was one of the things

934
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:09,278
that's that tweaked me a little bit when

935
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:12,000
i first saw yours it was like

936
00:32:09,278 --> 00:32:13,440
they had clearly run in hplc

937
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,119
and gc

938
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,640
which is fine i mean like i said if

939
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:18,479
you're using it for the terps the gc is

940
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,360
fine but they were probably it looked

941
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,278
like they were collecting that

942
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:24,879
cannabinoid data as they were doing the

943
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:26,480
terpene run as well ah okay so it's like

944
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,799
you know in my i'm like looking at i'm

945
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,558
like ignore that yeah don't even look at

946
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:32,240
that don't even put any credence into it

947
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:34,398
because it's just

948
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,079
it's weird well and

949
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:38,158
with me like when i see something off

950
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:40,158
like that and like when it comes to

951
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,760
terps and lab reports the reason i sent

952
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:44,000
it to you of course when we talked i was

953
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:45,919
like i don't know like i have no fun

954
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,200
clue you can read this what what is it

955
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,640
but like

956
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,200
yeah i i

957
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,360
i i'm like anybody else you know like i

958
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,200
i see that and i'm like wow thc number

959
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:56,639
wow cool high terp numbers what's this

960
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,640
tell me you asked me about a year ago

961
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,480
ryan when you start getting

962
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,240
uh skeptical about a lab report and i

963
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,558
said when somebody says to me i have a

964
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,319
lab report for you to see

965
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:08,480
right you should already be skeptical of

966
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:09,599
the results and that's okay like it's

967
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,480
not like you're trying to hate on

968
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:15,278
somebody's report card no but you should

969
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,960
be yeah you have to be right like you

970
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:18,480
that is the mentality that you have to

971
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,360
have are these numbers that i'm looking

972
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,360
at really real yeah right

973
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:25,759
yes

974
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:28,798
because like again like you know you

975
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:30,480
hear i hear for a while in in washington

976
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:32,158
they were calling them thc stores it's

977
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,200
not a [ __ ] score

978
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,960
like you didn't win a race you know

979
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,038
this is an analysis of what's in the

980
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,038
flower that you grew yeah

981
00:33:39,038 --> 00:33:43,759
and like yeah you played a role in that

982
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:46,398
but it's mostly genetics right like

983
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:48,000
you know anyway it's just funny like you

984
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:50,479
you know in this world that we're in

985
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,839
like there's so much grower's ego right

986
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,839
where it's like oh yeah you know and

987
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:56,079
it's like i really like let's try to

988
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:58,720
tease those two things apart

989
00:33:56,079 --> 00:34:00,480
right with how awesome you are from the

990
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,839
weed that you grew i'm like all for

991
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,839
telling people that they grow great meat

992
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:05,839
you go great flower i mean i'm always

993
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:07,038
impressed i don't care who it is yeah

994
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:09,039
right it's like if you're truly

995
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:10,239
producing the finest that's great like

996
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:11,759
people like that in my opinion are

997
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:14,078
helping the world

998
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,760
right but if you're just growing

999
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,800
like looking for lab of course you can

1000
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,720
run around the world telling how

1001
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,480
everybody how cool you are it's like

1002
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,838
yeah it doesn't impress me like i've

1003
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,838
seen enough lava boards that like i

1004
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:26,000
don't it's like who cares great you

1005
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:27,679
gotta you got a big one it's like great

1006
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,760
you know what i mean like yeah we if

1007
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:32,720
you've grown up plants especially from

1008
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:35,280
seed you're gonna find some big ones

1009
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:37,598
yeah right big big big plants and big

1010
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,280
big high numbers so

1011
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:41,280
anyway that's like a good thing to look

1012
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,200
at look at the cannabinoids are you know

1013
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,599
are you seeing neutral cannabinoids or

1014
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,480
acidic cannabinoids or bones

1015
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,639
right

1016
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,599
you want to be seen both and you want

1017
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:54,079
your neutrals like thc cbd cbg you want

1018
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:56,720
those numbers to be really low yeah um

1019
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:58,480
because that's an indicator

1020
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:00,319
that your lab report is good and now you

1021
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,760
sent me like for example so you sent me

1022
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,039
one and one had like i think there was

1023
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,599
like three and a three and a four

1024
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:07,199
percent or terp-wise yes they're both

1025
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,559
like i mean those are

1026
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:10,078
we had a we had what we called the

1027
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:11,759
schwag flag

1028
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:13,119
and it's really like under one percent

1029
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,040
so we would just discard anything that

1030
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:17,119
was under one percent terpene content

1031
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:20,480
yeah because they're they're not like

1032
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:22,160
they're 80s weed it's not that they're

1033
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,880
bad yeah

1034
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:28,239
it's just not the oiliest dankest like

1035
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,440
super drippy oily weed right

1036
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:31,118
um

1037
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,720
and so we would just automatically

1038
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,320
anything under it doesn't even get

1039
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:37,279
considered for the

1040
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,280
for you know quality and then

1041
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,040
we started you know this is a few years

1042
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,519
ago but we were you know getting into

1043
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:45,920
the four or five percent range

1044
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:47,599
and through breeding the highest

1045
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,680
terpenoid producing plants we were able

1046
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:52,640
to get some like outliers that were up

1047
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:55,199
to like even seven percent or even

1048
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:56,960
which is like ridiculously oily yeah

1049
00:35:55,199 --> 00:36:00,000
um

1050
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,679
so you know you can do that but

1051
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,440
again like you really want to have

1052
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:05,679
confidence in the lab that you're doing

1053
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,039
exactly and

1054
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:10,078
as a

1055
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:11,679
as a breeder like a home breeder it gets

1056
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:14,000
really [ __ ] expensive to use thirty

1057
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:16,559
party third party laps because it does

1058
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,480
you're growing a hundred plants

1059
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:21,119
like that's like a ten thousand dollar

1060
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,800
analytical bill yeah yeah crazy in most

1061
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,559
cases like even if you were to turn

1062
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,720
around and sell every gram of that crop

1063
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:27,759
you're not getting enough like yeah

1064
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:29,679
you know unless you're growing huge

1065
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,079
plants you're not getting that 10 grand

1066
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:32,879
back yeah right so

1067
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,720
um

1068
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,599
doing that kind of breeding has to be

1069
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:39,039
funded by people with buck with pockets

1070
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,240
or somebody that has an understanding

1071
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:42,400
that hey i'm going to make an investment

1072
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:44,319
in this and the result that comes out of

1073
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,960
the end is going to have value

1074
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,400
yeah right and and so nowadays like

1075
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,480
you'll see those plants that are like up

1076
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,838
into the five percent like five percent

1077
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,760
i'm not going to say it's a maxima in

1078
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:55,599
the market but like yeah when i see

1079
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,839
someone with a five percenter

1080
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,838
even when i consider it might be 30

1081
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:02,400
inflated i'm like my good job you agree

1082
00:36:59,838 --> 00:37:05,838
that well yeah um

1083
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:07,838
when i see eights i'm really skeptical

1084
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:09,759
again they're not possible i know

1085
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:11,119
they're possible because we've made them

1086
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,280
yeah but

1087
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:14,880
when it's such an anomaly got like six

1088
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,760
lines and all of them are eight

1089
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,920
percenters yeah that's kind of like oh

1090
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,920
yeah you won like five billion dollar

1091
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,559
lotteries in a row like the probability

1092
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:26,559
of that is really [ __ ] low right and

1093
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:28,239
so when the probability is really low

1094
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:30,400
something shifty is probably going on

1095
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:31,838
right yeah you get it right like this

1096
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,760
isn't about calling anybody out or

1097
00:37:31,838 --> 00:37:35,920
saying whatever your [ __ ] stuff

1098
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:38,160
yeah yeah like you know somebody showed

1099
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:41,119
me a uh 38

1100
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:43,039
labs flower 38

1101
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:45,920
total cannabinoids

1102
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:47,279
um which is like exceptionally high and

1103
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,680
it was enough to be lab important like

1104
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,400
called up josh you know i know josh and

1105
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:52,000
uh

1106
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,440
and alec from there they're two of the

1107
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,639
owners and i called up alec and i said

1108
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,320
dude like

1109
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:58,239
what's up with this number like people

1110
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,640
are showing this all over ig and sending

1111
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:00,639
it to me

1112
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:04,639
tell me what's going on with this sample

1113
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,280
and he's like yeah he says when we get a

1114
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:09,118
number over you know i think it was 32

1115
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,480
or whatever

1116
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:12,320
but when they when they have a number

1117
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,000
that hits a certain thing it's go back

1118
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,079
to the sample

1119
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,760
start from the beginning again and yeah

1120
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,480
whole process reanalyze it they call it

1121
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,079
a repress run a reprep on that sample

1122
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,760
and they do and it came back like you

1123
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,359
know within the same

1124
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:29,040
small window that it was like yeah it's

1125
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:30,960
a real number wow so you can have like

1126
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:33,279
these massive [ __ ] numbers where it's

1127
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,119
like all the stars aligned and the

1128
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,519
plants treated perfectly and it's the

1129
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:39,119
most banging genetic and

1130
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:40,880
the the dry and everything is done

1131
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:44,720
perfectly and you preserve that

1132
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,519
beautiful specimen and get it yeah

1133
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:47,279
um

1134
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:48,639
so when you when you showed me your

1135
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,079
samples and you had that one that was

1136
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:54,319
higher yeah and all i can tell you is

1137
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,680
it seems high it doesn't mean it's wrong

1138
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,760
yeah but

1139
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:59,919
it's one to look at

1140
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,920
it's anomalous it's anomalous yeah

1141
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,760
exactly and there's two anomalies in

1142
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,639
those three samples

1143
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,320
well yeah so so so even if it was just

1144
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:09,358
based on the numbers i would be like

1145
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,039
yeah

1146
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:12,239
that doesn't mean that they're wrong

1147
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:14,480
yeah

1148
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:16,639
no lab report no signature

1149
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,480
it's not even on a lab report you know

1150
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:20,000
yeah no i don't know the lab never

1151
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,519
solved convincing it's like all those

1152
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,599
things combined it's like red flag red

1153
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:24,800
flag red flag rag flag

1154
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:26,960
right so

1155
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:30,400
absolutely yeah

1156
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,400
and like i said you know

1157
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:33,759
the only way to really know these things

1158
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,440
is to run that sample that that plant

1159
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,079
through five different grows and analyze

1160
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:41,440
that that yeah and kind of see what's

1161
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,880
the range of what that plant does

1162
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,240
um

1163
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,358
yeah i mean i guess it could be an

1164
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:47,519
anomalous

1165
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:50,319
it could be an enormous anomalously good

1166
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:52,079
grow just that one round and

1167
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,720
that's that the only time you'll ever

1168
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:57,519
see it yeah then i think like i think

1169
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:58,799
that we can still say that like

1170
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:01,759
nobody

1171
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,680
really knows all the secret little

1172
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:06,160
switches and bells and whis and switches

1173
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:08,960
to give a plant to make it produce

1174
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:11,118
at its optimum optimum production every

1175
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,880
single time like sure you know you hit

1176
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:14,240
it or you don't and sometimes it's like

1177
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,680
there's a lot of clouds or sometimes

1178
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:18,000
it's shitty weather and you get you know

1179
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:19,279
like whatever it is like yeah

1180
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,119
nothing goes perfectly the air

1181
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,760
conditioner goes down who knows right

1182
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:26,000
yeah a ton of things that can go wrong

1183
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,359
um

1184
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,358
so

1185
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:31,838
again in the context of like a thing i

1186
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:33,440
like consumers to know is that like it's

1187
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:35,199
just to understand that context just

1188
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,400
because it's like you know like i'm not

1189
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,679
in the market you're out in the market

1190
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,599
we're trying to sell seeds we're trying

1191
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:42,159
to provide good products from people and

1192
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,079
you got some jump that's been growing

1193
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:46,159
for like seven years

1194
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:48,400
and they've got an instagram page with

1195
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:50,879
like their crosses and like

1196
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:54,559
everything's you know i i you know my

1197
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:56,318
results range from like 32 to 40 thc

1198
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:57,838
yeah

1199
00:40:56,318 --> 00:41:00,719
the reason i want to have these

1200
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:02,880
conversations in public is so that like

1201
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:05,199
the consumers that are watching us

1202
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:08,000
they can become informed and then when

1203
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:09,118
they see the used car salesman seed

1204
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,760
pushers

1205
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:14,240
that like are everywhere in this [ __ ]

1206
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,920
market every left turn like every second

1207
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:18,239
account that follows me is something

1208
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,760
genetics or something labs yeah right

1209
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:21,679
that's like really oh you're a lab are

1210
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,400
you you've got like a tent

1211
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:23,838
yeah

1212
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,519
um

1213
00:41:23,838 --> 00:41:27,119
it's all about

1214
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:29,358
it's it's all about marketing it's all

1215
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:31,280
about trying to [ __ ] make buck right

1216
00:41:29,358 --> 00:41:33,199
yeah and

1217
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,119
you know i like making a living out of

1218
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:36,719
the cannabis would be nice for everybody

1219
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:39,200
but

1220
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:40,078
you know i really

1221
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:42,159
have

1222
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,280
taken this to like a stupid level of

1223
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:45,279
passion

1224
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,119
yeah in depthness that it's like when i

1225
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,800
have to stand beside like joe blow

1226
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:50,720
that's like

1227
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,000
it's about nonsense it's like i just you

1228
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:53,759
know and i'm

1229
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,199
not competing not even competing for an

1230
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,720
audience but it's like i'm not i'm at a

1231
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:58,159
conference i'm speaking on a panel

1232
00:41:56,719 --> 00:42:00,078
beside some dude

1233
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:02,960
that's like spouting nonsense near just

1234
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:04,318
like jesus christ man yeah it's hard

1235
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,838
it's hard when you love something that

1236
00:42:04,318 --> 00:42:08,400
much and you fit that many that many

1237
00:42:05,838 --> 00:42:10,639
years into it and and just to watch you

1238
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,599
get bastardized super fast around you

1239
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:14,480
well yeah

1240
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:17,920
and the only way to do that is to like

1241
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:20,960
you know is to try to explain to people

1242
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:23,119
why your shit's different right

1243
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,480
like what do you see like all this time

1244
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:26,160
and energy that i put into learning and

1245
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,800
understanding all this stuff like why it

1246
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:30,639
makes a difference in our our seeds

1247
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,800
yeah

1248
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:35,279
and

1249
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,599
you know it's it's demoralizing

1250
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:39,839
that it's demoralizing to have to

1251
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:42,240
to sit there and do that and the but the

1252
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:44,639
only way to really have people recognize

1253
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:47,118
is to like educate all of our consumers

1254
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:48,960
right so that people can be informed and

1255
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:50,318
people can like not get caught in the

1256
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,079
carnival

1257
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:53,199
of get caught up with the carnival

1258
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:54,720
parkers

1259
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:55,838
yeah right

1260
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:57,039
so

1261
00:42:55,838 --> 00:42:58,799
it's abundant

1262
00:42:57,039 --> 00:43:00,400
well they're everywhere it's like you

1263
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:04,000
know it's like trying to walk across a

1264
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,000
field like avoiding cow patties

1265
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:09,680
yeah it really is so

1266
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,519
there's a loose bunch of stuff on labs i

1267
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:13,118
don't know one other stuff you want to

1268
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:14,960
cover or what if there's questions from

1269
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:16,960
the audience or stuff that we want yeah

1270
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:19,440
someone someone asked are inaccurate

1271
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:22,639
percentages fabricated by via false

1272
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:24,800
standards when using the gc

1273
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:27,440
uh which is what you mean a standard

1274
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,318
like so if you know yeah

1275
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,720
like

1276
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:34,480
i think the answer is yes lab results

1277
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:36,239
can be falsified they can also be

1278
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,920
there are all the time as we've

1279
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:39,358
explained with that 15 thing if you

1280
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,639
didn't understand and see that go back

1281
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:42,719
and watch it

1282
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:45,440
there is an inherent amount of normal

1283
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:48,559
variation and acceptable

1284
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:50,720
laboratory error that influences the

1285
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:51,599
end results right so

1286
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:55,118
like

1287
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:56,960
when you put in the flower

1288
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:59,599
and you get back that lab report that

1289
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,880
didn't come from god right yeah like i

1290
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,640
don't believe god that didn't somebody

1291
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,680
didn't hand that down to the divine and

1292
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:07,199
say this is the divine ultimate truth

1293
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:08,639
right like yeah yeah it's like hey we

1294
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:09,838
measured your [ __ ] this is the this is

1295
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:11,519
the measurement that we got here's the

1296
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:13,279
number and by the way what you should

1297
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:15,119
understand is that that number is like

1298
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,160
has an acceptable variation

1299
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,079
right

1300
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:18,960
on the other side of the question do

1301
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:22,560
people

1302
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:24,400
manipulate these laboratories

1303
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:27,440
yes absolutely

1304
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:29,039
in every district there have been

1305
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,480
laboratories that have had their bombs

1306
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:32,239
bank because

1307
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,599
like it's like you take like you know

1308
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:36,000
there was somebody

1309
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:39,680
in a leafly article somebody did this

1310
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,519
and laid out like a thousand lab reports

1311
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:42,159
they took all the statistical averages

1312
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:44,400
of

1313
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:47,199
all these different labs and every lab's

1314
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,519
statistical average went on on a graph

1315
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:51,919
with a different color curve right oh

1316
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:53,838
wow you see like everybody is all lined

1317
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,838
over this one specific area and then you

1318
00:44:53,838 --> 00:44:56,639
got one lab that's like shifted to the

1319
00:44:55,838 --> 00:44:58,400
right

1320
00:44:56,639 --> 00:45:00,239
their whole curve is like shifted to the

1321
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,240
right and it's like okay well what the

1322
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:05,279
[ __ ] are these guys doing wrong yeah

1323
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:07,519
right and the truth is and it happens in

1324
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,839
every district

1325
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:12,559
higher lab results

1326
00:45:09,838 --> 00:45:14,639
get more sales of course therefore

1327
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:17,440
there's an incentive for labs to give

1328
00:45:14,639 --> 00:45:20,239
higher results because they're a profit

1329
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,119
for-profit service yeah and

1330
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:23,919
there's

1331
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,880
a benefit for growers to seek those labs

1332
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,559
out

1333
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,838
and maybe pay a little bit more for a

1334
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:28,559
higher number

1335
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:30,799
right

1336
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,799
and

1337
00:45:30,838 --> 00:45:35,358
so i think that's a bad design yeah i

1338
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,480
think the answer you can't go back to

1339
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:38,960
that question

1340
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:41,760
do do labs manipulate let's not say all

1341
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,199
labs but say a percentage of labs do

1342
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,280
manipulate

1343
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:46,719
and that can be done intentionally or

1344
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,560
unintentionally

1345
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:52,639
yeah the the way it's set ups right for

1346
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:53,440
corruption if if one wants to be corrupt

1347
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:55,118
it's

1348
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,800
you have to it again it's about this

1349
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,800
passion thing that we were talking about

1350
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:01,519
what are you seeking

1351
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:03,519
speaking to market a product or are you

1352
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:04,880
seeking the ultimate truth um yeah are

1353
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:08,960
you seeing any answers cannabis

1354
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,960
understanding right and like

1355
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:13,200
if you're not controlling that agenda

1356
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:15,199
you're getting played by it right so if

1357
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:17,679
you're a consumer that's true unless you

1358
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:19,358
know like say for example like

1359
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:21,199
you know you i go through all this stuff

1360
00:46:19,358 --> 00:46:23,039
and you say to me you know dude i really

1361
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:24,000
want to be like high integrity seed bank

1362
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:25,920
we're going to do everything the right

1363
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,159
way and you sure you're doing it the

1364
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,159
right way

1365
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:32,799
i'm gonna have more faith in you

1366
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:36,000
yeah right

1367
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:37,599
um and then if like i resonate with that

1368
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
kind of thing and i say hey matt's doing

1369
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:41,920
all the thing look he's demonstrating

1370
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,440
that like hey i got this lab report but

1371
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,200
maybe it was a little high i don't know

1372
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,358
like something's questionable that shows

1373
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:50,239
that you got integrity if i'm a customer

1374
00:46:47,358 --> 00:46:52,159
i'm going to support that yeah right

1375
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:56,078
um but these are again that's like a

1376
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:57,759
value judgment of something that i value

1377
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:59,280
might not value those things right like

1378
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,040
because as you can see like a lot of

1379
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,240
other people are like well [ __ ] that the

1380
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:04,000
jungle boys are the hottest [ __ ] i'm

1381
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:05,679
gonna go grab whatever they got you know

1382
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,838
what i mean yeah they don't the value

1383
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:08,639
system is not the same so anyway next

1384
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:10,480
question

1385
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:12,078
and the education system's not the same

1386
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,440
i mean like that what we've been trying

1387
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,599
to do with the whole breeder syndicate

1388
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,679
thing has been it's been tough because

1389
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:19,200
we decided a long time ago the only way

1390
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:21,039
to combat

1391
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:23,519
disinformation and misinformation is to

1392
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:25,679
educate but you can't force people to

1393
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:28,480
want to educate themselves

1394
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:29,759
no you can't all you can do is

1395
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,639
lay it out for the people that want to

1396
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,559
know

1397
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:34,239
yeah and

1398
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:36,839
i've been pushing this ball of pill for

1399
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:39,439
a long time

1400
00:47:36,838 --> 00:47:40,639
um more people are getting to the point

1401
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,440
where they want to know

1402
00:47:40,639 --> 00:47:42,400
yeah

1403
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,358
right

1404
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,960
um

1405
00:47:43,358 --> 00:47:46,719
and it's changing

1406
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,280
right i mean just it's changing over

1407
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:51,279
time but yeah it takes time and you know

1408
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,960
it's like everything it's like

1409
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,359
you know what you and i consider good

1410
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:57,358
music that ain't what's on the top 40.

1411
00:47:55,358 --> 00:47:58,719
right and the cannabis industry is going

1412
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:00,000
to be no different like there's going to

1413
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:01,279
be people that really understand they're

1414
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,358
really passionate and they really want

1415
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:05,280
that beautiful things

1416
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:07,920
and then there's like

1417
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,960
the 90 that are gonna listen to justin

1418
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,920
bieber

1419
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,760
yeah right and smoke bieber butt

1420
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,358
so

1421
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,119
i have some i have some questions i want

1422
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:19,759
to run through um

1423
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:21,519
it refers to testing but it refers to

1424
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:24,319
genetic testing

1425
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:26,318
uh are you cool with that yeah sure okay

1426
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:27,759
um

1427
00:48:26,318 --> 00:48:28,880
this is kind of i don't know i mean i

1428
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,359
don't know if there's an answer to it

1429
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:33,440
necessarily but do you know how far we

1430
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:36,078
are in mapping the cannabis genome as

1431
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:38,960
far as are we able to tell

1432
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:42,880
real genetic relation as far as like s1

1433
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:44,800
variation and and parental lines father

1434
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:47,039
cousin sister is that even something in

1435
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,720
cannabis that you can do

1436
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:49,358
yeah you can do it

1437
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:51,439
i

1438
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:53,119
can't go and like seek that information

1439
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,720
out it's one of the weird things with

1440
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,920
the filos

1441
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:57,679
was going on you know they were doing

1442
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,039
the run around trying to get samples and

1443
00:48:57,679 --> 00:49:00,159
they obviously approached me at one

1444
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:01,358
point in time and i was like not

1445
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:03,679
interested

1446
00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:05,199
yeah but what i will do is i said hey

1447
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:07,039
i've got all these

1448
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:08,879
self populations

1449
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:10,400
why don't i help why don't we look at

1450
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,760
like 50 individuals from the self

1451
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:14,240
population and then explore the

1452
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,800
variation so then now we've got like

1453
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:18,879
we've we've shown hey here's like the

1454
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:21,599
parental clone here's the

1455
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:24,079
the heterozygosity by sequencing

1456
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:25,200
yeah growing 100 offspring of the selves

1457
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,720
do the same thing to each them they

1458
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:27,679
didn't want to do that [ __ ]

1459
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:28,639
yeah

1460
00:49:27,679 --> 00:49:30,399
um

1461
00:49:28,639 --> 00:49:32,719
it seemed like that was the most

1462
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,880
like what people went to philos for was

1463
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:35,759
that information more so than anything

1464
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,760
else

1465
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,359
they were just weird they had the pitch

1466
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,680
was great it was like

1467
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:43,679
collect your star on the galaxy

1468
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:44,960
yeah right like it was like it's kind of

1469
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:46,879
like that whole like

1470
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:49,280
we can show you your name it'll be up in

1471
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:51,440
lights yeah you know like it's [ __ ]

1472
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:56,400
nonsense but that's it people fall and

1473
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:56,400
fall for that [ __ ] right yeah so um

1474
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,240
when we when i don't mean we but i mean

1475
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:02,239
when

1476
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:04,558
humanity first

1477
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:06,078
did the human genome project it was like

1478
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:07,680
oh my god we're going to know everything

1479
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:08,800
we've got the whole genomes and that

1480
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:10,318
would be able to treat disease and it's

1481
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:13,359
like wait a second

1482
00:50:10,318 --> 00:50:15,519
it's like you've got one white guy

1483
00:50:13,358 --> 00:50:17,199
yeah right like do you think that that

1484
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:20,000
encompasses the genetic variation that

1485
00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:21,358
exists in like the jewish or the or the

1486
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,679
african-american or the african

1487
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:26,318
population of like the north yeah

1488
00:50:23,679 --> 00:50:27,838
in south africa or like asia versus you

1489
00:50:26,318 --> 00:50:29,199
know like wherever

1490
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:31,599
right and so

1491
00:50:29,199 --> 00:50:34,318
the next evolution that came out of that

1492
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:35,440
was called the thousand genomes project

1493
00:50:34,318 --> 00:50:36,960
right and it's like once you got a

1494
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:39,280
thousand genomes now you can start

1495
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:41,119
looking at all the different genes and

1496
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:43,680
seeing okay here's kind of like a

1497
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:45,920
catalog of the in of the genomic

1498
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:46,799
variation that exists in the species

1499
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,519
or

1500
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,000
like

1501
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:52,480
at least it gives us a look at hey

1502
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,400
there's way more variety right and so

1503
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:57,760
we're not at the point with cannabis

1504
00:50:54,400 --> 00:51:00,160
yeah so there are you know

1505
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:02,000
folks like medicinal genomics and some

1506
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:04,000
other groups i think medicinal genomics

1507
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,280
probably have like i would say they've

1508
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,519
been doing it i think they've been doing

1509
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,440
it like more or less the longest

1510
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:11,199
and they so they've started to get like

1511
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,720
yeah you can go in and if you're one of

1512
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:14,639
their clients and you paid out your

1513
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:16,558
sequence you can compare

1514
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:18,960
you know your snips versus other

1515
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:21,519
essentially sniffs or

1516
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,639
genetics misspellings in a word

1517
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:24,159
right yeah

1518
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:25,759
you can and because these things are

1519
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:26,719
repeated over time if you have like a

1520
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,480
genetic

1521
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:29,838
misspelling that happens in skunk and

1522
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,599
then you cross it into skunk northern

1523
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:33,759
lights and skunk caves and found

1524
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:34,838
caffeine like you have a probability of

1525
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,400
finding

1526
00:51:34,838 --> 00:51:38,318
that

1527
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,720
misspelling in all of those different

1528
00:51:38,318 --> 00:51:43,358
lines right yeah so over time you can

1529
00:51:40,719 --> 00:51:44,318
use those to build like a family tree

1530
00:51:43,358 --> 00:51:46,558
um

1531
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:52,079
but what we haven't really done a good

1532
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:56,559
job of at this point yet is saying this

1533
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:59,039
small genetic change results in x

1534
00:51:56,559 --> 00:52:01,119
right okay so like we've got a bunch of

1535
00:51:59,039 --> 00:52:03,279
dna letters and we can see there's

1536
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:04,559
variation in these dna letters but it's

1537
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:06,559
like okay what does that correlate to in

1538
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:09,040
a plant we don't know

1539
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:11,119
yeah right and that's the hard work is

1540
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:14,639
correlating the phenotypic data with the

1541
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:16,640
genetic data that makes sense and that

1542
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:18,879
is going to take time yeah that's got to

1543
00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:21,118
be years away yeah but it's gonna it's

1544
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:22,559
always gonna be an ongoing process right

1545
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:25,039
yeah and with corn they've done it

1546
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:26,880
they've got a pretty good job of it now

1547
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:28,960
and like listen we've got like we've got

1548
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,160
what's called an annotated genome which

1549
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,838
means

1550
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:34,719
you can look up hey you want to look up

1551
00:52:31,838 --> 00:52:34,719
like the uh

1552
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:39,760
fatty acid desaturates gene that is

1553
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:40,960
involved in like you know cell plant

1554
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,359
cells what happens when plants get

1555
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:45,519
really cold they induce oil content in

1556
00:52:43,358 --> 00:52:48,000
the cell membranes and there's a gene

1557
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:49,838
involved in that right so yeah like i

1558
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,440
can look up that gene and actually now

1559
00:52:49,838 --> 00:52:53,759
go and find out exactly where it is in

1560
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:55,679
the canon because they've said hey this

1561
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,280
small suction of the the chromosome

1562
00:52:55,679 --> 00:53:00,558
matches up with this gene and all of the

1563
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:02,000
plants this is the gene that does this

1564
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:04,240
in canvas

1565
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,159
right so but like again it's like you

1566
00:53:04,239 --> 00:53:07,759
know that that gene that segment of dna

1567
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:09,679
signals is there

1568
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:12,160
do we know what every variant that

1569
00:53:09,679 --> 00:53:14,239
exists for that gene

1570
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:16,000
and the result of those variants are no

1571
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:17,838
we don't know that

1572
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,920
very interesting so we're we're starting

1573
00:53:17,838 --> 00:53:21,679
to build that knowledge like one of the

1574
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:23,920
things you know recurring medicinal

1575
00:53:21,679 --> 00:53:25,679
genomics mccarron is no dummy

1576
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,400
you know he looked he was like oh we're

1577
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:28,159
going to start looking at the

1578
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,680
cannabinoid synthase genes like that's

1579
00:53:28,159 --> 00:53:31,679
going to be one of the first things so

1580
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:33,039
you know they sequence the whole genome

1581
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:34,239
but the first thing that they do they

1582
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:35,679
take the microscope out it's not a

1583
00:53:34,239 --> 00:53:37,439
microscope or a magnifying glass but

1584
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:38,480
it's an analogy you take the magnifying

1585
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:40,720
glass out and you go and you look at

1586
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:42,480
that region of the genome that has those

1587
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:44,159
genes involved in cannabinoid production

1588
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,639
hey this one's got a break in the gene

1589
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:48,159
or this one has two copies of the gene

1590
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:50,078
right and so

1591
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:50,960
they're starting to tease it apart for

1592
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:53,760
like

1593
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:56,079
some of the major genes of interest

1594
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,599
yeah but because they don't grow plants

1595
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:59,359
and they don't do those correlational

1596
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:01,440
studies between genetic data and

1597
00:53:59,358 --> 00:54:04,078
phenotypes

1598
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:07,039
they can't generate that kind of data

1599
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:09,280
yeah right it was it was slow build

1600
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:11,119
it was interesting going back and forth

1601
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,559
with filos at the very end before they

1602
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:13,760
shut their doors

1603
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:16,079
and

1604
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:18,559
giving them known parents

1605
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:20,000
and the known children cuts and watching

1606
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:21,760
them come back and say there was no

1607
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,480
relation it was really interesting

1608
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:26,559
watching that and they they put their

1609
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,318
their whole reputation on the line to do

1610
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:29,599
it on top of that well it makes you

1611
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:31,599
wonder what's going on because i mean

1612
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:33,200
you know they are so it's like did they

1613
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:34,720
[ __ ] up the samples

1614
00:54:33,199 --> 00:54:36,558
are they not just not running them and

1615
00:54:34,719 --> 00:54:38,318
taking your money and telling you

1616
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:40,160
right like that could be yeah too right

1617
00:54:38,318 --> 00:54:42,000
you have no way of knowing

1618
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:45,838
you have no way of knowing and and when

1619
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:47,679
we pointed it out they shut the doors so

1620
00:54:45,838 --> 00:54:49,920
i guess i i don't know i'd like to see

1621
00:54:47,679 --> 00:54:52,480
how long their data stays up online

1622
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:54,318
their data sets because knowing that it

1623
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,000
i i would think that if the more that

1624
00:54:54,318 --> 00:54:58,079
gets out the more likely people are to

1625
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,798
start asking questions

1626
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:00,640
i

1627
00:54:58,798 --> 00:55:01,838
i had like listened when they first

1628
00:55:00,639 --> 00:55:03,838
started coming out with their things i

1629
00:55:01,838 --> 00:55:05,838
talked to you know i was they offered me

1630
00:55:03,838 --> 00:55:07,279
a job at one point in time yeah when i

1631
00:55:05,838 --> 00:55:08,880
left napo and came back to canada they

1632
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,400
were like well come work with us nitro

1633
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:12,240
and just or at the

1634
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:14,480
philos and you know just give us give me

1635
00:55:12,239 --> 00:55:16,159
like two of your cbg seeds

1636
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,838
yeah no

1637
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:19,440
i was you know i

1638
00:55:17,838 --> 00:55:21,119
legalization was happening in canada i

1639
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,240
was over living out of [ __ ] hotels in

1640
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:24,240
the states

1641
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:26,000
yeah and uh

1642
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:28,399
yeah i just i didn't

1643
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,920
i didn't value it i didn't i there was

1644
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,519
too many red flags

1645
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,680
yeah right

1646
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:34,719
and um

1647
00:55:33,679 --> 00:55:36,239
so

1648
00:55:34,719 --> 00:55:37,519
like

1649
00:55:36,239 --> 00:55:39,679
the way that they were going and

1650
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:40,960
collecting their data

1651
00:55:39,679 --> 00:55:42,798
was wrong

1652
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:44,798
right and just because of

you know

1654
00:55:44,798 --> 00:55:48,159

1655
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:50,400
position i was in with knowing a lot of

1656
00:55:48,159 --> 00:55:52,639

and then it's verified cuts and you know

1662
00:55:59,039 --> 00:56:02,079
when you're doing a catatonic that it

1663
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,838
came from the guy that read camp comic

1664
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:04,880
right like yeah yeah exactly you know

1665
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:06,000
and they were like well we don't want to

1666
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,960
do that

1667
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,400
they didn't want we got these real

1668
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,720
legacy strengths you know we got

1669
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:12,639
fearless like well why not it's like oh

1670
00:56:10,719 --> 00:56:14,480
you want to take people's money to give

1671
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:15,838
them an answer

1672
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:18,240
right because they were running tests

1673
00:56:15,838 --> 00:56:19,440
but their cost was 30 100 bucks or

1674
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:21,279
whatever it was and they're charging

1675
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,079
people hundreds of dollars right so

1676
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:24,079
yeah

1677
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:26,640
they're just turning and burning

1678
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:28,160
um and in the meantime they're learning

1679
00:56:26,639 --> 00:56:30,719
all the stuff because they see

1680
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:32,558
everybody's samples or if like the guy

1681
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:33,439
that pays the test you only see your

1682
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:34,880
sample

1683
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,838
right yeah it's like you understand your

1684
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,280
genetic

1685
00:56:35,838 --> 00:56:39,199
data

1686
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:40,880
to whatever degree

1687
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:42,239
you can say oh look there's my star on

1688
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:44,318
the galaxy

1689
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:45,679
yeah right it's kind of like buying an

1690
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:46,960
anchor on the moon

1691
00:56:45,679 --> 00:56:48,719
right yeah like you can see what the

1692
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:52,079
telescope who cares it's like [ __ ]

1693
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:54,399
useless right like yeah dude

1694
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:54,400
um

1695
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:59,279
so but anyway you know

1696
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,559
anyway it's one of those things where

1697
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,400
it's like i don't know if you're thought

1698
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:03,920
to read tom sawyer but it's like there's

1699
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,200
a certain point in time he has to paint

1700
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,280
whitewash the stupid fats and

1701
00:57:05,199 --> 00:57:09,039

1703
00:57:09,039 --> 00:57:12,639
whitewash some of your fans that's kind

1704
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:14,160
of what phylos was doing with the

1705
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:16,719
cannabis industry right everybody was

1706
00:57:14,159 --> 00:57:18,879
lining up like suckers to be remember

1707
00:57:16,719 --> 00:57:20,239
it all turned like because of i did that

1708
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,760
breeding work from napro then there was

1709
00:57:20,239 --> 00:57:23,519
the patent that came from it like a lot

1710
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,520
of people all bent out of shape and it

1711
00:57:23,519 --> 00:57:26,880
was like you're [ __ ] phylos you're

1712
00:57:25,519 --> 00:57:29,519
working with filos and patenting all

1713
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:31,838
this stuff and i was like wait a second

1714
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:33,358
all you dumbasses fell into the [ __ ]

1715
00:57:31,838 --> 00:57:35,838
philos trap

1716
00:57:33,358 --> 00:57:37,759
you actively paid to give away your

1717
00:57:35,838 --> 00:57:38,798
[ __ ] information to some big genetics

1718
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,480
company

1719
00:57:38,798 --> 00:57:43,119
and you're pissed off at me

1720
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:45,119
like what yeah you mad at me like you

1721
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:46,318
fell into the trap dude

1722
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:47,440
right

1723
00:57:46,318 --> 00:57:49,519
um

1724
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:51,599
so i don't know the cannabis is cut you

1725
00:57:49,519 --> 00:57:52,719
know community is funny with that stuff

1726
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:54,480
because it's like yeah like the patents

1727
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:56,719
already freaked out about the patents

1728
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:57,760
and now everybody wants a patent right

1729
00:57:56,719 --> 00:57:59,118
yeah

1730
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,319
literally everyone

1731
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:01,838
yeah

1732
00:58:00,318 --> 00:58:03,519
and look like

1733
00:58:01,838 --> 00:58:05,358
i think if you truly bred something and

1734
00:58:03,519 --> 00:58:07,280
you created something new then you can

1735
00:58:05,358 --> 00:58:08,960
get intellectual property protection by

1736
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:10,880
way of a patent like a plant patent in

1737
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:13,280
the states [ __ ] get on with your bad

1738
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:14,400
self now why not now it's got to now

1739
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:16,798
it's got to the point of where you

1740
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:18,318
almost have to if you want to stay

1741
00:58:16,798 --> 00:58:20,079
competitive because the legal market is

1742
00:58:18,318 --> 00:58:21,759
coming and if you don't patent it

1743
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:24,079
someone else will it just it's gonna

1744
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:25,839
happen well they can't nobody can

1745
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:27,519
so somebody can't come along and patent

1746
00:58:25,838 --> 00:58:28,798
your [ __ ]

1747
00:58:27,519 --> 00:58:30,079
um

1748
00:58:28,798 --> 00:58:31,599
they can patent something that is the

1749
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:34,079
same as your [ __ ] if you didn't get to

1750
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:35,119
it in time yeah sure

1751
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:36,798
but yeah

1752
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:38,640
really like what a patent is saying hey

1753
00:58:36,798 --> 00:58:39,838
this this unique thing that i developed

1754
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:41,679
is mine

1755
00:58:39,838 --> 00:58:43,279
and yeah this gives you a stamp that

1756
00:58:41,679 --> 00:58:45,919
says hey that you actually developed

1757
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:47,359
that because you have to demonstrate

1758
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,318
how you made it

1759
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:49,838
okay

1760
00:58:48,318 --> 00:58:51,440
like you have to say to be like across

1761
00:58:49,838 --> 00:58:52,480
this and this we did these selections

1762
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,079
and there's a whole thing like the role

1763
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:56,719
description right do you have to have

1764
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:58,880
actual proof that you crossed x y z and

1765
00:58:56,719 --> 00:59:00,399
the proof of all this like video like do

1766
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:02,798
you know how it works

1767
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:04,480
it has to stand up in court

1768
00:59:02,798 --> 00:59:06,400
right because it can be challenged at

1769
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:08,559
any point in time so if you don't do a

1770
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:10,880
good enough job like you might get it

1771
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:12,880
past the uspto you met you might get

1772
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:15,280
past the patent examiner and he says

1773
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:17,280
yeah this thing appears

1774
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,480
whatever but if somebody comes along and

1775
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,160
challenges it later and they can

1776
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:22,079
demonstrate later

1777
00:59:20,159 --> 00:59:23,440
that that hey

1778
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:25,680
you didn't

1779
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:27,599
document well enough and there's these

1780
00:59:25,679 --> 00:59:30,639
things that call what you said into

1781
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:32,640
question that's up in front of the judge

1782
00:59:30,639 --> 00:59:34,960
yeah who's going to make a ruling on

1783
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:36,558
whether you actually the patent is valid

1784
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,000
a patent is a claim right it doesn't

1785
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:39,599
mean that you wouldn't hit it to claim

1786
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,280
that you own something

1787
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:42,960
right whether you really own it is a

1788
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:45,440
matter for the courts

1789
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:46,720
yeah right and so like any patent can be

1790
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,960
challenged

1791
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:51,759
um and so if you're going to go through

1792
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:53,280
a patent and all the effort and expense

1793
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:54,480
of getting a patent for something that

1794
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,319
you've created

1795
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:58,240
you should probably do a good job of

1796
00:59:56,318 --> 01:00:00,159
describing everything like all your home

1797
00:59:58,239 --> 01:00:02,399
every last step yeah because you want to

1798
01:00:00,159 --> 01:00:04,318
lay out the whole story

1799
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,358
so some because the story is what gets

1800
01:00:04,318 --> 01:00:07,279
published from the patent if somebody

1801
01:00:05,358 --> 01:00:09,440
comes along and says yeah this doesn't

1802
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,798
make sense in your story that's ground

1803
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,000
for a challenge

1804
01:00:10,798 --> 01:00:13,759
yeah and so

1805
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,119
that's why when you see like you know

1806
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:16,880
i'm not talking about plant patents but

1807
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:18,240
if you read some of these patents on

1808
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:20,318
like genes

1809
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:22,078
you know it's like

1810
01:00:20,318 --> 01:00:23,279
or for example in a chemotype so it'll

1811
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:26,160
be like

1812
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:29,200
we're patenting every plant in terpene

1813
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:31,759
dominance with uh type three or type two

1814
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:34,239
you know cannabinoid profile meaning cbd

1815
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:36,160
and cbg and that means everything from

1816
01:00:34,239 --> 01:00:38,639
one percent two percent three percent

1817
01:00:36,159 --> 01:00:40,000
four percent five percent six yeah

1818
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:42,159
and you'll literally see them [ __ ]

1819
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,119
list out like you know one through forty

1820
01:00:42,159 --> 01:00:45,838
percent

1821
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:48,318
right yeah for clarity that they say

1822
01:00:45,838 --> 01:00:49,759
this patent claims every plant that is

1823
01:00:48,318 --> 01:00:51,119
one percent two percent three percent

1824
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:53,920
four percent yeah

1825
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:56,400
and it's like you document it as tightly

1826
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:58,880
controlled as possible and the idea

1827
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:00,720
for that patent attorneys do is like

1828
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:02,640
you want to write patents that are

1829
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:05,199
defensible in the future

1830
01:01:02,639 --> 01:01:06,960
so you try to close every loophole that

1831
01:01:05,199 --> 01:01:08,239
you can think of

1832
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,280
right

1833
01:01:08,239 --> 01:01:11,519
and patents are different than

1834
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:14,640
trademarks i know archive trademarks

1835
01:01:11,519 --> 01:01:17,759
yeah trademarks are there's a trick yeah

1836
01:01:14,639 --> 01:01:20,558
trademark is how you sell a product

1837
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:22,319
okay okay look they when we start

1838
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:24,640
talking about intellectual property on

1839
01:01:22,318 --> 01:01:26,318
plants

1840
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:28,719
it's

1841
01:01:26,318 --> 01:01:30,318
who wherever the person is watching this

1842
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:31,598
in the world like if you're in europe or

1843
01:01:30,318 --> 01:01:33,119
in your canada or you're in the united

1844
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:35,519
states or you're in china

1845
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:38,640
totally different okay yeah

1846
01:01:35,519 --> 01:01:40,960
there's something in in the this there's

1847
01:01:38,639 --> 01:01:42,400
a system that is like accepted all over

1848
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:45,440
the world

1849
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:46,960
called um upof and upon essentially the

1850
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:49,760
union for the protection of plant

1851
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:51,760
varieties and and they're the guys that

1852
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:54,000
created this overarching system that

1853
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,000
said

1854
01:01:54,239 --> 01:01:58,399
these are the ways that we evaluate to

1855
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,680
see who owns or develops a new plant

1856
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,200
variety

1857
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:03,679
yeah but it's an international treaty

1858
01:02:01,199 --> 01:02:05,439
made by an international organization

1859
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:06,719
all the countries come together most of

1860
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:09,119
the countries in the world come together

1861
01:02:06,719 --> 01:02:10,159
and have signed this treaty but like for

1862
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:12,400
example

1863
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:12,399
you know

1864
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:17,519
like new zealand say they signed on in

1865
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:19,199
like the 1974 edition of the treaty and

1866
01:02:17,519 --> 01:02:21,838
the united states signed on in like a

1867
01:02:19,199 --> 01:02:24,480
later version call it 1991 right

1868
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:26,318
made up numbers and dates sure you're

1869
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:28,480
only beholden to the version of the

1870
01:02:26,318 --> 01:02:31,920
treaty to which you signed

1871
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:33,519
yeah okay so and then

1872
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:35,280
when you sign the treaty all these like

1873
01:02:33,519 --> 01:02:36,880
for example they go home you know so

1874
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:38,960
there's this international treaty the

1875
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:40,000
united states signs on the international

1876
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:41,599
trade hey we're gonna be part of this

1877
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,880
thing now they go back to the united

1878
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:45,280
states and they write a set of

1879
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:47,119
legislation that backs up the treaty

1880
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:48,880
yeah well that legislation is totally

1881
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:50,640
unique to the united states

1882
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:53,119
right like you follow the overarching

1883
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:55,598
principles of the

1884
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:56,720
the umbrella organization that top level

1885
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:57,680
org

1886
01:02:56,719 --> 01:02:59,439
but

1887
01:02:57,679 --> 01:03:00,879
really every country is a silo with

1888
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,679
their own system

1889
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:03,280
yeah

1890
01:03:01,679 --> 01:03:07,118
and so

1891
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:08,400
patents plant patents per se

1892
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:09,519
only exist in the united states in

1893
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:11,200
australia

1894
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:13,440
okay like that makes sense there is no

1895
01:03:11,199 --> 01:03:16,960
such thing as a patent a pan plant

1896
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:19,039
patent in canada or europe yeah we use

1897
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:22,720
um breeders rights the breeder's right

1898
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:22,720
system that's overthinking by upon

1899
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:27,280
one of the major differences between

1900
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:29,039
those two is that a patent

1901
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:32,640
you don't have to disclose or make

1902
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:32,640
available so for example

1903
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:36,318
when we talk about international

1904
01:03:34,239 --> 01:03:38,798
registration of plant varieties or plant

1905
01:03:36,318 --> 01:03:41,838
cultivars

1906
01:03:38,798 --> 01:03:43,920
what that does is so i develop

1907
01:03:41,838 --> 01:03:45,199
whatever call it like a blueberry sweets

1908
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:46,559
it's called a blueberry sweet skunk

1909
01:03:45,199 --> 01:03:48,480
plant i find a blueberry sweet skin

1910
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:50,720
plant it's totally different i register

1911
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:51,679
it i declare the parents i do the whole

1912
01:03:50,719 --> 01:03:54,000
spiel

1913
01:03:51,679 --> 01:03:55,598
yeah but he says okay ryan this plant is

1914
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,920
yours we recognize that you're the

1915
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:59,440
developer of this plant this one plant

1916
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:00,720
that you selected out of this population

1917
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:02,240
we're going to give you a cultivar

1918
01:04:00,719 --> 01:04:04,000
registration

1919
01:04:02,239 --> 01:04:06,399
recognition so it's a registered

1920
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:09,199
cultivar

1921
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:10,559
what you get out of that is the rice you

1922
01:04:09,199 --> 01:04:12,960
don't get the plant

1923
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:14,480
yeah so it's like now that plant that i

1924
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:15,838
have that i that

1925
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:17,280
anybody that wants to grow that plant

1926
01:04:15,838 --> 01:04:19,519
anywhere else in the world

1927
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:21,359
they can kill that plant but i get the

1928
01:04:19,519 --> 01:04:22,960
royalties or you know

1929
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:25,199
like i have the rights to the royalties

1930
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:27,199
or whatever profits come from

1931
01:04:25,199 --> 01:04:28,798
the development section of that plant

1932
01:04:27,199 --> 01:04:30,879
what you don't get to say is nobody else

1933
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:33,920
can use this plant in fact one of the

1934
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:36,318
conditions that you have to do

1935
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:37,358
is make your plant available to other

1936
01:04:36,318 --> 01:04:40,159
breeders

1937
01:04:37,358 --> 01:04:41,598
oh interesting yeah and the reason is is

1938
01:04:40,159 --> 01:04:43,358
like hey

1939
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:45,440
the reasoning from the top level org is

1940
01:04:43,358 --> 01:04:47,279
hey we recognize that you develop that

1941
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:49,039
plant and it's special it's awesome and

1942
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:50,480
it's unique and we're going to give you

1943
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:51,520
17 years of

1944
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:54,559
economic

1945
01:04:51,519 --> 01:04:57,920
exclusivity around that plant

1946
01:04:54,559 --> 01:05:02,160
plant genetic resources are not yours

1947
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:03,680
yes the entire globe has the right

1948
01:05:02,159 --> 01:05:06,239
everybody on the planet has the right to

1949
01:05:03,679 --> 01:05:08,719
that plant

1950
01:05:06,239 --> 01:05:10,558
for use in the betterment of all plants

1951
01:05:08,719 --> 01:05:12,480
for humanity

1952
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:14,400
therefore the plant that you have the

1953
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:16,000
certification on

1954
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:18,000
we recognize it as yours but you have to

1955
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,519
share it with everybody else yeah right

1956
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,280
and so other people can take my [ __ ] and

1957
01:05:19,519 --> 01:05:22,798
breed it and improve it

1958
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:24,480
yeah if i have a patent i don't have to

1959
01:05:22,798 --> 01:05:26,719
give it out to anybody

1960
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:28,880
uh okay i got you right you can control

1961
01:05:26,719 --> 01:05:30,879
who gets it right because it truly is

1962
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:33,200
your piece of property it's your you

1963
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:35,119
have ownership over that thing

1964
01:05:33,199 --> 01:05:36,318
gotcha um that makes that's yeah that

1965
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:38,318
makes a lot of sense it's kind of a

1966
01:05:36,318 --> 01:05:40,079
weird like unique thing that happens in

1967
01:05:38,318 --> 01:05:41,119
the states because you guys have these

1968
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:42,559
patents

1969
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:43,599
they're recognized in australia they're

1970
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:44,640
not recognized anywhere else in the

1971
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:46,400
world

1972
01:05:44,639 --> 01:05:48,318
not even canada no

1973
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:50,480
that's funny yeah yeah

1974
01:05:48,318 --> 01:05:51,679
yeah so that's one form of patents

1975
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:53,199
there's other forms of patents like

1976
01:05:51,679 --> 01:05:54,639
there's utility patents and there's all

1977
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:56,078
this other [ __ ] so

1978
01:05:54,639 --> 01:05:57,679
but i think

1979
01:05:56,079 --> 01:05:59,280
you know rather than doing a show on

1980
01:05:57,679 --> 01:06:01,919
patents it's just good to recognize that

1981
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:04,000
that's kind of the way it is so yeah get

1982
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:06,000
yourself a plan you can also do cultivar

1983
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,760
and variety registrations in

1984
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,280
the united states i think with patents

1985
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:12,319
around why would you

1986
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:15,920
yeah right the thing about being part of

1987
01:06:12,318 --> 01:06:17,199
the international variety registration

1988
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:19,680
is that

1989
01:06:17,199 --> 01:06:20,798
you you don't only have record like for

1990
01:06:19,679 --> 01:06:22,318
you if you're only growing and your

1991
01:06:20,798 --> 01:06:23,519
clients are only in the states fine

1992
01:06:22,318 --> 01:06:25,358
doesn't matter get your patent in the

1993
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:26,239
states you're protected you you're

1994
01:06:25,358 --> 01:06:28,000
you've

1995
01:06:26,239 --> 01:06:29,199
you're protected in the space take that

1996
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,039
plant to

1997
01:06:29,199 --> 01:06:33,598
europe

1998
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:35,280
nobody recognizes your ip

1999
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:36,559
yeah so

2000
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,079
you know you might want if you're going

2001
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:39,599
to be doing business internationally you

2002
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:41,519
might want to get

2003
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:43,318
um a form of intellectual property

2004
01:06:41,519 --> 01:06:46,239
protection that is recognized

2005
01:06:43,318 --> 01:06:47,679
internationally okay

2006
01:06:46,239 --> 01:06:49,519
so we've got a question for you i want

2007
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:52,078
to hear chimera talk about kitazan

2008
01:06:49,519 --> 01:06:53,280
jasmonic acid and salicylic acid is this

2009
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:55,119
something that you

2010
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:56,400
know a lot about i i mean i know a

2011
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:58,160
little bit about them i'm not like a

2012
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:00,400
plant physiology guy and i have that

2013
01:06:58,159 --> 01:07:02,159
stuff on the top of my on the top of my

2014
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:04,960
head i mean they're they're signaling

2015
01:07:02,159 --> 01:07:06,798
chemicals right yeah so kind of kaizen's

2016
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:10,159
not catastrophizing it's not it's like

2017
01:07:06,798 --> 01:07:12,239
what's that's the molecule that's in

2018
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:13,199
the shells of crustaceans right yeah

2019
01:07:12,239 --> 01:07:14,639
when there's

2020
01:07:13,199 --> 01:07:16,318
some evidence that it does stuff and

2021
01:07:14,639 --> 01:07:18,078
plants and that's not my area of

2022
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:20,400
specialty

2023
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:22,000
so i want to talk to you about what is

2024
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:24,079
chimera

2025
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:26,000
excited about genetically that's around

2026
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:28,000
right now something you're working on or

2027
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,358
something that maybe you saw recently

2028
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,199
that you're really stoked on that's

2029
01:07:29,358 --> 01:07:33,279
novel

2030
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:35,598
it might list that i get off on the

2031
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:37,599
variation so i like new stuff i like i

2032
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:39,838
like

2033
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:41,280
i like when our understanding grows

2034
01:07:39,838 --> 01:07:43,838
right so it's like you can use it

2035
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:45,680
because for me in genetics

2036
01:07:43,838 --> 01:07:48,078
it's like i you know we talked about a

2037
01:07:45,679 --> 01:07:49,679
little bit with caleb on the shango show

2038
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:51,599
the other day but yeah like when you're

2039
01:07:49,679 --> 01:07:52,960
selling a plant it's not just about

2040
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:54,640
looking through the population and

2041
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:56,960
saying hey oh this plant's great because

2042
01:07:54,639 --> 01:07:58,239
of whatever i want to understand all the

2043
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:00,559
traits and the plant and how they're

2044
01:07:58,239 --> 01:08:02,078
inherited right and how it's breeding

2045
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:03,359
it's kind of like being able to take a

2046
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:04,640
part machine

2047
01:08:03,358 --> 01:08:05,759
once you can take it apart and put it

2048
01:08:04,639 --> 01:08:08,078
back together

2049
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:10,720
then you can reassemble it in new ways

2050
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:12,559
yes right and so that's really what get

2051
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:14,639
you know like when for example the thiol

2052
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:16,319
story came out right the the skunk

2053
01:08:14,639 --> 01:08:19,358
compound yeah yeah

2054
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:19,359
super interesting

2055
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:23,119
i want to now be able to go into a

2056
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:26,079
breeding program

2057
01:08:23,119 --> 01:08:28,719
take a plant with styles self it

2058
01:08:26,079 --> 01:08:30,318
and see how does the

2059
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:32,560
like what happens in the distribution of

2060
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:34,480
that thiol expression in the offspring

2061
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:36,159
yeah right because when you analyze that

2062
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:38,318
then you can kind of get to understand

2063
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:39,358
then you can develop a hypothesis about

2064
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:41,199
how

2065
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:42,560
that trade is inherited

2066
01:08:41,198 --> 01:08:44,479
yeah once you know how that trade is

2067
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:46,880
inherited then you can bring it into any

2068
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:48,879
other breeding program sure right so

2069
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:51,600
that's like kind of what i nerd on it's

2070
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:53,600
not probably very exciting to people no

2071
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:55,120
i mean it's like yeah yeah that's the

2072
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:56,400
kind of stuff that i like so you know i

2073
01:08:55,119 --> 01:08:58,158
don't really

2074
01:08:56,399 --> 01:09:01,278
like

2075
01:08:58,158 --> 01:09:02,639
that there's i have favorites but

2076
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:04,080
you know

2077
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:06,239
when i look at cannabis i don't really

2078
01:09:04,079 --> 01:09:08,399
look at it in that almost call it like a

2079
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:09,759
prejudicial way

2080
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:12,000
where we're segregating plants on

2081
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:14,000
quality and i only like one type

2082
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:17,759
you know what i mean like i've got my

2083
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,759
favorite dogs but for cannabis

2084
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:22,880
i see the very i see the inherent value

2085
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:25,119
in all of it

2086
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:26,880
yeah right you know that makes sense

2087
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:28,318
funky like rudor allah stuff with the

2088
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,920
autoflowering i mean that was like i

2089
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:30,960
collect that stuff you know yeah like

2090
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:32,399
when i'm in morocco when i was in

2091
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,759
morocco i found these plants there

2092
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:36,000
there's a there's a hemp variety called

2093
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:38,158
panorama and essentially

2094
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,158
that the plant grows like a globe

2095
01:09:38,158 --> 01:09:43,198
so like all the branches are completely

2096
01:09:40,158 --> 01:09:45,519
equal so it makes like this round bush

2097
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:47,198
oh wow right and this temp breeder named

2098
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:48,880
even bosch years ago he developed a

2099
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:51,039
variety of it for

2100
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:52,880
um like as an ornamental variety it was

2101
01:09:51,039 --> 01:09:54,319
like it was at the time it was the only

2102
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:56,239
ornamental cannabis variety that had

2103
01:09:54,319 --> 01:09:57,519
been bred yeah and he thought oh yeah

2104
01:09:56,238 --> 01:10:00,000
people planted their garden yeah with

2105
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:01,600
these little weird glove balls

2106
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,439
um anyway i found a plant like that in

2107
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:05,199
morocco and i was like [ __ ] you like

2108
01:10:03,439 --> 01:10:07,519
take some seeds out of that sucker and

2109
01:10:05,198 --> 01:10:08,879
take it home yeah right

2110
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:10,880
it's an oddity

2111
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:13,199
yeah it's an oddity it's not in the

2112
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:14,719
current cannabis massive gene pool as

2113
01:10:13,198 --> 01:10:15,759
far as what's being worked with you

2114
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:17,439
never know what it's going to offer

2115
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:19,520
different like i like the different like

2116
01:10:17,439 --> 01:10:21,279
i really do get off on the variation

2117
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:23,520
that you see in the species

2118
01:10:21,279 --> 01:10:27,198
yeah um because i don't think anybody's

2119
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:27,199
done a very good job at like

2120
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:32,000
characterizing the variation that exists

2121
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:33,280
on any given set of trades right well in

2122
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,359
april we did we started doing a pretty

2123
01:10:33,279 --> 01:10:37,198
good job on terps

2124
01:10:35,359 --> 01:10:38,639
and then once we you know what we did

2125
01:10:37,198 --> 01:10:40,399
terps at first and then we were like you

2126
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:42,320
know you end up with a plant that has

2127
01:10:40,399 --> 01:10:44,960
the same terpene terpene profile and you

2128
01:10:42,319 --> 01:10:47,279
got two plants that are identical

2129
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:48,480
that's that look identical by lab report

2130
01:10:47,279 --> 01:10:50,079
but you smell them they're totally

2131
01:10:48,479 --> 01:10:51,919
different you're like okay

2132
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:54,000
this is clearly not the whole story we

2133
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:56,560
need to look at other chemicals so you

2134
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,800
pull out the gcms and you start looking

2135
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:00,800
for

2136
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:02,640
regions between your peaks it's like

2137
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:04,640
what else is in there that we're

2138
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:06,480
like just driving over right we're

2139
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:07,840
passing in the analysis

2140
01:11:06,479 --> 01:11:09,439
and then you start looking at that and

2141
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:11,199
then you find oh there's other scent

2142
01:11:09,439 --> 01:11:12,719
molecules that are involved in other

2143
01:11:11,198 --> 01:11:15,039
molecules with scent that are involved

2144
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:16,319
in our perception perception of smell

2145
01:11:15,039 --> 01:11:19,519
because again it's like i've used this

2146
01:11:16,319 --> 01:11:21,359
analogy before but it's like

2147
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:23,520
it's kind of like going to the orchestra

2148
01:11:21,359 --> 01:11:25,039
and then and then turn to the guy that's

2149
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:26,560
never heard orchestra music and saying

2150
01:11:25,039 --> 01:11:28,880
hey did you hear the oboe

2151
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:31,199
yeah right it's like yeah yeah he he

2152
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:32,880
perceives that in the overall sound of

2153
01:11:31,198 --> 01:11:35,198
what he's perceiving is the sound of the

2154
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:37,039
orchestra but he hasn't trained himself

2155
01:11:35,198 --> 01:11:38,319
to be able to like identify that one

2156
01:11:37,039 --> 01:11:39,119
note right

2157
01:11:38,319 --> 01:11:42,158
yeah

2158
01:11:39,119 --> 01:11:45,039
and scent is an orchestra

2159
01:11:42,158 --> 01:11:46,960
yeah it is molecules right and when we

2160
01:11:45,039 --> 01:11:50,079
smell those molecules we get them all at

2161
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:52,880
once that we perceive it as one thing

2162
01:11:50,079 --> 01:11:54,319
but really it's one thing it's like it's

2163
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:55,359
kind of like looking at the mona lisa

2164
01:11:54,319 --> 01:11:56,960
it's like you can say yeah it's one

2165
01:11:55,359 --> 01:11:59,039
painting well yeah it's one painting but

2166
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:01,198
it's like look at all the intricacy that

2167
01:11:59,039 --> 01:12:02,000
exists in it right all the brush details

2168
01:12:01,198 --> 01:12:04,158
yeah

2169
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,359
yeah and that's really the difference

2170
01:12:04,158 --> 01:12:06,879
between

2171
01:12:05,359 --> 01:12:09,198
that's what happens when you you know i

2172
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:10,400
did i missed the thing last night but i

2173
01:12:09,198 --> 01:12:11,839
imagine it's the kind of stuff that you

2174
01:12:10,399 --> 01:12:14,238
guys were talking about last night right

2175
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:15,679
like yeah we went through his kit and i

2176
01:12:14,238 --> 01:12:18,238
i went through and smelled each

2177
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:19,760
individual one like the terpenes they're

2178
01:12:18,238 --> 01:12:21,359
all in different percentages and whatnot

2179
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:22,640
but yeah it was fascinating there were

2180
01:12:21,359 --> 01:12:24,639
certain ones that i was smelling like

2181
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:25,920
lemonade and a few others that i just it

2182
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:28,000
totally wasn't what i thought it would

2183
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:30,079
be like it smells like oranges doesn't

2184
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,439
it yeah yeah there's there's a few

2185
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:33,359
different lemonades in there but yeah it

2186
01:12:31,439 --> 01:12:35,359
was it was wild man

2187
01:12:33,359 --> 01:12:37,359
uh he he wants to send you one of the

2188
01:12:35,359 --> 01:12:39,599
full kits too if you ever want it cool

2189
01:12:37,359 --> 01:12:41,439
i'll check it out for sure yeah um he he

2190
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:43,360
wanted to know crybaby uh i'm curious

2191
01:12:41,439 --> 01:12:45,678
how so mcclonal variants fit into the

2192
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:48,000
whole plant patents or whole patent

2193
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:48,000
sphere

2194
01:12:49,279 --> 01:12:54,158
somaclonal variants okay so semicolonal

2195
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:56,320
variation is

2196
01:12:54,158 --> 01:12:57,920
like let's call it it's usually referred

2197
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:58,799
to as the genetic variation that comes

2198
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:01,199
out of

2199
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:02,000
tissue culture but you can yeah really

2200
01:13:01,198 --> 01:13:04,399
some

2201
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:07,119
a somatic cell is like any cell in your

2202
01:13:04,399 --> 01:13:08,799
body that is not destined to become like

2203
01:13:07,119 --> 01:13:12,399
sperm or egg

2204
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:12,400
okay right so like yeah

2205
01:13:13,359 --> 01:13:18,960
uh oh audio cut for a second

2206
01:13:16,079 --> 01:13:21,198
oh we dropped

2207
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:23,920
sorry so here we go you're good arms are

2208
01:13:21,198 --> 01:13:25,599
just going to keep going off um

2209
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:28,158
so the solar panel variation is like the

2210
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:29,039
variation that exists as a result of the

2211
01:13:28,158 --> 01:13:30,479
plant

2212
01:13:29,039 --> 01:13:32,319
growing

2213
01:13:30,479 --> 01:13:33,519
so like a somatic cell is like any cell

2214
01:13:32,319 --> 01:13:35,679
in your body like i was saying it

2215
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:37,120
doesn't become a germline cell that

2216
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:38,640
doesn't become again it's not going to

2217
01:13:37,119 --> 01:13:41,119
become a gamete

2218
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:41,119
yeah okay

2219
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:46,480
in plants we talk about it from what we

2220
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:48,639
see the variation that exists when

2221
01:13:46,479 --> 01:13:51,039
plants come out of tissue culture like

2222
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:53,440
there's a variant that we recognize as a

2223
01:13:51,039 --> 01:13:55,198
phenotypic variant which we're noticing

2224
01:13:53,439 --> 01:13:57,439
a change in morphology

2225
01:13:55,198 --> 01:13:57,439
yeah

2226
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:01,039
probably what's happened is the hormones

2227
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,600
that we've been using in the tissue

2228
01:14:01,039 --> 01:14:05,600
culture processes have caused a genetic

2229
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:07,039
mutation that is the result of that

2230
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:08,719
variation

2231
01:14:07,039 --> 01:14:10,399
right so i guess

2232
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:12,319
i'm just trying to like repurpose the

2233
01:14:10,399 --> 01:14:14,079
question to say like

2234
01:14:12,319 --> 01:14:16,319
what's the degree of natural variation

2235
01:14:14,079 --> 01:14:17,600
that exists in a cannabis plant right

2236
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:18,799
yeah there was a paper that was just

2237
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:20,079
done on this

2238
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:22,159
and i think there was some flaws in the

2239
01:14:20,079 --> 01:14:24,079
paper but they they actually sequenced

2240
01:14:22,158 --> 01:14:26,158
all these different plate like they took

2241
01:14:24,079 --> 01:14:27,439
samples from a big mother plant called

2242
01:14:26,158 --> 01:14:28,639
like you know it was like five or six

2243
01:14:27,439 --> 01:14:30,238
feet tall it was actually not in the

2244
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:32,640
healthiest condition which

2245
01:14:30,238 --> 01:14:34,238
you know yeah it was like i was like

2246
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:36,400
maybe that's that should have been

2247
01:14:34,238 --> 01:14:37,839
documented in the study but bottom line

2248
01:14:36,399 --> 01:14:39,439
is they took a whole bunch of

2249
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:41,279
samples of different shoot tips bottom

2250
01:14:39,439 --> 01:14:43,279
of the plant top and plant medium middle

2251
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:44,800
part of the plant and lo and behold

2252
01:14:43,279 --> 01:14:46,238
there's all this genetic mutation that

2253
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:48,320
exists even with just a mother plant

2254
01:14:46,238 --> 01:14:50,879
forget tissue culture

2255
01:14:48,319 --> 01:14:53,679
just within a mother plant now

2256
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:55,920
whether that is a factor of them doing a

2257
01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:58,158
bad analysis or not let's forget that

2258
01:14:55,920 --> 01:15:00,000
and just assume that it happens

2259
01:14:58,158 --> 01:15:02,399
okay

2260
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:05,198
plants and we've seen this in trees

2261
01:15:02,399 --> 01:15:06,960
mutations happen as plants grow right so

2262
01:15:05,198 --> 01:15:08,158
if you got like a plant that throws off

2263
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:09,600
two shoots

2264
01:15:08,158 --> 01:15:11,679
right so this is the main one here you

2265
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:13,679
got two sheets coming off here when this

2266
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:15,359
guy has a mutation every cell that

2267
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:16,800
develops from that

2268
01:15:15,359 --> 01:15:18,079
cell with a mutation is going to carry

2269
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:19,840
that mutation

2270
01:15:18,079 --> 01:15:21,679
yeah right and so we've literally got

2271
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:23,039
two branches on a tree

2272
01:15:21,679 --> 01:15:24,960
that are going off in different ways

2273
01:15:23,039 --> 01:15:27,279
that have different genotypes if that

2274
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:29,119
genotype happens in a gene if that

2275
01:15:27,279 --> 01:15:30,319
mutation happens in a gene that's

2276
01:15:29,119 --> 01:15:32,238
important

2277
01:15:30,319 --> 01:15:34,399
you know an important trait for cannabis

2278
01:15:32,238 --> 01:15:35,519
that could lead to like a change in the

2279
01:15:34,399 --> 01:15:37,359
plant

2280
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:38,480
yeah right and so i don't know you

2281
01:15:37,359 --> 01:15:40,158
probably heard that like someone's

2282
01:15:38,479 --> 01:15:42,718
asking like a sport that's that is a

2283
01:15:40,158 --> 01:15:44,799
sport but a sport is like a shoot with a

2284
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:47,039
mutation right and so for example i was

2285
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:49,039
just going to mention like that maybe

2286
01:15:47,039 --> 01:15:50,640
people have heard about like pinot

2287
01:15:49,039 --> 01:15:52,960
pinot noir is a great variety he's been

2288
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:54,400
around for hundreds of years

2289
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:56,239
we actually have these new grapes that

2290
01:15:54,399 --> 01:15:58,399
are called pinot noir or pinot blanc

2291
01:15:56,238 --> 01:16:00,079
which means you know white and pinot

2292
01:15:58,399 --> 01:16:01,519
um

2293
01:16:00,079 --> 01:16:03,039
pinot gris

2294
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:06,159
pinot gris is actually kind of a pinky

2295
01:16:03,039 --> 01:16:08,479
grape pinky it's actually a sport that

2296
01:16:06,158 --> 01:16:10,079
they found on like somebody was walking

2297
01:16:08,479 --> 01:16:12,399
through a

2298
01:16:10,079 --> 01:16:13,760
vineyard of pinot noir and noticed that

2299
01:16:12,399 --> 01:16:16,399
one branch

2300
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:17,920
on a plant had gray grapes not purple

2301
01:16:16,399 --> 01:16:19,039
grapes like there is a mutation that

2302
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:21,279
happened

2303
01:16:19,039 --> 01:16:23,119
yeah in the color gene

2304
01:16:21,279 --> 01:16:25,519
right and maybe some other genes as well

2305
01:16:23,119 --> 01:16:27,920
but the point is you snip off that

2306
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:30,320
that sport or that cutting

2307
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:32,560
that plant is actually different enough

2308
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:34,479
from the registered pinot noir variety

2309
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:36,560
that you can actually take pinot that

2310
01:16:34,479 --> 01:16:38,799
new short the the new sport pinot gris

2311
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:40,080
or peanut butter and and well maybe not

2312
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,840
patented but you can register it for a

2313
01:16:40,079 --> 01:16:42,960
while i don't know yet

2314
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:45,520
patents is a little bit different

2315
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:46,640
because the way they unlock the way they

2316
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:48,719
they kind of characterize them is a

2317
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:50,800
little bit different okay

2318
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:52,480
um but yeah it's it's

2319
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:53,679
like you know when you do your plant

2320
01:16:52,479 --> 01:16:55,279
registration it's like oh yeah the

2321
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:56,399
grapes are purple well if like you go

2322
01:16:55,279 --> 01:16:58,079
back and it's like you got this one

2323
01:16:56,399 --> 01:17:00,399
where the grapes aren't purple it's

2324
01:16:58,079 --> 01:17:02,399
obviously not the same variety

2325
01:17:00,399 --> 01:17:05,119
yeah right or the same cultivar so you

2326
01:17:02,399 --> 01:17:06,000
can get named as a new cultivar

2327
01:17:05,119 --> 01:17:07,039
so

2328
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,520
um

2329
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:11,039
yeah truth is like

2330
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:12,640
these things happen

2331
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:14,719
they happen in plants

2332
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:16,960
the degree to which they happen in

2333
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:18,719
cannabis i'm sure we know that they know

2334
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:20,480
we know that it happens

2335
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:22,079
i think the degree to which we know that

2336
01:17:20,479 --> 01:17:22,879
it happens is probably still up in the

2337
01:17:22,079 --> 01:17:24,238
air

2338
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:26,159
yeah so i don't know if that answers the

2339
01:17:24,238 --> 01:17:28,399
question but uh

2340
01:17:26,158 --> 01:17:29,198
maybe there's a little context for it

2341
01:17:28,399 --> 01:17:30,559
yeah

2342
01:17:29,198 --> 01:17:32,158
that's interesting

2343
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:34,080
um

2344
01:17:32,158 --> 01:17:35,599
can you talk about and now now we're

2345
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:37,039
going to

2346
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:38,960
some of your strains that you've done in

2347
01:17:37,039 --> 01:17:40,399
the past can you talk about what my

2348
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:42,000
favorite strain i know we've probably

2349
01:17:40,399 --> 01:17:44,319
gone over it before

2350
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:46,399
but since this is a new episode mental

2351
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:48,639
floss like that that was one that

2352
01:17:46,399 --> 01:17:50,960
touched me i'm a i'm a [ __ ] for purples

2353
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:52,800
and it was one of it was made during an

2354
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:54,719
era where purples were pretty obscure at

2355
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:56,640
the time like the the purple craze had

2356
01:17:54,719 --> 01:17:58,800
gone not many people were breeding with

2357
01:17:56,640 --> 01:18:00,960
purples but metal floss always had this

2358
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:02,880
beautiful purple senescence during

2359
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:04,719
flower yeah can you talk about a little

2360
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:07,199
bit when it turns at the end it's a

2361
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:08,640
beautiful one like when

2362
01:18:07,198 --> 01:18:10,479
it does one of those things i guess it's

2363
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:11,760
got a bunch of carotenoids in it the

2364
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:13,119
carotenoids like when you look at for

2365
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:14,640
example i don't know you you probably

2366
01:18:13,119 --> 01:18:16,640
don't have maple trees down where you

2367
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:18,800
are you might have seen them in the fall

2368
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:20,640
they go from like green and then when

2369
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:21,679
the green the plant you know when the

2370
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:23,199
plants going in the fall and they're

2371
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:25,119
about to shed their leaves they pull as

2372
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:26,960
much resources back out of the leaves

2373
01:18:25,119 --> 01:18:28,719
into the trunk yes right so they can

2374
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:30,800
save those those building blocks for

2375
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:33,039
next year and what's left what happens

2376
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:34,960
is so the plants go the leaves go from

2377
01:18:33,039 --> 01:18:37,039
green to either red or yellow the reason

2378
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:38,239
they're red or yellow is because they've

2379
01:18:37,039 --> 01:18:40,560
got

2380
01:18:38,238 --> 01:18:43,039
um

2381
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:44,640
molecules in the leaf called carotenoids

2382
01:18:43,039 --> 01:18:46,800
and carotenoids just comes from that

2383
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:48,079
yellow orangey pigment color that's why

2384
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:49,440
they're called that like kind of like

2385
01:18:48,079 --> 01:18:50,158
carrots right

2386
01:18:49,439 --> 01:18:52,399
but

2387
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:53,359
those carotenoids kind of hide behind

2388
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:55,920
the

2389
01:18:53,359 --> 01:18:57,119
chlorophyll and so with metal floss

2390
01:18:55,920 --> 01:19:00,480
again when you when you give it a good

2391
01:18:57,119 --> 01:19:02,238
flush at the end yeah and the plant you

2392
01:19:00,479 --> 01:19:04,718
know cannibalizes all that

2393
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:06,959
that chlorophyll you end up with these

2394
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:08,399
beautiful kind of rainbow

2395
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:10,239
yellow and purple leaves on the back

2396
01:19:08,399 --> 01:19:13,759
that plant is also like

2397
01:19:10,238 --> 01:19:16,079
it makes some of my favorite hash of any

2398
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:18,719
cannabis that i've ever come across

2399
01:19:16,079 --> 01:19:21,039
um super flavorful it's strong

2400
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:22,640
it melts like [ __ ] hell when you uh

2401
01:19:21,039 --> 01:19:25,039
someone's saying [ __ ] carrots yeah [ __ ]

2402
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:25,039
carrots

2403
01:19:25,119 --> 01:19:30,238
when you eat when you it melts like

2404
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:31,760
crazy and it's also very up like i would

2405
01:19:30,238 --> 01:19:33,119
smoke that stuff thinking i'm gonna have

2406
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:34,719
another puff and go to bed and you know

2407
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:36,640
i got the heat or two hours later typing

2408
01:19:34,719 --> 01:19:38,158
away you know yeah yeah like it just it

2409
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:40,159
gets you going

2410
01:19:38,158 --> 01:19:43,119
and he heals like a [ __ ]

2411
01:19:40,158 --> 01:19:46,158
so it's like it's just a great plant

2412
01:19:43,119 --> 01:19:48,880
right uh where did you source your uh

2413
01:19:46,158 --> 01:19:50,799
stuff for the incense haze

2414
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:52,400
that the incidence haze one of the

2415
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:54,079
parents is sweet skin the other one is a

2416
01:19:52,399 --> 01:19:56,479
seed that came from this dude in new

2417
01:19:54,079 --> 01:19:57,679
york state that or that said he got out

2418
01:19:56,479 --> 01:19:59,439
of the piff

2419
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:01,600
you know um

2420
01:19:59,439 --> 01:20:03,279
i don't know if it is or not

2421
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:05,039
his name was frank so i call it frank's

2422
01:20:03,279 --> 01:20:07,519
incense haze yeah right because it

2423
01:20:05,039 --> 01:20:08,719
really smelled like incense um when you

2424
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:10,639
grew it

2425
01:20:08,719 --> 01:20:12,639
like it was the reason i paired that one

2426
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:14,239
with the sweet skunk is because the two

2427
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:16,319
terp like

2428
01:20:14,238 --> 01:20:18,718
very oft not very often not very often

2429
01:20:16,319 --> 01:20:20,719
you'll come across two plants that are

2430
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:22,079
so close to each other they could be the

2431
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:23,279
same plant

2432
01:20:22,079 --> 01:20:24,238
yeah um

2433
01:20:23,279 --> 01:20:26,399
and so

2434
01:20:24,238 --> 01:20:28,238
sweet skunk in this plant were like in

2435
01:20:26,399 --> 01:20:31,119
almost every sense identical to the part

2436
01:20:28,238 --> 01:20:32,718
where like you'd walk into a room like

2437
01:20:31,119 --> 01:20:34,559
when you got when you know if you have

2438
01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:37,119
plans for like 10 15 years in your room

2439
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:39,039
yeah you get to learn like these little

2440
01:20:37,119 --> 01:20:40,719
you know idiosyncratic sorry

2441
01:20:39,039 --> 01:20:41,920
idiosyncrasy with the leaf and the way

2442
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:43,520
that like

2443
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:45,520
you know the way that the leaves come

2444
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:47,520
off the main frond or the serration

2445
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:49,600
pattern or whatever it is yeah you get

2446
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:51,840
to know them like a parent can identify

2447
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:54,400
twins right like one of the twins and so

2448
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:55,760
it's the same thing like

2449
01:20:54,399 --> 01:20:57,679
um and

2450
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:59,119
these plants would get confused right

2451
01:20:57,679 --> 01:21:01,440
the people would get them all the time

2452
01:20:59,119 --> 01:21:02,639
because they're so close together

2453
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:04,799
um

2454
01:21:02,639 --> 01:21:06,560
anyway yeah it was so when those two

2455
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:08,480
came together so i didn't keep saying i

2456
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:09,920
was selfish because i wanted to

2457
01:21:08,479 --> 01:21:12,158
understand the inheritance pattern of

2458
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:12,960
some of the rare volatiles that are in

2459
01:21:12,158 --> 01:21:15,279
it

2460
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:17,039
and the self

2461
01:21:15,279 --> 01:21:18,158
although it's pure it's a little bit

2462
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:20,158
smaller

2463
01:21:18,158 --> 01:21:21,759
you got a wider range of like because

2464
01:21:20,158 --> 01:21:23,519
it's expressing all the all the the

2465
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:25,520
hidden variation that exists within one

2466
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:26,880
genome right or those that self

2467
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:28,639
population

2468
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:32,480
but when i cross those two sister

2469
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:35,520
planets together when i when i do a um

2470
01:21:32,479 --> 01:21:38,079
when i do cross using a reversal i'll

2471
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:39,600
always hit the plant to itself because

2472
01:21:38,079 --> 01:21:42,238
usually you're trying to get that pure

2473
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:44,960
line but i also always while the paul is

2474
01:21:42,238 --> 01:21:47,119
flying i will just make a bunch of other

2475
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:48,399
crosses at the same time yeah so it's

2476
01:21:47,119 --> 01:21:50,079
you have them so it's like when you're

2477
01:21:48,399 --> 01:21:52,158
going down a program it's like oh hey i

2478
01:21:50,079 --> 01:21:54,238
lost a trade or this line doesn't have a

2479
01:21:52,158 --> 01:21:55,839
trait that i want you go back to the

2480
01:21:54,238 --> 01:21:57,759
line with the trait you've already got a

2481
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:59,440
hybrid that's 50

2482
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:01,119
within the line you're working in right

2483
01:21:59,439 --> 01:22:04,158
so

2484
01:22:01,119 --> 01:22:05,679
some guy dude uh but anyway

2485
01:22:04,158 --> 01:22:09,279
so when you cross those two things

2486
01:22:05,679 --> 01:22:11,039
together this this the incense haze

2487
01:22:09,279 --> 01:22:13,679
which wasn't simply irresistible i mean

2488
01:22:11,039 --> 01:22:14,719
they came out much bigger and better

2489
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:17,760
um

2490
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:19,679
and very consistent to type

2491
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:21,440
you know um

2492
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:24,079
so it kind of was the best of both

2493
01:22:21,439 --> 01:22:25,839
worlds so when people ask me if like you

2494
01:22:24,079 --> 01:22:28,479
know when they're when they're sniffing

2495
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:30,239
around that thing i always say hey

2496
01:22:28,479 --> 01:22:32,238
get both of them you know get the self

2497
01:22:30,238 --> 01:22:34,000
for breeding so you got the pure stock

2498
01:22:32,238 --> 01:22:36,158
it's a little little more homozygous or

2499
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,279
a greater chance of being homozygous

2500
01:22:36,158 --> 01:22:39,599
but

2501
01:22:37,279 --> 01:22:41,759
the hybrid performs the other one

2502
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:43,840
right in terms of like a grower's

2503
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:45,600
performance right oh sure you know it

2504
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:46,800
really depends on what what the customer

2505
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,840
is looking for

2506
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:49,679
i

2507
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:52,319
want to have time i really like to take

2508
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:54,239
my time to do it like a proper consult

2509
01:22:52,319 --> 01:22:56,000
with someone because i'll come up and be

2510
01:22:54,238 --> 01:22:57,359
like hey somebody grew this stuff the

2511
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,639
you know the lemon floss it's great i

2512
01:22:57,359 --> 01:23:00,238
want to grow it and that's like what

2513
01:22:58,639 --> 01:23:01,920
what are you doing it for like what are

2514
01:23:00,238 --> 01:23:03,359
you using it for

2515
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:04,800
right because i don't want you to buy

2516
01:23:03,359 --> 01:23:06,559
the seeds that you think you want i want

2517
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:09,520
you to have the seeds that are going to

2518
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:10,639
be the best for what you do

2519
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:13,199
right

2520
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:15,199
yeah so yeah

2521
01:23:13,198 --> 01:23:17,519
is there a strain that you can think of

2522
01:23:15,198 --> 01:23:18,960
that you have been looking for for many

2523
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:22,159
years or strain you'd like to encounter

2524
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:22,158
from the past that you haven't

2525
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:24,719
i mean

2526
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:26,880
yeah

2527
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:28,639
again we ended a straight discussion i

2528
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:31,679
think of it in terms of plants

2529
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:33,440
right like are there rare phenotypes

2530
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:35,279
that i've seen in the past that i don't

2531
01:23:33,439 --> 01:23:36,879
that i'd love to see again sure i mean

2532
01:23:35,279 --> 01:23:38,319
of course

2533
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:39,440
it's kind of one of those things that

2534
01:23:38,319 --> 01:23:41,599
it's like

2535
01:23:39,439 --> 01:23:43,839
if it comes by and passes without you

2536
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:45,840
grabbing a copy and then solving it like

2537
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:47,679
it may have gone to the wind

2538
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:49,199
yeah right so you got to recognize that

2539
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:51,199
it is but you know you're always looking

2540
01:23:49,198 --> 01:23:52,479
for those things in the future

2541
01:23:51,198 --> 01:23:54,479
we decided to plant when i was

2542
01:23:52,479 --> 01:23:56,879
relatively young and it was called the

2543
01:23:54,479 --> 01:23:58,959
scooty sweetie there's an island off of

2544
01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:00,239
uh texas british columbia and the

2545
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:02,319
straight there

2546
01:24:00,238 --> 01:24:04,479
yeah called listedian it's no power it's

2547
01:24:02,319 --> 01:24:05,759
essentially a hippie commune and

2548
01:24:04,479 --> 01:24:08,879
you know they grow a lot of dope up

2549
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:10,400
there um yeah and they this one like it

2550
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:11,440
was before i had ever i'd never even

2551
01:24:10,399 --> 01:24:12,719
heard of the island at that point in

2552
01:24:11,439 --> 01:24:14,559
time i was quite young living on the

2553
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:17,039
other side of the country and a friend

2554
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:18,159
of mine a friend of mine

2555
01:24:17,039 --> 01:24:20,158
someone's asking what we think of

2556
01:24:18,158 --> 01:24:23,279
breeder's team yeah your questions are

2557
01:24:20,158 --> 01:24:24,799
funny dude um anyway

2558
01:24:23,279 --> 01:24:26,399
this this flower ended up back with me

2559
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:28,639
and it was amazing it was like

2560
01:24:26,399 --> 01:24:29,519
incredibly electric super strong really

2561
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:31,920
up

2562
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:33,679
and unfortunately other than the name

2563
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:34,560
leskidi sweetie

2564
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:36,719
i

2565
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:38,639
i never knew anything you know

2566
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:39,679
yeah i never knew what it was so it's

2567
01:24:38,639 --> 01:24:41,520
like yeah for sure i'd love to come

2568
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:42,800
across those things

2569
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:44,239
um

2570
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:46,000
but it's like the beautiful girl that

2571
01:24:44,238 --> 01:24:48,158
you dated in high school you might not

2572
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:49,439
find another one like it so marry her

2573
01:24:48,158 --> 01:24:50,238
while you can

2574
01:24:49,439 --> 01:24:52,079
yeah

2575
01:24:50,238 --> 01:24:53,519
yeah no kid

2576
01:24:52,079 --> 01:24:55,198
well we need to get your genetics here

2577
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:56,880
in the states you know i know there's a

2578
01:24:55,198 --> 01:24:58,158
lot of people who really want to grab

2579
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:59,440
chimera's stuff is there anywhere

2580
01:24:58,158 --> 01:25:00,960
available in the states right now that

2581
01:24:59,439 --> 01:25:01,599
people can i can't i can't sell out of

2582
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:03,198
the

2583
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:06,000
states unfortunately

2584
01:25:03,198 --> 01:25:07,599
oh um there is that it's definitely like

2585
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,439
i said when i work down there

2586
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:11,520
part of you know becoming a landed

2587
01:25:09,439 --> 01:25:12,399
immigrant is having your fingerprint

2588
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:14,880
scanned

2589
01:25:12,399 --> 01:25:16,238
right so it's like me me sending seeds

2590
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:17,359
into the states ain't really a great

2591
01:25:16,238 --> 01:25:19,599
idea

2592
01:25:17,359 --> 01:25:21,519
yeah it's probably probably not but yeah

2593
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:23,760
maybe someone can um work on doing some

2594
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:24,840
chimera genetics out here that'd be cool

2595
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:25,840
yeah

2596
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:27,440
yeah the states we have breeders

2597
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:29,199
retailers gonna come up and get going

2598
01:25:27,439 --> 01:25:31,439
again but they're a uk bank

2599
01:25:29,198 --> 01:25:33,599
so it's you know with them having done

2600
01:25:31,439 --> 01:25:35,839
brexit it's a like it's a bit of a [ __ ]

2601
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:37,039
show right yeah not this it's not as

2602
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:38,800
easy to the business side of the uk it

2603
01:25:37,039 --> 01:25:41,198
was but it's perfectly legal for us to

2604
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:42,800
do yeah so people that want to do that

2605
01:25:41,198 --> 01:25:44,960
can you know get contact with me and we

2606
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:46,480
can hook you up to the uk

2607
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:48,319
um

2608
01:25:46,479 --> 01:25:49,919
but unfortunately the way the laws are

2609
01:25:48,319 --> 01:25:51,198
and with that whole

2610
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:53,760
fingerprint and having worked for the

2611
01:25:51,198 --> 01:25:55,039
man thing it's like yeah

2612
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:56,320
yeah

2613
01:25:55,039 --> 01:25:57,359
that always

2614
01:25:56,319 --> 01:25:58,399
though

2615
01:25:57,359 --> 01:26:00,319
yeah

2616
01:25:58,399 --> 01:26:02,319
that's where we're at

2617
01:26:00,319 --> 01:26:03,439
um crybaby made a comment on your

2618
01:26:02,319 --> 01:26:05,119
limoncello he said i thought the

2619
01:26:03,439 --> 01:26:06,638
limoncello was very consistent was an

2620
01:26:05,119 --> 01:26:08,639
excellent breeder i know he's done some

2621
01:26:06,639 --> 01:26:10,400
stuff with the two yeah that's right

2622
01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:12,480
right that's the that's the sweet skin

2623
01:26:10,399 --> 01:26:14,559
itself it is pretty consistent smell

2624
01:26:12,479 --> 01:26:16,638
wise there's a little bit of variation i

2625
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:18,239
find still in like in morphology if you

2626
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:19,359
grow enough plants of the flower more

2627
01:26:18,238 --> 01:26:21,198
quality

2628
01:26:19,359 --> 01:26:23,198
and so that's just what i meant from

2629
01:26:21,198 --> 01:26:24,719
that context like the smoking they're

2630
01:26:23,198 --> 01:26:25,759
more or less they're more or less the

2631
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:26,880
same but they're very close they're

2632
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:28,480
within

2633
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:30,719
that type

2634
01:26:28,479 --> 01:26:32,559
um yeah but

2635
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:33,920
you know i wouldn't lay down if i was

2636
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:35,840
going to grow an indoor set of tables i

2637
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:37,039
wouldn't lay see down seed from those

2638
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:38,079
because there's just

2639
01:26:37,039 --> 01:26:39,198
if you're trying to sell the flour

2640
01:26:38,079 --> 01:26:41,279
there's a little for me there's a little

2641
01:26:39,198 --> 01:26:43,439
bit too much inconsistency

2642
01:26:41,279 --> 01:26:44,479
yeah yeah

2643
01:26:43,439 --> 01:26:46,799
well is there anything else you want to

2644
01:26:44,479 --> 01:26:49,919
cover before we uh rock it out steve's

2645
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:51,600
saying cut some bc locals up with seeds

2646
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:53,840
all these new regenexx knees suck and

2647
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:56,079
then there's seeds are available

2648
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:57,119
yes seeds are there yeah everybody

2649
01:26:56,079 --> 01:26:59,039
listen everybody's you know what it's

2650
01:26:57,119 --> 01:27:01,198
like everybody's gone for the cali stuff

2651
01:26:59,039 --> 01:27:02,560
right the cali kelly world owns the

2652
01:27:01,198 --> 01:27:04,879
world

2653
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:06,800
it's you know spain on the worlds 10

2654
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:11,279
years ago bcu in the world 10 years

2655
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:11,279
before that it'll vary it'll move around

2656
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:14,800
the work right they're doing the work

2657
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:16,239
down there there's a lot of people that

2658
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:18,400
are growing seeds

2659
01:27:16,238 --> 01:27:19,359
um yeah and listen that's the only way

2660
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:20,960
that we're going to come up with new

2661
01:27:19,359 --> 01:27:22,559
better cannabis keep your own seeds just

2662
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:24,000
[ __ ] keep growing seeds as much as

2663
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:27,440
it's appealing and you have to grow

2664
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:29,520
clones for your business model

2665
01:27:27,439 --> 01:27:30,638
you know just keep growing seeds because

2666
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:32,400
if you don't grow these we're never

2667
01:27:30,639 --> 01:27:33,760
going to find anything new and we're

2668
01:27:32,399 --> 01:27:36,000
always going to be stuck with the same

2669
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:38,079
[ __ ] that we had five years ago that's

2670
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,439
how it goes yeah

2671
01:27:38,079 --> 01:27:41,279
yeah

2672
01:27:39,439 --> 01:27:44,079
right and listen sometimes it's stuff

2673
01:27:41,279 --> 01:27:46,238
from my you know it's like i i see i say

2674
01:27:44,079 --> 01:27:48,000
i call it cannabis fashion right it's

2675
01:27:46,238 --> 01:27:49,599
like i like to i like to hold on to old

2676
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:51,279
cuts because it's like they go out of

2677
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:52,639
favor but you bring them back like five

2678
01:27:51,279 --> 01:27:54,158
ten years later and people were like i

2679
01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:55,600
love that [ __ ]

2680
01:27:54,158 --> 01:27:57,439
you know yeah like dude it's the mini

2681
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:59,280
skirt or the bell bottoms like they keep

2682
01:27:57,439 --> 01:28:00,479
it back right

2683
01:27:59,279 --> 01:28:02,399
so yeah

2684
01:28:00,479 --> 01:28:04,158
i never thought i'd see skunk one make a

2685
01:28:02,399 --> 01:28:07,119
comeback and it did you know a few years

2686
01:28:04,158 --> 01:28:07,119
ago like what the [ __ ]

2687
01:28:07,279 --> 01:28:10,319
would i laugh at the skunk one if

2688
01:28:09,119 --> 01:28:12,639
somebody actually actually asked me to

2689
01:28:10,319 --> 01:28:14,158
sit in and help use genetics to help

2690
01:28:12,639 --> 01:28:15,840
referee this stuff because it's like you

2691
01:28:14,158 --> 01:28:18,158
got like five guys in california they

2692
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:20,000
were like i've got the original skunk

2693
01:28:18,158 --> 01:28:22,479
one that's like oh you do do you it's

2694
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,840

2696
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:27,679
though no okay well then you don't have

2697
01:28:26,319 --> 01:28:29,840
the original

2698
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:31,679
yeah right it's funny again it's that

2699
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:33,039
whole ego thing that like people want to

2700
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:34,880
get together

2701
01:28:33,039 --> 01:28:36,319
and you know and be like hey i got the

2702
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:40,079

[ __ ] wonderful dumb it's an

2705
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:44,960
interesting plant but it's one of those

2706
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:47,039
things like you know it was one of the

2707
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:48,000
first right the first recruit reading

2708
01:28:47,039 --> 01:28:49,439
lines and

2709
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,880
dave started selling it in holland and

2710
01:28:49,439 --> 01:28:52,238
then every proceed company was like well

2711
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:53,199
it's not selling we got to sell the

2712
01:28:52,238 --> 01:28:54,959
skunk

2713
01:28:53,198 --> 01:28:56,719
yes so it's like then dutch passion's

2714
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:58,480
got it and since he's got a copy of it

2715
01:28:56,719 --> 01:29:00,158
and then everybody's got a copy of it

2716
01:28:58,479 --> 01:29:01,279
every [ __ ] seed bank in the world

2717
01:29:00,158 --> 01:29:03,519
more or less

2718
01:29:01,279 --> 01:29:05,359
has a copy of it are they all original

2719
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:06,719
how much are they any like you know it'd

2720
01:29:05,359 --> 01:29:08,238
be really interesting to have like an

2721
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:10,239
acre and have all of them and grow them

2722
01:29:08,238 --> 01:29:11,759
all side by side and just see and see

2723
01:29:10,238 --> 01:29:13,599
what they're like they're probably not

2724
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:15,520
they probably like not even you know

2725
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:17,840
they're probably not even alike

2726
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:19,440
yeah i'm sure they're not and this dude

2727
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:22,560
that bought the seeds back in like you

2728
01:29:19,439 --> 01:29:23,839
know 96 or whatever when he got them

2729
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:25,120
you probably didn't get them from the

2730
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:27,199
original guy

2731
01:29:25,119 --> 01:29:28,559
right so yeah probably not is your stuff

2732
01:29:27,198 --> 01:29:30,960
original

2733
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:32,800
you know yeah it's just it's a funny

2734
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:33,600
it's a funny thing i i

2735
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:36,560
i

2736
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:39,120
i was actually quite amused to see

2737
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:41,360
one of the most spread around scene

2738
01:29:39,119 --> 01:29:42,399
varieties that existed in the last 50

2739
01:29:41,359 --> 01:29:44,000
years

2740
01:29:42,399 --> 01:29:46,238
have a bunch of new people pop up and be

2741
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:48,079
like yo i've got the original like yeah

2742
01:29:46,238 --> 01:29:50,158
and then and throw down big dollars even

2743
01:29:48,079 --> 01:29:52,079
though it's never been gone

2744
01:29:50,158 --> 01:29:53,679
you know yeah like it's always been

2745
01:29:52,079 --> 01:29:55,840
available and what like what is the

2746
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:57,679
original like yeah right like the

2747
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:59,600
original was a seed it was a named

2748
01:29:57,679 --> 01:30:00,800
population it wasn't like

2749
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:02,960
you know it's not like today it's like

2750
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:05,520
oh gee kush or cookies or [ __ ] ruts

2751
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:07,039
or whatever like these start as cuttings

2752
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:08,400
right it always makes me laugh it's like

2753
01:30:07,039 --> 01:30:10,719
you know for example blue dream when

2754
01:30:08,399 --> 01:30:12,559
blue dream came around

2755
01:30:10,719 --> 01:30:14,000
it was it was one cut

2756
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:15,520
right more or less like there ended up

2757
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,238
being a couple that were very similar

2758
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:18,719
but

2759
01:30:16,238 --> 01:30:20,638
there was one cut and then people would

2760
01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:22,000
come along and be like i got this blue

2761
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:23,600
dream santa cruz blue dream thing and

2762
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,479
then they'll like spank white widow on

2763
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:28,639
it or some og or whatever some random

2764
01:30:26,479 --> 01:30:31,359
pollen yeah and then they sell the seeds

2765
01:30:28,639 --> 01:30:33,440
as blue dreams blue drain and now people

2766
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:34,559
grow those seeds in a different market

2767
01:30:33,439 --> 01:30:36,960
where they don't know what the original

2768
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:38,960
blue dream is they pick a mom they say

2769
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:40,079
it's blue dream and now you've got two

2770
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:41,840
plants

2771
01:30:40,079 --> 01:30:43,279
that are being passed around the world

2772
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:44,800
as if they're both the original and one

2773
01:30:43,279 --> 01:30:46,319
of them is not even the same chemical

2774
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:49,360
profile as the blue drink yeah right

2775
01:30:46,319 --> 01:30:50,479
it's not even close most likely yeah

2776
01:30:49,359 --> 01:30:51,839
so

2777
01:30:50,479 --> 01:30:53,439

2786
01:31:06,479 --> 01:31:10,000
early 80s he brought obviously a bunch

he met a hemp researcher that was

2794
01:31:22,399 --> 01:31:25,599
essentially like

2795
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:27,920
he was a he was in a european country

2796
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:28,719
i'm not going to say which one but he

2797
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:30,800
was

2798
01:31:28,719 --> 01:31:33,600
the he grew like he was known as the

2799
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:36,800
heft guy right like redhead their their

2800
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:38,880
country sold hemp seed around the world

2801
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:39,840
and when

2802
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:42,239
when the

2803
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:44,400
uh police would like they'd come across

2804
01:31:42,238 --> 01:31:45,839
a cannabis bust they'd go and get him

2805
01:31:44,399 --> 01:31:48,238
and bring him to the site and be like is

2806
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:50,800
this drug cannabis or not is this hemp

2807
01:31:48,238 --> 01:31:53,119
yeah right yeah i know blackpile

2808
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:53,119
um

2809
01:31:53,439 --> 01:31:56,399
and um

2810
01:31:55,039 --> 01:31:59,840
sorry someone's asking that question

2811
01:31:56,399 --> 01:31:59,839
that's all right and uh anyway

2812
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:06,158
sam arranged for this guy to grow on his

2813
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:06,960
research field a hectare of skunk

2814
01:32:06,158 --> 01:32:09,359
yeah

2815
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:10,800
and and open populate it so essentially

2816
01:32:09,359 --> 01:32:12,319
like you know sam brought those seeds

2817
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:14,159
over and they all went into greenhouses

2818
01:32:12,319 --> 01:32:15,920
they did various things things of them

2819
01:32:14,158 --> 01:32:18,158
had a big bunch of

2820
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:19,119
the skunk left enough to plant like a

2821
01:32:18,158 --> 01:32:20,719
hectare

2822
01:32:19,119 --> 01:32:21,679
and so they took them to this european

2823
01:32:20,719 --> 01:32:23,359
company

2824
01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:25,440
country and planted in hector in

2825
01:32:23,359 --> 01:32:28,158
isolation

2826
01:32:25,439 --> 01:32:29,599
and he and rob went through the

2827
01:32:28,158 --> 01:32:31,039
uh what the field and robed all the

2828
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:33,199
males and the off-types and the and the

2829
01:32:31,039 --> 01:32:34,960
the females that were not skunk-like

2830
01:32:33,198 --> 01:32:37,839
yeah but the rest of it just got like an

2831
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:40,960
open pocket open-pollinated that is what

2832
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:44,000
the ancestral skunk is okay okay so it's

2833
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:45,760
like it's the closest thing a population

2834
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:48,639
could be

2835
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:51,119
to what was produced in california

2836
01:32:48,639 --> 01:32:52,800
yes all the other families that came out

2837
01:32:51,119 --> 01:32:54,399
of that population were like you know

2838
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:56,079
they were family lines somebody went in

2839
01:32:54,399 --> 01:32:58,000
and found two plants and they crossed

2840
01:32:56,079 --> 01:33:00,079
them together yeah so what came out of

2841
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:01,600
that from those one-to-one cross is not

2842
01:33:00,079 --> 01:33:03,920
the same as what was preserved in the

2843
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:05,760
overall open population right so that's

2844
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:07,760
what the that's what the skunk was as i

2845
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:10,159
said sam was like there's all these

2846
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:12,320
people are you know

2847
01:33:10,158 --> 01:33:13,359
crying and whatever about having access

2848
01:33:12,319 --> 01:33:15,119
to this

2849
01:33:13,359 --> 01:33:15,509
what's up plastagram

2850
01:33:15,119 --> 01:33:16,880
um

2851
01:33:15,510 --> 01:33:18,719
[Music]

2852
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:20,239
let's give them access to this so we did

2853
01:33:18,719 --> 01:33:21,359
right and that and they have they got a

2854
01:33:20,238 --> 01:33:23,359
little germination around i mean they

2855
01:33:21,359 --> 01:33:24,559
germinate yeah like that like 25 or

2856
01:33:23,359 --> 01:33:26,000
maybe even a little bit less now i

2857
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:27,679
haven't tested them recently well

2858
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,639
they're pretty old right

2859
01:33:27,679 --> 01:33:30,719
yeah i mean they must have been

2860
01:33:28,639 --> 01:33:31,679
reproduced like

2861
01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:34,880
30

2862
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:34,880
25 30 years ago

2863
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:38,880
a yeah years ago

2864
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:41,119
sam was looking at selling his

2865
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:43,600
collection and i actually helped him

2866
01:33:41,119 --> 01:33:45,359
re-catalog the entire thing

2867
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:47,199
and so we got to go you know we went

2868
01:33:45,359 --> 01:33:48,559
through everything and

2869
01:33:47,198 --> 01:33:50,238
we did a whole bunch of germination

2870
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:51,840
tests and we pulled stuff out that was

2871
01:33:50,238 --> 01:33:53,519
like 25 year old seed that had been

2872
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:56,079
stored at like

2873
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:58,400
you know four degrees celsius for

2874
01:33:56,079 --> 01:34:01,359
20 plus years 25 years and sometimes

2875
01:33:58,399 --> 01:34:03,039
germinated at like 80 90

2876
01:34:01,359 --> 01:34:04,960
so seeds if they're stored properly and

2877
01:34:03,039 --> 01:34:06,719
consistently they can last a long time

2878
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:09,279
and it's like i got like i got a ton of

2879
01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:10,880
those blueberry seeds still left from

2880
01:34:09,279 --> 01:34:12,719
from the dj black projects and people

2881
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:14,800
like yeah but they're all seeds but dude

2882
01:34:12,719 --> 01:34:16,840
i can pull [ __ ] the grapefruit sweet

2883
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:19,760
skunk out and pop ten of them and all of

2884
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:22,400
them right like doesn't matter how old

2885
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:23,280
the [ __ ] seed is if it germinates

2886
01:34:22,399 --> 01:34:25,279
right

2887
01:34:23,279 --> 01:34:26,960
yeah exactly

2888
01:34:25,279 --> 01:34:28,079
obviously some people think differently

2889
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:29,600
but

2890
01:34:28,079 --> 01:34:32,800
was there any skunk too in that

2891
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:34,880
population of uh stuff that he had saved

2892
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:36,400
skunk 2 wasn't from sam

2893
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:37,760
oh it wasn't no you know where was that

2894
01:34:36,399 --> 01:34:39,599
from i don't know somebody else came

2895
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:42,159
along and made it up i don't think he

2896
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:43,520
ever produced one called skunk too he um

2897
01:34:42,158 --> 01:34:45,118
i remember there was some kind of quote

2898
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:47,440
somewhere about him talking about how

2899
01:34:45,118 --> 01:34:49,839
skunk 2 was the

2900
01:34:47,439 --> 01:34:51,678
the skunkier version

2901
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:52,639
he didn't work the skunkier version

2902
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:54,319
that's the thing he was like i don't

2903
01:34:52,639 --> 01:34:56,639
like it i'm watching that

2904
01:34:54,319 --> 01:34:58,399
yeah yeah all right so yeah i wonder

2905
01:34:56,639 --> 01:34:59,920
where i read that i'll have to go back

2906
01:34:58,399 --> 01:35:01,439
and look there's a lot of stuff that

2907
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:02,560
gets attributed to sam i mean it's like

2908
01:35:01,439 --> 01:35:04,399
again the whole thing about him in the

2909
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:05,920
dea like all this [ __ ] is attributed to

2910
01:35:04,399 --> 01:35:08,799
him that's just not even true there's

2911
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:10,639
little specks of like roots of truth

2912
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:13,039
that somebody took and blew up into this

2913
01:35:10,639 --> 01:35:15,600
big weird story and you know

2914
01:35:13,039 --> 01:35:17,600
misinterpret this um it's because he's

2915
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:19,360
mr mystery i think you know like he's

2916
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:21,119
like he's an enigma you're not wrong

2917
01:35:19,359 --> 01:35:22,639
that doesn't help but again like i think

2918
01:35:21,118 --> 01:35:24,000
after like i think if you were treated

2919
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:26,239
the way that he's been treated in the

2920
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,600
cannabis community

2921
01:35:26,238 --> 01:35:29,359
look i mean it's like the same thing

2922
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:30,800
that happened with me in the my brain

2923
01:35:29,359 --> 01:35:32,158
for that work that ended up being

2924
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:33,600
patented it's like everybody [ __ ]

2925
01:35:32,158 --> 01:35:36,799
turns on you

2926
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:36,800
yeah right um

2927
01:35:38,238 --> 01:35:41,519
and you know people like i said

2928
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:43,279
everywhere everywhere he went it was

2929
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:44,480
like the you know the whole dutch scene

2930
01:35:43,279 --> 01:35:46,479
the reason that people started calling

2931
01:35:44,479 --> 01:35:48,238
him dea

2932
01:35:46,479 --> 01:35:50,158
was that he was able to come into a

2933
01:35:48,238 --> 01:35:52,158
country that wasn't his he's not [ __ ]

2934
01:35:50,158 --> 01:35:56,399
dutch he went to holland as an american

2935
01:35:52,158 --> 01:35:57,359
expat and was able to was able to get

2936
01:35:56,399 --> 01:35:58,879
um

2937
01:35:57,359 --> 01:36:00,799
no i didn't say rooting hormone i said

2938
01:35:58,880 --> 01:36:02,480
hormones for plant tissue culture so

2939
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:04,719
rooting hormones not the same

2940
01:36:02,479 --> 01:36:06,959
um some of the [ __ ] that they use for

2941
01:36:04,719 --> 01:36:09,198
plant tissue culture can cause mutations

2942
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:11,359
but that's yeah

2943
01:36:09,198 --> 01:36:13,599
um but anyway sam was able to go into

2944
01:36:11,359 --> 01:36:14,880
holland set up set up business get a

2945
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:16,880
license to grow cannabis from the

2946
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:18,319
government nobody else could do it

2947
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:20,159
yeah and so of course all the dutch

2948
01:36:18,319 --> 01:36:21,679
dudes were [ __ ] choked right they

2949
01:36:20,158 --> 01:36:23,359
were like how is this not this isn't

2950
01:36:21,679 --> 01:36:25,840
fair this guy's got all this [ __ ] right

2951
01:36:23,359 --> 01:36:28,399
there absolutely he must have some

2952
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:30,639
context that we don't have what the [ __ ]

2953
01:36:28,399 --> 01:36:32,559
like the dea is an american organization

2954
01:36:30,639 --> 01:36:33,760
why the hell would the dea

2955
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:35,039
go to the government of a different

2956
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:36,800
country and say hey you got to let this

2957
01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:39,039
america grow weed in your country that

2958
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:42,239
doesn't make any [ __ ] sense like

2959
01:36:39,039 --> 01:36:44,079
that's a stupid [ __ ] assumption right

2960
01:36:42,238 --> 01:36:46,238
that's the story that some dutch

2961
01:36:44,079 --> 01:36:47,840
reporter guy came up with and he used to

2962
01:36:46,238 --> 01:36:49,759
have a written cannabis radio show and

2963
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:52,239
he spared them all over the airwaves and

2964
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:53,920

2999
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:57,600
that i was working with

3000
01:37:55,198 --> 01:38:00,238
at the time that i was employed by that

3001

were allowing me to [ __ ] like have my

3002
01:38:00,238 --> 01:38:04,319
dream cannabis job and build a [ __ ]

3003
01:38:02,319 --> 01:38:05,198
multi-million dollar laboratory to play

3004
01:38:04,319 --> 01:38:08,000
in

3005
01:38:05,198 --> 01:38:09,759
right like yeah it's a job but it's also

3006
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,359
a job that i wanted to do one of the

3007
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:13,440
consequences that these guys came out

3008
01:38:11,359 --> 01:38:16,158
and patented a bunch of uh

3009
01:38:13,439 --> 01:38:17,919
a a class of plants that didn't exist

3010
01:38:16,158 --> 01:38:19,839
before i made them

3011
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:22,239
yeah so it's like how the hell people

3012
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:24,560
like you can complain

3013
01:38:22,238 --> 01:38:26,799
is ridiculous like you you obviously

3014
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:29,039
have no idea what you're talking about

3015
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:31,039
and are spouting an opinion

3016
01:38:29,039 --> 01:38:33,198
of like from a place of complete

3017
01:38:31,039 --> 01:38:34,479
ignorance so like yeah i do have to

3018
01:38:33,198 --> 01:38:36,158
laugh and

3019
01:38:34,479 --> 01:38:38,399
the reason i'm emotional about it i'm

3020
01:38:36,158 --> 01:38:40,559
clearly irritated is because i [ __ ]

3021
01:38:38,399 --> 01:38:42,719
got death threats from people like you

3022
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:44,800
yeah i know right yeah so give me i went

3023
01:38:42,719 --> 01:38:47,439

after me right i did yeah

3025
01:38:47,439 --> 01:38:51,279
yeah i didn't have the full i didn't

3026
01:38:49,198 --> 01:38:53,919
have the full picture and no one did and

3027
01:38:51,279 --> 01:38:55,599
that's that's the problem you know

3028
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:58,319
no no one had the full picture we just

3029
01:38:55,600 --> 01:39:00,800
went off of uh oh my god patent this

3030
01:38:58,319 --> 01:39:03,840
guy's [ __ ] with the man

3031
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:05,840
listen our community was bred to believe

3032
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:08,000
that right yeah yeah they should be very

3033
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:09,840
conspiratorial yeah they're bad like i

3034
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:13,359
knew research scientists that worked at

3035
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:16,560
gw pharmaceuticals like doing petri dish

3036
01:39:13,359 --> 01:39:18,559
work and experimental design and like

3037
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:20,960
these guys would have the same

3038
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:22,719
experiences that you and i would have

3039
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:25,439
taking care of mary's nephew with

3040
01:39:22,719 --> 01:39:27,198
epilepsy down the street right they

3041
01:39:25,439 --> 01:39:29,039
would have personal relationships with

3042
01:39:27,198 --> 01:39:31,678
like these kids that couldn't get access

3043
01:39:29,039 --> 01:39:33,920
to cannabis and they would come in

3044
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:35,840
and because of gw pharmaceuticals that

3045
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:37,520
was doing the work with cannabis they

3046
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:39,039
were allowed they were able to get

3047
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:41,920
access to the medicine they needed to

3048
01:39:39,039 --> 01:39:43,920
change their life right so i like big

3049
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:45,199
pharma or not i can't [ __ ] have i

3050
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:47,679
don't have a problem with that like if

3051
01:39:45,198 --> 01:39:50,559
you're helping people

3052
01:39:47,679 --> 01:39:52,399
in like a context again they're

3053
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:54,480
operating in the context of prohibition

3054
01:39:52,399 --> 01:39:55,920
where like these medicines can't get to

3055
01:39:54,479 --> 01:39:56,959
the people i made a post today about

3056
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:58,560
marinol

3057
01:39:56,960 --> 01:40:00,719
right somebody's chirping me about

3058
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:03,440
marital like oh no it's made by in a

3059
01:40:00,719 --> 01:40:05,840
laboratory dude a molecule as a molecule

3060
01:40:03,439 --> 01:40:08,079
is a molecule like if you're [ __ ]

3061
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:10,079
starving for water you don't care

3062
01:40:08,079 --> 01:40:13,118
whether that water was made

3063
01:40:10,079 --> 01:40:14,158
from like burning fossil fuels or mixing

3064
01:40:13,118 --> 01:40:16,719
hydrogen

3065
01:40:14,158 --> 01:40:19,519
and oxygen in a laboratory or purifying

3066
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:21,439
it out of [ __ ] [ __ ] sewer water like

3067
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:24,480
once it comes out at the end and it's

3068
01:40:21,439 --> 01:40:26,399
pure [ __ ] water it's water

3069
01:40:24,479 --> 01:40:28,158
right so it's the same with thc and it's

3070
01:40:26,399 --> 01:40:30,158
the same with cbd

3071
01:40:28,158 --> 01:40:31,679
right like yeah if those medicines can

3072
01:40:30,158 --> 01:40:32,879
go to someone that can benefit from

3073
01:40:31,679 --> 01:40:34,639
those medicines that they couldn't

3074
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:36,319
access otherwise

3075
01:40:34,639 --> 01:40:37,039
why the hell do you have a problem with

3076
01:40:36,319 --> 01:40:39,279
it

3077
01:40:37,039 --> 01:40:40,960
right like yeah i don't get it

3078
01:40:39,279 --> 01:40:42,238
right and i know that it comes because

3079
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:43,760
they're not in a place where it's like

3080
01:40:42,238 --> 01:40:46,718
you feel like oh the government's not

3116
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:52,400
yeah right

3117
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:56,639
i like seeing the passionate side yeah

3118
01:41:54,319 --> 01:41:58,079
like i mean i get offended by it right

3119
01:41:56,639 --> 01:41:59,039
because it's like oh yeah of course you

3120
01:41:58,079 --> 01:42:00,639
have people that don't know what the

3121
01:41:59,039 --> 01:42:02,880
hell they're talking about

3122
01:42:00,639 --> 01:42:05,920
and it's like they're spouting that off

3123
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:07,520
as if their ignorant perspective

3124
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:10,639
is like

3125
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:12,000
like one valuable but like too supremely

3126
01:42:10,639 --> 01:42:14,000
valuable like they think that they're

3127
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:16,079
right it's like dude yeah go look up the

3128
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:18,079
dunning-kruger effect okay

3129
01:42:16,079 --> 01:42:19,519
yeah yeah you know a little bit you know

3130
01:42:18,079 --> 01:42:22,238
a little bit and think that you know

3131
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:24,320
everything right try learning a lot and

3132
01:42:22,238 --> 01:42:25,839
then things like you know you know

3133
01:42:24,319 --> 01:42:27,519
anyway whatever there's too much of that

3134
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:29,520
in the cannabis industry and you know

3135
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:31,280
i'm i'm all up for raising everybody up

3136
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:32,719
i would love to

3137
01:42:31,279 --> 01:42:34,238
and that's why we do these things we

3138
01:42:32,719 --> 01:42:36,560
share perspective we teach people

3139
01:42:34,238 --> 01:42:38,319
because we want you all to be better so

3140
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:40,560
that you all can go and raise the

3141
01:42:38,319 --> 01:42:42,719
[ __ ] game and when we all raise the

3142
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:44,560
game the cannabis is better the products

3143
01:42:42,719 --> 01:42:46,000
are better the products are safer and

3144
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:47,760
we're all dabbing out on the dankest

3145
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:49,279
[ __ ] [ __ ] right like that's what

3146
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:52,480
exactly

3147
01:42:49,279 --> 01:42:55,439
that's why i i i find it a

3148
01:42:52,479 --> 01:42:56,399
an honor when anybody anybody uses my

3149
01:42:55,439 --> 01:42:58,079
stuff

3150
01:42:56,399 --> 01:42:59,359
because it means that it was good enough

3151
01:42:58,079 --> 01:43:01,359
in their eyes

3152
01:42:59,359 --> 01:43:02,799
to take forward and make better and and

3153
01:43:01,359 --> 01:43:04,399
the resulting factor that is if they

3154
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:05,760
make something better than i made i

3155
01:43:04,399 --> 01:43:07,519
don't let that intimidate me i want to

3156
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:09,440
go work with that like that's what and

3157
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:11,280
that's exciting they truly are making it

3158
01:43:09,439 --> 01:43:12,719
better but the thing i don't like is

3159
01:43:11,279 --> 01:43:13,920
when people like they actually hack

3160
01:43:12,719 --> 01:43:15,520
apart your work and then they tell

3161
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:18,239
everybody it's better it's like and then

3162
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:20,239
they sell it as whatever your strain is

3163
01:43:18,238 --> 01:43:22,559
and then that's that i did today contact

3164
01:43:20,238 --> 01:43:24,238
and he's like hey man i want like uh i'm

3165
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:25,520
interested in this kind of high and i'm

3166
01:43:24,238 --> 01:43:27,279
looking at your

3167
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:28,880
highland mexican blueberry

3168
01:43:27,279 --> 01:43:30,158
um

3169
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:31,920
and i'm like i want to buy a hundred

3170
01:43:30,158 --> 01:43:33,279
seeds i was like oh you wanna buy a

3171
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:34,560
hundred seeds i'm not excited because

3172
01:43:33,279 --> 01:43:36,319
he's buying a hundred seeds and it's

3173
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:38,400
like yeah because he wants to pop a

3174
01:43:36,319 --> 01:43:40,319
bunch i want him it was like it's like

3175
01:43:38,399 --> 01:43:43,118
dude if you're going to put in 100 grow

3176
01:43:40,319 --> 01:43:45,359
effort or 100 seed effort into

3177
01:43:43,118 --> 01:43:47,359
improving the line let me help you right

3178
01:43:45,359 --> 01:43:48,479
yeah and it's like i would die this line

3179
01:43:47,359 --> 01:43:50,158
and i would you know and i'm going to

3180
01:43:48,479 --> 01:43:51,198
throw in this line extra so that you've

3181
01:43:50,158 --> 01:43:53,198
got it

3182
01:43:51,198 --> 01:43:54,719
so that as you're inbreeding this one

3183
01:43:53,198 --> 01:43:56,238
you should put a little bit of this back

3184
01:43:54,719 --> 01:43:58,319
into it so that you know

3185
01:43:56,238 --> 01:44:00,319
you you don't you don't suffer

3186
01:43:58,319 --> 01:44:01,840
inbreeding depression and they've got

3187
01:44:00,319 --> 01:44:03,599
the same traits and it's got some nice

3188
01:44:01,840 --> 01:44:05,279
flavor stuff so you know in the end

3189
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:07,199
you'll be you'll be able to

3190
01:44:05,279 --> 01:44:09,679
build it better i love that i'm stoked

3191
01:44:07,198 --> 01:44:12,238
on that right yes absolutely buying a

3192
01:44:09,679 --> 01:44:14,960
five-pack and then knocking off open

3193
01:44:12,238 --> 01:44:16,799
pollination of five seeds to me

3194
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:18,239
because it's like you're not

3195
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:20,639
i went to a lot of work to create that

3196
01:44:18,238 --> 01:44:21,839
population

3197
01:44:20,639 --> 01:44:23,199
and now you've essentially put it

3198
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:24,960
through bottleneck and you're selling it

3199
01:44:23,198 --> 01:44:27,759
the same thing that's [ __ ] up right

3200

yeah i totally agree on that can you

3216
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:57,039
tell us a little bit about the highland

3217
01:44:55,359 --> 01:44:58,799
mexican too since we just brought that

3218
01:44:57,039 --> 01:45:00,560
up these were old seeds that came to me

3219
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:03,279
through rabbit legends actually someone

3220
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:05,199
shipped them to him and it was some old

3221
01:45:03,279 --> 01:45:06,639
dude that was like yeah i'm old i've

3222
01:45:05,198 --> 01:45:08,559
been growing for years and years i

3223
01:45:06,639 --> 01:45:10,000
collected these things in the 60s and

3224
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:12,639
70s

3225
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:14,158
and i don't know

3226
01:45:12,639 --> 01:45:15,679
you know i don't know what's going i

3227
01:45:14,158 --> 01:45:16,799
don't i know i don't have the ability to

3228
01:45:15,679 --> 01:45:18,239
do something with them can you please

3229
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:20,400
give them something that did so we got

3230
01:45:18,238 --> 01:45:23,118
some and i grew a whole bunch and found

3231
01:45:20,399 --> 01:45:25,359
a really interesting plan

3232
01:45:23,118 --> 01:45:26,799
yeah and i put i had one i was like i'm

3233
01:45:25,359 --> 01:45:29,118
gonna take this one plant and put it in

3234
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:30,880
the flowering room

3235
01:45:29,118 --> 01:45:33,118
and it was you know it was like a real

3236
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:34,880
equatorial right so yeah you put it in

3237
01:45:33,118 --> 01:45:36,559
it gets to like a foot tall you're like

3238
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:38,400
ooh this thing's gonna really stretch so

3239
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:39,280
you cut it down and make four or four

3240
01:45:38,399 --> 01:45:41,039
shoots

3241
01:45:39,279 --> 01:45:42,800
and yeah this thing dude it was like

3242
01:45:41,039 --> 01:45:44,079
twice as tall and wide as any other

3243
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:46,079
plant in the room and it must have

3244
01:45:44,079 --> 01:45:47,600
produced like i don't know it wasn't

3245
01:45:46,079 --> 01:45:49,439
they were in like the many thousands of

3246
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:51,760
these like it was like you know probably

3247
01:45:49,439 --> 01:45:53,519
i bet

3248
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:56,159
because the whole thing just like the

3249
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:58,880
whole it was these long

3250
01:45:56,158 --> 01:46:00,879
you know the old kind of like long spear

3251
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:02,880
flowers that you'd see in this

3252
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:04,960
not too thick but like really yeah yeah

3253
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:06,719
long running

3254
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:07,840
it was like that just chopped full of

3255
01:46:06,719 --> 01:46:10,800
seeds

3256
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:12,960
and uh it had a nice high effect it was

3257
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:15,119
like we weren't analyzing turps back

3258
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:17,359
then but i in memory i would say that

3259
01:46:15,118 --> 01:46:19,759
it's probably like a lyman interpreter

3260
01:46:17,359 --> 01:46:22,000
lyman pining plant which is oh

3261
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:22,960
interesting it's kind of rare in today's

3262
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,639
world

3263
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:27,359
yeah i think that's what was really

3264
01:46:24,639 --> 01:46:29,440
associated with a lot of the old hazes

3265
01:46:27,359 --> 01:46:31,439
and interesting

3266
01:46:29,439 --> 01:46:33,839
it was just nice but but it was nice

3267
01:46:31,439 --> 01:46:36,158
classic non

3268
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:39,199
like it was not popular but so when i

3269
01:46:36,158 --> 01:46:41,759
released those dj joint projects

3270
01:46:39,198 --> 01:46:43,039
yeah i put some of those out there

3271
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:46,000
and i don't think we sold a pack for

3272
01:46:43,039 --> 01:46:47,198
like 18 months

3273
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,479
because they were like oh you know

3274
01:46:47,198 --> 01:46:50,158
everybody wanted the grapefruit

3275
01:46:48,479 --> 01:46:51,839
blueberry and the mental floss and all

3276
01:46:50,158 --> 01:46:53,118
the products that were like

3277
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:54,880
getting yield

3278
01:46:53,118 --> 01:46:56,639
and then finally somebody decided to

3279
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:58,159
grow a couple of those like in an

3280
01:46:56,639 --> 01:46:59,600
equatorial climate and ordered some of

3281
01:46:58,158 --> 01:47:01,439
those and grew them

3282
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:03,119
and they were just

3283
01:47:01,439 --> 01:47:06,238
i mean they're

3284
01:47:03,118 --> 01:47:08,559
they have the ugliest phenotype flower

3285
01:47:06,238 --> 01:47:12,238
female oh i'm sure yeah

3286
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:14,080
like long spindly weird like

3287
01:47:12,238 --> 01:47:15,919
you know like buds that have like they

3288
01:47:14,079 --> 01:47:17,359
look like they've got like five or six

3289
01:47:15,920 --> 01:47:18,960
fox tails coming out of them just two

3290
01:47:17,359 --> 01:47:20,079
calories

3291
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:21,760
right and they'd look it would look like

3292
01:47:20,079 --> 01:47:23,198
a finger it wouldn't look like a hand

3293
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:24,480
with a bunch of things i remember seeing

3294
01:47:23,198 --> 01:47:26,559
him yeah

3295
01:47:24,479 --> 01:47:28,238
yeah and you could take them like just

3296
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:30,560
rip off calyx and essentially fold the

3297
01:47:28,238 --> 01:47:32,399
paper around it right

3298
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:33,600
right but there it was a great nice

3299
01:47:32,399 --> 01:47:35,920
effect

3300
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:38,320
um in doing those crosses and actually

3301
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:39,760
growing dj stuff i

3302
01:47:38,319 --> 01:47:41,759
i don't i'm not

3303
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:44,159
i don't have proof that this is the way

3304
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:45,119
it is but it's definitely my very strong

3305
01:47:44,158 --> 01:47:48,839
feeling

3306
01:47:45,118 --> 01:47:52,158
is that all those introspective and

3307
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:54,000
like i don't say uh but like

3308
01:47:52,158 --> 01:47:56,319
cerebral kind of highs that you get from

3309
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:57,920
thc and this is largely from running all

3310
01:47:56,319 --> 01:47:59,439
dj stuff through that really expensive

3311
01:47:57,920 --> 01:48:01,600
lab that we built

3312
01:47:59,439 --> 01:48:03,439
like in populations most of it's in the

3313
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:05,199
8 to 12 range

3314
01:48:03,439 --> 01:48:06,399
yeah right it's not [ __ ] twenty-five

3315
01:48:05,198 --> 01:48:08,399
percent but

3316
01:48:06,399 --> 01:48:10,000
yeah exactly low canaveral production

3317
01:48:08,399 --> 01:48:12,399
what we would call today low canal life

3318
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:14,319
correction plans yeah but

3319
01:48:12,399 --> 01:48:15,599
when you whack up thirty percent to like

3320
01:48:14,319 --> 01:48:17,679
twenty eight twenty five twenty eight

3321
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:19,760
thirty percent thc

3322
01:48:17,679 --> 01:48:22,719
you start to really get that stoned kind

3323
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:24,320
of lethargic kind of dull effect where

3324
01:48:22,719 --> 01:48:27,039
it's like

3325
01:48:24,319 --> 01:48:28,399
all the sheen has been taken off of like

3326
01:48:27,039 --> 01:48:29,920
a high and you just kind of feel it in

3327
01:48:28,399 --> 01:48:32,079
your head and you're just

3328
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:33,600
like kind of whacked and stoned that's

3329
01:48:32,079 --> 01:48:35,359
the phc

3330
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:37,119
right if you take a marinol pill you

3331
01:48:35,359 --> 01:48:38,559
actually feel the same way

3332
01:48:37,118 --> 01:48:40,238
i bet right it kind of feels like

3333
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:41,840
somebody flooded you in the head with

3334
01:48:40,238 --> 01:48:43,359
something you know

3335
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:44,239
like wacky yeah

3336
01:48:43,359 --> 01:48:46,399
um

3337
01:48:44,238 --> 01:48:48,079
and you don't get that from

3338
01:48:46,399 --> 01:48:50,158
those 12 percenters or those 10

3339
01:48:48,079 --> 01:48:52,399
percenters now you kind of get a nice

3340
01:48:50,158 --> 01:48:54,479
cloudy buzz but it's like it's enough

3341
01:48:52,399 --> 01:48:56,879
that you're affected but you're just

3342
01:48:54,479 --> 01:49:00,000
kind of in a different head space

3343
01:48:56,880 --> 01:49:01,760
and yeah i i the clear-headed well and

3344
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:04,479
for you know like the folks in rob's

3345
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:06,560
generation dave's generation

3346
01:49:04,479 --> 01:49:08,079
that's i'm not saying rob and dave in

3347
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:10,239
particular but like

3348
01:49:08,079 --> 01:49:11,760
people of that age that's what cannabis

3349
01:49:10,238 --> 01:49:14,399
was when they were growing up and what

3350
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:16,000
they had access to right that was like

3351
01:49:14,399 --> 01:49:18,559
he didn't come across like a cookies

3352
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:19,840
back in the 70s it didn't exist no no of

3353
01:49:18,560 --> 01:49:21,119
course now

3354
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:22,560
so

3355
01:49:21,118 --> 01:49:25,198
um

3356
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:26,800
you'd be but you'd be buzzed right but

3357
01:49:25,198 --> 01:49:28,479
it's a different headspace and so that

3358
01:49:26,800 --> 01:49:30,800
whole generate not that whole generation

3359
01:49:28,479 --> 01:49:33,198
but the majority of that generation fell

3360
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:34,159
in love with that experience and then

3361
01:49:33,198 --> 01:49:36,479
sure

3362
01:49:34,158 --> 01:49:37,839
indica and 20 plus percent cannabis came

3363
01:49:36,479 --> 01:49:39,919
along it was too much for them because

3364
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:41,039
it didn't do that same thing that they

3365
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:42,960
wanted

3366
01:49:41,039 --> 01:49:44,479
right and i you know when someone was

3367
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:46,560
talking about when the basket's full

3368
01:49:44,479 --> 01:49:48,079
stuff with thca

3369
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:50,639
you're you're kind of right but it's

3370
01:49:48,079 --> 01:49:52,158
like you know dj for example like music

3371
01:49:50,639 --> 01:49:52,960
with lsd

3372
01:49:52,158 --> 01:49:54,319
right

3373
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:56,399
and so

3374
01:49:54,319 --> 01:49:57,599
maybe the basket's not full with

3375
01:49:56,399 --> 01:49:59,359
you don't want to fill the basket with

3376
01:49:57,599 --> 01:50:01,599
thc because when you're putting lsd and

3377
01:49:59,359 --> 01:50:02,960
thc in it together in moderate amounts

3378
01:50:01,599 --> 01:50:05,199
like it's a more pleasant effect at

3379
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:07,279
least for him precisely for him yeah

3380
01:50:05,198 --> 01:50:09,279
this is all about perception so

3381
01:50:07,279 --> 01:50:12,000
um

3382
01:50:09,279 --> 01:50:13,359
it's just you know i it's an interesting

3383
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,560
thing because essentially what's

3384
01:50:13,359 --> 01:50:17,598
happened now

3385
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:20,239
is that like market with a 10 or a 12

3386
01:50:17,599 --> 01:50:22,560
flower good [ __ ] luck

3387
01:50:20,238 --> 01:50:24,000
the market consumers retailers

3388
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:26,480
distributors are all going to laugh at

3389
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:28,319
you yeah totally arguably there's a

3390
01:50:26,479 --> 01:50:29,759
whole class of people out there

3391
01:50:28,319 --> 01:50:31,840
that would like that

3392
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:33,039
oh for sure right for sure it's kind of

3393
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:34,239
like saying hey we're going to have

3394
01:50:33,039 --> 01:50:35,679
liquor stores we're only going to sell

3395
01:50:34,238 --> 01:50:37,519
things that are like 25 and above

3396
01:50:35,679 --> 01:50:38,719
percent alcohol it gets rid of all beer

3397
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:39,679
all wine

3398
01:50:38,719 --> 01:50:41,439
all

3399
01:50:39,679 --> 01:50:43,199
you know like coolers and all that kind

3400
01:50:41,439 --> 01:50:45,359
of stuff that's a huge amount of like

3401
01:50:43,198 --> 01:50:46,719
alcohol consumers or the people that

3402
01:50:45,359 --> 01:50:47,839
like those products that might they

3403
01:50:46,719 --> 01:50:49,520
don't want to sit down with a bottle of

3404
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:51,440
whiskey and like these shots or chugs or

3405
01:50:49,520 --> 01:50:54,000
gas exactly right

3406
01:50:51,439 --> 01:50:55,198
so in a way

3407
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:57,279
we're doing the market in the service

3408
01:50:55,198 --> 01:50:59,678
and we're doing consumers uh the service

3409
01:50:57,279 --> 01:51:00,479
what's up vessel

3410
01:50:59,679 --> 01:51:02,880
um

3411
01:51:00,479 --> 01:51:05,839
yeah so i don't know like i don't

3412
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:08,480
you know 20 people like up to 10 12 bud

3413
01:51:05,840 --> 01:51:10,719
this guy likes 12 budwood [ __ ] you know

3414
01:51:08,479 --> 01:51:12,638
yeah hey man like

3415
01:51:10,719 --> 01:51:14,480
not everybody's like you like some

3416
01:51:12,639 --> 01:51:16,880
people want to drink light beer

3417
01:51:14,479 --> 01:51:18,319
right yeah i don't like getting baked

3418
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:20,719
stoned at all

3419
01:51:18,319 --> 01:51:22,319
i just don't i like to be able to if i

3420
01:51:20,719 --> 01:51:24,158
have to react to something i want to be

3421
01:51:22,319 --> 01:51:26,399
able to react as fast as possible you

3422
01:51:24,158 --> 01:51:27,759
know what i mean at any point

3423
01:51:26,399 --> 01:51:28,960
yeah

3424
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:30,400
yeah well people are saying it's like

3425
01:51:28,960 --> 01:51:32,158
you know not every not everybody wants

3426
01:51:30,399 --> 01:51:35,118
that some people don't want older weed

3427
01:51:32,158 --> 01:51:37,439
older people usually and it's true

3428
01:51:35,118 --> 01:51:38,960
but maybe like you know we could teach

3429
01:51:37,439 --> 01:51:41,919
people how to use cannabis in a way that

3430
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:45,520
some people might not want

3431
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:48,079
uh like even if you're a teenager right

3432
01:51:45,520 --> 01:51:49,679
and dude i've seen it with friends like

3433
01:51:48,079 --> 01:51:50,960
i've seen them friends that like they

3434
01:51:49,679 --> 01:51:52,158
start smoking a little weed and then

3435
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:54,239
they're like yeah it's fun and then they

3436
01:51:52,158 --> 01:51:56,000
get into it and they start smoking more

3437
01:51:54,238 --> 01:51:56,799
and they're [ __ ] way too bad right

3438
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,880
and it

3439
01:51:56,800 --> 01:52:00,639
doesn't it like it impacts their life in

3440
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:03,440
a negative way

3441
01:52:00,639 --> 01:52:05,118
yeah right so and so i want more people

3442
01:52:03,439 --> 01:52:06,638
using cannabis

3443
01:52:05,118 --> 01:52:09,198
if they got to smoke something that's

3444
01:52:06,639 --> 01:52:10,719
like you know half cbd and half thc or

3445
01:52:09,198 --> 01:52:12,559
even just mostly cbd with a little bit

3446
01:52:10,719 --> 01:52:13,599
of thc in it like you know five percent

3447
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:15,440
tfc

3448
01:52:13,599 --> 01:52:17,119
i don't care like i think that we should

3449
01:52:15,439 --> 01:52:19,359
make cannabis for all people

3450
01:52:17,118 --> 01:52:21,759
um i do too market when we've got the

3451
01:52:19,359 --> 01:52:24,238
market that is this way it just it's not

3452
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:26,000
a good thing for the for it's not a good

3453
01:52:24,238 --> 01:52:28,238
thing for consumers

3454
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:30,399
you know there there are

3455
01:52:28,238 --> 01:52:32,319
scientific studies that show like mass

3456
01:52:30,399 --> 01:52:33,920
consumption of thc for at least some

3457
01:52:32,319 --> 01:52:35,599
people is not a good thing

3458
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:36,880
yeah and so what do we say oh sorry you

3459
01:52:35,599 --> 01:52:38,159
guys you don't get to just you just

3460
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:39,520
you're not allowed to benefit from this

3461
01:52:38,158 --> 01:52:40,960
plan

3462
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:42,480
yeah it doesn't make sense

3463
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:44,079
right it's like well hey how about i can

3464
01:52:42,479 --> 01:52:44,959
make you something that does benefit

3465
01:52:44,079 --> 01:52:46,479
like

3466
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:48,800
that variety that i developed out of

3467
01:52:46,479 --> 01:52:50,158
napro for the with the beta carotene and

3468
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:52,400
the cbdv

3469
01:52:50,158 --> 01:52:55,519
right it was like i was like

3470
01:52:52,399 --> 01:52:58,559
that plant had no recreational potential

3471
01:52:55,520 --> 01:53:00,480
at all like it was not fun for anybody

3472
01:52:58,560 --> 01:53:03,280
right but it was going to make a

3473
01:53:00,479 --> 01:53:04,079
difference in some three-year-old's life

3474
01:53:03,279 --> 01:53:05,679
right

3475
01:53:04,079 --> 01:53:07,039
and his mom isn't going to be able to

3476
01:53:05,679 --> 01:53:09,520
like give him a [ __ ] and he's not going

3477
01:53:07,039 --> 01:53:11,519
to have like 10 seizures a day that felt

3478
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:13,599
really [ __ ] good dude right being

3479
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:15,679
able to make that plant it felt really

3480
01:53:13,599 --> 01:53:17,679
really really good like i can't tell you

3481
01:53:15,679 --> 01:53:20,000
the way i can imagine i was more proud

3482
01:53:17,679 --> 01:53:22,560
of that plant in a way

3483
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:24,639
than any high thc plant that i've ever

3484
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:26,800
made that like has like a thousand more

3485
01:53:24,639 --> 01:53:28,639
people using it or yeah like 10 000

3486
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:29,679
people smoking it right

3487
01:53:28,639 --> 01:53:31,679
um

3488
01:53:29,679 --> 01:53:33,760
so yeah i'm all about making all types

3489
01:53:31,679 --> 01:53:35,599
of candidates for all types of people

3490
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:37,360
and uh just because it's the one that

3491
01:53:35,599 --> 01:53:38,800
like the majority people doesn't like

3492
01:53:37,359 --> 01:53:40,719
that doesn't mean that it's not an

3493
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:42,239
amazing thing right

3494
01:53:40,719 --> 01:53:44,719
so yeah we gotta we gotta make those

3495

plans right which is yeah that's what

3496

01:54:38,158 --> 01:54:41,118
even with all the stuff around i was

3526
01:54:39,359 --> 01:54:42,158
popular in the market but i mean i grew

3527
01:54:41,118 --> 01:54:43,920
some of that [ __ ] out recently it's

3528
01:54:42,158 --> 01:54:44,960
every bit as good as a lot of the other

3529
01:54:43,920 --> 01:54:46,560
stuff

3530
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:47,359
i could give a [ __ ] about the market i

3531
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:49,039
mean

3532
01:54:47,359 --> 01:54:50,960
especially right now i mean the the seed

3533
01:54:49,039 --> 01:54:52,960
markets crashed uh cannabis markets

3534
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:54,239
crashed like right now the people that

3535
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:55,279
are gonna stick through it are the

3536
01:54:54,238 --> 01:54:56,238
people that were always gonna stick

3537
01:54:55,279 --> 01:54:58,319
through it whether they were making

3538
01:54:56,238 --> 01:54:59,839
money or not so

3539
01:54:58,319 --> 01:55:01,920
i'm looking forward to that at least

3540
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:02,880
shaking out some of the [ __ ] [ __ ]

3541
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:04,239
and that's about all the good that's

3542
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:06,000
gonna come from it but well i gotta

3543
01:55:04,238 --> 01:55:08,000
leave something that dave said you know

3544
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:10,319
dave watson sam says it's like we all

3545
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:11,279
stand on the shoulders of giants

3546
01:55:10,319 --> 01:55:13,279
right

3547
01:55:11,279 --> 01:55:14,800
um all of us everybody that works with

3548
01:55:13,279 --> 01:55:16,639
cannabis we all got those seeds from

3549
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:20,079
somewhere except for greatest food he

3550
01:55:16,639 --> 01:55:22,079
invited so that's the difference

3551
01:55:20,079 --> 01:55:24,880
yeah we got to respect the people that

3552
01:55:22,079 --> 01:55:26,800
we got things from and you know

3553
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:28,639
all of all of us in our germ pleasant

3554
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:30,480
that we have in our hands

3555
01:55:28,639 --> 01:55:32,800
it all comes from somewhere

3556
01:55:30,479 --> 01:55:34,158
right and sure maybe maybe we refined it

3557
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:35,920
a little bit maybe we found some better

3558
01:55:34,158 --> 01:55:36,799
plants and we propagated and changed

3559
01:55:35,920 --> 01:55:38,399
around

3560
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:40,320
but all of us are

3561
01:55:38,399 --> 01:55:41,198
beholden to the people that came before

3562
01:55:40,319 --> 01:55:43,920
us

3563
01:55:41,198 --> 01:55:45,759
