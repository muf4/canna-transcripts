of that permanent marker right now uh

00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:35,639
you know a lot of people really like it

39
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:37,359
it's a more modern uh you know genetic

40
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,118
um from what I understand on the

41
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:43,478
internet and talking with farmer Dan

42
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:47,359
before the show it's some kind of uh you

43
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:51,078
know Sher jealousy or biscotti jealousy

44
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:53,319
sure B of some kind whatever I didn't

45
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:55,239
really get a lot of buscatti from this

46
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:57,239
either does Dan from the stuff that he's

47
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:59,078
experienced farmer Dan's growing out a

48
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:00,959
few crosses he's got some experience

49
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:02,559
with thee got some experience with the

50
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,078
Skittles he's got some experience with

51
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,879
the permanent markers a little bit so I

52
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:09,079
asked him about it and stuff and he

53
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:11,400
really likes it but that's a homegrown

54
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,280
version of it you know currently today

55
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,280
I'm going to be smoking a w version of

56
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,800
it I picked up a little a like a little

57
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,759
weirdo it's the SE junky one he's saying

58
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,680
SE junkie what the heck Chuck who are

59
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:24,560
you why you what do you I don't [ __ ]

60
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,040
with them really but like at the end of

61
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,920
the day you guys in the last video with

62
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:31,479
the blue Zushi you were like that ain't

63
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:33,238
even really blue so you know I don't

64
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:34,759
know I don't know about modern genetics

65
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:37,400
and I'm going to get stuff wrong I don't

66
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:39,479
grow this stuff so at the end of the day

67
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,319
that's yall want to do a little review

68
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:42,919
you say you like permanent markers so

69
00:02:41,318 --> 00:02:46,158
this is the closest thing I could really

70
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:47,799
find so if I get it wrong or if this

71
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:49,679
really ain't the right permanent markers

72
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,439
or whatever that may be be the case I'm

73

to go leave and start their own [ __ ]

92
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,120
which is cool people you grown men and

93
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:34,598

97
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,200
to be stronger we're going to work

98
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:42,959
together there's too much uh bickering

99
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,119
and drama in the community let's bring

100
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,239
it together with Chuck dog you know if

101
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:52,640
if if somebody else ain't going to do it

102
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:54,480
I'm going to do it you know but anyways

103
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:56,438
got that little eight of the permanent

104
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,639
markers been smoking on it for a day or

105
00:03:56,438 --> 00:04:00,438
two I'll be honest I wish I could show

106
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:03,399
you buds but

107
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:05,598
you know oh YouTube don't like us very

108
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,158
much so I talked with Dan like I said a

109
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:08,759
little bit we've been hashing it out and

110
00:04:07,158 --> 00:04:11,039
I'm pretty sure this is permanent marker

111
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:13,798
when I pull it out I smell it I get that

112
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:15,400
permanent marker uh of Vibes you know

113
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:16,798
that's what we're talking about today we

114
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,040
were talking about some permanent Mark

115
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,638
so you know I wouldn't say it's as

116
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,639
powerful as this right here obviously

117
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:27,439
but you know we we're we we like to

118
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,720
consider ourselves uh you know glorified

119
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:31,160
scent experts around here so we got the

120
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,800
per the marker for reference I can't

121
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,919
even get this bag open I didn't eat my

122
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,400
waties I should put my purse down I know

123
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:42,478
I know but I got it open but I mean

124
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:44,038
guys it smells like Sher to me I mean

125
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,359
howse you really say

126
00:04:44,038 --> 00:04:49,038
it I was thinking about this for three

127
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:52,600
days how you know what to tell y'all

128
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:54,560
about it I mean does it smoke good is it

129
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,000
great does it smell great I mean it

130
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,319
smells like sherb I mean sherb to me can

131
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,720
kind of smell anywhere from like kind of

132
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:05,639
pix candy flavors

133
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:08,000
to uh that kind of almost I wouldn't say

134
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:11,240
Citrus it ain't full on like that but

135
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,759
it's kind of got that like uh yeah that

136
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,400
kind of tropical citrusy sherb smell

137
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,199
that that's pretty common I feel like

138
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:19,599
that in most of them and and it's really

139
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:22,600
in tune with a lot of stuff that's

140
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,919
already on the market modern Market or

141
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,479
in in in the wreck uh the wreck weed

142
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:29,959
stores or whatever basically at least

143
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:31,758
here in Michigan it's a there's a lot of

144
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:33,279
stuff out there so it's like I don't

145
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,840
really understand the hype about it I

146
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:37,959
get the imagery and the idea and the you

147
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:39,318
know it's kind of cool for about 5

148
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:41,359
Seconds that your weed smells a little

149
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:43,680
bit like a permanent marker but it's

150
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,280
really not for me uh and I'm not dunking

151
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,038
on it cuz you know at the end of the day

152
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:49,038
this ain't a homegrown this ain't this

153
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:51,680
could very well not be the cut this

154
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:54,240
could very well be uh something else who

155
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,478
knows who really who really knows am I

156
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,600
getting biscotti from it I like biscotti

157
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:00,199
kind of it's all right for more of a

158
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,199
modern strain I really

159
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:04,600
really kind of like it uh but I don't

160
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:06,919
really get that from this and and that's

161
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,240
that's that's kind of disappointing but

162
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:12,279
the sherb side of it it's sure uh you

163

comment section below what what is Chuck

204
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:37,800
do dog got to do to get some good

205
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:39,400
permanent marker cuz I'll be honest this

206
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,759
ain't really it for me I'll give this a

207
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:44,279
four out of 10 the overall smoke isn't

208
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,639
really bad it's pretty smooth and stuff

209
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:48,959
but it I guess the hype behind it is

210
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,840
just more of for me is more of a

211
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:52,918
disappointment uh because you know I've

212
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:54,719
tried other other plants that are

213
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:56,918
similar to that that I've been homegrown

214
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,479
and I've grown myself shout out local

215
00:07:56,918 --> 00:08:03,399
you're uh sure best one uh cross I think

216
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:06,158
it was to the P90 or the sweet PE I mean

217
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:08,279
dude anything with p91 in it kicks up

218
00:08:06,158 --> 00:08:10,800
that freaking potency that flavor I

219
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:13,918
really lik it I like I really enjoyed

220
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,840
growing you know that cuz you could find

221
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:18,359
that Sher sherb kind of vibe in it or

222
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:19,959
whatever you're looking for and but

223
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,319

224
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:23,478

269
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,360
time but you know I'm going to roll me

270
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:15,399
up something a little bit different

271
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:18,120
while we while we do this transition cuz

272
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:22,639
I just you

273
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:24,679
know I don't really find the eights when

274
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:27,600
you're buying an eight a m hour bag I

275
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:30,599
don't really find much difference in

276
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,120
bulk uh weed buying bulk from like a

277
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,920
deli style or buy whatever a prepackaged

278
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,799
bulk deal at a cheaper rate I don't find

279
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:41,159
much difference in potency or overall

280
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:43,120
quality Mo for most of the time when it

281
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:45,078
comes to a lot of this [ __ ] so save

282
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,560
yourself a few bucks I think that eth

283
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:50,599
was like 20 bucks or 25 bucks with tax

284
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:52,638
save yourself some money and they got

285
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,079
freaking half ounces in there for like

286
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:56,320
40 bucks they're better weed than that

287
00:10:55,078 --> 00:10:58,958
you're getting a half ounce you're

288
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,600
saving yourself money and you know

289
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,799

457
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,679
about some silica today it's not

458
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:48,919
something I have historically used or

459
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:51,120
ever have a lot of experience with in my

460
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:55,120
garden a lot of times I'm just relying

461
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:58,079
on what I got going in in my my my soil

462
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:59,639
mix and the and just basically can of a

463
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:02,960
and b and a few few other little

464
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:05,080
products from my my micronutrients and

465
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,600
stuff like that but somebody left a

466
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:11,199
comment on my last video talking about

467
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:13,759
silica and you know just asking do I use

468
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,120
it and and I had to say no I I actually

469
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:18,558
don't I do know somewhat a little bit

470
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:21,678
about it that people have had mixed

471
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:23,240
results with it some people use it some

472
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,720
people don't is it

473
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,359
necessary I would say probably not

474
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,759
obviously because I've been growing

475
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:32,439
without it just fine does it help your

476
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:35,519
garden I think if you got your p's and

477
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:38,679
your Q's on point if you're using the

478
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:40,240
right uh if you you know if your garden

479
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:42,720
is where it needs to be and everything

480
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,000
is properly balanced just like bidder

481
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,319
was telling me you know I I actually

482
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,960
went ahead and picked up some power SI

483
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:52,480
and started implementing into my garden

484
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,840
and and I and maybe I'm losing my mind

485
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:59,279
but within 6 to8 hours I swear every

486
00:18:54,839 --> 00:19:02,839
plant in my grow veg in my veg my

487
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:04,279
veg tent all had more rigidity to them I

488
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:06,319
don't know if I'm losing I know you're

489
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:09,079
saying there's no way that that was

490
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:11,558
those you know uh the little Cil plant

491
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:14,000
bodies were deposited into the Cil walls

492
00:19:11,558 --> 00:19:16,720
or whatever that fast Chuck you don't

493
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,519
know you're losing it bro well I asked

494
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,759
bitter and he said it is possible if you

495
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:23,519
got it dialed in right you could see

496
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:25,158
results that quick but that being said

497
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:27,679
there's a couple different forms of

498
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:30,240
silica you know let's let's maybe dive

499
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:34,200
into that a little bit because there are

500
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:36,279
some more you know plant uh you know

501
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,960
plant ready more available to the plant

502
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:41,359
I guess I said say my bad I can't talk I

503
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,480
took some edibles a little bit ago my

504
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:45,959
old lady and I we made some little you

505
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:48,720
know little coconut oils little coconut

506
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:51,360
butter and uh I put some in my coffee I

507
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,640
got to say and uh I'm a little bit it's

508
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:56,038
it's starting to kick in I'm a little

509
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,320
lit right now but that being said I want

510
00:19:56,038 --> 00:20:00,519
to jump into the the different forms of

511
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:02,399
it I'm kind of talk about it and if I

512
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:05,440
get something wrong as usual let me know

513
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:08,159
down in the chat I'm not an expert so

514
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,600
please don't take my advice uh look to

515
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,159
some of the people that know more than

516
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:14,158
me I'm learning along with y'all so this

517
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,520
is this has been great so please leave

518
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,200
stuff in the comments if you got

519
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:18,879
something you want me to check out you

520
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,000
got something you want me to look into

521
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,280
or maybe something you think I might

522
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,599
need to implement in my garden I mean

523
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:25,639
you know I'm not going to do every

524
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:27,439
little thing but I'll pick and choose

525
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,320
what I think I you know that's cool or

526
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,519
maybe a good idea and do some research

527
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:34,119
just like we did with the Sila so I got

528
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:35,480
to talking the bidder I got to talking

529
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:36,879
some of the other guys some people were

530
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:38,360
saying they didn't see a difference I

531
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,400
saw the difference that's all I could

532
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:42,359
say I feel like I see a difference now

533
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,640
it's been almost what two weeks a week

534
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:46,839
and a half two weeks I feel like I'm um

535
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:50,159
I'm seeing a difference so that being

536
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:52,639
said I wanted to jump into uh you know a

537
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,720
couple the the different forms of it

538
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,400
real quick I took some notes here for

539
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,798
you guys cuz I'm a big dummy you know

540
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,798
I'm I'm not that good with with

541
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:02,319
remembering stuff I'm not that good at

542
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:04,759
communicating to be honest with you I

543
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:06,759
can't talk I'm from the south I got a

544
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:11,079
overbite like I said got kicked by a

545
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:13,200
zebra in in my jaw but we're going to go

546
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:15,399
through it so the first form of it which

547
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,640
is the more common form of about that a

548
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:20,720
lot of us use or see or or maybe when

549
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:22,559
you're first learning about silica uh

550
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,038
you you might think you when you get to

551
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:25,480
looking at the prices let's just say

552
00:21:24,038 --> 00:21:28,640
that you might say well that one's for

553
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:31,200
me Chuck the potassium uh silic

554
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,559
silicates for me bro that is you know

555
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,240
$30 $40 a little bottle a little gallon

556
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:39,440
bottle bro that's one and done that's

557
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,759
easy Chuck well there's different forms

558
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,480
of it and like I said we're going to go

559
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:46,960
through it that's not going to be your

560
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:49,200
best form of it but it can any any form

561
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,000
of it is going to help I do think and to

562
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,600
a certain degree that's that's me saying

563
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,079
from my own experience so I don't know

564
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:56,359
some people you know if you're running

565
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:57,960
in it depends on what you're running in

566
00:21:56,359 --> 00:22:00,158
if you're organic guy if you're running

567
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,600
in a different setup you might not see

568
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:05,278
the results you might have it uh some

569
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:07,319
form of silica in some other product you

570
00:22:05,278 --> 00:22:09,240
use so you might not need this product

571
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:10,519
and and most people probably aren't

572
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,798
going to use it and we're going to talk

573
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:14,558
about the benefits of it as after we get

574
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:16,240
done talking about the different forms

575
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:17,359
of it I'm a country guy takes me a

576
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,599
second to get through stuff I'll give

577
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:24,439
you a long long drawn out uh explanation

578
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:27,918
so potassium silicate and what is it

579
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:30,960
it's a water soluble salt form of silica

580
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:34,720
wiely used used in Hydroponic and soil

581
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:38,319
systems it raises pH due to its alkaline

582
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:41,120
nature and must be added uh separately

583
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:44,240
from other nutrients to avoid

584
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:46,959
precipitation so basically what that

585
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:49,480
means is you want to add this first all

586
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,480
you got to do when you're mixing up your

587
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:54,278
nutrients is put your silica product in

588
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,480
first cuz it's going to make your pH

589
00:22:54,278 --> 00:22:58,200
Spike then you're going to add your base

590
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,919
nutrients then you're going to add your

591
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:03,679
C mag and then anything else after that

592
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:05,880
it's pretty easy peasy simple you don't

593
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,759
have to think much about it but you do

594
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,799
got to make sure you get it right and

595
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:11,400
keep it tight you know you need to

596
00:23:09,798 --> 00:23:13,319
really be careful and make sure you're

597
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:17,640
putting your stuff in in the right

598
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:19,678
orders uh but the benefits it strength

599
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:22,880
strengthens your cell balls it improves

600
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:25,120
your stem rigidity and it also helps

601
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,960
protect uh you know from Pest and

602
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:31,158
disease giving a little bit extra re uh

603
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:33,319
resistance you know basically the it's

604
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:35,240
like almost like armoring itself out you

605
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:37,678
know like kind of making it hard like

606
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:42,000
would you want to chew on a a real hard

607
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:43,798
uh silica fi uh material or would you

608
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,599
want to go and get the next soft little

609
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:47,359
thing so the the idea is they just don't

610
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:49,719
want to eat it and and the pest and

611
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:51,439
things will move on with the mold uh you

612
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:53,400
know just I guess a little I think it's

613
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,679
a Stam or stemon or I forget what the

614
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,600
little thing is a little probe that

615
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:58,120
comes down from a mold if you look at

616
00:23:56,599 --> 00:23:59,959
the stuff underneath the microscope it's

617
00:23:58,119 --> 00:24:02,558
kind of cool actually but it basically

618
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:05,440
comes down and sticks that that that uh

619
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:07,798
little it's basically an anchoring it

620
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,480
anchors to the plant and and then that's

621
00:24:07,798 --> 00:24:11,960
when you know how it attaches itself to

622
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:14,240
the plant but I guess the idea is it's

623
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:17,600
just it can't basically attach itself

624
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,720
because it's just so strong [ __ ] strong

625
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:22,959
rough you know after they circumcised

626
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:26,399
type thing the rough skin left over that

627
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,640
kind of rough strong rigid you know uh

628
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:30,599
but

629
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,720
yeah so we're going to jump over into

630
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:36,079
the sodium silicate and basically it's

631
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,519
less common than the pottassium silicate

632
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:43,079
due to sodium's potential for toxicity

633
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:44,918
and high amounts um and then we got what

634
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:46,839
people really should probably be using

635
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:48,799
the most I think is from what I

636
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:52,759
understand from understood from my

637
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:56,158
research uh is uh silicate

638
00:24:52,759 --> 00:25:01,278
acid soic so I can't say that right

639
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:06,720
y'all soic cicc acid I can't say that

640
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:11,359
description the plant available form of

641
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,360
silica absorbed as a

642
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:19,398
mono monoy I can't talk y'all mono cicc

643
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:22,640
acids there we go found in specialized

644
00:25:19,398 --> 00:25:25,439
sub supplements like power SI and

645
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:28,440
extreme silica highly soluble and

646
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:32,759
effective form

647
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:34,600
or H highly soluable and effective folio

648
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:36,519
application and but you can also

649
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:38,839
obviously feed it you know feed it

650
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:41,599
through just like you normally would and

651
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:43,398
uh I guess yeah so we we've been using

652
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:46,918
power SI and it's been great so that's

653
00:25:43,398 --> 00:25:48,558
going to be your your more uh the what

654
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:50,200
you want to use it's also going to be

655
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:51,398
it's going to be your better form of it

656
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,240
but it's also going to be your more

657
00:25:51,398 --> 00:25:55,278
expensive form of it too so don't be

658
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:57,880
surprised when you look at it uh because

659
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:58,880
it is more more concentrated it'll go

660
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,600
further

661
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,399
and it it is a little bit more expensive

662
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:05,759
but I definitely think there that's

663
00:26:02,398 --> 00:26:07,639
going to be your best option and I think

664
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:09,798
Mills make some there's a couple other

665
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,278
brands I'm not real familiar with those

666
00:26:09,798 --> 00:26:14,398
Brands so you do need to do yourself a

667
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:17,240
little bit of research and and deep dive

668
00:26:14,398 --> 00:26:19,759
into that a little bit more I'm I'm just

669
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:22,440
getting Tongue Tied tied all all up

670
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:24,240
today you guys I can't really say it

671
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:29,159
let's see if we could try it one last

672
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:31,720
time sois Sissa I we give up I don't

673
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:34,960
care drop it in the comments let me

674
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:38,240
know then you can ALS also got dious

675
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:40,399
Earth which I don't really I know some

676
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,038
of you organic guys and stuff use that I

677
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:44,038
don't use that uh you know you can use

678
00:26:42,038 --> 00:26:45,798
it for pest control and stuff like that

679
00:26:44,038 --> 00:26:47,759
and I'm assuming it breaks down as well

680
00:26:45,798 --> 00:26:49,720
into the soil a little bit but I I

681
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:52,519
couldn't couldn't imagine it would be

682
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:54,480
super available right away but what the

683
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:57,639
heck do I know I don't really know so

684
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:00,120
maybe look into the doation Earth stuff

685
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,960
um but that being said you know if you

686
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:06,439
want to try implementing it into your

687
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:09,000
garden silica might be for you uh you

688
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:11,519
know it's going to help your plant be

689
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,240
stronger outside especially people like

690
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:15,278
to really use it outside because it's

691
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:19,240
going to make it uh supposedly more

692
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:21,319
drought resistant um stronger uh in the

693
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:25,000
winds uh it can deal with colder

694
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:26,599
temperatures better Pest and molds and

695
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,480
stuff I don't know it just sounds like a

696
00:27:26,599 --> 00:27:31,759
Bene beneficial thing all the way around

697
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,759
for me like I'm up in Michigan I get

698
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:35,879
mold I get a few pests here and there

699
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:38,200
especially Outdoors so like why wouldn't

700
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:40,480
I want to add it it goes a long way

701
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,759
you're not like you're you're mainly

702
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,640
just using it in veg some people use it

703
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:45,960
all the way through but some people

704
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,120
there's people out there that say that

705
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,880
it can make your buds too dense I don't

706
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:51,398
know you know there some people say

707
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,200
that's bull crap and don't have that

708
00:27:51,398 --> 00:27:55,479
problem so you know take it with a grain

709
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,000
of salt try it out see if it works for

710
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,720
you like we were saying there's a

711
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,440
different forms of it

712
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,000
uh you know I can't really say it the

713
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,480
proper way maybe you guys can you know

714
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,440
your most common forms are going to be

715
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,079
your your potassium silicate which is

716
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,120
like you're you're going to know the

717
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:11,678
difference cuz you're going to see a

718
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:15,558
bottle of it it's going to be 2030 $40

719
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:17,919
whereas uh you know the Sol soltic asset

720
00:28:15,558 --> 00:28:20,440
is going to be more ex expensive I'm

721
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:22,320
sure you guys are getting a good good uh

722
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:25,080
show out of me trying to pronounce this

723
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:28,278
stuff

724
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:30,798
monosilicic acid there we go all those

725
00:28:28,278 --> 00:28:34,278
C's too many C's right there two two C's

726
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:36,918
two eyes to many eyes

727
00:28:34,278 --> 00:28:39,319
monosilicic acid there we go don't help

728
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:40,559
with the Edibles of course but we'll

729
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:43,439
make it

730
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:47,119
through that being said I'm having a

731
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:49,240
blast learning about this stuff you know

732
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:50,479
a lot of times I see people talking

733
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,640
about this stuff and it's hard to jump

734
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,360
into a conversation just the way my

735
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,679
brain work I got that ADHD so it's just

736
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:58,479
the way it is it's hard for me to jump

737
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:00,038
in and absorb some of this stuff but but

738
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,319
the show is causing me to have to go

739
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:05,000
down these rabbit holes and and check

740
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:09,839
out you know check out some different

741
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:13,038
stuff um that being said uh that's

742
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:15,959
pretty much it for a silica I mean you

743
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:18,240
want to implement it in your vegetative

744
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:20,720
growth growth more than anything or

745
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,960
outside you want to streng strengthen up

746
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:26,120
your plant you want to get a little bit

747
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,759
more resistance to B molds and and Pest

748
00:29:26,119 --> 00:29:32,038
and things like that drought

749
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:34,640
tolerant uh you know cold to tolerance

750
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:36,440
better I don't know guys if you if you

751
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,159
if you got the money to do it implement

752
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:41,320
it try it out you can make it go a long

753
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,840
way uh you know it is what it is and

754
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:45,240
always make sure you're putting it in

755
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:48,599
first because it meeses what your it

756
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:51,558
messes with your pH okay uh what else we

757
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:54,798
got for you guys today I've done lost my

758
00:29:51,558 --> 00:29:58,798
train thought here going on a deep dive

759
00:29:54,798 --> 00:30:00,398
on the silica see oh another thing I

760
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:03,038
wanted to start doing in these episodes

761
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:04,319
is maybe something else like a segment

762
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:05,599
this I don't really know how I'm going

763
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:07,359
to do it yet but as right now I'm kind

764
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:09,079
of thinking what did I learn this week

765
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:10,519
is what it's going to be called and

766
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:12,960
basically just hanging out with Matt on

767
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:15,038
the show uh learning about breeding

768
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,440
techniques and Seed making techniques

769
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:18,278
whatever you want to call them chucking

770
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,840
I'm a glorified chucker that's what I

771
00:30:18,278 --> 00:30:22,599
call myself and I'm proud of it but I

772
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:26,639
asked him I said Matt I was digging on

773
00:30:22,599 --> 00:30:29,798
the forums I saw bod uh sometimes would

774
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,399
uh you know pollinate his females and

775
00:30:29,798 --> 00:30:33,918
then he throw them back in the veg and

776
00:30:31,398 --> 00:30:35,639
he said yeah you can do that and uh we

777
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,480
talked about that we got in I didn't

778
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,519
know you could do that and and from what

779
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:42,679
he was saying it's some it'll definitely

780
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:44,240
finish up so your seeds will finish up

781
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:46,559
and then the benefits of it is you'll

782
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,679
have a plant that's basically reved so

783
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:50,240
you could take Cuts then or you could

784
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:52,159
reveg the whole plant and throw it back

785
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,919
in the flow Harvest your seeds and throw

786
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,919
that whole thing back into flow I

787
00:30:53,919 --> 00:31:00,840
thought that was really cool uh you know

788
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:06,038
and I and also uh we we were talking

789
00:31:00,839 --> 00:31:09,000
about um where I'm losing oh you can

790
00:31:06,038 --> 00:31:10,960
also uh over pollinate just like you can

791
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,759
underp pollinate when you're making

792
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,960
seeds which I didn't know that I always

793
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:17,240
knew you could under pollinate or or

794
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,038
just you know pollinate too early or

795
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,159
pull your plant your mail or your

796
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:23,558
reversal your reverse plant too soon or

797
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:25,799
however you're doing it or if you're

798
00:31:23,558 --> 00:31:28,480
dusting on there's several ways you can

799
00:31:25,798 --> 00:31:31,240
pollinate plants but he was basically

800
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,919
saying you know if you over pollinate

801
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:35,319
you can really you can get a lot of

802
00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:37,200

00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:55,320
to rocking you lose your string you run

890
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:56,878
out of string another thing if I like to

891
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:59,039
do especially back when I was mowing and

892
00:34:56,878 --> 00:35:01,279
weeding I carry a little piece of the

893
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:03,519
four five foot piece of string and I'd

894
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:08,079
fill me up one of them little bottles

895
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:10,800
with with some uh two cycle uh you know

896
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:12,960
some weed or some some juice fill me up

897
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,280
with some gas and I put that little

898
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,240
bottle in my pocket the other guys they

899
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:20,200
wore fanny packs I ain't wearing no damn

900
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:21,679
fanny pack but I put it in my pocket and

901
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:25,559
I carry a string with me so when you're

902
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:27,358
out 20 20 clicks down a fence weed and

903
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:29,320
you and you run out of string because

904
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:33,239
the jack ass day before didn't fill up

905
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:34,680
your weed eater uh you're good to go so

906
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:36,319
that being said I want to talk about

907
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:39,399
weed eaters again for a

908
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,280
minute a lot of people don't know this

909
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:45,200
but when you're weeding there's a proper

910
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:47,359
way to walk the head on most common weed

911
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:49,759
eaters is going

912
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:53,480
counterclockwise so the way you want to

913
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,680
walk to where you get a smooth cut to

914
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:57,039
where that

915
00:35:54,679 --> 00:35:59,318
head that head is moving along that

916
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:01,838
grass just perfect especially when

917
00:35:59,318 --> 00:36:03,960
you're up against a wall or or rocks or

918
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:05,838
whatever you want to you want to get a

919
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,519
real clean cut so you don't got to sit

920
00:36:05,838 --> 00:36:09,358
there doing all this if you're doing all

921
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:10,639
this especially if it's been cut before

922
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:12,719
if you're doing all this back and forth

923
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:14,639
stuff you're not doing it right you know

924
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:17,959
the mo the right way to weed eat is

925
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:21,000
actually to walk sideways to always walk

926
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:23,079
left or to walk backwards going left if

927
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,599
you're going right say say you're

928
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:26,880
looking at your house or whatever you're

929
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:29,359
about to weed e the way you want to do

930
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,559
it is go left always there's a couple

931
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:34,159
reasons for that that's the way the

932
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:36,078
design the way the head spins if you go

933
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:37,559
right it's going to dig into the ground

934
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,680
it's going to get it's going to do all

935
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:41,199
this it's going to make your chop your

936
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:45,679
cut look real crappy you want it to look

937
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:48,000
like a green glass Lake Grass Lake of

938
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:49,000
water smooth as ice on a calm day you

939
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,039
know what I

940
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,119
mean and if you go right it's going to

941
00:36:52,039 --> 00:36:56,440
screw you up a lot of people see me weed

942
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:59,880
eating and shorts saying [ __ ] like dude

943
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:03,760
how do you stand weed eating in shorts

944
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:05,280
bro like don't that [ __ ] hit your legs

945
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:08,560
I'm going to tell you a secret fam when

946
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:11,160
you walk left all the debris thrown

947
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:12,719
right so if you're walking the right way

948
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:15,920
not only are you not getting [ __ ] on

949
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:18,000
your legs you're also not throwing rocks

950
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,800
into your window if you go if you go

951
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,519
right and you face that weeder forward

952
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,119
and you try to go fast as you can you're

953
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:27,239
going to throw you're going to throw

954
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,000
rocks you not only going to throw on

955
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:30,719
yourself you throw it through a window

956
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,039
I've done it before I've seen it done

957
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:35,358
before you know it's easy to do so

958
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:37,440
always you want to walk left you walk

959
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:39,358
with the sideway stance or backwards

960
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,760
just saying backwards Chuck weeding

961
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:44,358
backwards what kind of weeding is hard

962
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:47,359
enough well it's called stamina Brothers

963
00:37:44,358 --> 00:37:48,598
I hear you guys you know and I see a lot

964
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:51,358
of people in the comment saying well you

965
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:52,880
know my back hurts when I weeded well

966
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:54,480
you don't that's why we talked about

967
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,599
last time you don't have to have a steel

968
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,559
a steel is not going to be the best for

969
00:37:56,599 --> 00:38:01,119
everybody I see little sissies out there

970
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:02,639
with the straps on and the doing all

971
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,119
like or there's different styles of weed

972
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:06,239
eaters but that being said that's why

973
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:08,720
you go with a lighter uh you know like a

974
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:10,039
shawa you go with a lighter one with a

975
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:12,358
uh if you're a shorter guy you can

976
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:14,920
adjust the handles it's got a shorter

977
00:38:12,358 --> 00:38:16,799
Rod uh you know so you can kind of

978
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,800
really you want to tailor your weer to

979
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,599
you you know you're not trying to buy

980
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,440
the best weer on the market because it's

981
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:24,720
got the name Steel on it I'm sorry

982
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:26,039
Steel's a great product but you got to

983
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,799
really think about what you're buying

984
00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:29,358
they're not made for everybody they're

985
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:32,200
heavy they're bigger they're not made

986
00:38:29,358 --> 00:38:33,519
for for shorter people really uh so make

987
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:35,639
sure you're getting a tailored weed

988
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:37,838
eater for yourself so I rock out with

989
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:40,960
shaas I walk rock out with SH I've had

990
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:42,639
hus aaras before I've had echos or

991
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,199
whatever there a couple different other

992
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:45,400
brands but you know they're all about

993
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:47,439
the same if you if you're doing

994
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,240
residential stuff but like I said I like

995
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,760
to go with a lightweight shawa for

996
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:53,078
residential stuff I like to go with a

997
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:54,720
steel for for real heavy stuff some

998
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:56,680
people like to use a disc cutter or

999
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:58,199
Cutters and stuff I like to use them too

1000
00:38:56,679 --> 00:38:59,879
but when you're working with with uh you

1001
00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:01,598
know guys that just get out of jail or

1002
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:04,000
addicts and stuff like that no

1003
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,920
disrespect cuz I got them in my family

1004
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,559

1005
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,559
in [ __ ] up the next day they slice

1006
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:11,239
their legs off they slice my legs off so

1007
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:14,880
you know weed eater is a little bit

1008
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:16,439

think I'm going to take us back to the

1056
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:13,838
cabin once again and this actually

1057
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,599
happened before my time running through

1058
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:17,639
the field throwing all my plants out cuz

1059
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,880

00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:28,039
I'm not really sure

1064
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:30,039
but this one's the same place but this

1065
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:33,880
was probably 6 months to a year before

1066
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:36,759
that time and I have been growing I

1067
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:43,119

1122
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:02,960
so my Garden's in the corner facing the

1123
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:05,358
field out the back door and I have my

1124
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:08,039
little Garden in the corner and I'm

1125
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:11,920
growing how probably had 10 15 plants

1126
00:44:08,039 --> 00:44:11,920
out there and the sun goes

1127
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,760
down and uh we're hanging out

1128
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:20,559

1129
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:24,000
food we're watching some

1130
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:25,559
TV we got dogs so anytime dog barks I

1131
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,440
look out the window see what's going on

1132
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:30,599
not cuz necessary paranoid I just want

1133
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:33,358
to be prepared so I mean you know I'm

1134
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:36,480
not up to no good really so I'm like

1135
00:44:33,358 --> 00:44:36,480
what the hell's going on so I look

1136
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:40,480
outside I don't see nothing in my

1137
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:44,160
driveway so I'm like

1138
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:47,079
cool sometimes C how you know or

1139
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:49,519
whatever so or the Pome gets on a por so

1140
00:44:47,079 --> 00:44:49,519
the dogs

1141
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:55,720
Bart so look at the other window just on

1142
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:58,000
the other side of the room facing my one

1143
00:44:55,719 --> 00:45:00,598
neighbor that I could see

1144
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,400
and they probably got a quarter mile or

1145
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:07,039
a half mile long driveway bro it's

1146
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:09,720
paved and this is just after the dark so

1147
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:13,239
it's you know it's dark out and I see

1148
00:45:09,719 --> 00:45:16,318
four lights four cars and four

1149
00:45:13,239 --> 00:45:19,199
lights rolling up that driveway bro I'm

1150
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:20,719
talking like right on each other's ass

1151
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:22,519
like rolling up there and I'm we've been

1152
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:24,039
living there for a long time so I knew

1153
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:27,039
you know I'd see people come and go and

1154
00:45:24,039 --> 00:45:29,599
it was always just one car my mind being

1155
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:32,800
way it is I said dude that looks like

1156
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:34,760
the police and I taught her and I said I

1157
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,318
said is that and they pull up I could

1158
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,800
see them pull up to the house but the

1159
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:39,880
way they were driving the way they were

1160
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,559
on each other moving like a little Squad

1161
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:43,640
bro there was just the way they were the

1162
00:45:41,559 --> 00:45:46,400
way the lights in Kentucky at the time

1163
00:45:43,639 --> 00:45:47,759
they were using the the Ford Tauruses so

1164
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,280
you I think is what they were the for

1165
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,119
Ford tus so you can tell the way the

1166
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:53,400
light there were certain way the lights

1167
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:54,760
were and on the back uh the way the

1168
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,680
lights were set up you could tell with

1169
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,760
the the rear end lights or whatever tail

1170
00:45:56,679 --> 00:46:00,598
lights

1171
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:03,119
so I'm like that looks like the the the

1172
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:05,359
police and they go up to that

1173
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:07,960
house

1174
00:46:05,358 --> 00:46:10,039
and they got their spotlights on and

1175
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:12,880
they're knocking on the door and my

1176
00:46:10,039 --> 00:46:15,239
neighbor single woman with some kids she

1177
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:18,480
comes out she's talking to them and

1178
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:21,159
[ __ ] and this is probably I don't know 3

1179
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,760
400 yards away I don't know maybe more

1180
00:46:21,159 --> 00:46:24,159
but I you know I could make stuff out

1181
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:26,240
because I got porch lights on and

1182
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:28,279
everything and the cop lights all that

1183
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:29,719
[ __ ] were on

1184
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,839
and they weren't there but like five

1185
00:46:29,719 --> 00:46:34,519
minutes and I was like I was telling her

1186
00:46:31,838 --> 00:46:36,838
I was like what the [ __ ] are they doing

1187
00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:38,559
and uh they're out I can see them

1188
00:46:36,838 --> 00:46:41,119
walking out in the field that they got a

1189
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:42,400
big front yard like a massive one like

1190
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:44,200
probably four or five acres and they're

1191
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:47,440
out there looking around and they're

1192
00:46:44,199 --> 00:46:48,799
making their way towards the the

1193
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,800
neighbor in

1194
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:54,119
between them and and us there's a big

1195
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:56,400
barn and a field there another neighbor

1196
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:59,119
owns but his house isn't located there

1197
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:02,599
and they're their way towards my my

1198
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:04,039
property and I told her I said man like

1199
00:47:02,599 --> 00:47:07,160
they're going to come over here they're

1200
00:47:04,039 --> 00:47:10,079
looking for something you know and uh

1201
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:11,480
she's like no you'd be all right they're

1202
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:14,880
just they' be

1203
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:16,000
fine well I don't know something my gut

1204
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,960
told me

1205
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,519
like dude what the hell you know they're

1206
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:24,280
gonna come up here so I always get

1207
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:26,358
myself in sh situations like that and

1208
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:28,160
just being where I'm from you don't want

1209
00:47:26,358 --> 00:47:29,838
to get caught [ __ ] so it's like I'd

1210
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:33,199
rather sacrifice my

1211
00:47:29,838 --> 00:47:37,358
grow and be able to sleep in my own bed

1212
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:41,078
than you know go to jail for some plants

1213
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:42,598
so I'm watching and sure enough bro they

1214
00:47:41,079 --> 00:47:45,240
get back in the car and they start

1215
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:47,920
cruising down that driveway and instead

1216
00:47:45,239 --> 00:47:49,799
of going right back towards town where

1217
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:51,720
they came from they they all they start

1218
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:53,200
slowly turning left and I told her I

1219
00:47:51,719 --> 00:47:55,838
said they're coming up here just the way

1220
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:58,279
they were moving and that's

1221
00:47:55,838 --> 00:48:01,279
probably quarter mile

1222
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:02,960
maybe from like the way like when they

1223
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,640
leave that driveway I can see them drive

1224
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:07,119
to my driveway down by the bridge and

1225
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:09,558
they come up then they got to come up my

1226
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:11,200
[ __ ] and uh I told her let's said

1227
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:12,599
they're coming up here and my plants at

1228
00:48:11,199 --> 00:48:16,519
this time like four or five foot tall

1229
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:20,800
right and A Pet's only 4 foot tall 4 FO

1230
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:23,199
3 in something like that and uh sure

1231
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:27,280
enough bro they're they're cruising real

1232
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:29,719
slow Spotlight so I run outside dude

1233
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:31,240
and I grabbed them plants start grabbing

1234
00:48:29,719 --> 00:48:32,919
them bro was me and they're [ __ ] in

1235
00:48:31,239 --> 00:48:36,759
five gallons bro so I'm getting two

1236
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:38,960
three at a time Max bringing them inside

1237
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:41,800
and

1238
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:45,358
uh like I said I probably had 14 15 of

1239
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:47,480
them out there and uh I get a couple in

1240
00:48:45,358 --> 00:48:49,318
a couple runs in I look outside and sure

1241
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:51,199
enough bro they're like stopped in front

1242
00:48:49,318 --> 00:48:53,079
of my house and they start slowly

1243
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:55,358
driving up the driveway my shit's steep

1244
00:48:53,079 --> 00:48:57,160
so like you need to be in a truck almost

1245
00:48:55,358 --> 00:48:59,440
to get up our [ __ ] so they're in these

1246
00:48:57,159 --> 00:49:01,519
little cars I taking them a minute and

1247
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:04,159
the water that washes down this driveway

1248
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:06,159
will wash out real big ruts so it's it's

1249
00:49:04,159 --> 00:49:08,838
kind of rough you know it's like Creek

1250
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:11,358
Rock driveway type thing and

1251
00:49:08,838 --> 00:49:13,279
uh they're driving up at real slow and

1252
00:49:11,358 --> 00:49:15,598
I'm [ __ ] and I'm I told her I said

1253
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,880
they're coming and I could see them with

1254
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:19,720
the spotlights you know I'm in the cut

1255
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:21,200
bro so when they show up they use

1256
00:49:19,719 --> 00:49:23,118
Spotlight Spotlight and everything

1257
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:26,318
looking and

1258
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:29,160
uh I'm running these plants inside dude

1259
00:49:26,318 --> 00:49:32,119
and I probably get down to like the last

1260
00:49:29,159 --> 00:49:36,199
four you know and I could hear them bro

1261
00:49:32,119 --> 00:49:38,920
come up at gravel you know sound of the

1262
00:49:36,199 --> 00:49:41,399
cars and start seeing lights close and

1263
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:43,519
I'm I'm in between my cabin and like the

1264
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:44,960
back facing the field where you park and

1265
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:46,719
then they're coming up the drive on the

1266
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,599
front they can't see me because the

1267
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:50,879
cabin essentially block blocking the

1268
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:55,039
view in the way it's like kind of coming

1269
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:57,440
up a hill and uh I run two plants and

1270
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:59,199
I'm and I run I'm about to run back

1271
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,838
outside and they're they're literally

1272
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:02,598
out in front of our cabin and the way

1273
00:50:00,838 --> 00:50:04,400
you had to like you had to kind of curve

1274
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:05,720
around this big curve and it there's a

1275
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,880
bunch of trees and bushes you can't

1276
00:50:05,719 --> 00:50:08,679
really see and then once you come to the

1277
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,240
back you can see like the the cabin and

1278
00:50:08,679 --> 00:50:14,279
