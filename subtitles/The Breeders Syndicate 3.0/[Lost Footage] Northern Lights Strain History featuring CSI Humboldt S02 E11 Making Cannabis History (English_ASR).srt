Wasabi I need to teach you how to use a

23
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,799
camera

24
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:37,799
use a camera as my own heads cut off

25
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,320
yeah this is a professional it could be

26
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,079
called headspace that you need to get

27
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:46,019
there you go this is a perfect I'm just

28
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:48,599
analyzing my [ __ ] you just super anal

29
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:51,298
dude I like logged in and like your [ __ ]

30
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:54,239
was like aiming at the wall I know I I

31
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:56,159
started I start off with a scenery of my

32
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,560
my ceiling

33
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,118
you do yeah because nobody wants to see

34
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,460
my [ __ ] face the first time they jump

35
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:06,078
in I want to traumatize anyone I want to

36
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:06,078
be I want it to be smooth

37
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:10,459
yeah

38
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,459
all right

39
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,939
so

40
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,459
um

41
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:19,859
trying to think of how to start this

42
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:21,439
uh well I don't know what you said

43
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,400
because I just popped up

44
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:26,219
we're hoping

45
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,260
uh managing technical difficulties and

46
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:31,620
whatnot that we might be able to get a

47
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:33,539
CSI on to chat about some stuff yeah

48
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:37,140
um and uh

49
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:38,939
this uh this Friday evening we kind of

50
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:42,419
decided that we were going to maybe sort

51
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:44,579
of merge uh something that's current uh

52
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:47,039
going on right now with some historical

53
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:50,819
[ __ ] yeah right and we had an excellent

54
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:54,780
opportunity to do that in the uh in the

55
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:58,799
nl5 project that Matt and and CSI have

56
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:01,080
been up to uh and nl5 probably needs uh

57
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,519
no introduction in the sense that it's

58
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,640
probably like one of the most famous

59
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:07,259
terms in all of cannabis yep uh but

60
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:09,119
there's a lot of Legend behind it and

61
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:11,219
there's a lot of misinformation behind

62
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,379
it and so we thought for this episode

63
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:17,400
maybe we could sort of like take you

64
00:03:13,378 --> 00:03:19,259
guys through like how it started some of

65
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,300
the history to it and a lot of this

66
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:23,759
stuff has been chatted about in various

67
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,379
ways and shapes and forms but we thought

68
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:29,219
it might be interesting to sort of like

69
00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:31,679
coalesce it all into one show yeah uh

70
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:33,479
and start from back then and sort of

71
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,060
bring it into the now

72
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,919
because modern times yeah because you

73
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,979
know so I mean I've done I've helped

74
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:43,559
with some like 90s stuff and uh it makes

75
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:46,738
me feel old but you know the 90s is like

76
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,539
30 plus years ago now uh and the 80s

77
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:51,658
when all this [ __ ] was happening was 40

78
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:54,419
plus years ago now so most people in

79
00:03:51,658 --> 00:03:57,179
cannabis have heard about nl5 but it's

80
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:59,399
mostly just Legends and there's a lot of

81
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,680
misinformation and a lot of funny cuts

82
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,019
and a lot of odd stories and so we kind

83
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,680
of thought we'd just chat about those

84
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:10,379
kind of aspects a little bit and sort of

85
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,080
merge the history with a little bit of

86
00:04:10,378 --> 00:04:16,279
the project that these guys are doing

87
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,280
um because they tie in together

88
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,660
and yeah I mean where do we want to

89
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:24,899
start

90
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,460
uh you know we can start with

91
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:28,319
um maybe I'll start maybe we can start

92
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:29,579
with just the generalization you know

93
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:31,740
and then we'll start with some history

94
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:35,519
so the reason why everybody knows what

95
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:36,540
nl5 is in my opinion is because of

96
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:40,620
Neville

97
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:43,979
right uh Neville uh popularized it he

98
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:47,340
picked a selection uh and he used the

99
00:04:43,978 --> 00:04:49,978
nl5 and a bunch of famous crosses one of

100
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:54,179
which was probably the most famous line

101
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:56,699
of all time the nl5 hates yes uh and

102
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,139
then other groups and Canadian seed

103
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:02,040
banks and all these different things

104
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:04,740
started using the name nl5 and L5 right

105
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:08,160
and it just sort of became part of the

106
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,879
fabric of cannabis history yeah if you

107
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,699
will

108
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:13,639
right and there was a lot misunderstood

109
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:16,860
about it or whatever but it's probably

110
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:19,259
one of the most recognizable terms in

111
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:22,199
canvas yeah I think even people like my

112
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:24,360
parents uh my mom my dad was who he was

113
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:25,860
with weed but my mom had nothing to do

114
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,419
with it she wanted nothing to do with it

115
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,580
never learned it and even she has sort

116
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:31,500
of Northern Lights as a strict and

117
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:33,060
Northern Lights and Northern Lights five

118
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,579
and all that and so now what we've got

119
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,500
going on is is I've joked on previous

120
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:40,500
episodes or whatever that like when I

121
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:43,500
was trying to collect uh a lot of old

122
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:46,259
stuff it was almost impossible but now

123
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,779
we're kind of in this wave of you know

124
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:51,240
famous things from the 80s and 90s you

125
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:54,239
know or in any form they might exist in

126
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:57,600
has has got a Resurgence yeah of

127
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,000
popularity and interest and people want

128
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,759
to see what's up with you know what was

129
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,740
once common becomes legendary yeah

130
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:07,259
right it's really is kind of what it

131
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,900
boils down to and so for anyone that

132
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:12,479
came into the weed scene later when ml5

133
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:15,538
was already kind of a myth

134
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:17,399
um you know uh you know hopefully we can

135
00:06:15,538 --> 00:06:19,918
like clear up a bunch of stuff because

136
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:23,698
there's a lot of there's a lot of people

137
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:27,120
that are talking about the name yeah

138
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:29,639
right yeah so uh

139
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,160
when we tell this tale let's go ahead

140
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,300
and start with there was a man named

141
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,939
Herbie

142
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:41,579
sure and Herbie uh went to a certain

143
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:44,219
hair hair salon where the Northern Light

144
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:46,859
crew hung out and he would go to they

145
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:49,560
would go to this hair salon and commune

146
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:51,479
and smoke weed and talk stuff well this

147
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,240
guy named Herbie came in and he was a

148
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:59,579
veteran and he

149
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:01,800
um wanted to be able to grow and make a

150
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:03,839
living for himself so they set him up

151
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,300
with some lights and some some of the

152
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:08,399
original Steve Murphy Afghani seeds and

153
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,259
he had some of his own

154
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:12,839
um different hybrids he was working with

155
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:15,300
mostly Colombian and Mexican I believe

156
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:16,379
that was the uh quote

157
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,139
um

158
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:20,639
yeah and and he he was the one who

159
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:26,280
selected this

160
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:29,699
nl5 clone from or from his own work with

161
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:32,519
the Steve Murphy Afghan and Hawaiian

162
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:34,800
so yeah I mean probably the the way that

163
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:38,159
a people can understand it the best is

164
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,139
that there was a loose Collective group

165
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,479
of friends you know you know

166
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:45,478
acquaintances whatever in the Pacific

167
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:47,219
Northwest area yeah um Herbie was one

168
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:50,519
there was a guy named some some people

169
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:52,800
call him the Indian uh was another one

170
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:56,459
um Steve Murphy was a different one

171
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,139
um there was uh you know a um there was

172
00:07:56,459 --> 00:08:01,500
a number of different characters all

173
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:03,960
involved at various points and so it was

174
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,538
a mostly everyone has to remember that

175
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:08,879
in that time in the early 80s almost

176
00:08:06,538 --> 00:08:11,879
everything in America was still sativa

177
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:14,399
and blends of different sativas because

178
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:15,719
all the all the weed that came into

179
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:18,959
America

180
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:21,360
was seeded Sativa weed

181
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:23,399
right so the core of everybody starting

182
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:27,000
to breed was you got three seeds with

183
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:30,899
your sativa weeds lots of them and the

184
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,299
rare [ __ ] was Indica because Indica made

185
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:36,418
hash hash didn't come with free seeds

186
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:38,939
and so Indica seeds were really hard to

187
00:08:36,418 --> 00:08:41,338
acquire uh they came from people on the

188
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,740
hippie hashish Trail people like Sam

189
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:47,100
Skunk Man and Neville and others made

190
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:49,459
trips to Afghanistan which in that era

191
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:52,080
was extremely difficult to do

192
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:54,479
it's dangerous and they started bringing

193
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,060
back small amounts of seeds so unlike

194
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,159
sativa that was getting sativa seeds

195
00:08:57,059 --> 00:09:01,919
spread out all over America in every

196
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:04,620
kilo that was sold Indica seeds were

197
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:06,958
hard to come by yeah so the NL story

198
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:10,560
starts with a very small handful of

199
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:13,018
seeds of pure Indica that came from this

200
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:15,059
dude named Steve Murphy yeah

201
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:16,379
right and then of course just like

202
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:18,239
anybody

203
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:21,299
um the group in on the Pacific Northwest

204
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,940
up there started making hybrids of this

205
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:25,699
stuff they crossed it to itself they

206
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:29,459
crossed it to everything else they had

207
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:31,320
and the the famous numbers of NL

208
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:33,479
basically

209
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,820
you know connotate like the lower the

210
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,339
number the more indica and the shorter

211
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:42,000
it was yeah so the one two three four

212
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:44,279
were you know predominantly Indica based

213
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,379
and smaller and you start getting into

214
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:48,480
five six seven eight nine ten eleven and

215
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:51,360
they start getting more and more sativa

216
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,000
now Matt's already interviewed one of

217
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,759
the main characters uh in the for in in

218
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,220
this thing and he basically stated that

219
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:01,860
they took that Steve Murphy Afghan and

220
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,360
they crossed it to every sativa they

221
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:07,759
could get their hands on

222
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:11,580
so Hawaiians Mexicans Colombians

223
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:14,039
you said Indians blends of those things

224
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:16,320
hybrids of those things all back and

225
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:19,199
forth right so

226
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:23,459
the nl5 they had this buddy named Herbie

227
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:28,200
who got involved and uh Herbie had a

228
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:28,859
Hawaiian okay and this Hawaiian was

229
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,980
um

230
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:35,759
you know he crossed he it got crossed to

231
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,320
the Steve Murphy Afghan and the it got

232
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:39,720
called nl5

233
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,760
uh for its position and the height and

234
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,540
the blend of sativa versus indica or

235
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:44,519
whatever

236
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:48,599
and they found afino that they really

237
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:51,360
really liked so nl5 initially was a seed

238
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:54,778
line created within that little crew

239
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:57,240
and then Herbie gave back to the NL crew

240
00:10:54,778 --> 00:10:58,740
like this select Fino that he was super

241
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,519
excited about

242
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:04,680
and so the as best we can tell it's a

243
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:05,459
pure Afghan from Steve Murphy on the one

244
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:08,099
side

245
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:09,179
and a Mexican Colombian We Believe on

246
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,339
the other side

247
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:12,539
that was called a Hawaiian because it

248
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:13,800
was called a Hawaiian because it was

249
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:16,019
grown in Hawaii but there is no

250
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:18,719
indigenous Hawaiian weed yeah most

251
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:20,459
Hawaiian weed was Mexican Colombian a

252
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,660
blend of those two or a blend of those

253
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:26,819
two with Afghan right so

254
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:29,699
um you know and then as you know as the

255
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:34,140
story's been told uh this gentleman

256
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:37,019
um sent Neville uh a uh a whole bunch of

257
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:40,078
seeds all numbered

258
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:41,519
right yeah and uh I don't know if you

259
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:44,879
have any of those catalogs handy but

260
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:47,519
Neville's story is that Neville's story

261
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:48,299
is that he was

262
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,159
um

263
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:53,879
you know he did a lot of work with them

264
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:55,439
and a lot of them as we found out were a

265
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:59,220
mess because they were a blend of

266
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:03,120
indicas and and sativas yeah but in this

267
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:05,579
one seed of nl5 out of a bunch of Indica

268
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,519
sativa hybrids and a mess he found this

269
00:12:05,578 --> 00:12:12,899
plant that was what he called the pure

270
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:15,899
Indica throwback that showed zero sativa

271
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:19,259
influence yeah it was short it was squat

272
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:21,419
it was leafy it was covered in Frost it

273
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:23,578
didn't have a lot of smell

274
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:27,599
um and so he started Crossing this to

275
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:30,000
things and it crossed amazingly well

276
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:34,500
with basically everything he threw on it

277
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:37,259
yeah so the legend of nl5 was born

278
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:40,919
because he crossed it to skunk one

279
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:42,240
and he crossed it to NL he crossed it to

280
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:45,419
Hayes

281
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,940
and he crossed it to ml2 and he crossed

282
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:50,039
it to a few other things uh it started

283
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,740
showing up in poly hybrids he made like

284
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:55,319
silver Pearl yeah and it just sort of

285
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:58,620
became one of the building blocks of his

286
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:02,100
genetic library and since he was one of

287
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:04,320
the first dudes that had a seed bank

288
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,759
anything that he had that he threw into

289
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,339
a bunch of crosses kind of went

290
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:10,319
everywhere yeah right and all these

291
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:12,180
things are winning High Times you know

292
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,700
stuff and it's getting big glossy

293
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:17,458
pictures and nl5 Hayes was the most

294
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:19,920
popular strain they sold so the legend

295
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:20,939
of it just took off

296
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:23,819
now

297
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:25,920
there's a debate here because what

298
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:29,160
what's indisputable is that he went to

299
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:33,000
the states and he got uh the Pacific

300
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:36,120
Northwest hash plant and the um and the

301
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,559
G13 through friends of uh another guy

302
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,200
who's pretty famous named Jorge

303
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:44,699
Cervantes some friends of his hooked him

304
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:46,800
up and he arranged for the cutting that

305
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:50,700
the guys in the Pacific Northwest were

306
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:53,399
growing as nl5 to be shipped over

307
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:55,740
right yeah and so they did this they did

308
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,839
this clever thing where they shipped

309
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:01,139
this plant over in a terrarium of other

310
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:04,260
plants and they took scissors and they

311
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:05,820
cut the serrations off the edges of each

312
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:08,458
of the pot leaves

313
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:11,820
so it didn't look like wheat that's sick

314
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:14,159
huh that's right they just shaved all

315
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:18,060
that off so it looked unusual

316
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:20,819
and if Neville is posted uh back when he

317
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:22,379
used to post on Mr Nice that he didn't

318
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,600
like that one as much because it wasn't

319
00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:26,700
as consistent of a breeder as the one he

320
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,100
found amongst the seed line yeah and so

321
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:31,019
he didn't use it yeah so right there you

322
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:34,680
have this massive confusion where

323
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:37,259
everybody thinks nl5 is the same thing

324
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:40,198
where it is kind of the same thing but

325
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:42,600
there's a seed line that never got out

326
00:14:40,198 --> 00:14:44,879
there's a clone that they selected from

327
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:48,180
that seed line that was popular in

328
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:50,399
Washington yeah and there's a clone that

329
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:51,899
that Neville found among seeds they sent

330
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:55,679
to him

331
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:57,120
and they all got called nl5 yes and

332
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:59,338
that's where a lot of the con the

333
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,139
confusion lies yeah so people think

334
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:03,720
they'll be like oh I've got the same

335
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:05,879
clone that Neville used and all of his

336
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:09,180
breeding but it never left the West

337
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:11,698
Coast yeah well no because Neville says

338
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:14,578
he found it in seat yeah

339
00:15:11,698 --> 00:15:17,219
you know so there was there was two

340
00:15:14,578 --> 00:15:18,539
select cuttings even early

341
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,220
um and you know most people don't

342
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:23,338
realize this but Neville says his was

343
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:25,379
like a total Afghan throwback and the

344
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:28,560
one that that uh the Seattle crew

345
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:31,198
describes had like two foot colas on it

346
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:35,338
right yeah that's a long running lime

347
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:37,319
green colas well yes and no yes and no

348
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:40,320
if I remember if I remember it was

349
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:42,180
stated that they combined different buds

350
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,420
to make it look like it had a massive

351
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:48,179
Cola for Neville oh Jesus yeah so that

352
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:50,159
there were some fun stuff going on there

353
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:52,439
was some Shenanigans perhaps yes

354
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:55,740
Shenanigans abound there was some

355
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:58,260
Shenanigans so there's a so yeah I mean

356
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:59,940
there's an aspect where

357
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:01,860
um

358
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,420
I'm sorry I'm looking down for a second

359
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:06,899
because Matt didn't have his catalog

360
00:16:03,419 --> 00:16:08,159
handy I know I always do too but I do I

361
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:11,458
don't know if there's a bigger version

362
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:14,100
of this but if everyone wants to look

363
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:17,879
at that picture right there

364
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:20,100
that is a picture of the mother cut

365
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:21,958
taken in Amsterdam and put in the

366
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:25,019
Scentsy seeds catalog

367
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:27,899
taken when it won a cup in 1995 it was

368
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:30,659
printed in the 96 catalog that is a that

369
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:35,100
is one of the few existing pictures of

370
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:37,439
an actual growing nl5 that Neville used

371
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:40,620
and you can see it's short it's squat

372
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,899
it's leafy as [ __ ] you know it's got all

373
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,500
these things going on to it

374
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:44,940
um

375
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:49,198
and so

376
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:51,420
you know uh so nl5 Neville said that nl5

377
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:53,399
was prop nl5 Haze was probably the most

378
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:55,500
famous and best-selling thing in his

379
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:58,500
whole catalog both at his seed bank and

380
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:02,639
later at Scentsy yeah

381
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:04,798
um the nl5 skunk one got renamed it's I

382
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,140
don't know if it was renamed Shiva Shiva

383
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:09,418
skunk yeah I think it was renamed Shiva

384
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:11,400
skunk at Scentsy seeds but it was sold

385
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:14,660
the whole time

386
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:19,559
um so probably it was sold from 87 or 88

387
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:21,540
all the way through uh you know 1999 or

388
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:24,119
the early 2000s still probably to this

389
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:27,659
day but it's not the same [ __ ] yeah

390
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:29,879
um and nl5 Haze was sold consistently so

391
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:32,660
you know it just kind of entered into

392
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:35,760
the Lexicon everybody knows nl5 hits

393
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:37,679
yeah and it's gotten old enough now that

394
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:39,779
a bunch of people are like oh I have it

395
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,120
I have the original cutting I have the

396
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:44,038
this I have the that so

397
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:47,219
you know

398
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:49,919
um you know and uh and and you know it

399
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:52,259
it um someone's saying nothing about the

400
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,840
NL crew telling Neville that I mean

401
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:57,538
Neville you know Neville spoke about the

402
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:59,159
NL but he basically like has said that

403
00:17:57,538 --> 00:18:02,099
he just got

404
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:05,519
um he just got these labeled seeds and

405
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:07,619
he made his own inferences about them

406
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:09,418
you know so yeah

407
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:10,979
you know he had he had to make it up

408
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:13,380
basically like he had to think what what

409
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:15,360
am I seeing yeah um and then you know

410
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,980
the guys back then it was in the 80s and

411
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:18,899
they were all scared of getting busted

412
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:21,538
so they didn't really take copious notes

413
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:23,460
no and then either that was stated

414
00:18:21,538 --> 00:18:25,980
several times you know and we actually

415
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,860
know a bit more about the nl5 than we

416
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,660
know about a lot of the other NL numbers

417
00:18:27,859 --> 00:18:32,699
because of what Herbie was working with

418
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:36,660
and what he said he crossed to the Steve

419
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:38,580
Murphy to get that nl5 yeah so it's like

420
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:41,100
a lot of things you know I mean a lot of

421
00:18:38,579 --> 00:18:42,298
a lot of uh a lot of breedings are

422
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:44,759
collaborative

423
00:18:42,298 --> 00:18:46,740
it's a small group of friends doing one

424
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:48,480
part at my garage and you do the next

425
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:50,519
part of yours and this and that and

426
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,558
everything else and who's responsible

427
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:55,740
for it there might be one or two people

428
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:57,240
that gets known for it but in reality

429
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,740
there's a whole little group that's

430
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,200
involved

431
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,339
yeah it was it was a kind of small group

432
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,900
yeah

433
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:09,538
right yep so you know uh and then you

434
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:12,179
know when it comes to ml5 Haze uh

435
00:19:09,538 --> 00:19:15,000
Neville claims that right before he left

436
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:18,298
Scentsy about 95-ish uh they lost the

437
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,819
mother of nl5 dope

438
00:19:18,298 --> 00:19:22,798
it died and it makes kind of sense

439
00:19:20,819 --> 00:19:27,178
because if you like there's a bunch of

440
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:28,980
nl5 haze cuts that still are kept in amp

441
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:32,519
in America especially in the New York

442
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:36,360
Region and in Amsterdam and they all are

443
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:37,980
basically from 88 to 95. yeah

444
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:40,019
you know there's not really people

445
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:41,460
aren't really like oh I got this one in

446
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:43,679
2002

447
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:45,480
uh but there was a lot of fire in those

448
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,580
seven or eight years that they were able

449
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:50,038
to marry those two plants together yeah

450
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:53,038
you know and then

451
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:54,960
you know uh Super Silver Haze and stuff

452
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:57,599
like that was kind of Neville's attempt

453
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:01,079
to blend the three most famous Amsterdam

454
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:02,038
lines together uh which was NL skunk and

455
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:04,500
Haze

456
00:20:02,038 --> 00:20:05,879
and so you know now we have this whole

457
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,500
thing where

458
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:10,860
everything gets different names and

459
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:14,579
different nicknames and tons of [ __ ] has

460
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:16,740
NL or skunk or Haze blended into it yeah

461
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:18,960
but you might not know because it

462
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:22,200
doesn't have that name attached

463
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,779
yeah you know uh no someone said I

464
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:28,620
assumed it was phenos of one to nine no

465
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:30,619
it was different hybrids so nl1 was

466
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:34,199
almost pure Afghan

467
00:20:30,619 --> 00:20:36,239
nl2 was another afghan that they

468
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,880
actually got like a Kush type Afghan

469
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,640
from the Indian and they Blended that to

470
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,500
Steve Murphy yeah three and four sort of

471
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,360
lost a time nobody has them but they

472
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,279
were also you know they started

473
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:50,219
increasing amounts of sativa and 5

474
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:53,160
through 11 were just the NL Crews

475
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:55,279
Crossing that Afghan to different

476
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:58,259
sativas yeah

477
00:20:55,279 --> 00:21:01,019
and you know the more the higher the

478
00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:03,480
number the taller the plant the more

479
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:07,200
sativa influenced yeah

480
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:09,900
right yep and so we know it so if you

481
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,940
look around uh at some of Neville's

482
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:15,240
early catalogs you can see him playing

483
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:18,240
around he uses the eight he uses the

484
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:20,339
five he uses the nine he's got the one

485
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,960
and the two you know all these different

486
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:24,599
things and then after three or four

487
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:26,400
years he decided basically that he was

488
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:28,678
only going to breed with the one the two

489
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,780
and the one cutting of the five that he

490
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:33,360
found yeah and so all these other

491
00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:35,759
hybrids kind of go away

492
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:38,459
because probably because they were mixes

493
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:39,839
of extreme sativas with indicas and they

494
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:42,600
were probably a lot more of a pain in

495
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:44,699
the ass for a breeder to tame yeah and

496
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:47,639
he did have high high as far as his

497
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:50,340
Keepers he did use a uh

498
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:52,799
a rigorous selection so he didn't keep

499
00:21:50,339 --> 00:21:54,779
he went through a lot of seeds to find

500
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:56,639
what he kept and the Indian I believe

501
00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:58,558
the Indian was Native American but I

502
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,299
can't say that for sure but he was he

503
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:02,940
was Native American but he was he was

504
00:22:00,298 --> 00:22:05,639
part of the Pacific Northwest crew yeah

505
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:07,140
uh and a lot of these guys aren't aren't

506
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,940
well known and don't want to be in the

507
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:10,740
well-known because in the 80s especially

508
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:12,419
in the late 80s there was a series of

509
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:15,298
rolling busts and they all got in

510
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:17,960
trouble yeah uh so it was a hard time to

511
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:17,960
be a cultivator

512
00:22:18,619 --> 00:22:23,639
yeah yeah and all that it was there was

513
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:25,798
a lot of persecution back then there was

514
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,720
a lot of secrecy back then that's part

515
00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:29,099
of why they didn't keep copious notes

516
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:32,819
because they didn't want them to be used

517
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:36,599
against them in a court of law later on

518
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:37,980
um and so you know but basically I say I

519
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:40,740
think it's fair to say that the reason

520
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:42,960
why everybody knows nl5 is because of

521
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:44,880
Neville that I think that's fair I think

522
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,759
everybody agrees with that too because

523
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,380
he and even like the Seattle guys will

524
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:51,839
say that if they hadn't sent it to

525
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:54,419
Neville it likely would have been lost

526
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:57,779
yeah because they went through a rolling

527
00:22:54,419 --> 00:23:00,659
series of busts and had issues

528
00:22:57,779 --> 00:23:03,119
yeah you know so it so it was sold at

529
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:06,059
Neville's seed bank for a number of

530
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:09,000
years and then it was sold at Scentsy

531
00:23:06,058 --> 00:23:10,558
for a number of years after that uh

532
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,640
never pure

533
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:18,658
right uh always a hybrid skunk one Haze

534
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:20,580
nl2 silver Pearl other poly hybrids

535
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:22,200
Blended together but never really by

536
00:23:20,579 --> 00:23:26,339
itself yeah

537
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:29,100
so there was a pure seed line of nl5 but

538
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:32,279
nobody got it it wasn't sold it didn't

539
00:23:29,099 --> 00:23:34,439
make it to out of Amsterdam it was given

540
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:37,678
to like a couple people and even like

541
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,840
even great you know uh even like some of

542
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:43,019
the Seattle guys said that there was a

543
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:45,658
couple of cuts that got out the eight

544
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:48,000
the nine and maybe one of and maybe one

545
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:51,780
of the twos from the Indian but nothing

546
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,240
else yeah so the five survived because

547
00:23:51,779 --> 00:23:56,700
it went to Amsterdam

548
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,079
basically yeah that it's that's the only

549
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,240
reason it survived that's the only

550
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:02,099
reason why it survived so if you listen

551
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,259
to the Seattle crew they had one version

552
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:07,439
of nl5 that they kept as a cutting and

553
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:12,058
and kind of cropped out uh Neville found

554
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:14,220
a breeder that he kept you know yeah and

555
00:24:12,058 --> 00:24:17,279
you know it kind of It kind of went into

556
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:19,440
it kind of went into Legend

557
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:22,319
um you know and so

558
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,820
you know uh and so yeah I see all kinds

559
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:26,700
of people what's up with this person's

560
00:24:23,819 --> 00:24:28,558
nl1 what's up with this nl5 what

561
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:32,220
happened is is because it became so

562
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:34,678
famous okay two things happened one is

563
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:36,900
that in Amsterdam anytime anything gets

564
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:39,960
famous people get seeds of it and they

565
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:43,259
white label it yeah right and they offer

566
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:45,240
up their own versions of it okay and

567
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:47,879
then on top of that when the Canadian

568
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,079
seed companies got involved they ended

569
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,000
up buying a bunch of stuff from

570
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:54,178
Amsterdam blending it to Canadian

571
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:57,298
strains and claiming that they had these

572
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:59,940
things for sales purposes yeah you know

573
00:24:57,298 --> 00:25:03,179
so you get and and they all have sort of

574
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:05,400
dodgy history yeah when it comes to

575
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:07,980
provenance what I've what I've told you

576
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:10,860
so far is pretty much factually agreed

577
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:13,319
to by the people that sent it to Neville

578
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:16,019
and Neville yeah and people around

579
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:18,658
Neville yeah you know and then it gets

580
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:20,700
famous and there's a proliferation of

581
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:22,980
people and seed banks that claim to have

582
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:24,778
various stuff

583
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:27,480
but they weren't passing out this

584
00:25:24,778 --> 00:25:29,339
cutting to other people no they weren't

585
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,919
sharing it just so other people in

586
00:25:29,339 --> 00:25:34,500
different continents could like make

587
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,600
their own seeds with it it wasn't like

588
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,919
today where people were trading seeds

589
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:40,500
back and forth

590
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:44,278
you know and clones back and forth

591
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:46,500
especially to competitors you know the

592
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:49,679
Dutch are extremely business oriented

593
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:51,289
very they're not going to just like bro

594
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,700
out

595
00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:54,899
[Music]

596
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:56,759
yeah that's why Matt's laughing because

597
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,559
they very are very much business

598
00:25:56,759 --> 00:26:00,119
oriented if they have a cut and everyone

599
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:02,639
else wants it and they're breeding off

600
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:03,719
it and making money there's not really a

601
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,580
chance they're going to share that

602
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,259
[ __ ] thing and there's a definite

603
00:26:05,579 --> 00:26:09,538
chance everybody's gonna say that they

604
00:26:07,259 --> 00:26:10,919
have it yeah there's a definite chance

605
00:26:09,538 --> 00:26:13,500
that everyone's gonna say they have it

606
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:16,140
and they're gonna use that any name that

607
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:20,519
becomes famous in cannabis

608
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:22,679
gets used yeah you know so someone asked

609
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:25,019
about you know and so

610
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:28,320
um that's kind of like that's kind of

611
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:30,240
where nl5 you know just got crossed to

612
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:33,480
some very famous things and Neville made

613
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,579
some very [ __ ] famous lines off it

614
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,440
and there wasn't that much weed strains

615
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:40,439
back then and the combination of that

616
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,778
and High Times being like the premiere

617
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:45,720
magazine in the 90s and you get all

618
00:26:42,778 --> 00:26:48,419
these high quality glossy photos and all

619
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:51,960
the the Cannabis cups and there was only

620
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:55,080
one Cannabis Cup a year yeah so this

621
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:56,819
[ __ ] got hella famous

622
00:26:55,079 --> 00:27:01,500
legendary

623
00:26:56,819 --> 00:27:04,259
you know yeah and um yeah

624
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:07,140
what about another one

625
00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:08,278
what's that what about in L1 oh denali's

626
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,860
question

627
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:12,480
oh I didn't see it I mean nl1 is is

628
00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:14,519
probably the closest thing to Steve

629
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,740
Murphy Afghan

630
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:19,500
um it's it's it's got a little bit of

631
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:23,220
discrepancy between the guys involved as

632
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:24,599
to what exactly is in it yeah um but you

633
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,880
know it's that's kind of irrelevant

634
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:29,399
because what actually got sold is what

635
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:32,340
got sent to Neville and everybody should

636
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:36,019
know that Neville got it in in uh in

637
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:38,399
84-85 and spent two or three years

638
00:27:36,019 --> 00:27:41,759
seeing what he had so if you bought

639
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,320
Northern Lights in 85 or 86 or even 87

640
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:46,319
from his catalog

641
00:27:43,319 --> 00:27:47,399
it was a [ __ ] hodgepodge of any of

642
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:50,399
the lines

643
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:54,538
all Blended together yeah it wasn't

644
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:56,519
until about 88 that uh

645
00:27:54,538 --> 00:27:57,960
um it wasn't about I'm gonna turn off my

646
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:01,379
light because people are bitching it

647
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:05,579
wasn't about until 88 that uh he started

648
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:07,080
coming out with nl1 nl2 and nl5 yeah

649
00:28:05,579 --> 00:28:10,678
right

650
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:13,579
and uh you know and so and then so then

651
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:17,340
these numbers get attached I think

652
00:28:13,579 --> 00:28:22,500
1989 late 88 is when nl5 Haze got

653
00:28:17,339 --> 00:28:26,158
released yeah and nl5 skunk one and nl5

654
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:27,839
this and so no one nl2 you know when it

655
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,059
went to Scentsy

656
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:31,259
um you know they just called nl1

657
00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:35,399
Northern Lights

658
00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:38,278
yeah and they called nl2 Hindu Kush

659
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:39,600
uh and so lots of people got NL because

660
00:28:38,278 --> 00:28:41,519
it was one of the most common things

661
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:43,558
sold

662
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:47,038
yeah so I had to screenshot something

663
00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:48,839
this one no yeah it's hard I mean people

664
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:50,700
ask questions sometimes I'll get it

665
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:52,678
sometimes not it's really hard to like

666
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:55,620
Pat your head and rub your stomach at

667
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:57,778
the same time so like I try to chat

668
00:28:55,619 --> 00:29:00,359
about something and sound like you know

669
00:28:57,778 --> 00:29:02,038
fairly have a have some flow and then I

670
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:03,538
read a question and I think about it and

671
00:29:02,038 --> 00:29:05,879
all of a sudden I'm not talking and I'm

672
00:29:03,538 --> 00:29:08,460
just staring at the screen so forgive me

673
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:10,919
uh for all that you know if it's a

674
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:13,558
little ADHD yeah if I miss your question

675
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:15,419
I'm sorry it's just the way it works so

676
00:29:13,558 --> 00:29:17,519
you know I've chatted about this a bunch

677
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:20,340
before on some of the previous podcasts

678
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:23,099
and a little bit more detail but that's

679
00:29:20,339 --> 00:29:25,619
what got it famous

680
00:29:23,099 --> 00:29:28,558
right that that is the story that is

681
00:29:25,619 --> 00:29:31,500
that is that is the story and so now

682
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:33,418
anytime anything becomes famous you know

683
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:35,278
it's kind of like music or fashion or

684
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:36,778
something like that it gets [ __ ]

685
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:39,599
recycled

686
00:29:36,778 --> 00:29:41,339
right like it becomes new and most

687
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:43,379
people don't know about it and then all

688
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:45,418
of a sudden people are like I've got

689
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:47,580
this ancient nl5 cut and I'm making

690
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:49,200
beans with it I've got this this this

691
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:51,658
you know

692
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,600
um you know and maybe maybe Matt you

693
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:57,120
could explain the boof cut or the the

694
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:58,798
new cut I I don't know I I've never

695
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:00,058
talked to Bodie about that one and I

696
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:02,639
keep meaning to ask him because people

697
00:30:00,058 --> 00:30:04,639
ask it a lot but I don't know the the

698
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:08,159
history on that one

699
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:10,860
so I mean people you know and you know

700
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:13,320
people asked about Bob Hemphill and you

701
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:16,319
know uh and and Ella and stuff like that

702
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:18,418
and so people have been people you know

703
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:20,460
it's really hard when you get see when

704
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:23,340
you get seeds and lines that are that

705
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:26,159
are 25 30 years old Plus

706
00:30:23,339 --> 00:30:30,418
uh provenance on it becomes difficult

707
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:33,000
right you know uh apparently you know uh

708
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:35,759
Hemphill used to work with uh the

709
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,380
coastal seeds Collective uh and

710
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:39,839
apparently you know he got it through

711
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:41,220
some friend of cogus

712
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:44,398
you know

713
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:46,500
um but nl1 was sold for you know what

714
00:30:44,398 --> 00:30:48,719
probably 20 years yeah for a long time

715
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:52,140
for a long time it was it was sold it

716
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,819
was and there was never a specific cut I

717
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:56,820
mean Neville had some breeding males

718
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:59,579
that he used uh nl1 and nl2 and

719
00:30:56,819 --> 00:31:01,500
Neville's thing was almost always males

720
00:30:59,579 --> 00:31:04,379
yeah they were part of his breeding

721
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:07,319
males and so it wasn't like nl5 well

722
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:10,500
while never Neville just had one cutting

723
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:13,619
that had to be kept alive yeah nl1 was

724
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:15,839
kind of like a line yeah and so any like

725
00:31:13,619 --> 00:31:17,939
Urban Poison or something right yeah so

726
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:20,099
anytime there's a line it's a lot harder

727
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:22,620
to lose the line

728
00:31:20,099 --> 00:31:25,619
than it is when you're dependent on one

729
00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:28,099
specific cut to stay alive and keep

730
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:30,658
going yeah

731
00:31:28,099 --> 00:31:32,759
just because these these [ __ ] Dutch

732
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:34,860
guys are such businessmen when you're

733
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:37,379
not sharing a cut amongst your homies

734
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:39,538
and your good friends it exponentially

735
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:42,419
increases the chance that some kind of

736
00:31:39,538 --> 00:31:44,339
disease or accident or drought or worker

737
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:46,799
error is going to kill your [ __ ] cut

738
00:31:44,339 --> 00:31:50,579
that greed will get you and then you

739
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:55,319
haven't shared it so it gets lost

740
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:58,398
right yep uh you know and so uh Ben and

741
00:31:55,319 --> 00:32:01,079
Alan dronkers aren't generous people

742
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:02,579
they were sharing they weren't sharing

743
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:04,619
[ __ ] with anybody

744
00:32:02,579 --> 00:32:07,259
you know

745
00:32:04,619 --> 00:32:11,219
um and uh you know so I don't know I

746
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:12,720
mean it it uh nl5 is super famous NL is

747
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,700
super famous that we went through

748
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,960
probably a 10-year period where nobody

749
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,419
gave a [ __ ]

750
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:22,380
uh probably starting right around the

751
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:24,538
Kush sour going into cookie era yeah uh

752
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:26,580
where old things were just old and

753
00:32:24,538 --> 00:32:30,058
unpopular

754
00:32:26,579 --> 00:32:32,939
right yeah it's just yeah things like

755
00:32:30,058 --> 00:32:35,579
Northern Lights skunk one these were a

756
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:37,259
cheese things that that like people are

757
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:39,778
kind of looking at now like oh they got

758
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:42,480
the [ __ ] G they got like like if I

759
00:32:39,778 --> 00:32:45,179
saw that in a store with tons of clones

760
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,259
and you know the early mid-2000s it's

761
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:49,380
like

762
00:32:46,259 --> 00:32:50,819
huh give me some of that new [ __ ] nobody

763
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:53,460
was worried about that because it was so

764
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:54,960
abundant oh you know I mean we we had a

765
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:58,259
I can't remember who said it but it's

766
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:00,720
absolutely true you know 15 20 years ago

767
00:32:58,259 --> 00:33:03,599
you you bought seeds from Nirvana Gypsy

768
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,579
Nirvana and you got free skunk one seeds

769
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:07,740
because he might as well because you had

770
00:33:05,579 --> 00:33:09,298
so many of them and it was so common

771
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:11,759
it was you know you had to give them

772
00:33:09,298 --> 00:33:14,398
away yeah because nobody wanted to buy

773
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:16,019
them yeah it was super abundant and so

774
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:18,719
there's a thing where everything's so

775
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:20,759
common why would anyone want it and

776
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,339
people's tastes and change you know

777
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:25,079
people's you know taste changes and then

778
00:33:23,339 --> 00:33:28,139
it becomes rare

779
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:30,178
and then people want it again yeah but

780
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,440
most people in cannabis don't hold on to

781
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:33,179
anything unless it's currently

782
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,759
profitable

783
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:38,580
so what once becomes we've we've seen it

784
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:40,019
over and over and over and over again

785
00:33:38,579 --> 00:33:43,199
um you know where something that was

786
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:45,058
once abundant yeah becomes Uber rare or

787
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,580
lost a Time

788
00:33:45,058 --> 00:33:49,079
like I'll say it straight up if it you

789
00:33:47,579 --> 00:33:51,480
know hopefully he pops on here this

790
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:54,000
evening but if it wasn't for CSI loving

791
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:56,038
the Urkel and breeding with it a ton

792
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,220
most people wouldn't have access to it

793
00:33:56,038 --> 00:34:02,099
yeah his prolific breeding is probably

794
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:03,720
the reason why that genetic survived

795
00:34:02,099 --> 00:34:06,778
yeah and I'm not saying he's the only

796
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:08,760
person that held it no but it but yeah

797
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:10,079
it got done I used to know I mean we're

798
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,879
not going to talk about purples very

799
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:15,000
long here tonight but like I used to

800
00:34:11,878 --> 00:34:17,338
know dozens upon dozens of Growers 15

801
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,579
years ago that ran Urkel

802
00:34:17,338 --> 00:34:22,799
and you and then Diesel and Kush gets

803
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:24,179
popular and like six people held onto it

804
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,700
yeah

805
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:28,500
literally yeah it's yeah that's how it

806
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:30,000
goes dude and it's not and and the

807
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:32,699
reason why I brought that up is because

808
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,099
that's how super skunk became almost

809
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:38,338
extinct that's how nobody can find the

810
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:40,679
the Dead Skunk Terps that's how all

811
00:34:38,338 --> 00:34:43,139
these things become rare or hoarded or

812
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:45,960
extinct is they're so common nobody

813
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:47,878
thinks they need to care to preserve it

814
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,559
and then hippies and Growers start

815
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:50,519
looking around at who's got that old

816
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:53,039
school

817
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:55,320
and they can't [ __ ] find it and a lot

818
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:57,239
of times the name game happens it'll get

819
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:00,000
a different name or you know someone

820
00:34:57,239 --> 00:35:01,259
makes seeds with it and it has a

821
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,880
different name that it carries on with

822
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:05,640
so people don't even know to look in

823
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,619
that direction for said one of these

824
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:09,900
bass lines yeah we've talked about that

825
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:12,720
before too where I love the counter

826
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:16,200
culture aspect of Americans giving weed

827
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:18,358
nicknames yeah but for lineage it's a

828
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:20,639
real pain in the ass no it's terrible

829
00:35:18,358 --> 00:35:22,440
because we take whatever the name of the

830
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:24,779
actual thing is and it gets a nickname

831
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,980
and then it goes to a different crew and

832
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,660
they give it a different [ __ ]

833
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:29,519
nickname yeah and then it goes to this

834
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:32,279
other crew and they give it a spin on

835
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:33,960
that name yeah and then 20 years goes by

836
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,839
and you're trying to trace what the hell

837
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:39,119
it is yeah playing telephone you've got

838
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:41,699
to go through four or five nicknames

839
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:45,480
back and then you get to the core thing

840
00:35:41,699 --> 00:35:48,899
and then you and then the trail goes dry

841
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:52,619
so you know I mean uh

842
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:55,260
so now after 10 or 15 years of nobody

843
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:56,700
giving a [ __ ] about Northern Lights

844
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,859
it's hot

845
00:35:56,699 --> 00:36:00,299
yeah people want to try these ancient

846
00:35:58,858 --> 00:36:03,119
things that they grew up when they were

847
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:06,000
kids reading about or these the first we

848
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,740
the first like true famous wheat yeah

849
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,800
you know they want to see what's up they

850
00:36:07,739 --> 00:36:13,858
want to see what's up with it and uh you

851
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,420
know and so now because there's interest

852
00:36:13,858 --> 00:36:16,980
now all of a sudden where there's

853
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:19,440
interest there's economy and people

854
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:21,179
start popping up with it yeah

855
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,220
all over the place and most people

856
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:25,440
probably don't know that there was two

857
00:36:23,219 --> 00:36:28,980
completely distinct cuts that were used

858
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,720
one from America and one from haunt yeah

859
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:32,579
and there was a seed line but it was

860
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:35,639
given out to nobody and then you see

861
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:39,440
stuff where I've got nl5 Pure

862
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:42,299
well how yeah lots of that right how

863
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:45,000
yeah you know

864
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:46,980
you know I mean you can you can talk you

865
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,139
can you can know that that Neville had

866
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:51,119
it pure because the guy that made it

867
00:36:49,139 --> 00:36:54,179
says I sent it to him pure along with

868
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:56,099
the rest of it yeah and Neville says I

869
00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:57,118
got it pure from dude okay they both

870
00:36:56,099 --> 00:36:59,940
agree

871
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:02,160
here's when I sent it it exists but did

872
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:05,159
you share with anybody no so everybody

873
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:07,139
has a bunch of hybrids or Canadians got

874
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:08,940
it and sold their [ __ ] and then people

875
00:37:07,139 --> 00:37:09,960
get it and it's got a name attached and

876
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,519
they're like

877
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,838
you know

878
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:15,539
um

879
00:37:12,838 --> 00:37:18,119
there it is yeah

880
00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:19,980
you know and because we're cannabis and

881
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:22,140
because all of our stories are kind of

882
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:24,659
black market or underground or

883
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:27,598
prohibitioning it gets really difficult

884
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:30,239
to to sometimes it comes down to who you

885
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,740
choose to believe yeah and that's a lot

886
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:34,618
of the time with a lot of these strains

887
00:37:31,739 --> 00:37:35,879
and so some people will get like NL and

888
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:37,680
they'll and the guy will be like I've

889
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:40,140
had this for 30 years and never left the

890
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:41,819
West Coast it's it's this yeah and

891
00:37:40,139 --> 00:37:44,400
they're like great it's this that's all

892
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:46,200
the proof I need let's start breeding

893
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,240
with it and it's this

894
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:52,199
and now it's labels all over the place

895
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:54,358
and people are buying it and is it that

896
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:58,019
one thing one thing I also noticed was

897
00:37:54,358 --> 00:38:00,420
that during the philos era a lot of

898
00:37:58,019 --> 00:38:02,280
people would get said cologne that they

899
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:05,039
got with dubious

900
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:06,180
Heritage or whatever they submit it to

901
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:10,259
philos

902
00:38:06,179 --> 00:38:13,019
and by doing so say that philos verified

903
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:14,940
their clone as legitimate you know God

904
00:38:13,019 --> 00:38:16,440
yeah yeah that happened that started

905
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:19,320
happening a lot too and that was a real

906
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:20,780
problem because and as we learned

907
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:23,280
um

908
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:26,099
yeah philos couldn't

909
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:28,760
tell people any kind of plant relation

910
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:32,280
with any consistency

911
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:34,740
that maybe we should say this about CSI

912
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:38,460
is that it doesn't matter what it is but

913
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:41,459
CSI sent in fi this is how Matt myself

914
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:43,858
and CSI discovered that philos was

915
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:45,599
really really really full of it

916
00:38:43,858 --> 00:38:48,000
um we had some evidence before but this

917
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:50,820
was kind of one of the big kickers was

918
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:54,300
that uh CSI had made a cross

919
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:55,740
uh and he sent in both parents and I

920
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:58,500
don't know if he wants this story out so

921
00:38:55,739 --> 00:38:59,819
much no yeah well I'll shut up about it

922
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:02,579
then I didn't even mention what it was

923
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:05,280
but I'll just say this we we discovered

924
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:07,380
that their genetic sequencing wasn't as

925
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,760
strong as we would have hoped yeah yeah

926
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:11,039
it was it was definitely disappointing

927
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:13,020
with the consistency of it

928
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:14,960
you know and so people thought that

929
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:16,980
their genetic testing was like American

930
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,139
genetic testing

931
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:20,940
yeah where you can have 23 and me or

932
00:39:19,139 --> 00:39:22,618
some [ __ ] and be like oh my God I'm five

933
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:25,019
percent Norwegian

934
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:26,640
and you know Grandpa was from Germany

935
00:39:25,019 --> 00:39:28,920
and this guy and I'm like and I'm part

936
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:31,618
African or whatever yeah and we were

937
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:33,480
hoping that same kind of accuracy would

938
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:37,380
be transferred into wheat

939
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:40,199
yeah and I'm trying to move Caleb in

940
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:42,960
oh we'll see Caleb click the thing and

941
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:44,879
save request to join if you can if you

942
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,099
if you see how to do that

943
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:51,358
hit the request to join button so I can

944
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:53,039
uh add you in when you got time

945
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:56,098
all right go ahead

946
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:57,659
yeah so I mean it it um and you know in

947
00:39:56,099 --> 00:39:59,820
order the other the other thing about it

948
00:39:57,659 --> 00:40:02,759
is is for like talking about human

949
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:05,640
genetics is geneticists can go to like a

950
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:07,920
pure Norwegian or a pure Japanese or a

951
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:11,338
pure Chinese whatever and they can start

952
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,480
comparing DNA yeah and seeing these

953
00:40:11,338 --> 00:40:15,420
different things and they know how to

954
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:18,300
sequence it it would be amazing if DNA

955
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:23,700
evidence had existed in Holland in the

956
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:25,740
80s yeah and Neville and and sssc and

957
00:40:23,699 --> 00:40:27,659
and Scentsy in these early groups would

958
00:40:25,739 --> 00:40:29,519
have been able to like put down markers

959
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:31,980
of what was what

960
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:33,539
yeah and then we could have seen their

961
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:35,820
descendants because you'd have something

962
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:37,019
to compare it to

963
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:39,119
yeah

964
00:40:37,019 --> 00:40:41,759
but that's not always the case that's

965
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:45,780
not always the case so fortunately you

966
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:48,500
know uh so it remains a dream because

967
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:48,500
here he is

968
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:55,560
sir your lighting is terrible but if you

969
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,300
just you look like you look like you're

970
00:40:55,559 --> 00:40:59,940
on 60 Minutes and you're one of those

971
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:02,039
like grayed out you know like guys under

972
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:04,079
the witness protection program it's too

973
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:06,599
bright in here it's too bright in there

974
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:08,760
yeah you can always see your face too

975
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:12,320
bright yeah yeah

976
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,320
I ain't trying to you know

977
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:18,839
oh you look beautiful I thank you thank

978
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:21,480
you so maybe I talk a lot so maybe I'll

979
00:41:18,838 --> 00:41:22,980
do like an introduction uh not the ones

980
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:25,440
needed and then I'll shut up and get out

981
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:27,539
of the way so part of the reason why we

982
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,539
did we TR we decided to do this

983
00:41:27,539 --> 00:41:32,039
selection tonight was because it Blends

984
00:41:29,539 --> 00:41:34,039
uh something that's currently going on

985
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:37,380
with something that's extremely famous

986
00:41:34,039 --> 00:41:38,460
and uh has a bunch of History to it so I

987
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:41,700
just spent a whole bunch of time

988
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:43,800
chatting about the history of it and the

989
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:46,739
simple and maybe like you know mellow

990
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:49,320
way to talk about it is that uh in in

991
00:41:46,739 --> 00:41:52,139
our search of History we started getting

992
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:55,079
in contact with some of these uh

993
00:41:52,139 --> 00:41:58,199
original Northern Lights crew people and

994
00:41:55,079 --> 00:42:00,839
hearing their story and as part of that

995
00:41:58,199 --> 00:42:05,399
uh we got we got some seats

996
00:42:00,838 --> 00:42:09,299
mm-hmm uh Matt got some seeds and then

997
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:13,019
um Matt uh and and Caleb here uh decided

998
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:14,880
to collaborate on it uh and and Caleb

999
00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:17,820
donated some space and some time and

1000
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:20,400
some energy and they uh did a bunch of

1001
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:22,920
stuff uh both growing out Fino's looking

1002
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:26,460
within the line making hybrids and all

1003
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:28,440
that and so uh I was I was involved as

1004
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:31,260
much as listening to them talk about it

1005
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:34,619
so I'll shut up and turn it over to them

1006
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:38,099
because uh they are about to offer up

1007
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:40,079
some seeds of what they have going on uh

1008
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:42,780
and it might be you know some of the

1009
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:44,160
first real NL to come on the market in a

1010
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:46,019
while

1011
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:47,759
um so Matt and Caleb why don't you chat

1012
00:42:46,019 --> 00:42:50,300
about what you found and what you saw

1013
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:53,220
and what interested you and

1014
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:55,560
well first things first you know I'm you

1015
00:42:53,219 --> 00:42:57,118
know when I posted up on IG you know

1016
00:42:55,559 --> 00:42:59,519
there's there's a few people who are

1017
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:02,460
like you know what did what did Matt

1018
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:04,920
have to do with any of this you know and

1019
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:06,838
fair question I wouldn't even be growing

1020
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:08,880
these seeds if Matt hadn't uh you know

1021
00:43:06,838 --> 00:43:11,539
had all that dialogue with you know

1022
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,519
mystery man

1023
00:43:11,539 --> 00:43:16,318
and you know he he's the one who you

1024
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:19,500
know put all that together he's the one

1025
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:21,358
who sourced these seeds essentially so I

1026
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:24,679
wouldn't be growing nothing without Matt

1027
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:27,179
you know making that first step so yeah

1028
00:43:24,679 --> 00:43:30,179
maybe maybe I'll throw in one more thing

1029
00:43:27,179 --> 00:43:32,539
so everyone knows when you know breeders

1030
00:43:30,179 --> 00:43:35,219
like us get together it's super common

1031
00:43:32,539 --> 00:43:37,980
for some breeding to be a collaborative

1032
00:43:35,219 --> 00:43:40,919
process right right this guy's got some

1033
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:43,139
seeds you know they both have an idea

1034
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:44,760
this other person has some room that

1035
00:43:43,139 --> 00:43:46,858
they're willing to put towards the idea

1036
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:50,220
or a greenhouse or some indoor space

1037
00:43:46,858 --> 00:43:52,400
they come up with a plan and you breed

1038
00:43:50,219 --> 00:43:52,399
together

1039
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:58,799
of the transaction but but every but

1040
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:00,960
everybody everybody you know lots lots

1041
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,760
of friends who are breeders kind of

1042
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,280
collaborate on little things like that

1043
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:06,900
all the time

1044
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:09,300
it's super common just so people just so

1045
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:10,019
people know so you know

1046
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:13,500
um

1047
00:44:10,019 --> 00:44:17,338
you know Matt had the seeds uh you know

1048
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:20,579
CSI had the space and skill you know and

1049
00:44:17,338 --> 00:44:22,380
skill and you know and ability uh we all

1050
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:24,720
have the interest and the history behind

1051
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:26,880
it and really wanted to see what was in

1052
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:30,118
there and so it you know the project

1053
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:32,338
happened right and uh you know some

1054
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:35,400
people know some people don't the very

1055
00:44:32,338 --> 00:44:37,380
first you know clone I ever grew came

1056
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:41,039
from my dad and that was Northern Lights

1057
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:42,300
back in 1994. you know so that's about

1058
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:44,639
that one dude

1059
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:47,099
I mean you know you can remember

1060
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:51,659
I mean I rocked it on and off until

1061
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:54,420
about 2002 when I lost it and uh it was

1062
00:44:51,659 --> 00:44:57,059
a Cola plant super Frosty a decent

1063
00:44:54,420 --> 00:45:00,300
density you know not not like rock hard

1064
00:44:57,059 --> 00:45:03,480
Girl Scout cookies or anything

1065
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:07,380
I I describe the nose but I'm absolutely

1066
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:09,780
horrible at scribing you know the smells

1067
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:12,780
so when people ask I'm like it smells

1068
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:15,660
good I don't know but that's not my

1069
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:17,640
forte I I'm more of a visual you know oh

1070
00:45:15,659 --> 00:45:19,440
it looks like this you know similar to

1071
00:45:17,639 --> 00:45:21,900
this in the looks Department blah blah

1072
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:25,260
blah you know other than you know it

1073
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:30,240
smells great or whatever whatever if I'm

1074
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:30,240
not the dude for for the sniffer yeah

1075
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:36,960
um but yeah yeah okay I mean

1076
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:38,940
when you lost it was it something you

1077
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:41,519
kept looking for like when you when

1078
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:43,740
you're picking up clones oh yeah oh yeah

1079
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:46,139
yeah no it was one of the things that

1080
00:45:43,739 --> 00:45:48,838
you know uh family and friends you know

1081
00:45:46,139 --> 00:45:51,239
all had it and then you know I lost it

1082
00:45:48,838 --> 00:45:53,279
and I went looking and nobody had it

1083
00:45:51,239 --> 00:45:56,759
everybody lost it you know that's how it

1084
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:59,180
goes yeah but some people are asking if

1085
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,180
it purple

1086
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:07,980
not the one I got from my dad

1087
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:10,858
um I don't I don't really recall it even

1088
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:14,760
remotely having any type of purple to it

1089
00:46:10,858 --> 00:46:18,659
at all yeah and and these these you know

1090
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:21,300
nl5 seats that you know I just ran there

1091
00:46:18,659 --> 00:46:25,618
was very very little if any you know

1092
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:26,700
actual purple to any of them so yeah you

1093
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:29,099
know

1094
00:46:26,699 --> 00:46:30,960
um but then again uh sometimes when

1095
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:33,660
you're making seed uh

1096
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:36,659
you know the purple traits kind of kind

1097
00:46:33,659 --> 00:46:38,399
of tend to take a back seat yeah a lot

1098
00:46:36,659 --> 00:46:40,799
of a lot of purple things will be

1099
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,660
halfway green you know or all the way

1100
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:45,240
green you know

1101
00:46:42,659 --> 00:46:47,039
when they're making seeds so I mean

1102
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:49,439
Mendo purple does that you know where

1103
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:51,539
it's you know more green than purple

1104
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:54,300
even under cool temperatures and

1105
00:46:51,539 --> 00:46:56,759
everything when it's full of seeds yeah

1106
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:58,560
you know so

1107
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:00,960
um but uh I think the plants have

1108
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:02,699
different uh processes when they're

1109
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:07,019
pregnanted versus not

1110
00:47:02,699 --> 00:47:08,639
right right you know they they do they

1111
00:47:07,019 --> 00:47:11,759
do very different things their their

1112
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:13,980
goal is different at the time and and I

1113
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,500
didn't even think about this but I'm I'm

1114
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:19,079
feeding seeded out plants you know

1115
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,699
nitrogen [ __ ] all the way through yeah

1116
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:22,800
yeah I'm not trying to cut off their

1117
00:47:20,699 --> 00:47:25,799
Nitro Source you know early like it

1118
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:29,039
would a flower so yeah the goal is is

1119
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:30,859
healthy mature seeds not attractive

1120
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:34,440
flour

1121
00:47:30,858 --> 00:47:35,639
is just the carrier for the seed so it's

1122
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:38,400
very different it's a very different

1123
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:40,618
feeding regimen to get where you want to

1124
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:42,660
go and flower

1125
00:47:40,619 --> 00:47:45,900
which is why when you have a failed run

1126
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:49,078
and a bunch of flour and no seed that

1127
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:50,700
smoke ain't the best yeah right and he

1128
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:52,740
already said it maybe maybe I should

1129
00:47:50,699 --> 00:47:54,719
mention something is that uh you know

1130
00:47:52,739 --> 00:47:56,338
CSI has actually you know he has some

1131
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:58,078
pictures of some of these old Gardens

1132
00:47:56,338 --> 00:48:00,119
and stuff like that

1133
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:02,099
um but unfortunately since it was all

1134
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:05,220
prohibitiony back then

1135
00:48:02,099 --> 00:48:07,260
um they were on Polaroids and uh you

1136
00:48:05,219 --> 00:48:08,598
learn with Polaroids that they fade over

1137
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:11,880
time

1138
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:14,039
you know so uh they become the the

1139
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:16,800
colors start to become washed out the

1140
00:48:14,039 --> 00:48:19,980
edges start to become less distinct yeah

1141
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:21,839
so you know he cataloged some of it and

1142
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:23,699
uh you know you can you can get a

1143
00:48:21,838 --> 00:48:26,639
general idea but it's not the sharpest

1144
00:48:23,699 --> 00:48:29,039
of picks right I I have thousands of

1145
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:33,000
these Polaroids you know for you know

1146
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:35,300
the better part of a decade and now

1147
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:38,818
now they're uh

1148
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:41,280
not much to look at yeah that's a bummer

1149
00:48:38,818 --> 00:48:42,900
dude that's such a bummer right right

1150
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:46,619
it's just something you didn't know at

1151
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:50,099
the time who knew that over 15 20 25

1152
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:52,858
years Polaroids would would fade right a

1153
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:55,079
regular picture developed at a you know

1154
00:48:52,858 --> 00:48:58,019
you know old school style will stay good

1155
00:48:55,079 --> 00:49:00,539
for a long time right yeah Polaroids

1156
00:48:58,019 --> 00:49:02,818
don't you know I should have scanned

1157
00:49:00,539 --> 00:49:05,400
them all while I had the chance

1158
00:49:02,818 --> 00:49:06,838
yeah I mean you know we all should have

1159
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,420
done things differently when we were

1160
00:49:06,838 --> 00:49:12,960
younger yeah you know that's the common

1161
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:15,539
theme right right your camera slowly but

1162
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,400
surely burning out bro well you know so

1163
00:49:15,539 --> 00:49:19,440
the best thing is is I was having I was

1164
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:22,440
having a conversation with with uh our

1165
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,179
buddy pip uh who is gonna drop some

1166
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:25,920
seeds soon and he might come on here and

1167
00:49:24,179 --> 00:49:27,358
chat with Matt and I but he didn't

1168
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,280
really want to show his face so I'm

1169
00:49:27,358 --> 00:49:32,900
definitely going to show him this CSI

1170
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,900
Tech yeah right here

1171
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:39,420
because it's exactly what he's looking

1172
00:49:35,699 --> 00:49:41,639
for right a disembodied voice coming out

1173
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:43,680
of coming out of the darkness isn't that

1174
00:49:41,639 --> 00:49:46,379
how they always used to do yeah right

1175
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:47,239
this is Barry 60 Minutes in the 90s you

1176
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:50,460
know

1177
00:49:47,239 --> 00:49:52,919
now I just need the voice Tech yeah you

1178
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:54,599
need that voice Tech

1179
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,940
yeah yeah

1180
00:49:54,599 --> 00:49:59,039
um tell us what you saw man tell it tell

1181
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:00,300

1182
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:04,019
yeah

1183
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:05,579
the the the seeds that Wright and I have

1184
00:50:04,019 --> 00:50:09,719
available

1185
00:50:05,579 --> 00:50:15,359
um are basically an open pollination uh

1186
00:50:09,719 --> 00:50:17,039
from 47 plants 27 females 20 males just

1187
00:50:15,358 --> 00:50:19,980
open pollinated

1188
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:21,480
and uh you know there was there was

1189
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:22,199
definitely good Bad and the Ugly in

1190
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:25,380
there

1191
00:50:22,199 --> 00:50:27,358
um there was one plant that was near

1192
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:30,838
identical to the Northern Light I grew

1193
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:33,059
you know from 94 on from my dad

1194
00:50:30,838 --> 00:50:36,358
um smelled like it looked extremely

1195
00:50:33,059 --> 00:50:37,318
similar to it you know all of that

1196
00:50:36,358 --> 00:50:39,960
um

1197
00:50:37,318 --> 00:50:42,239
and you know I I had a one of my good

1198
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:44,880
old old buddies from you know

1199
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:46,799
from that area you know uh

1200
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,838
you know check checking things out with

1201
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,460
me as it was progressing and he was like

1202
00:50:48,838 --> 00:50:53,460
yeah that's that's just like the plant

1203
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:56,400
we we used to rock you know 25 years ago

1204
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:57,420
so that's wild that that's definitely a

1205
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,940
good sign

1206
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:02,639
um there was a lot of variety in there

1207
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:04,800
um one of my favorites of course uh was

1208
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:07,139
this one that was super Frosty kind of a

1209
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,400
popcorn nugget thing a really good

1210
00:51:07,139 --> 00:51:10,078
stretch

1211
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:13,500
um and it was kind of bubble gummy

1212
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:15,359
that's how I you know describe it but I

1213
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:16,199
don't know maybe other people would you

1214
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:18,719
know

1215
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:20,759
just describe the smell different

1216
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:22,858
um but it was really nice and we're

1217
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:24,900
definitely saving that one and then the

1218
00:51:22,858 --> 00:51:27,480
one that was

1219
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:32,280
um I just have written down a stinky as

1220
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:35,099
[ __ ] but it it's it had like 10

1221
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:38,460
different smells you know top middle

1222
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:40,019
bottom and I I can't describe that kind

1223
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:41,760
of stuff but you know there's there's

1224
00:51:40,019 --> 00:51:43,559
guys with noses who are like oh yeah

1225
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,480
that's blah blah blah blah blah blah

1226
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:48,660
blah you know and lift 20 different

1227
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:50,159
smells on something but all I know is it

1228
00:51:48,659 --> 00:51:53,039
smelled amazing too

1229
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:54,838
um yeah and that one uh that one's

1230
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:58,558
definitely a keeper and then there were

1231
00:51:54,838 --> 00:52:01,558
some other ones that you know ranged uh

1232
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:03,420
you know this way and that way and you

1233
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:05,460
know might might end up being Keepers

1234
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:08,700
might not definitely gonna give them a

1235
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:10,260
couple few runs to decide on which ones

1236
00:52:08,699 --> 00:52:12,960
are going to kind of make the cut for

1237
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:15,300
future projects you know

1238
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:17,760
so that that's what I'm stoked about is

1239
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:19,859
that we get to see them as clones not

1240
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:22,079
just see seed moms you know but as

1241
00:52:19,858 --> 00:52:24,598
clones and they have clones of every

1242
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:26,880
single one it's it's pretty expansive

1243
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:30,119
and it was a it was a cool it was cool

1244
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:31,858
fit and I know you know he he he credits

1245
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:33,838
me with getting the seats and stuff but

1246
00:52:31,858 --> 00:52:36,779
it was it was really cool to be able to

1247
00:52:33,838 --> 00:52:40,199
to look inside

1248
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:42,359
uh csi's mindset as he did these

1249
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:44,338
selections what he was looking for how

1250
00:52:42,358 --> 00:52:46,318
he went about it how many clones he was

1251
00:52:44,338 --> 00:52:49,139
keeping of each I learned a lot I

1252
00:52:46,318 --> 00:52:51,539
learned a lot from dude during this so

1253
00:52:49,139 --> 00:52:53,460
um he put in the work no matter what he

1254
00:52:51,539 --> 00:52:55,739
says he put in the [ __ ] work on this

1255
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:57,720
stuff right

1256
00:52:55,739 --> 00:53:00,000
yeah maybe maybe I should add something

1257
00:52:57,719 --> 00:53:04,078
in where Caleb and I chat a bunch about

1258
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:05,760
like you know Fino's he's found in seed

1259
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:07,859
lines before

1260
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:09,900
um that didn't survive like you know the

1261
00:53:07,858 --> 00:53:11,460
the backup clone didn't survive and he

1262
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:13,800
lost it and he's like well you know I

1263
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:14,760
got x amount of these seeds I can find

1264
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:18,480
it again

1265
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:21,059
so uh maybe you know how excited were

1266
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:23,159
you dude to find something that was

1267
00:53:21,059 --> 00:53:25,940
pretty close to the spitting image of

1268
00:53:23,159 --> 00:53:25,940
your lost plan

1269
00:53:26,039 --> 00:53:28,739
I was stoked on it

1270
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:32,400
um

1271
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:34,139
but you know uh I was all honestly more

1272
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:37,139
excited with some of these other ones

1273
00:53:34,139 --> 00:53:38,179
that you know because you know back in

1274
00:53:37,139 --> 00:53:41,578
94

1275
00:53:38,179 --> 00:53:44,519
the the reality is you know

1276
00:53:41,579 --> 00:53:46,619
um it's just a traded clone you have no

1277
00:53:44,519 --> 00:53:48,420
idea you know where it came from how

1278
00:53:46,619 --> 00:53:50,760
many speeds it got selected from you

1279
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:52,440
know anything about it you know and

1280
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:54,780
that's the thing with traded clones is

1281
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:58,200
you know it might be selected from one

1282
00:53:54,780 --> 00:54:00,059
or four or ten or a hundred you know

1283
00:53:58,199 --> 00:54:02,279
um I just like you know having the

1284
00:54:00,059 --> 00:54:05,040
opportunity to actually select from

1285
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:07,619
better than one yeah for sure I think

1286
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:10,380
too that like there are things for all

1287
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:12,599
of us now that we're all older where

1288
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:15,358
some of the strains that you grow first

1289
00:54:12,599 --> 00:54:18,300
and you build your first relationships

1290
00:54:15,358 --> 00:54:21,299
with as a grower right in your mind

1291
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:24,240
because you're learning so much then and

1292
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:26,099
this is your kind bud plant right right

1293
00:54:24,239 --> 00:54:28,500
you know and they really stick with you

1294
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:31,140
those and you know you think back like

1295
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:33,059
oh what could I have done uh with that

1296
00:54:31,139 --> 00:54:36,000
plant when I actually had some some

1297
00:54:33,059 --> 00:54:38,160
knowledge when I had that plant I was an

1298
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,500
idiot you know I was 19 or something and

1299
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:41,818
I Didn't Know Jack and now I'm like you

1300
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:43,920
know what could I do if I had it now

1301
00:54:41,818 --> 00:54:47,460
right right

1302
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:49,200
yeah yeah yeah yeah no I'm I'm a little

1303
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:51,659
interested too and I know this is an NL

1304
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:53,098
talk but are you do you want to talk

1305
00:54:51,659 --> 00:54:54,358
about any of the pinks and perf stuff

1306
00:54:53,099 --> 00:54:56,880
you're singing too since that's a big

1307
00:54:54,358 --> 00:54:59,039
project you have going on right now

1308
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:02,700
oh we could touch on it just a little

1309
00:54:59,039 --> 00:55:06,539
bit yeah yeah you know uh um had me

1310
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:08,639
amped yeah I'm definitely gonna uh you

1311
00:55:06,539 --> 00:55:10,259
know try to post up a little bit more on

1312
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:13,078
that soon

1313
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:15,660
just because uh there's there's some

1314
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:18,599
interesting stuff in in there

1315
00:55:15,659 --> 00:55:20,480
um and uh yeah that one keeper I was

1316
00:55:18,599 --> 00:55:25,318
telling you about uh

1317
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:29,460
it smells better than 99 of wheat I've

1318
00:55:25,318 --> 00:55:31,440
come across so that's wild you know

1319
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:34,740
um definitely it's not a purple Fino

1320
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:37,920
pure green you know no purple traits to

1321
00:55:34,739 --> 00:55:41,639
it whatsoever but man the smell is just

1322
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:43,500
so overpowering uh I I think it could be

1323
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:45,420
a passed around the keeper as long as

1324
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:48,318
it's over five percent THC of course

1325
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:50,400
yeah for sure

1326
00:55:48,318 --> 00:55:53,699
we should mention that some of the

1327
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:55,980
terpiest things tend to be lower THC

1328
00:55:53,699 --> 00:55:58,259
right right there's a ratio there's a

1329
00:55:55,980 --> 00:56:00,960
there's a there's a ratio there that's

1330
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:03,119
not fully understood but a lot of times

1331
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:06,780
things that are extremely human

1332
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:08,519
perception terpy don't tend to be the

1333
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:11,099
most potent there are things out there

1334
00:56:08,519 --> 00:56:14,099
that have both but uh a lot of them

1335
00:56:11,099 --> 00:56:17,039
don't so we'll see and uh

1336
00:56:14,099 --> 00:56:20,039
have I told you much or anything about

1337
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:23,219
this uh this pinks and purpose plant

1338
00:56:20,039 --> 00:56:25,440
uh uh I I heard it through your conver

1339
00:56:23,219 --> 00:56:27,838
you and Matt chatted about it and he

1340
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:29,818
called me all excited yeah yeah because

1341
00:56:27,838 --> 00:56:32,219
it's rare that you sound not excited

1342
00:56:29,818 --> 00:56:34,558
yeah something that you found so he was

1343
00:56:32,219 --> 00:56:37,199
I'd never hear him overstate anything

1344
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:40,019
about anything dude pops thousands of

1345
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:42,419
seeds so when he tells me dude like this

1346
00:56:40,019 --> 00:56:44,519
is special like yeah I mean I think I

1347
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:47,039
think homie told me something like he he

1348
00:56:44,519 --> 00:56:51,300
thinks it might be like the best Fino

1349
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:54,239
he's found yeah which for someone like

1350
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:56,099
you to say who pops literally like

1351
00:56:54,239 --> 00:56:58,078
thousands of seeds over a number of

1352
00:56:56,099 --> 00:57:00,420
years and searches through them that's

1353
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:03,300
really something oh yeah you know

1354
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:05,519
and it really is I I like to give to

1355
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:07,680
give credit to you know uh what what

1356
00:57:05,519 --> 00:57:10,739
plants you know kind of produce these

1357
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:13,259
kind of things yeah and uh

1358
00:57:10,739 --> 00:57:15,419
uh this particular plant you know it has

1359
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:17,280
Mendo purple in its background but

1360
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:20,940
there's no purple traits to this plant

1361
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:23,400
at all but Mendo purple has this strong

1362
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:26,159
uh mango

1363
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:28,920
um trait that pops up in the ones and

1364
00:57:26,159 --> 00:57:32,639
this thing is that mango times a hundred

1365
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:36,960
you know it's it's just the strongest

1366
00:57:32,639 --> 00:57:39,779
mango I've ever smelled wow you know as

1367
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:42,300
you know and a bunch more fruit too but

1368
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:44,519
uh you know I know it gets that mango

1369
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:49,079
you know at least you know a portion of

1370
00:57:44,519 --> 00:57:51,358
it from from the Mendo perks so you know

1371
00:57:49,079 --> 00:57:54,660
could be cool as long as I don't lose

1372
00:57:51,358 --> 00:57:56,159
the Clone ganja boners yeah I mean one

1373
00:57:54,659 --> 00:57:58,500
one of the things that the Mendo P

1374
00:57:56,159 --> 00:58:00,779
certainly has is it's got pretty wide

1375
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:03,838
genetic diversity so there's a lot of

1376
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:05,280
Terps in there right right and so then

1377
00:58:03,838 --> 00:58:07,558
you throw it on something else that's

1378
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:10,200
also terpy and maybe wide and you can

1379
00:58:07,559 --> 00:58:12,599
get these unusual things that have a

1380
00:58:10,199 --> 00:58:14,399
potential to pop up right I mean that's

1381
00:58:12,599 --> 00:58:16,440
kind of like people should know this too

1382
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:18,539
and maybe I should say it right now

1383
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:22,679
where it's like if you cross something

1384
00:58:18,539 --> 00:58:24,719
to like that uh you know to but to I

1385
00:58:22,679 --> 00:58:26,639
don't know to deep chunk

1386
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:29,219
you're going to get a lot of deep chunk

1387
00:58:26,639 --> 00:58:31,019
and it's going to be really consistent

1388
00:58:29,219 --> 00:58:33,118
you know and there's certain things you

1389
00:58:31,019 --> 00:58:36,179
throw certain things on cookies and it

1390
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:38,700
looks very cooky right and so people get

1391
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:40,318
frustrated when you cross two very wide

1392
00:58:38,699 --> 00:58:41,939
things because you can get a bunch of

1393
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:44,639
junk and you can get a bunch of this and

1394
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:46,019
that and it's all like unpredictable oh

1395
00:58:44,639 --> 00:58:48,298
yeah but then every once in a while

1396
00:58:46,019 --> 00:58:50,460
amongst all that stuff there's this gem

1397
00:58:48,298 --> 00:58:52,259
because it's so wide and unpredictable

1398
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:54,900
and you're like oh whoa

1399
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:56,880
what is that thing right right so

1400
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:57,960
sometimes the frustration and the effort

1401
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,960
pays off

1402
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:03,420
because a really wide base of things to

1403
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:05,699
look through and maybe I should say this

1404
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:06,900
too is when you know when Caleb was

1405
00:59:05,699 --> 00:59:09,019
referencing when he did the open

1406
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:12,358
pollination that there was some gems

1407
00:59:09,019 --> 00:59:15,780
some mids some junk

1408
00:59:12,358 --> 00:59:18,960
that's 90s wheat if you have a wide

1409
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:22,980
genetic base you're gonna get

1410
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:26,280
amazing mid Z junk they're all in combo

1411
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:28,858
and also uh on that pinks and perps one

1412
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:31,079
uh you know I I was I was I always

1413
00:59:28,858 --> 00:59:31,920
forget this but

1414
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:35,460
um

1415
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:38,159
I I grew up when I I made those and

1416
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:40,500
found that one I was growing out 180 of

1417
00:59:38,159 --> 00:59:44,519
those things so there was only one like

1418
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:46,318
it out of 180 yeah you know so I wonder

1419
00:59:44,519 --> 00:59:47,579
how it's gonna breed because it was such

1420
00:59:46,318 --> 00:59:51,179
an outlier

1421
00:59:47,579 --> 00:59:52,920
right were there other other fenos that

1422
00:59:51,179 --> 00:59:55,318
were more consistent and like popping up

1423
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:58,920
more often oh yeah the the the the

1424
00:59:55,318 --> 01:00:01,980
purple ones were predominant you know to

1425
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:04,619
find an actual green one in in this

1426
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:07,079
hybrid was actually the Rarity you know

1427
01:00:04,619 --> 01:00:09,599
most most everything was you know some

1428
01:00:07,079 --> 01:00:11,460
form of light pink or lavender you know

1429
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:14,760
all the way through you know purple to

1430
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:17,639
almost black yeah you know but uh yeah

1431
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:19,680
the the green ones were were rare you

1432
01:00:17,639 --> 01:00:21,779
know and and I I probably kept out of

1433
01:00:19,679 --> 01:00:25,500
the 180 I probably kept about 20 or so

1434
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:28,559
of the of the darker purple ones and

1435
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:31,679
just the real terpier ones the you know

1436
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:34,200
but they're all I don't think I I have

1437
01:00:31,679 --> 01:00:36,659
any other uh green ones out of the whole

1438
01:00:34,199 --> 01:00:39,779
all all the purples and the blacks

1439
01:00:36,659 --> 01:00:41,879
that's wild man yeah that it was so

1440
01:00:39,780 --> 01:00:46,019
consistently that and then this one pops

1441
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:47,700
up right so and so maybe I should throw

1442
01:00:46,019 --> 01:00:50,400
this out there just real quick before we

1443
01:00:47,699 --> 01:00:52,199
totally lose the thread on it is on some

1444
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:54,660
of these ones that you found that that

1445
01:00:52,199 --> 01:00:56,338
the one that's super Frosty and smells

1446
01:00:54,659 --> 01:00:58,558
to you like bubble gum and the one that

1447
01:00:56,338 --> 01:01:01,558
kind of reminds you strongly of your dad

1448
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:03,420
dad's dad's NL and such

1449
01:01:01,559 --> 01:01:05,700
um you're probably planning on doing

1450
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:07,980
some more breeding with those select

1451
01:01:05,699 --> 01:01:11,338
females correct oh yeah I'm already

1452
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:13,019
working on that too uh so the the first

1453
01:01:11,338 --> 01:01:14,940
round of course was the open pollination

1454
01:01:13,019 --> 01:01:17,880
and now

1455
01:01:14,940 --> 01:01:20,818
um I have uh a room that's a couple few

1456
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:24,720
weeks into flower and that's all the

1457
01:01:20,818 --> 01:01:26,058
keeper females and my keeper male my

1458
01:01:24,719 --> 01:01:28,139
favorite male out of the whole bunch

1459
01:01:26,059 --> 01:01:30,420
which is

1460
01:01:28,139 --> 01:01:33,719
um I don't know it's like almost a milk

1461
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:36,838
chocolatey smelling male and he's super

1462
01:01:33,719 --> 01:01:40,199
pungent and he almost looks like a

1463
01:01:36,838 --> 01:01:43,019
bigger uh version of purple indica

1464
01:01:40,199 --> 01:01:45,419
you know that was that's a throwback

1465
01:01:43,019 --> 01:01:48,960
from the same you know Washington areas

1466
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:50,220
these seeds came from you know so you

1467
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:53,280
know there's there's something to that

1468
01:01:50,219 --> 01:01:55,379
and uh like I've told uh

1469
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:57,540
um told Matt I'm not sure if I I told

1470
01:01:55,380 --> 01:02:00,720
you not so but uh

1471
01:01:57,539 --> 01:02:02,099
um when the the Northern Lights I used

1472
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:04,019
to have

1473
01:02:02,099 --> 01:02:07,019
um you know occasionally I'd throw a

1474
01:02:04,019 --> 01:02:10,619
late Nana or whatever whatever and I

1475
01:02:07,019 --> 01:02:12,719
grew out a bunch of S1 seeds well I gave

1476
01:02:10,619 --> 01:02:15,599
you know some of these s1s to my buddy

1477
01:02:12,719 --> 01:02:17,939
you know uh clones of the S ones anyway

1478
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:20,760
and uh

1479
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:23,760
um he uh accidentally crossed it to

1480
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:26,460
train wreck and

1481
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:28,980
when that stuff was grown out it had

1482
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:30,960
that same chocolateiness that I'm

1483
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:33,539
smelling in this thing you know when

1484
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:35,880
grown Outdoors so

1485
01:02:33,539 --> 01:02:40,400
I don't know if it's just coincidence or

1486
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:43,798
or what but you know it it could just be

1487
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:46,380
same same similar genetics the power of

1488
01:02:43,798 --> 01:02:48,960
accidents

1489
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:52,200
the power of accidents so maybe I should

1490
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:54,838
throw this in there too so if with with

1491
01:02:52,199 --> 01:02:57,480
the these seeds that uh Matt and Caleb

1492
01:02:54,838 --> 01:03:00,119
are offering up this open pollination uh

1493
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:01,559
what that's going to give you is you

1494
01:03:00,119 --> 01:03:03,960
know that's going to give you your own

1495
01:03:01,559 --> 01:03:06,000
ability to hunt through the line and

1496
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:08,760
it's going to be very wide

1497
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:11,400
you know but you could find gems just

1498
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:13,920
like he found yeah uh you could you

1499
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:15,000
could absolutely perhaps find one you

1500
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,858
wouldn't know that it looked you know

1501
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,358
there could be bubble gum smelling ones

1502
01:03:16,858 --> 01:03:20,400
there could be this ones there could be

1503
01:03:18,358 --> 01:03:22,739
there's a reasonably good chance that

1504
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,460
somewhere in there those phenos pop up

1505
01:03:22,739 --> 01:03:26,699
again

1506
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:28,858
and then give them x amount of months to

1507
01:03:26,699 --> 01:03:31,078
do some more breeding and we'll get the

1508
01:03:28,858 --> 01:03:33,358
chance to see if some of these selected

1509
01:03:31,079 --> 01:03:36,180
females breed true for the traits that

1510
01:03:33,358 --> 01:03:38,578
he liked because those will be on offer

1511
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:40,739
too so that's kind of like for people

1512
01:03:38,579 --> 01:03:43,079
that don't know that's kind of like when

1513
01:03:40,739 --> 01:03:45,298
you get old seeds or seeds that you want

1514
01:03:43,079 --> 01:03:47,220
to preserve one of the best things to do

1515
01:03:45,298 --> 01:03:49,259
to keep the genetic diversity of the

1516
01:03:47,219 --> 01:03:53,219
line is just to open pollinate

1517
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:55,859
everything right and then you know you

1518
01:03:53,219 --> 01:03:57,779
can set aside you know some seeds from

1519
01:03:55,858 --> 01:04:00,058
selected phinos and you can keep certain

1520
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:01,440
phenols and start breeding with them and

1521
01:04:00,059 --> 01:04:03,960
intentionally

1522
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:05,280
and seeing where it takes you so that's

1523
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:07,679
kind of like the that's one of the

1524
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:09,720
processes of

1525
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:11,578
um taking old seeds and trying to both

1526
01:04:09,719 --> 01:04:14,058
preserve the line but then take it in

1527
01:04:11,579 --> 01:04:14,059
certain directions

1528
01:04:15,619 --> 01:04:20,400
and you've done that a number of times

1529
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:22,859
with like various heirloom strains that

1530
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:25,920
you've come across you know always open

1531
01:04:22,858 --> 01:04:28,199
pollinate step one and then you know you

1532
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:29,700
can do whatever you want past that you

1533
01:04:28,199 --> 01:04:30,838
know directional this way that way or

1534
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:33,598
the other

1535
01:04:30,838 --> 01:04:35,159
you know and everybody else can too as

1536
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:38,780
long as you know you share the seed and

1537
01:04:35,159 --> 01:04:40,920
all that you know yeah

1538
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:43,260
are there any other projects you're

1539
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:44,940
super stoked about past that like any

1540
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:46,740
Femme projects coming up that you're

1541
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:49,760
you're you're pumped about

1542
01:04:46,739 --> 01:04:52,798
oh I got that patient zero common

1543
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:55,079
patient zero is on its way

1544
01:04:52,798 --> 01:04:56,579
uh I don't know that that one's gonna be

1545
01:04:55,079 --> 01:04:58,380
interesting

1546
01:04:56,579 --> 01:05:01,318
um I'm not sure how that one's gonna

1547
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:03,119
turn out but you know we'll see it could

1548
01:05:01,318 --> 01:05:05,579
be cool maybe you could explain for

1549
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:07,200
people because you have so many names uh

1550
01:05:05,579 --> 01:05:10,318
because you're so prolific about things

1551
01:05:07,199 --> 01:05:12,960
what is patient zero oh patient zero is

1552
01:05:10,318 --> 01:05:15,058
a you know uh

1553
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:18,119
um basically it's the just the Urkel

1554
01:05:15,059 --> 01:05:20,339
across the Pakistani Central Kush and I

1555
01:05:18,119 --> 01:05:23,818
grew out a hundred and something of

1556
01:05:20,338 --> 01:05:27,779
those years ago and my absolute favorite

1557
01:05:23,818 --> 01:05:29,818
plan of that one was a was the one I

1558
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:32,460
named patient zero

1559
01:05:29,818 --> 01:05:34,199
um and you know it's it's kind of as

1560
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:36,380
long as you like a little turpinelian on

1561
01:05:34,199 --> 01:05:39,000
your diet is pretty all right

1562
01:05:36,380 --> 01:05:41,280
and so maybe I'll add that to it too

1563
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:45,179
where it's like a lot of modern breeding

1564
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:46,859
today is one-offs where people hybridize

1565
01:05:45,179 --> 01:05:48,358
something and then just toss it out to

1566
01:05:46,858 --> 01:05:50,338
the public

1567
01:05:48,358 --> 01:05:53,759
um what he just described is what's

1568
01:05:50,338 --> 01:05:56,099
known as like multi-stage breeding where

1569
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:58,920
he made a cross he grew out a bunch of

1570
01:05:56,099 --> 01:06:01,798
phenos he picked one that he liked and

1571
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:04,619
now he's doing further work with that

1572
01:06:01,798 --> 01:06:08,219
Fino itself probably Crossing it to

1573
01:06:04,619 --> 01:06:10,140
itself and Crossing it to other uh

1574
01:06:08,219 --> 01:06:13,739
cuttings that he has in the stable that

1575
01:06:10,139 --> 01:06:15,598
he thinks might blend well with it right

1576
01:06:13,739 --> 01:06:17,639
um one of my favorites I actually have

1577
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:21,960
uh flowering right now

1578
01:06:17,639 --> 01:06:23,818
um is uh uh the Mendo purple number 54

1579
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:25,699
selection from you know growing out that

1580
01:06:23,818 --> 01:06:31,079
last hundred and something of those

1581
01:06:25,699 --> 01:06:32,699
the Urkel 103 you know S1 and then you

1582
01:06:31,079 --> 01:06:35,339
know those you know

1583
01:06:32,699 --> 01:06:39,239
um I reversed the 103 slapped it on the

1584
01:06:35,338 --> 01:06:41,219
Mendo man those are uniform I mean as

1585
01:06:39,239 --> 01:06:44,219
uniform as you can get really yeah

1586
01:06:41,219 --> 01:06:46,858
that's cool interestingly uh the Mendo

1587
01:06:44,219 --> 01:06:49,919
is extremely dominant on it uh really

1588
01:06:46,858 --> 01:06:53,460
yeah they're all they look more like

1589
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:56,280
Mendo purple plants than you can barely

1590
01:06:53,460 --> 01:06:57,900
see any Urkle to them and both of those

1591
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:59,700
selections were made out of that room

1592
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:03,059
that I came and visited you and saw

1593
01:06:59,699 --> 01:07:07,939
before you uh the s1s of Urkel and the

1594
01:07:03,059 --> 01:07:11,519
s1's amendo P yeah yeah uh-huh yeah yep

1595
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:14,720
but uh yeah yeah

1596
01:07:11,519 --> 01:07:14,719
um definitely interesting though

1597
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:19,020
I don't know yeah I was excited too like

1598
01:07:17,639 --> 01:07:21,420
about I don't know if you want to talk

1599
01:07:19,019 --> 01:07:23,159
about any of the purple punch stuff or

1600
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:25,019
if that's you know what I mean like the

1601
01:07:23,159 --> 01:07:27,598
the findings in that that you're kind of

1602
01:07:25,019 --> 01:07:28,679
seeing that are unique yeah yeah

1603
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:31,200
um

1604
01:07:28,679 --> 01:07:33,058
the we we've talked and the most

1605
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:36,779
surprising thing about breeding with

1606
01:07:33,059 --> 01:07:39,660
purple punch is how [ __ ] stable it is

1607
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:41,579
I mean absolutely right when you're

1608
01:07:39,659 --> 01:07:45,899
working with you know it doesn't matter

1609
01:07:41,579 --> 01:07:48,539
what you know ogs diesels chem dogs Girl

1610
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:51,000
Scouts you know and then all the popular

1611
01:07:48,539 --> 01:07:53,700
stuff based off all those yeah you're

1612
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:57,059
gonna find a nice portion of you know uh

1613
01:07:53,699 --> 01:08:00,179
hermaphrodism you know more so if you

1614
01:07:57,059 --> 01:08:02,400
know your your environment's not a you

1615
01:08:00,179 --> 01:08:03,719
know perfect but you know even if you

1616
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:05,760
have a perfect environment there's

1617
01:08:03,719 --> 01:08:06,480
always going to be a percentage of those

1618
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:10,500
um

1619
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:14,099
but the purple punches have almost the

1620
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:18,838
lowest uh levels of hermaphrodism I've

1621
01:08:14,099 --> 01:08:20,699
seen in any hybrids so I mean that's

1622
01:08:18,838 --> 01:08:22,979
that's useful that's something people

1623
01:08:20,698 --> 01:08:26,399
look for and I think like the fact that

1624
01:08:22,979 --> 01:08:29,659
it popped up in an OG GDP was kind of

1625
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:33,420
shocking you know yeah yeah

1626
01:08:29,659 --> 01:08:35,159
and you know I I was I was the I wasn't

1627
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:36,960
a huge fan of purple punch I didn't even

1628
01:08:35,159 --> 01:08:40,380
you know start growing it until a couple

1629
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:41,759
of years ago yeah I I kind of ignored it

1630
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:43,380
and was like I got plenty of my own

1631
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:46,198
Urkle hybrids I don't need another one

1632
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:48,659
yeah but uh you know it has traits that

1633
01:08:46,198 --> 01:08:51,119
it put puts forward and you really can't

1634
01:08:48,659 --> 01:08:52,858
argue with it you know yeah I was the

1635
01:08:51,119 --> 01:08:54,719
same way you know we both just kind of

1636
01:08:52,859 --> 01:08:57,900
dodged hype for a while with like the

1637
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:59,640
[ __ ] the the gorilla glue and that

1638
01:08:57,899 --> 01:09:02,039
and then end up at the end like [ __ ]

1639
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:04,020
that shit's kind of good yeah right last

1640
01:09:02,039 --> 01:09:06,298
one with the party that's an interesting

1641
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:08,759
that's an interesting aspect that people

1642
01:09:06,298 --> 01:09:11,278
maybe should hear about is sometimes you

1643
01:09:08,759 --> 01:09:14,219
can have an amazing cut that checks a

1644
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:16,620
bunch of boxes and it breeds like [ __ ]

1645
01:09:14,219 --> 01:09:19,020
right it's right all over the place that

1646
01:09:16,619 --> 01:09:21,298
throws a bunch of junk and it does the

1647
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:23,759
quality inherent in the cut itself

1648
01:09:21,298 --> 01:09:25,679
doesn't seem to translate to its

1649
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:28,198
children very well and then other times

1650
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:29,940
you can take something like purple punch

1651
01:09:28,198 --> 01:09:31,979
that they're just talking about that has

1652
01:09:29,939 --> 01:09:33,479
a lot of nice traits but kind of Lacks

1653
01:09:31,979 --> 01:09:34,919
High or whatever else and you don't

1654
01:09:33,479 --> 01:09:37,379
think that much of it

1655
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:39,779
and then you cross it to things and it's

1656
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:41,159
children come out incredibly amazing

1657
01:09:39,779 --> 01:09:44,819
with a bunch of traits that you like

1658
01:09:41,159 --> 01:09:48,119
right so sometimes a breeding parent can

1659
01:09:44,819 --> 01:09:51,960
actually be kind of a crappy

1660
01:09:48,119 --> 01:09:55,319
crappy plant in some ways like uh Caleb

1661
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:58,039
likes a lot of the s1s of my Mendo P

1662
01:09:55,319 --> 01:10:01,380
quite a bit more than the mama

1663
01:09:58,039 --> 01:10:04,019
oh yeah you know the Mama's amazing for

1664
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:06,060
breeding but as an actual plant itself

1665
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:09,780
there's some aspects to it that are

1666
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:10,739
unpredictable and and it's low THC right

1667
01:10:09,779 --> 01:10:12,359
right

1668
01:10:10,738 --> 01:10:13,919
um but some of its children and some of

1669
01:10:12,359 --> 01:10:15,299
the things that it throws and when you

1670
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:16,319
breed

1671
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:17,880
um and sometimes you might take

1672
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:19,380
something like purple punch that people

1673
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:21,679
make fun of and you breed with it and

1674
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:24,779
you're like wow this thing is amazing

1675
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:27,179
it throws all these traits consistently

1676
01:10:24,779 --> 01:10:29,340
that are useful right

1677
01:10:27,179 --> 01:10:32,699
I mean like you could talk for a minute

1678
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:35,819
about how stable that bubble gum cut you

1679
01:10:32,698 --> 01:10:37,979
have is and why you use it in so many

1680
01:10:35,819 --> 01:10:40,319
different things because it throws like

1681
01:10:37,979 --> 01:10:43,198
rock you know it it doesn't rot very

1682
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:46,340
easily it's got incredible structure it

1683
01:10:43,198 --> 01:10:49,019
it densens things up right right right

1684
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:51,900
well I don't know about

1685
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:56,760
it's really not the densest cut out

1686
01:10:51,899 --> 01:10:59,759
there but it's it's uh it's definitely a

1687
01:10:56,760 --> 01:11:03,300
um you know as as rot resistant as you

1688
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:05,460
can you can get a plant you know

1689
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:07,860
um on on my worst year year ever

1690
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:11,039
outdoors I think I was aiming for like

1691
01:11:07,859 --> 01:11:13,679
700 pounds or something and

1692
01:11:11,039 --> 01:11:15,960
then we had six inches of rain the last

1693
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:19,199
week of September you know first week of

1694
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:21,600
October and I lost 50 to 60 percent of

1695
01:11:19,198 --> 01:11:23,698
that Garden to mold

1696
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:25,920
and the only thing that came through

1697
01:11:23,698 --> 01:11:28,619
that garden with probably less than one

1698
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:31,039
percent rot ratio was that bubble gum

1699
01:11:28,619 --> 01:11:35,099
cut that's winning

1700
01:11:31,039 --> 01:11:37,019
you know yeah so you know tons of people

1701
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:39,360
are like you know what's your best you

1702
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:42,780
know mold resistant you know blah blah

1703
01:11:39,359 --> 01:11:46,380
blah well right there you know

1704
01:11:42,779 --> 01:11:48,479
so that outdoor Queen yeah so someone

1705
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:50,579
sometimes those traits like they were

1706
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:52,500
just talking about like you know uh

1707
01:11:50,579 --> 01:11:55,619
Caleb does an enormous amount of

1708
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:57,560
breeding so for him to say that the

1709
01:11:55,619 --> 01:12:00,179
purple punch is some of the most

1710
01:11:57,560 --> 01:12:02,580
non-intersex stable thing he's ever

1711
01:12:00,179 --> 01:12:04,619
worked with is saying something

1712
01:12:02,579 --> 01:12:07,140
right you know when he says that like

1713
01:12:04,619 --> 01:12:09,059
this plant is almost immune to mold and

1714
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:11,699
it's the most mold resistant plant I've

1715
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:14,100
ever seen and it passes that trait to

1716
01:12:11,698 --> 01:12:16,678
some progeny that's useful information

1717
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:18,239
right right you know I see a lot of

1718
01:12:16,679 --> 01:12:21,779
people commenting on the purple punch

1719
01:12:18,238 --> 01:12:23,698
strength and like when

1720
01:12:21,779 --> 01:12:25,559
breeding has changed

1721
01:12:23,698 --> 01:12:27,719
um from where it was maybe 10 years ago

1722
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:29,580
on what we would select for potency wise

1723
01:12:27,719 --> 01:12:31,560
but we wouldn't use what we would use

1724
01:12:29,579 --> 01:12:33,779
certain one of us you know

1725
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:36,659
um purple punch all I'd ever heard about

1726
01:12:33,779 --> 01:12:39,539
was how weak it was so I just never I

1727
01:12:36,658 --> 01:12:42,960
never got into it however

1728
01:12:39,539 --> 01:12:46,979
it is a is a very extract Centric

1729
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:49,380
Community now and with extracts pretty

1730
01:12:46,979 --> 01:12:51,658
much everything's [ __ ] strong

1731
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:53,279
um so so a lot of things are are more

1732
01:12:51,658 --> 01:12:54,658
terp-based now where people are are

1733
01:12:53,279 --> 01:12:58,079
checking out what kind of Terps are

1734
01:12:54,658 --> 01:13:00,839
being passed how they breed and uh yeah

1735
01:12:58,079 --> 01:13:02,340
I mean some people won't want to won't

1736
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:04,619
want to [ __ ] with anything that doesn't

1737
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:06,000
lay them out me I I like all kinds of

1738
01:13:04,619 --> 01:13:08,219
ranges of different highs and I don't

1739
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:11,460
like being laid out so for me purple

1740
01:13:08,219 --> 01:13:15,000
punch is [ __ ] perfect oh yeah

1741
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:16,920
yeah and you know weed weed affects

1742
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,899
humans in different ways

1743
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:21,239
um some of my favorite strains to smoke

1744
01:13:18,899 --> 01:13:23,158
on a regular basis the other two guys

1745
01:13:21,238 --> 01:13:25,139
that were CH you know they don't like it

1746
01:13:23,158 --> 01:13:26,819
that much on a they they agree it's it's

1747
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:28,560
a super quality cut

1748
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:30,359
but it's not something with their body

1749
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:33,120
chemistry that really adapts all that

1750
01:13:30,359 --> 01:13:35,279
well yeah I have friends that only like

1751
01:13:33,119 --> 01:13:36,840
incredibly potent indicas because they

1752
01:13:35,279 --> 01:13:39,539
want to be hammered down

1753
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:41,460
and a sativa makes them crawl up the

1754
01:13:39,539 --> 01:13:44,279
wall yeah right I have other friends

1755
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:46,679
that smoke a sativa and they relax

1756
01:13:44,279 --> 01:13:48,719
right that would be me so yeah so

1757
01:13:46,679 --> 01:13:51,239
cannabis and cannabis and individual

1758
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:52,619
strains uh don't think that the way it

1759
01:13:51,238 --> 01:13:53,279
affects you is the way it affects

1760
01:13:52,619 --> 01:13:57,119
everyone

1761
01:13:53,279 --> 01:13:59,158
there's a range there yeah

1762
01:13:57,119 --> 01:14:02,219
that's why I like keeping so many

1763
01:13:59,158 --> 01:14:04,439
different you know cultivars because you

1764
01:14:02,219 --> 01:14:06,420
know I I like the whole spectrum of

1765
01:14:04,439 --> 01:14:08,759
different things and I know other people

1766
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:11,060
too you know like different things so

1767
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:14,880
you can't always breed for yourself

1768
01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:16,679
definitely not does the purple punch

1769
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:18,960
reverse

1770
01:14:16,679 --> 01:14:21,840
uh yeah yeah it reverse is fine

1771
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:24,960
interesting so it reverses easily but

1772
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:26,880
won't ever throw intersex traits yeah

1773
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:30,480
yeah that was kind of odd in itself

1774
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:32,460
right the the S one I got grown now I

1775
01:14:30,479 --> 01:14:35,399
don't think I found a single ball

1776
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:38,239
or or nanor on any of them

1777
01:14:35,399 --> 01:14:40,619
which was almost unheard of oh yeah yeah

1778
01:14:38,238 --> 01:14:43,859
you're usually going to get at least 10

1779
01:14:40,619 --> 01:14:46,019
to 20 percent you know and I I say 10 to

1780
01:14:43,859 --> 01:14:49,139
20 and that could just be one ball down

1781
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:50,760
low or one you know a late Nana or

1782
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:54,199
something but there's always going to be

1783
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:57,900
like 10 to 20 percent yeah

1784
01:14:54,198 --> 01:15:01,019
and then there's certain things that um

1785
01:14:57,899 --> 01:15:03,658
perm but reverse

1786
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:04,860
right right you know I mean we've talked

1787
01:15:03,658 --> 01:15:07,379
before about we're not going to get into

1788
01:15:04,859 --> 01:15:10,500
it too much but you know they uh you

1789
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:14,100
know the old sour cuts are famous for

1790
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:16,260
not reversing oh yeah or getting a

1791
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:18,300
handful of seed but they're also famous

1792
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:20,820
for the wrong conditions and they they

1793
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:23,159
throw nanners that can see create seed

1794
01:15:20,819 --> 01:15:26,340
in your room for flower production yeah

1795
01:15:23,158 --> 01:15:30,059
it's really easy to grow it boofy I had

1796
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:32,219
a I had some Sour some sourdies in a in

1797
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:34,620
a fully seeded out room just recently

1798
01:15:32,219 --> 01:15:35,399
and uh

1799
01:15:34,619 --> 01:15:38,039
um

1800
01:15:35,399 --> 01:15:40,259
you know completely full of seed and

1801
01:15:38,039 --> 01:15:43,079
about week four it just starts balling

1802
01:15:40,260 --> 01:15:45,300
up just hanging all kinds of Sour Diesel

1803
01:15:43,079 --> 01:15:47,279
balls and even though it's fully seeded

1804
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:49,560
so the whole room was completely seated

1805
01:15:47,279 --> 01:15:51,960
so it didn't have any risk of

1806
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:54,120
pollinating anything but you know it

1807
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:57,000
still felt the need to you know throw

1808
01:15:54,119 --> 01:15:59,819
out just a ton of balls Mike what are

1809
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,920
you doing with this you know

1810
01:15:59,819 --> 01:16:02,880
I didn't see any pollen off of them but

1811
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:05,940
you know

1812
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:07,980
yeah yeah I mean the you know the um

1813
01:16:05,939 --> 01:16:09,839
like the what I consider to be the

1814
01:16:07,979 --> 01:16:13,139
original but you know it's the one I got

1815
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:15,060
the chemd cut uh is pretty famous for

1816
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:18,600
throwing a bunch of manners at week

1817
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:20,340
three four uh but they're sterile

1818
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:22,920
you know they don't really They Don't

1819
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:25,560
Really uh you know uh you know they

1820
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:28,199
don't really make seat yeah and that Kim

1821
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:30,300
D or just chemds in general it seems

1822
01:16:28,198 --> 01:16:33,719
yeah they they throw bananas like

1823
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:35,520
they're going out of style yeah and it's

1824
01:16:33,719 --> 01:16:37,619
a trait that goes there and so I've had

1825
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:39,600
any number of friends or helpers or

1826
01:16:37,619 --> 01:16:41,519
whatever on a light depth Greenhouse

1827
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:44,280
come to me panicked

1828
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:46,560
because half the greenhouse has bananas

1829
01:16:44,279 --> 01:16:48,719
popping out all over right and I'm like

1830
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:51,000
oh calm down calm down it's it's the D

1831
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:54,060
we're gonna be fine you know and we're

1832
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:55,679
fine you know you can find a bean yeah

1833
01:16:54,060 --> 01:16:57,120
um but you know you do that with cherry

1834
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:58,690
pie or something and you have beans

1835
01:16:57,119 --> 01:17:01,198
everywhere right

1836
01:16:58,689 --> 01:17:03,178
[Laughter]

1837
01:17:01,198 --> 01:17:05,039
so certain things certain things are

1838
01:17:03,179 --> 01:17:07,020
different different risky you know

1839
01:17:05,039 --> 01:17:09,060
there's different levels of risk yeah

1840
01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:10,800
yeah yeah right so I mean maybe we

1841
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:12,600
should maybe we should chat about this

1842
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:13,800
maybe we should reel it back in for a

1843
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:15,300
second

1844
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:18,719
um part of the reason why we did this

1845
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:20,640
nl5 chat uh both starting in the 80s and

1846
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:22,679
going through some of the history and

1847
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:25,140
then bringing Caleb on was to talk about

1848
01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:29,039
the project that that him and Matt have

1849
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:30,300
going and uh they they just dropped the

1850
01:17:29,039 --> 01:17:32,880
seeds I believe

1851
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:35,520
yes or we're about to or just did yeah

1852
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:36,739
no they're dropped uh calebs Caleb's

1853
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:40,020
site is

1854
01:17:36,738 --> 01:17:41,759
humboldtsi.com correct Caleb yeah there

1855
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:45,179
you can buy them on there or I'll write

1856
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:49,920
seedco.com yeah and so it's a it's a

1857
01:17:45,179 --> 01:17:52,560
it's a riot and uh and Caleb collab

1858
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:54,719
um and it's a big open pollination of

1859
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:56,400
genetics from

1860
01:17:54,719 --> 01:18:00,300
um one of the people that was intimately

1861
01:17:56,399 --> 01:18:02,339
involved in the old NL crew uh so the

1862
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:04,679
the provenance is excellent as far as

1863
01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:06,539
like who it comes from

1864
01:18:04,679 --> 01:18:09,480
um and you know but then on top of that

1865
01:18:06,539 --> 01:18:10,319
too the proof is in the pudding so you

1866
01:18:09,479 --> 01:18:13,500
know

1867
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:15,359
um it uh it's a chance for people to

1868
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:17,219
maybe hunt around if you have if you're

1869
01:18:15,359 --> 01:18:18,658
a little adventurous and look through

1870
01:18:17,219 --> 01:18:22,800
something old

1871
01:18:18,658 --> 01:18:24,960
and something famous you know uh and you

1872
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:26,880
know Caleb found a few things in it that

1873
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:29,300
he was super excited about and so

1874
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:32,819
hopefully you you guys will too

1875
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:35,460
uh and one of the ways that we're gonna

1876
01:18:32,819 --> 01:18:37,979
make sure that not everything is

1877
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:42,060
Skittles OG cookie

1878
01:18:37,979 --> 01:18:44,099
cushman's whatever is by people taking

1879
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:46,560
effort and Reviving some of these old

1880
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:49,020
things and making fresh bats of batches

1881
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:51,600
of seed that are more viable and then

1882
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:55,080
getting them into people's hands so the

1883
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:56,880
gene pool stays wider yeah yeah so not

1884
01:18:55,079 --> 01:18:59,819
only is it a cool old project to

1885
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:01,739
something that's extremely famous uh and

1886
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:04,319
there's potential in it

1887
01:19:01,738 --> 01:19:06,658
um but you can better believe that most

1888
01:19:04,319 --> 01:19:09,238
modern breeding uh with a few exceptions

1889
01:19:06,658 --> 01:19:10,799
is the same 30 or 40 Cuts Blended in a

1890
01:19:09,238 --> 01:19:11,819
bunch of different ways over the last 10

1891
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:14,340
years

1892
01:19:11,819 --> 01:19:17,099
and this Harkens back to a much older

1893
01:19:14,340 --> 01:19:19,260
time so there's a possibility there that

1894
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:20,880
when you out cross things to something

1895
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:23,039
that aren't like each other if you take

1896
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:25,260
these nl5s and you start throwing it on

1897
01:19:23,039 --> 01:19:27,539
different stuff you have you might get

1898
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:28,920
some unusual stuff you're not expecting

1899
01:19:27,539 --> 01:19:30,079
that's good

1900
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:32,340
right

1901
01:19:30,079 --> 01:19:34,380
you know brayden's [ __ ] with me sorry

1902
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:36,179
guys no it's like because that's because

1903
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:38,219
that's the thing is a lot of breeders

1904
01:19:36,179 --> 01:19:40,199
say that like sometimes you know

1905
01:19:38,219 --> 01:19:41,460
Crossing two very distinct things

1906
01:19:40,198 --> 01:19:45,899
together

1907
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:47,698
is where you really get quality yeah

1908
01:19:45,899 --> 01:19:50,279
you know and you're certainly

1909
01:19:47,698 --> 01:19:52,859
introducing something older in the gene

1910
01:19:50,279 --> 01:19:55,800
pool that was very common 20 30 years

1911
01:19:52,859 --> 01:19:56,939
ago but now is many generations in her

1912
01:19:55,800 --> 01:19:59,820
bread

1913
01:19:56,939 --> 01:20:01,198
and so uh by these guys doing this

1914
01:19:59,819 --> 01:20:02,819
project we're it's kind of getting

1915
01:20:01,198 --> 01:20:05,399
thrown out there again where it can get

1916
01:20:02,819 --> 01:20:07,439
bred into a lot of modern stuff

1917
01:20:05,399 --> 01:20:08,939
and people get to see what happens so

1918
01:20:07,439 --> 01:20:11,519
you know you'll you'll get more

1919
01:20:08,939 --> 01:20:14,219
opportunities to see what CSI is doing

1920
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:15,719
with the work uh in future breeding

1921
01:20:14,219 --> 01:20:17,760
projects that seem like they're already

1922
01:20:15,719 --> 01:20:19,560
engaged

1923
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:21,360
um and hopefully people are going to buy

1924
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:23,360
a bunch of this stuff and start posting

1925
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:25,559
and trying them out themselves

1926
01:20:23,359 --> 01:20:28,198
and it's one of the ways you can keep

1927
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:30,920
cannabis history alive right and making

1928
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:33,178
the encourage with the stuff yeah yeah

1929
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:34,679
you know mixing it with modern things

1930
01:20:33,179 --> 01:20:38,699
and seeing what happens

1931
01:20:34,679 --> 01:20:41,039
right right so what do you guys think

1932
01:20:38,698 --> 01:20:43,579
would be the best

1933
01:20:41,039 --> 01:20:47,579
you know available

1934
01:20:43,579 --> 01:20:51,079
uh plant line whatever out there too

1935
01:20:47,579 --> 01:20:51,079
across to the nl5s

1936
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:55,380
you know

1937
01:20:52,979 --> 01:20:57,238
I I personally I want to see the Hogs

1938
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:59,279
breath in all five I think that would be

1939
01:20:57,238 --> 01:21:01,379
cool if if we could track that down and

1940
01:20:59,279 --> 01:21:02,759
do that again it's been out of my hands

1941
01:21:01,380 --> 01:21:06,319
for a while but I think that would be

1942
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:06,320
interesting just because of the terms

1943
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:11,940
how about you not so

1944
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:14,219
you know I actually think that

1945
01:21:11,939 --> 01:21:16,039
um it might cross well with something

1946
01:21:14,219 --> 01:21:20,460
like the dog [ __ ]

1947
01:21:16,039 --> 01:21:23,039
okay okay you know kind of a potentially

1948
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:25,380
almost a back cross potentially almost I

1949
01:21:23,039 --> 01:21:27,539
mean a back cross has to use the the

1950
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:31,460
technically the same cut to go back to

1951
01:21:27,539 --> 01:21:33,600
but maybe something that is very NL

1952
01:21:31,460 --> 01:21:36,239
because one thing I'll say about that

1953
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:40,620
dog [ __ ] grown indoor is boy does it

1954
01:21:36,238 --> 01:21:43,079
look like 90s weed like lime green with

1955
01:21:40,619 --> 01:21:47,219
bright orange hairs and it just has that

1956
01:21:43,079 --> 01:21:49,679
like NL type of like like look I was

1957
01:21:47,219 --> 01:21:51,239
gonna say Hydro but uh Caleb is purely

1958
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:53,880
organic so I don't want to insult them

1959
01:21:51,238 --> 01:21:56,519
it's just that like that like big sack

1960
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:58,560
of hydro and NL that you would get you

1961
01:21:56,520 --> 01:22:00,600
know that's just super Frosty and stuff

1962
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:02,159
like that and so

1963
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:04,260
um you know but it might give it some

1964
01:22:02,158 --> 01:22:06,719
stretch and some Vigor and it might kind

1965
01:22:04,260 --> 01:22:08,039
of like and that's kind of like what I

1966
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:10,679
like one of the things that I get

1967
01:22:08,039 --> 01:22:12,179
interested about is crossing two

1968
01:22:10,679 --> 01:22:15,300
different things that you think have

1969
01:22:12,179 --> 01:22:17,760
similar parentage behind them yes and

1970
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:21,420
then you see if you get some throwbacks

1971
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:24,780
because both parents have it yeah I I do

1972
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:26,399
have the dog [ __ ] in uh my latest round

1973
01:22:24,779 --> 01:22:29,099
but

1974
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:31,738
so you know but it's it's getting across

1975
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:32,480
to that that chocolatey

1976
01:22:31,738 --> 01:22:36,959
um

1977
01:22:32,479 --> 01:22:40,379
nl5 mail and honestly uh I think there

1978
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:44,158
were better uh there are males that

1979
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:46,619
kind of looked more similar to dog [ __ ]

1980
01:22:44,158 --> 01:22:49,259
but uh

1981
01:22:46,619 --> 01:22:51,719
um I you know I I didn't use them

1982
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:53,940
personally for this round

1983
01:22:51,719 --> 01:22:55,859
um because I liked that you know

1984
01:22:53,939 --> 01:22:57,178
particular you know chocolatey one and

1985
01:22:55,859 --> 01:22:59,158
if I was gonna throw out one more

1986
01:22:57,179 --> 01:23:00,719
recommendation and combine the old with

1987
01:22:59,158 --> 01:23:02,399
the new

1988
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:06,840
um one of Neville's most classic

1989
01:23:02,399 --> 01:23:10,500
combinations was uh nl5 and skunk

1990
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:13,739
and I kind of view uh the diesel family

1991
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:16,920
as cert what we have is surviving modern

1992
01:23:13,738 --> 01:23:19,379
skunk not that there's not cheese and a

1993
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:22,800
couple other things like that but I kind

1994
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:24,960
of view like sours as American skunk

1995
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:27,659
right or very very skunkish so it would

1996
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:30,119
be kind of cool to see like what we have

1997
01:23:27,658 --> 01:23:31,859
now is skunk and what we have now is NL

1998
01:23:30,119 --> 01:23:33,059
Blended back together

1999
01:23:31,859 --> 01:23:34,679
right

2000
01:23:33,060 --> 01:23:37,500
um because that was one of the most

2001
01:23:34,679 --> 01:23:40,920
classic best-selling and they combined

2002
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:40,920
super well yeah

2003
01:23:42,359 --> 01:23:46,579
um I definitely have cheese in there too

2004
01:23:43,979 --> 01:23:46,579
so you know

2005
01:23:47,359 --> 01:23:54,059
are you talking skunk one or skunk

2006
01:23:51,179 --> 01:23:56,279
I mean I that's cheese is fine that's

2007
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:58,500
obviously pure skunk one that's very old

2008
01:23:56,279 --> 01:24:01,319
I was just thinking of certain diesels

2009
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:03,719
just because I consider I consider

2010
01:24:01,319 --> 01:24:04,859
certain diesels uh modern that to me

2011
01:24:03,719 --> 01:24:08,520
that even though it doesn't have the

2012
01:24:04,859 --> 01:24:11,639
name I consider a diesel to be like a

2013
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:14,820
skunk skunk skunkoid type plant right

2014
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:17,280
right it's tall it's rangy you know it's

2015
01:24:14,819 --> 01:24:19,619
it's got that kind of skunk type growth

2016
01:24:17,279 --> 01:24:22,738
to it it's got these very I basically

2017
01:24:19,619 --> 01:24:25,319
think of like gas and Diesel as it's not

2018
01:24:22,738 --> 01:24:26,718
like roadkill but it is on that skunk

2019
01:24:25,319 --> 01:24:29,399
Spectrum

2020
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:32,340
it's like different angles of the same

2021
01:24:29,399 --> 01:24:35,460
Terps yeah you know yeah that's kind of

2022
01:24:32,340 --> 01:24:36,060
how I see it so you know

2023
01:24:35,460 --> 01:24:37,859
um

2024
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:39,960
but yeah and then the other thing too is

2025
01:24:37,859 --> 01:24:43,019
that you know he you know you cross it

2026
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:44,640
to things you hope are gonna cross well

2027
01:24:43,020 --> 01:24:46,320
and then you cross it to some things

2028
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:48,780
that are just random and sometimes those

2029
01:24:46,319 --> 01:24:50,340
random ones end up being the best ones

2030
01:24:48,779 --> 01:24:51,539
because you really don't know and you

2031
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:54,060
really don't know what genes are gonna

2032
01:24:51,539 --> 01:24:56,100
pop right right and you really don't

2033
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:58,380
know what recessives are in there

2034
01:24:56,100 --> 01:25:01,560
true true right like so to take it back

2035
01:24:58,380 --> 01:25:03,600
to humans unless both parents have the

2036
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:07,199
gene you can't have kids with blue eyes

2037
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:08,820
or green eyes you know you if if one

2038
01:25:07,198 --> 01:25:10,738
parent has the recessive the other

2039
01:25:08,819 --> 01:25:13,380
parent has the dominant it won't combine

2040
01:25:10,738 --> 01:25:14,939
right blonde hair is the same way both

2041
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:16,980
parents have to have the blonde hair

2042
01:25:14,939 --> 01:25:18,059
gene or the red hair gene or it won't

2043
01:25:16,979 --> 01:25:20,459
pop

2044
01:25:18,060 --> 01:25:22,679
and so sometimes if you take two things

2045
01:25:20,460 --> 01:25:25,140
that you think might have similar genes

2046
01:25:22,679 --> 01:25:26,819
you might get some recessives that pop

2047
01:25:25,140 --> 01:25:29,100
and all of a sudden something unusual

2048
01:25:26,819 --> 01:25:29,719
comes out you know

2049
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:31,620
yeah yeah

2050
01:25:29,719 --> 01:25:35,039
so

2051
01:25:31,619 --> 01:25:37,260
yeah well I promise to to not hold Caleb

2052
01:25:35,039 --> 01:25:40,439
too long I know he's got some [ __ ] to do

2053
01:25:37,260 --> 01:25:41,820
tonight too so I I'm thankful for you

2054
01:25:40,439 --> 01:25:43,198
coming and talking about the Northern

2055
01:25:41,819 --> 01:25:46,079
Lights I know everybody's super stoked

2056
01:25:43,198 --> 01:25:48,000
to be able to hear about it firsthand

2057
01:25:46,079 --> 01:25:49,698
um but yeah is there anything else you

2058
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:52,979
want to talk about before we all balance

2059
01:25:49,698 --> 01:25:55,979
uh I think I'm good I gotta go Wrangle a

2060
01:25:52,979 --> 01:25:57,959
five-year-old beast at least yeah we

2061
01:25:55,979 --> 01:25:59,579
know you know uh Friday night isn't the

2062
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:01,679
easiest night for you so we super

2063
01:25:59,579 --> 01:26:05,519
appreciate you coming on and shooting

2064
01:26:01,679 --> 01:26:07,800
the [ __ ] and all that you know and uh

2065
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:09,420
you know I briefly saw your face in the

2066
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:11,699
shadows there for a minute before the

2067
01:26:09,420 --> 01:26:13,560
pitch black kicked in

2068
01:26:11,698 --> 01:26:15,059
um but yeah you know

2069
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:16,800
um that's that's kind of it we wanted to

2070
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:18,480
chat about NL we wanted to chat about

2071
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:21,060
the history we wanted to clear up some

2072
01:26:18,479 --> 01:26:24,000
misconceptions and we wanted people to

2073
01:26:21,060 --> 01:26:26,340
hear about some of the specifics of what

2074
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,380
was available How It Was Made what you

2075
01:26:26,340 --> 01:26:31,020
what we saw in it

2076
01:26:28,380 --> 01:26:34,079
um and let people go from there

2077
01:26:31,020 --> 01:26:36,360
so as always everyone thank you for

2078
01:26:34,079 --> 01:26:38,039
giving us part of your Friday night you

2079
01:26:36,359 --> 01:26:40,799
know Caleb uh where do you where where

2080
01:26:38,039 --> 01:26:42,979
can people find your seats again

2081
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:47,100
uh Humboldt

2082
01:26:42,979 --> 01:26:50,000
csi.com there you go yeah humboldtsi.com

2083
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:52,620
we'll grab the nl5 please

2084
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:55,198
experience it make sure you let them

2085
01:26:52,619 --> 01:26:58,559
know about yours too yeah I got it too

2086
01:26:55,198 --> 01:27:01,738
but but you know support the man

2087
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:03,539
yeah so you know both both guys have it

2088
01:27:01,738 --> 01:27:05,698
you can get them both off each of their

2089
01:27:03,539 --> 01:27:07,139
individual websites

2090
01:27:05,698 --> 01:27:09,059
um they were communicating a bunch

2091
01:27:07,139 --> 01:27:11,400
during the during the grow they were

2092
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:14,520
talking about what he was seeing sharing

2093
01:27:11,399 --> 01:27:15,899
pictures and just you know and all that

2094
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:17,400
and so

2095
01:27:15,899 --> 01:27:19,259
um you know it's how a lot of people

2096
01:27:17,399 --> 01:27:21,960
tell a lot of passion projects get made

2097
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:24,060
today is with uh uh people that have

2098
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:26,639
similar interests collaborating and

2099
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:28,500
making it work so support it if you can

2100
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:30,420
if you you know it'd be great

2101
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:32,100
uh and it would spread out some old

2102
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:34,020
genetics and it would keep them alive

2103
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:36,000
and you could do your little part to

2104
01:27:34,020 --> 01:27:38,460
make sure that the gene pool stays wider

2105
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:42,000
