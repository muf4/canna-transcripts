Revolution is in stock the blueberry in

25
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:05,000
cross that we've been working on for 5

26
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:07,759
years now is finally at its uh what I

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,280
feel is a great completion point for it

28
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:11,879
uh a true breeding line for blueberry

29
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,000
scents and

30
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:16,079
flavor um it was our most popular

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,879
selling line on the original release

32
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,118
when we released the first Blue Bonnet

33
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:21,798
crosses I didn't make a whole lot of

34
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:23,959
them because I really wanted to explore

35
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:26,880
what was in them before I did a major

36
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:30,199
release uh we were at that point and it

37
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:34,118
was uh originally a DJ Short Blueberry

38
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:36,520
from DJ shorts early early work where he

39
00:01:34,118 --> 00:01:38,599
would sell the seeds at different talks

40
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:40,920
that he would do across California at

41
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:43,399
collectives uh buddy resin lung picked

42
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,280
up some packs he gave them to me I went

43
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:47,799
through them and found the best

44
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,799
representative of what I thought the

45
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:52,759
most beautiful blueberry was

46
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:55,280
like but it didn't have the exact scent

47
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:57,519
that I wanted when I saw that in my

48
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,239
mind's eye and I was as I would look at

49
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:03,560
it I would picture beautiful blueberry

50
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:06,718
Jam TPS and flavor and scent just all of

51
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:09,560
it and they didn't have it so we made a

52
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:11,239
mission The Last 5 Years to make this a

53
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,000
reality and something where you could

54
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:17,159
pop a pack of seeds and it would be

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,759
almost identical for that tur profile

56
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:22,318
we're there they are now released on

57
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:24,519
Riot seeds.com the pre-orders over

58
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:27,839
they're already shipping out we also

59
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:30,400
have something called The Modern Blue um

60
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,000
that we didn't really release we did it

61
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,879
on our uh patreon so definitely check

62
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,639
that out our 50 tier patreon ended up

63
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:43,919
getting the Lion Share of these with

64
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:46,399
their monthly package and it was the mac

65
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:48,158
daddy cross to Blueberry incross Mac

66
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,000
Daddy from a company called ouse

67
00:02:48,158 --> 00:02:54,158
genetics and then my personal favorite

68
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,639
out of the uh hype strains as it were

69
00:02:54,158 --> 00:02:58,399
that we are kind of uh merging with some

70
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,158
of this blue stuff so that we can bring

71
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,319
it into the modern generation and get

72
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:06,798
some of the new kids interested the

73
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:10,119
sherb cream pie phenomenally resinous

74
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:13,000
great hash maker great yielding nice

75
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,080
long high for a sherb cross which is my

76
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,799
biggest problem with Sher cross to our

77
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:20,560
blueberry in Cross and we call that one

78
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:23,439
blue cocky and um yeah triple on Tandra

79
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,640
there U we have bluy because it's Blast

80
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:27,400
for me to use something like runs for me

81
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:29,919
but the white runs out of all the runs

82
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,840
stuff I found to be the best runs cross

83
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:34,238
with the most potent High we did a

84
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,438
blueberry incross cross to that bringing

85
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,799
heavy heavy blueberry jam turps to the

86
00:03:36,438 --> 00:03:41,919
white runs we also have trop Berry which

87
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,400
is the Dosey trop uh Tropic trop Cherry

88
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:46,958
I believe cross to the dossey do cross

89
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,680
to the blueberry and cross all of these

90

traveled and not only that but the

111
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:46,319
future for the Canada Cabana because you

112
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:48,279
know we really want to instill from from

113
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:52,519
the Breeders Syndicate side how

114
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:55,679
important Forum culture was and is and

115
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:58,478
will always be to keeping like

116
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,079
everything correct straight and keeping

117
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:01,758
that part of the culture alive because

118
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:04,240
that's that was been a major part of the

119
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:06,080
culture for all of us so with that um

120
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,600
Oki you want to start tell us about

121
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:13,159
yourself brother how' you get

122
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:16,840
started uh yeah I got started in the uh

123
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:19,880
uh weed Biz by uh pretty much not having

124
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:23,239
any access to to good weed in Oklahoma I

125
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:25,560
was tired of uh kind of the the Mexican

126
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,199
brick that I was used to getting and I

127
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,918
kind of figured hey I might be able to

128
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:34,478
grow better than this and uh so yeah

129
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:40,079
that's where I got started back in um uh

130
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:42,120
2002 in Oklahoma uh in my closet and uh

131
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,719
after that you know we moved to Denver

132
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,840
which is where all of us met and uh you

133
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,880
know kind of uh gradually scaled things

134
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:51,000
up over time where did you get your

135
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:53,959
seats from early on when you uh your

136
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,038
your first genetics man you know I think

137
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:58,799
it was do you remember it was like uh

138
00:05:56,038 --> 00:06:02,120
Heaven's Gateway or something heway yeah

139
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,879
yeah yeah yeah that one um I got some um

140
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:07,720
the first the first seeds I ever grew

141
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:11,279
were I'm pretty sure it was uh Brothers

142
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:16,680
grim c99 and then it was a

143
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:18,598
G13 uh hash plant cross and real nice I

144
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,800
mean I was a shitty grower at the time

145
00:06:18,598 --> 00:06:24,560
so it wasn't that good but uh you know

146
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,280
it was a nice place to start yeah dude I

147
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,959
mean it's like a a different look from

148
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:30,839
the Mexican brick weed obviously I grew

149
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:33,758
up on the same like I was a had definite

150
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:36,318
meth Mexican brick weed smoker you know

151
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,160
growing up and uh I appreciated it for

152
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,319
what it was until I found real dank and

153
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,919
really quickly realized there is a whole

154
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:46,000
this is a whole another level of weed

155
00:06:42,918 --> 00:06:48,680
bro so yeah I appreciate that how about

156
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,560
you Chris tell us some of uh your early

157
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:56,160
Beginnings yeah I I grew up in Florida

158
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,319
um pretty much similar story to uh to

159
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,280
Oki you know started growing in my

160
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,199
closet when I was in college

161
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:04,878
uh started smoking when I was like maybe

162
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:08,598
12 or 13 kind of on the regular by by

163
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:11,160
late high school you know um and in

164
00:07:08,598 --> 00:07:13,038
college I actually found myself like you

165
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,960
know I went to a big Florida College

166
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:16,918
like everyone partying and I just

167
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:19,959
couldn't like hang and drink like

168
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:22,000
bothered my stomach and I soon I soon

169
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:24,120
figured out that like cannabis was my

170
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,120
social in it was my way to talk to girls

171
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,759
and my way to hang out with people and

172
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,720
you know because I couldn't hang on like

173
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,598
pounding beers night after night yeah so

174
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,080
um so it kind of just became my thing I

175
00:07:32,598 --> 00:07:37,079
started selling weed I started growing

176
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:39,399
weed and um you know I met some good

177
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:41,959
people early on that that got to put me

178
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:44,120
on got you know guys that had a bunch of

179
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:47,758
grow houses going and just put me to

180
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,519
work as like a as a grunt basically and

181
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,639
you know we just had the old speed trays

182
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:54,519
with the Rockell slabs and you know this

183
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:59,639
like early early mid 20000s you know

184
00:07:54,519 --> 00:08:02,158
similar timeline 2003 2005 and uh and

185
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:04,240
you know had couple spots eventually got

186
00:08:02,158 --> 00:08:07,000
my own little spot going cranking out

187
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:10,000
and uh and then we all got

188
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,680
raided and uh and then ended up laying

189
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,279
low for a couple years and uh you know

190
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,280
spent a lot of time in Amsterdam going

191
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:19,399
to Europe a lot and uh you know and then

192
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:22,239
went to California in

193
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:24,399
2009 was in Oakland ended up getting

194
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,038
like robbed and just everything fell

195
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:29,038
apart it was just like an Oakland story

196
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:30,240
you know this was 2009 when things were

197
00:08:29,038 --> 00:08:33,958
just

198
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,560
bro yeah and I had a cousin in Denver

199
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:37,000
and I was like you know Colorado is not

200
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:38,838
that bad and they're like legalizing

201
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,839
like Cali is so I just went there and

202
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,880
like kind of started life over in his

203
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:45,959
basement and he let me kind of run his

204
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:48,559
grow and uh you know within less than a

205
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:50,838
year of being in Colorado I had a a an

206
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:53,958
investor a warehouse a spot you know I

207
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:57,000
was just kind of just just in it meeting

208
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:58,518
people and you know it's a good thing so

209
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,759
what were some of the early strains you

210
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:05,078
saw when you were for barely starting to

211
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:06,958
grow um the guys that I got put on with

212
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:09,359
just were growing this hash plant this

213
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:11,359
Florida hash plant that you know I've

214
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,200
heard the guys from Swamp boys a couple

215
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,240
people that were in that scene in that

216
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,759
day talk about um I you know some people

217
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,600
said it came from the cense SE hash plan

218
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:24,078
from Amsterdam but nobody was really

219
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,800
sure um some people some people say it

220
00:09:24,078 --> 00:09:29,120
may have been the white before we called

221
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:32,599
it that oh sure yeah because it had that

222
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,679
you it was squatty um it was real hashy

223
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:38,759
smelling like that mirene kind of really

224
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:40,879
cut through um and uh yeah it it was

225
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:43,480
just about pumping that one plant out

226
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:45,120
and it was super dank but I feel like

227
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,800
like I never saw anything like that

228
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,600
again I think that cut just disappeared

229
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:51,159
like everybody got busted and it just

230
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:54,200
didn't make it you know yeah Florida had

231
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:55,679
some dank bro Florida had all kinds of

232
00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:00,200
over there running around in different

233
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:03,719
little uh circles pretty wild yeah was a

234
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,200
big indoor scene up until 2006 when the

235
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,879
you know there was Federal funding to

236
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,519
like get everybody busted but they they

237
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:11,439
said that was more indoor in Florida

238
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:13,120
than the California I believe it yeah

239
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,079
yeah they held down like you know the

240
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,120
triangle Kush the white like you said

241
00:10:15,078 --> 00:10:18,679
the Gainesville green there's all kinds

242
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,440
of stuff that came out of there that was

243
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:25,639
just absolute fire and and changed the

244
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:28,320
world of cannabis as far as I see it yep

245
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:30,039

246
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,240

let's see uh probably like mid to late

248
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:40,759
90s I started smoking weed swag weed

249
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:40,759
that I was stealing from my dad

250

you um you know so and he uh he didn't

251
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:49,719
have the highest of standards for

252
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:53,600
himself so it wasn't very good for sure

253
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:55,600
yeah and uh but then I I had a buddy um

254
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,800

grow a little bit of weed from him I was

286
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:21,040
always you know hustling some weight on

287
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:24,600
the side and

288
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:27,559
uh early on my favorite uh I mean back

289
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,959

2000s weed and it's still I've talked

291
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:34,879
about it several times favorite weed all

292
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:38,399
time cat piss it would stain your pipe

293

it would you know you you'd be smoking

294
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,240
something different three weeks later

295
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,639
and the resin in your pipe would still

296
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:45,360
taste like

297
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:48,320
catpiss just so pungent

298
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,440

304
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:07,120
uh early on

305
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:12,239
uh right when Chris kind of moved out

306
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:15,680
there it was probably around 2009 surely

307
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:18,600
after he got out there we linked up

308
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:21,078
um online somehow I can't even tell you

309
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,440
specifically how it happened end up

310
00:13:21,078 --> 00:13:25,278
working with Chris in his first

311
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:29,440
Warehouse that he even had up there in

312
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:34,519

314
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:39,440

traveling around meeting everybody and

324
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:08,278
one of the best introductions that you

325
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:11,000
could make you know back in the day in

326
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:14,360
the weed game was like oh I'm such and

328
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:19,720
like you know the locks and the doors

329
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:23,239
just opened up and it was like you were

330
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:25,720
almost already kind of verified and uh

331
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:28,278
so you already had the Cabana stamp of

332
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,000
approval so a lot of people were more

333
00:14:28,278 --> 00:14:32,838
open to

334
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,839
uh meeting you and you know talking to

335
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:38,279
you and working with you and stuff

336
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:41,279
so that's how uh it started early

337
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:44,000
on yeah dude I remember you know I think

338
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:47,519
me and you first met I don't remember

339
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,759
who it was through maybe Phil Phil Rojo

340
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,959
but I remember we first met at a strip

341
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:56,680
club uh uh Shotgun

342
00:14:52,958 --> 00:15:01,758
Willies every 420 back in the

343
00:14:56,679 --> 00:15:04,439
day uh canado with throw a big um event

344
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:06,159
at Shotgun Willies and can't remember

345
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,000
what it was he had some kind of loose

346
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:10,319
connection to Shotgun Willie so yeah

347
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,600
just a few loose connections there yeah

348
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,480
something where they allowed all of us

349
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,759
to go in there and run rampant for the

350
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,639
day but yeah there there were h a couple

351
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:22,839
of really good years where we had a lot

352
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:25,879
of people uh I remember the stat bills

353
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:28,480
bro stacks of twos from

354
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:30,759
kiry if you were there for the $2 bill

355
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,759
year you were there for a good year oh

356
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:36,278
yeah I was there the year I don't know

357
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:38,720
if you remember this me and Joe scho

358
00:15:36,278 --> 00:15:41,919
decided we were going to start smoking

359
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,120
inside Shotgun Willies and the cops

360
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:46,078
[ __ ] pushed us all the way into the

361
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,679
back and we're kind of surrounding us

362
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:49,399
slowly but surely because they weren't

363
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:51,318
quite sure if we're going to [ __ ]

364
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:53,559
fight and what we're going to do and all

365
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:56,599
of a sudden like a hooker back backed

366
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:58,198
her Lamborghini up over a cop car and

367
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,839
that was it dude like they all B out the

368
00:15:58,198 --> 00:16:04,078

369
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:07,600

374
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:21,040
the Kevin Bacon Theory or however it

375
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,639

376
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:25,838
Colorado man it was cool because there

377
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,839
were several

378
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:30,120
uh

379
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:31,919
um I gotta I might have a special guest

380
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,839

385
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:47,039
killer where was I at I lost my train of

386
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,919
thought there uh just you know seven

387
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:50,759
degrees separation Kevin Bacon how we

388
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:52,240
all kind of went through there and oh

389
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:55,480
yeah out in Colorado there was kind of

390
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:58,879
like you know we all knew each other we

391
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:01,720
all had gone to you know motive uh

392
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:04,000
motive 303 he used to throw a bunch of

393
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,798
uh great dude barbecues and Gatherings

394
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,400
at his house so we'd go over to motives

395
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:11,000
I would do some at my house we'd come

396
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:14,959
over to mine we'd go to skitty's house

397
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,480
we'd go to Bobby O's house we'd be at uh

398
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:21,360
Ho's of course that was kind of like

399
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:26,759
the um the home base I guess you would

400
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:28,959
say and uh but you know there there were

401
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:32,000
people that hung out with you know cops

402
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,240
and Paco and Rojo those guys kind of

403
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
always hung out you know with themselves

404
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:40,798
and then motive and you know I might be

405
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,480
getting you know getting things wrong

406
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:46,079
and who hung out with who but everybody

407
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:50,038
had their own little clicks and you Roo

408
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:52,599
yeah Rojo and Paco and cob oh yeah yeah

409
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:56,200
um because they all used work together I

410
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:58,399
think um at a spot down here in Denver

411
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,519
there was also the Adam Dunn Cannabis

412
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,120
Cup event events you remember

413
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:05,038
those at all yeah when they started

414
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:07,119
doing those me and Mitch originally had

415
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:09,359
planned those out for an event we were

416
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:11,839
going to do called the Breeders ball and

417
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:13,558
it suddenly got like co-opted into Adam

418
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:15,599
dun's kind of gig but those were kind of

419
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:17,079
fun too because like you'd have breeders

420
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:18,599
that [ __ ] wanted to kill each other

421
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:21,240
at those events and we would all just

422
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:23,959
kind of put all our our weapons down as

423
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:26,319
we came in the [ __ ] event and smoked

424
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,759
and there was a period in time with the

425
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:31,079
events

426
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:33,279
probably it's this probably 10 years ago

427
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:36,519
now where it's like 10 years ago I'd say

428
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:38,558
was like the height of cannabis events

429
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:41,158
and then then they started kind of

430
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:44,158
getting flooded and uh there was too

431
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:46,400
many of them and they were too expensive

432
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:49,559
and all of that they kind of drowned

433
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,600
themselves out and then covid came and

434
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:56,240
you know nobody wanted to hang out with

435
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:58,240
anybody exactly right it's still uh it's

436
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,759
still recovering now I think as far as

437
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,759
like a smoking cannabis scene and it's

438
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:07,400
it's a little different I mean a lot of

439
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:10,319
people are you know still you know just

440
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:12,559
sit down and Blaze with anybody but I

441
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:15,759
don't want to go to a cup and just smoke

442
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:17,960
everybody's weed anymore I've been and

443
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:20,679
I've had cup cough I don't want to you

444
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:23,240
know yeah we we have events um for our

445
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:24,759
group like me CSI bod a bunch of us out

446
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,440
here in California and I'd love to get

447
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:29,279
you guys all to come out for it um if

448
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,159
possible I know it's a you know hell of

449
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:35,000
a trip but we do it out in the last time

450
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:37,440
we did it out by Yos rented a big ass

451
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,200
Mansion crashed for a few days and just

452
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,440
smok tons of different kinds of weed

453
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,038
from everyone and it's you won't have to

454
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,240
twist my arm very hard man yeah it was

455
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:48,519
it was in the like I really took it from

456
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,759
like the nugs and jugs events the [ __ ]

457
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:52,480
korado did even some of the Adam dun

458
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:54,599
stuff like it was all inspiring to me to

459
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,839
be like I think we can pull this [ __ ]

460
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:57,879
off where even if people don't

461
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:59,599
necessarily get along we can get along

462
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,960
for three days smoking weed and talking

463
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:02,678
weed and being [ __ ] nerds for a

464
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,679
little bit and it's it's been [ __ ]

465
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:08,798
insane one year we had like you know

466
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:11,519
Josh D all the triangle guys come out

467
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:14,158
the Irene crew came out it it was pretty

468
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:15,599
phenomenal so this next round I really

469
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:19,240
would love to have some of you guys come

470
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:23,399
out I learned from the events that uh

471
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:26,038
the booth is like the magic spot you

472
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,880
know if you have the booth where you

473
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:30,359
know and when I was working with the

474
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:33,159
Lazy Lion we would always go out of our

475
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:35,519
way to have one of the biggest booths

476
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:39,880
and to have extra space so people could

477
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:42,359
hang out and to have that social aspect

478
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,679
of it and I would always tell all these

479
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:48,959
breeders like you don't need a booth you

480
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:51,720
can come set up at my at my booth and uh

481
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,679
sell seeds make money you know we can

482
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:57,519
combine the traffic of everybody over

483
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:59,038
there and it it it worked real well for

484
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:01,759
a long time and every everybody was

485
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:04,879

of seeds gave a ton of seeds away you

489
00:21:11,798 --> 00:21:16,359
know so

490
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:19,000
uh it was good times back in the day and

491
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:21,639
I I hope uh the industry can get back to

492
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,159
there at some point there has to we got

493
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,600
to kind of level out at some point I

494
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,278
think I think like what we're trying to

495
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:29,599
do with the show too is to bring back

496
00:21:27,278 --> 00:21:31,400
some of that culture um teach some of

497
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:35,278
the younger dudes that this [ __ ] did

498
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:36,880
exist does exist can exist and that

499
00:21:35,278 --> 00:21:38,278
there there is something deeper than

500
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,320
just like trying to strain hunt the

501
00:21:38,278 --> 00:21:42,079
newest cookies and flashing your and

502
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:44,158
flexing your [ __ ] on Instagram like

503
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:46,240
you're some big baller like there's a

504
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,120
lot more culture involved in that like

505
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,880
love and Brotherhood yeah very deep that

506
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:53,959
last last decades and span decades you

507
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,880
know that they can become a part of and

508
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:59,200
be involved in if they're good

509
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:02,640
people the newer generation too I think

510
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:05,159
uh they're spoiled in the sense that

511
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,559
uh we gave them so much stuff that they

512
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:10,278
didn't have to work for at all yeah very

513
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:12,720
true very [ __ ] true you know these

514
00:22:10,278 --> 00:22:15,119
events like they were kind of taboo for

515
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:18,360
a while there and it's like people were

516
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:19,839
scared to go to cannabis cups like early

517
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:22,918
on because it's like they didn't want to

518
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:25,319
be associated with them or seen at him

519
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:27,480
or something and just the the whole

520
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:29,839
shift of how how it's changed over the

521
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,599
years and the Dynamic of how people

522
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:34,678
approach them and how they're utilized

523
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:37,278
and stuff is uh it's interesting to see

524
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:39,038
you know I miss I miss how Emerald cup

525
00:22:37,278 --> 00:22:42,278
was out here because we get a lot of you

526
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:44,879
guys out here for Emerald cup and like

527
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:48,159
getting to see guys like Rao you know

528
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,120
you guys and interacting and it it was

529
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,720
super [ __ ] cool because we don't

530
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:53,558
living across the country we don't get

531
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,600
to see each other to often and and a lot

532
00:22:53,558 --> 00:22:58,798
of that culture has been lost with the

533
00:22:55,599 --> 00:23:00,719
emerald cup how Corporate it's gone not

534
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:02,798
cup used to be kind of the the thing

535
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,120
that

536
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,599
everybody was it was looked at as kind

537
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:09,199
of like the equilibrium where it was

538
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:12,639
fair playing ground and the best of the

539
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:15,038
best was going to go there and then it

540
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,759
turned into sponsorship dollars yeah and

541
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:19,440
seed companies would make like their

542
00:23:16,759 --> 00:23:22,278
their money for the year there dude like

543
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,919
that's make a chunk there and that and

544
00:23:22,278 --> 00:23:27,880
it would feed a lot of people I've seen

545
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:31,320
uh I've been at the booth you know yeah

546
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:33,440
right with with people and seing uh well

547
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:36,839
end of the six figures come in over over

548
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,919
the weekend for sure you know those

549
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:41,359
weekends I don't know how many of them

550
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:43,720
there are these days but back in the day

551
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:45,319
there were some good weekends yeah dude

552
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,759
there there really isn't anymore I mean

553
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:49,759
like um if you're not like a registered

554
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:52,640
licensed company you're not getting in

555
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:55,759
and that's just that so a lot of of us

556
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,840
just don't give a [ __ ] about that part

557
00:23:55,759 --> 00:24:01,038
of it you know not me of course I'm

558
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:04,079
totally legal and uh follow every law so

559
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:06,519
you know yeah I thought I thought

560
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:09,240
Emerald cup probably peaked in like

561
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:12,038
2016 and then after that it just kind of

562
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:14,319
got like you know more more just

563
00:24:12,038 --> 00:24:17,359
corporatized and more about the business

564
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:19,079
than than actually an event for Growers

565
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:21,278
um because it was always good going out

566
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:22,558
there because like as a grower you know

567
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:24,519
you yeah you can go to all these other

568
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:26,398
cups and you know High Times Cannabis

569
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:28,679
Cup or whatever was going on but you

570
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:30,359
didn't really have access to like the

571
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:33,159
genetics and what was really happening

572
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:35,038
but you know Emerald cup whatever I go

573
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:37,080
see a doctor for five minutes right

574
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:38,519
there in line to get in and he checks my

575
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:41,639
arm and then I'm going in the back

576
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:43,440
medical area and you know and I get to

577
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:46,120
like talk to the Breeders and they have

578
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,480
jaars of the flower and I could open it

579
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:50,398
touch it smell it before I buy the seeds

580
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,960
like you couldn't do that online could

581
00:24:50,398 --> 00:24:54,798
do that anywhere you know so as a as a

582
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,600
grower it was the number one event

583
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:58,440
because like you could touch and feel

584
00:24:56,599 --> 00:25:00,599
the genetics before you grow it that's

585
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,880
so that's a that was a game Cher and

586
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:04,480
when they got rid of that I was like

587
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,720
there's no point in going anymore yeah

588
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,640
that's way I felt I stopped

589
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:10,480
participating myself everyone always

590
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:12,520
used to bring their special drops to the

591
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,960
emerald cup too like you know their big

592
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:18,398
crosses and their big drops and exive

594
00:25:18,398 --> 00:25:26,079

595
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:27,798
every year and far exceeded on uh uh

596
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:29,480

and uh just

601
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:43,399
so the genetics

602
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:46,240
uh that the Amo cup provided

603
00:25:43,398 --> 00:25:48,558
man hands down the best event I would

604
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,759

650
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,080
like at the same time I'm past it it's

651
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,679
just whatever you know yeah there's

652
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:48,319
always extenuating

653
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:50,519
circumstances that was one of the

654
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:52,038
benefits I felt like of the Cabana was

655
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:54,240
that because you had to go through this

656
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:57,480
invite process and they were more strict

657
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,679
about you know starting [ __ ] that you

658
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,960
didn't have just like trolls like I mean

659
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:05,360
we were all on like IC mag and all these

660
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:06,798
other sites before that you know and and

661
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:08,319
you could just create another account

662
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:10,558
create another email whatever go on

663
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:12,398
there talk you could talk [ __ ] about

664
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:14,678
yourself as a way to Hype yourself up as

665
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:17,518
a seed brand because just to get drama

666
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:19,320
started or whatever abely do that you

667
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:21,399
know but you couldn't none of that was

668
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:23,240
flying on the Cabana because I got

669
00:28:21,398 --> 00:28:25,879
booted so many times

670
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:28,599
bro yeah and it was you and you had to

671
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:30,960
like beg you know beg to get back on

672
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:33,480
there yeah dude you know I'd have like

673
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,679
long conversations like three four hours

674
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:40,399
with with hoe with the admins of like

675
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:42,519
all right I'm sorry you know yeah yeah

676
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:44,879
there were Zero Tolerance policies and

677
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:49,679
then there were Cabana Zero Tolerance

678
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:51,200
policies man and they took them to uh um

679
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,320
another level back in the day but they

680
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,399
were actually needed at the time they

681
00:28:53,319 --> 00:29:00,359
really were they really were and it

682
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:04,359
offered uh it made the bana a place that

683
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:06,759
uh for I mean for so many reasons but

684
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:08,918
that one specifically made it different

685
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:11,480
than the other places man because

686
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:15,880
somebody got in there and mouthing off

687
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:19,319
like it it was it was deleted it was

688
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:22,240
reported he was banned it was never an

689
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:23,839
issue yeah you know and I never I never

690
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,759
held any hard feelings because I always

691
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:27,158
knew it's like that's the old guard at

692
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:29,079
the Cabana and they don't put up with

693
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:31,919
that [ __ ] so I never hard feelings I was

694
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:34,199
like yeah I probably [ __ ] too far on

695
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,640
that one you know like you kind to know

696
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,080
you got to self check a little bit but

697
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,480
they've always been even after that

698
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:41,798
though they were always [ __ ] cool to

699
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:44,440
me you know what I mean so it's always

700
00:29:41,798 --> 00:29:47,558
been a place close to my heart even with

701
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:49,600
the Cabana and me you know there was I I

702
00:29:47,558 --> 00:29:53,879
did a lot of things that weren't exactly

703
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:57,119
like uh Cabana friendly activities sure

704
00:29:53,880 --> 00:30:00,120
so I wasn't on there actively for a long

705
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:02,798
time but I I'd still be belly boating

706
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:06,319
with hoe on the weekends and going

707
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:07,119
fishing and at all the barbecues and you

708
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:09,839
know

709
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:12,199
so I I I don't have many posts on the

710
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:14,959
Cabana I I was never like the most

711
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:17,440
active guy on there

712
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:20,399
and but it's

713
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,000
because I was working with seeds boom

714
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:24,158
I'm working with all these breeders I'm

715
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,159
doing all these things I'm doing all

716
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:29,360
these testers and boom they don't like

717
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:32,200
seeds I'm you know growing weed for this

718
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:34,798
giant dab bar where it's like a smoke

719
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:37,720
facility and yeah yeah you know we don't

720
00:30:34,798 --> 00:30:40,000
want to promote that to the to the crowd

721
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:42,480
and so there's just things I was doing

722
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,960
that uh weren't Cabana friendly but I

723
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:51,558
was still always around with the Cabana

724
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:55,200
and um you know skdy I give him a ton of

725
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:58,200
props because to this day I still grow

726
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,639
just my own version of Skitty Tech you

727
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:04,120
know it's all yeah yeah essentially the

728
00:31:00,638 --> 00:31:07,839
same um kind of technique I I switch up

729
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:10,398
my nutrients and I've done things you

730
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:12,798
know tons of different ways where skdy

731
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:15,319
is pretty tried and true and he does not

732
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:18,240
yes he does deviate from his script very

733
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:21,038
often and uh Still rocking it with

734
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,399
tremendous success to this day you know

735
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:25,759
so and skdy was the first dude that I

736
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:28,079
met like years ago this like

737
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:30,679
2011 where he's like yeah I only got got

738
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:32,158
like 3.1 per light on this round you

739
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:34,880
know I'm going to do better next time

740
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,559
and it's like everybody used to throw

741
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,880
those numbers around on the forums and

742
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:42,319
we're like yeah bro whatever Forum right

743
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:44,519
and but like I had the you know I'd see

744
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:47,000
his garden i' see how meticulous he was

745
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:48,759
in his canopy and I even went there just

746
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,519
to trim for him a couple times and just

747
00:31:48,759 --> 00:31:52,720
to see what it was and I'm like bro

748
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:57,599
these really do weigh what he says they

749
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:59,319
do like like wow and and you know he was

750
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:03,319
you know like curb said there's a lot of

751
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:06,519
just consistency there and um you know

752
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:09,439
he he he just was like he just had his

753
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:11,319
method and uh I mean it was kind of like

754
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,840
early crop steering before we knew what

755
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:15,960
it was because he'd be watering them a

756
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:18,519
couple times a day by hand you know go

757
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:20,720
back you know yeah skinny steering there

758
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:24,240
you go you know but yeah sometimes he's

759
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:26,558
hand water four times a day you know so

760
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:29,278
um and and we didn't understand that

761
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:31,359
then like more water more equals more

762
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:32,919
yield like really like you know like

763
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:34,638
isn't it already wet what does that

764
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:37,960
matter yeah

765
00:32:34,638 --> 00:32:40,240
right you know but but yeah he he he

766
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,798
really proved that because yeah because

767
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,480
I mean back in the day like on the

768
00:32:41,798 --> 00:32:46,480
forums everybody like said whatever you

769
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,519
know it was hard to prove anybody's real

770
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:52,038
yields and everyone's setups was was it

771
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:54,720
was primitive you know so it's not like

772
00:32:52,038 --> 00:32:57,519
we had deuses on the ceiling and like we

773
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,519
just slap job and even even even bigger

774
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,599
bigger grows 100 lighters I mean we were

775
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,798
using residential AC's and like we

776
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:05,000
didn't really know what we were doing

777
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:08,759
then you know from an engineering like

778
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,759
design standpoint at least so um so it

779
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:13,798
was just cool to have that open sharing

780
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:15,519
of knowledge but but like what was

781
00:33:13,798 --> 00:33:18,599
different for the Cabana was just it was

782
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:21,000
so genetic centered and you know like

783
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:23,000
like curb said at the beginning like you

784
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,440
know it was all it's just like open a

785
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,880
door like you know like The Gatekeepers

786
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:31,519
had finally opened the gate to like all

787
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,720
the hoarded clone ones of the time that

788
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,558
you only read about that you know like

789
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:38,440
we were like ah it's finally my turn to

790
00:33:35,558 --> 00:33:40,558
be the cool kid you know right and you

791
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,720
could finally see pictures good grows of

792
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:44,000
some of these things that you'd only

793
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:46,240
heard about and and you know I mean when

794
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,599
you look on IC mag you'd see people

795
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,759
growing it it'd be like nine obviously

796
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:52,398
different plants that weren't related

797
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:54,359
but finally on the Cabana you could see

798
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:57,199
legit [ __ ] being grown and that was

799
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:58,839
something special I think and uh and

800
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,120
it's and it's one of the things I'm

801
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:02,678
telling people now like why should you

802
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:05,079
visit the cavana because you can finally

803
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:07,600
see that [ __ ] you can finally go look

804
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:09,279
and see all that stuff it's there you

805
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:10,440
know like this is this is important

806
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,839
historical

807
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:15,918
documentation I do encourage people to

808
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:19,440
dig through these forums man and look

809
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:22,279
through some of these old posts and you

810
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:25,760
will be shocked at who you

811
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:29,320
see chiming in And discussing things

812
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:31,679
like back in the day when it was like uh

813
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:34,440
you know ghost OG was the hot thing it's

814
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:37,480
like I knew we had the real ghost cuz

815
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:40,000
how we got the ghost from Ghost you know

816
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:43,039
what I mean and it was like

817
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,679
uh there was never any question about it

818
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:49,358
and the authenticity of clones when

819
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:51,720
people really started

820
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:54,358
like trading

821
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:57,279
genetics it was a blessing and a curse

822
00:34:54,358 --> 00:35:01,400
at the same time because you got the

823
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:03,000
people who got the real genetics and

824
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,480
will share them and get them out to

825
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,358
people and then you got other people who

826
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:14,159
will take any old thing and just say oh

827
00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:17,159
this is sfv yeah Kush and uh when you're

828
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:20,078
somebody trapping out a 10 lighter or 20

829
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:22,639
lighter or and that's your main thing

830
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:26,480
you got your whole garden riding on

831
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:28,559
this riding on this sfv OG clone or

832
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:32,679
whatever it may be and then it's some

833
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:34,920
boof [ __ ] that's not the real thing you

834
00:35:32,679 --> 00:35:37,519
know even if it's good but it's not sfv

835
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:40,480
it's like you know that was the hard

836
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:42,559
part was confirming things but the

837
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,079
Cabana everything was like already

838
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:47,519
confirmed I see mag THC farmer

839
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:49,160
everything came like with a level of

840
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:51,559
skepticism there's so much [ __ ]

841
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:53,799
shenanigans on those places bro I can't

842
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:56,239
even there's not a lot good I can say

843
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:59,318
about those places to be honest I mean

844
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:01,838
granted I love those and I encourage

845
00:35:59,318 --> 00:36:06,199
everybody man I want every back in the

846
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:09,199
day I was on THC farmer IC

847
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:09,199
mag

848
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:16,680
um troll it up I I was never on roll it

849
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:18,960
up but uh Ivan from Jungle boys had his

850
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:20,679
own little Forum like there for a minute

851
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:24,599
I can't even remember what it was called

852
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:26,559
right now uh can of collective I think

853
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:29,039
um oh God

854
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:30,400
yeah that might have been a seed bank I

855
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:33,880
can't remember yeah that was that was

856
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:36,119
the uh after that that Forum pot pimp

857
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:37,240
went down it became can of collective

858
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:40,880
you remember

859
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:43,078
pool the UK group oh [ __ ] what a dumbass

860
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:46,640
name for a forum there was another one

861
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:49,880
that like um like cornbread and a couple

862
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:52,279
guys were on that was uh bunch of Cali

863
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:54,920
guys were running it like Sway and those

864
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:56,280
guys from like Sacramento um and

865
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:58,318
everybody would always be in the chat

866
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:00,200
room what was the name of that I can't

867
00:36:58,318 --> 00:37:02,639
remember it was another one I don't know

868
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:04,679
was invited it was like trying to be

869
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:06,239
like the Cabana but it never really took

870
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:08,199
off other than the chat room and the

871
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:10,199
chat room was just people like late at

872
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:13,879
night talking [ __ ] while their res was

873
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:15,838
filling up basically yeah you know like

874
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:19,160
I was always formally disinvited from

875
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:21,159
these places bro like uh what be it IC

876
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:23,598
mags I wouldn't sell my seeds there and

877
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:25,799
then logic in the farm there's a actual

878
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:27,559
like when you Google Matt Riot first

879
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:30,760
thing that pops up is Matt Riot is a

880
00:37:27,559 --> 00:37:34,239
total douchebag on the farm like yeah

881
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:36,079
they love they love my ass

882
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:38,479
there

883
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:40,599
yeah there were actual like Forum

884
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,079
Superstars back in the day and Forum

885
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:44,480
villains and yeah I would definitely fit

886
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:47,400
the villain mold yeah you might have

887
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:50,000
been a villain man definitely a

888
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:51,960
villain yeah you kind of guess it like

889
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,480
uh you know whose troll account you're

890
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:57,599
interacting with you know yeah right we

891
00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:00,159
we knew we knew a few pretty infamous

892
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:04,000
trolls ourselves K

893
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:07,078
do we uh we have a buddy who he might he

894
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,480
he could be up there and uh top

895
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:12,839
trolls which one on the forums in the

896
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:16,760
game man but still still too big I think

897
00:38:12,838 --> 00:38:21,519
was his name still too big still too big

898
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:23,079
yeah he he's a a real life troll and uh

899
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:24,679
he's also one of the best dudes in the

900
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:29,039
world he would give you a shirt off his

901
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:31,960
back so as trolls go he was our Troll

902
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:34,079
and yeah for sure yeah I think he

903
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:35,838
disseminated more genetics that were

904
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:38,318
supposed to have restrictions on them

905
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:39,880
than anybody I ever met he was just like

906
00:38:38,318 --> 00:38:41,480
he was like what I'm not supposed to

907
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,440
give this to anybody all right I'm gonna

908
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:45,838
give it to like 50

909
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:48,200
people you don't give him a cut with

910
00:38:45,838 --> 00:38:49,880
conditions forget it right something in

911
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:52,000
your garden with conditions like Okie

912
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:53,880
was saying like don't even tell him

913
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,400
because the second you tell him like oh

914
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:57,960
you can't have this one that's the one

915
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,639
he's taken like

916
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,240
bath he's going to do whatever he's

917
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:02,639
going to go down God bless and then he's

918
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:04,759
going to come up the stairs and tell you

919
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:08,159
hey I just stole that clone from there

920
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:10,680
man I'm going home the up yeah he have

921
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:15,039
it in his ear like a like a pencil or a

922
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:17,519
joint he just have the Clone there like

923
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:19,358
out so I want to start getting into some

924
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:22,358
of you dudes like what your Specialties

925
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:24,039
are Okie what's your specialty like

926
00:39:22,358 --> 00:39:28,559
where did you take cannabis where did

927
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:32,079
you find your niche in this uh WI world

928
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:35,960
man um you know that that's a tough one

929
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:39,119
to to answer um I think like if I do

930
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:43,000
have a specialty it's just uh you know

931
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:45,640
being able to uh put a concept together

932
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,599
and you know get people excited about it

933
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:52,358
and then you know follow through on the

934
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:55,559
execution um you know for from a growing

935
00:39:52,358 --> 00:39:58,279
perspective uh uh a lot of the stuff

936
00:39:55,559 --> 00:40:00,279
that we're working on now is all to me

937
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:02,640
like the the crop steering stuff you

938
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:07,560
know all of the science associated with

939
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:10,118
that and uh you know uh we're we're all

940
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:13,519
uh uh used to growing in the basement

941
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:16,160
and then you know I had a a brief uh a

942
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:19,000
bit of greenhouse Growing Experience but

943
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:21,078
uh yeah no the the legal and uh

944
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,480
commercial stuff is like fairly new to

945
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:29,318
me yeah and how's that been for you oh

946
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:31,639
it's good I mean uh uh the there there's

947
00:40:29,318 --> 00:40:33,440
uh good and bad with it I mean I don't

948
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:36,759
have to worry about anyone kicking in my

949
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:41,800
door anymore but um you know going

950
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:44,640
through uh testing uh sucks a lot and uh

951
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:46,839
you know uh dealing with metric and just

952
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:49,480
you know the stress associated with uh

953
00:40:46,838 --> 00:40:52,039
running a legal business is uh on a

954
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:56,199
different level than uh anything

955
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:58,440
Legacy how has um hlv affected uh

956
00:40:56,199 --> 00:41:01,679
anything that you're doing

957
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:07,039
uh you know knock on wood uh no effects

958
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:10,519
so far but um um you know we uh we we've

959
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:13,279
done a lot of our uh own feno hunting um

960
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:15,519
you know we try to to we try to you know

961
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,079
do a lot of our stuff from seed just so

962
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:19,800
that uh we're able to find out which

963
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:21,720
genetics are really working in our

964
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:24,000
facility and our environment you know

965
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:26,639
for the practices that uh we're we're

966
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,480
implementing so and the genetics that

967
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:30,598
fit your grp dude like that's something

968
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,039
a lot of people don't understand is you

969
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:34,400
know like you hear about the hype

970
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:35,679
strains and you want them for sure

971
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,800
you're going to make it work and it's

972
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:40,559
not always how it goes you know so you

973

00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:44,799
your environment or that you can morph

975
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,480
just a little bit to grow with the

976
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,280
strain but at a certain point you know

977
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:51,639

Consulting and uh was always into a lot

1037
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:18,639
of the nutritive side of cannabis um had

1038
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:21,920
been you know been making my own custom

nud formulas you know dry salts and uh

1040
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:26,000
eventually kind of did a lot of stuff

1041
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:28,279
with soil soil analysis really thrown

1042
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:32,480
some science at soil techniques rather

1043
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:35,240
than just you know just guessing um and

1044
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,880
uh you know I was lucky through through

1045
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:39,000
Consulting that you know I got to step

1046
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:41,519
into some pretty big facilities and

1047
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,639
start to learn you know kind of how to

1048
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:47,119
talk to talk with those people and and

1049
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:51,480
and gain some business Acumen and and um

1050
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:54,800
you know uh soon after that like 2019

1051
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:56,679
20120 uh really up until last year uh

1052
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:59,559
that whole period that that you know

1053
00:44:56,679 --> 00:45:01,879
four four five years um I've spent in

1054
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:05,680
various just director roles around the

1055
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:08,720
country um at at larger commercial

1056
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:12,279
facilities um you know nothing really

1057
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:14,039
stuck unfortunately um and and and a lot

1058
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:17,200
of places you know I was just grinding

1059
00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:19,800
myself to the Bone um and it was either

1060
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:21,879
like you know it just wasn't a fit as

1061
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:23,640
far as the chemistry with the owners or

1062
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:25,599
they were just like I came in as their

1063
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:28,400
like fifth grower and the place was a

1064
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:30,240
mess oh yeah and you can only fix it so

1065
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,079
much because they're broke or they're

1066
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:33,759
going through a lawsuit or you know what

1067
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:37,960
I mean it's just like that's the hardest

1068
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:39,480
position to be put in it is um and uh

1069
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:42,318
you know and I met some good people in

1070
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:43,760
that world as well and you know kind of

1071
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:47,679
learned how to manage people a little

1072
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:52,079
bit better and uh manage my time manage

1073
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:53,440
you know tasks and software and and and

1074
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:56,760
uh you know just do other things that

1075
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:58,720
you didn't really do as a grower yeah so

1076
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:02,000
uh but always kind of going back to the

1077
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:04,239
nutritive side always like focused on um

1078
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,239
efficiencies you know both Oki and I are

1079
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:08,959
both Engineers by you know academically

1080
00:46:07,239 --> 00:46:12,000
so it's like you're always thinking

1081
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:14,079
efficiencies and and um you hopefully

1082
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,039
not the sacrifice quality but just

1083
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:20,000
asking like the the hows and the wise of

1084
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:22,440
a lot of the things you're doing and um

1085
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,599
you know and and taking that approach

1086
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:27,519
and so right now I'm working with hor gr

in the future just because I I I like uh

1201
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:20,559
I like seeing the the Next Generation

1202
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:24,039
take it to a new level and he's one of

1203
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:26,798
the people doing it

1204
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:29,599
yeah all right so let's talk about some

1205
00:51:26,798 --> 00:51:30,440
of the Cabana stuff and where what kind

1206
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:32,119
of stuff are you going to be

1207
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:33,440
implementing how is it going to change

1208
00:51:32,119 --> 00:51:37,200
from where it

1209
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:38,920
was uh when I you know was on it for a

1210
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:40,919
while and then off and then on and then

1211
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,960
off and then on and how's it going to go

1212
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:45,240
into the

1213
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:47,559
future most important thing for everyone

1214
00:51:45,239 --> 00:51:50,679
to take in is that we are open to the

1215
00:51:47,559 --> 00:51:54,040

school knowledge on there I'm trying

1222
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:13,599
hard to get the new generation to come

1223
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:16,680

1225
00:52:16,679 --> 00:52:21,798

1226
00:52:19,159 --> 00:52:24,199

00:57:07,159 --> 00:57:11,118
that's the other thing everybody's got

1336
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:13,159
their own discords everybody's got yeah

1337
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:15,798
Instagram everybody's got Facebook

1338
00:57:13,159 --> 00:57:17,279
everybody's got half a dozen social

1339
00:57:15,798 --> 00:57:19,679
media profiles that they have to

1340
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:22,240
maintain and so we're just fighting for

1341
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:26,838
our space and we have to prove our value

1342
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:30,078
to um get everybody to come but uh

1343
00:57:26,838 --> 00:57:32,639
the old school people like we we got

1344
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:34,599
them and I think there's going to be a

1345
00:57:32,639 --> 00:57:37,920
new appreciation

1346
00:57:34,599 --> 00:57:39,559
for the old school and what they had and

1347
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:42,280
what they had to offer because I think

1348
00:57:39,559 --> 00:57:44,720
these Exotics

1349
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:49,519

1458
01:02:51,679 --> 01:02:56,598
of those dudes who I think is also super

1459
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:59,160
slept on because

1460
01:02:56,599 --> 01:03:03,519
he was making beans and packaging up

1461
01:02:59,159 --> 01:03:06,558
beans and kind of grinding on the

1462
01:03:03,519 --> 01:03:09,719
Underground State Side scene like before

1463
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:12,440
most people were man yeah and uh he had

1464
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:14,239
he's got some great stuff man yeah he

1465
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:17,318
had a Durango OG I think it was called

1466
01:03:14,239 --> 01:03:20,439
it was really good fire fire OG had some

1467
01:03:17,318 --> 01:03:23,318
white Voodoo and some big white and

1468
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:25,880
lemon aliens and he he had some good

1469
01:03:23,318 --> 01:03:28,079
stuff back in the day yeah lots of

1470
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:29,640
respect for that dude yeah he was for a

1471
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:31,440
while he started getting really big but

1472
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:33,759
I think he just kind of backed off a

1473
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:35,798
little bit from the scene and uh slowed

1474
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:37,799
down but yeah the respect still there

1475
01:03:35,798 --> 01:03:40,000
definitely for him from uh people I

1476
01:03:37,798 --> 01:03:42,400
think he started doing uh some hemp

1477
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:46,278
stuff and I know he was doing some stuff

1478
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:49,160
uh um internationally as well so good he

1479
01:03:46,278 --> 01:03:51,159
stays busy man he posted up some picture

1480
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:53,239
he's one of those guys who can go away

1481
01:03:51,159 --> 01:03:54,719
and you don't hear from him or see

1482
01:03:53,239 --> 01:03:56,558
anything from him for like three or four

1483
01:03:54,719 --> 01:03:59,318
years and then he posts up picture of

1484
01:03:56,559 --> 01:04:03,519
like some Mega Greenhouse that's

1485
01:03:59,318 --> 01:04:05,920
going 400 yards full of

1486
01:04:03,519 --> 01:04:09,719
[ __ ] more than my ass that's for

1487
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:12,639
[ __ ] sure yeah so he always stays

1488
01:04:09,719 --> 01:04:15,919
with a project he's a worker yeah I dude

1489
01:04:12,639 --> 01:04:17,920
that's cool that's really cool but yeah

1490
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:21,559
so Phil would give me tons of stuff when

1491
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:25,159
I went to the lion um Phil also hooked

1492
01:04:21,559 --> 01:04:29,798
me up with uh a guy named Mike Finelli

1493
01:04:25,159 --> 01:04:31,399
and uh he does a ton of

1494
01:04:29,798 --> 01:04:34,358
uh

1495
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:38,119
um like grow design he he'll get your

1496
01:04:34,358 --> 01:04:42,759
room all set up he was working with uh

1497
01:04:38,119 --> 01:04:44,240
oh man kick myself he uh these old

1498
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:45,920
controllers what were the old

1499
01:04:44,239 --> 01:04:48,278
controllers

1500
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:49,838
called before the troll Masters

1501
01:04:48,278 --> 01:04:53,400
everybody had one of these I can't

1502
01:04:49,838 --> 01:04:55,239
remember what it was called but uh he

1503
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:57,480
helped design those and then he worked

1504
01:04:55,239 --> 01:05:00,199
with a guy named Bo who owned

1505
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:02,679
chlorophyll up here in Denver which is

1506
01:05:00,199 --> 01:05:07,919
just like a nutrient you know just a

1507
01:05:02,679 --> 01:05:10,960
little uh Hydro shop and he plugged me

1508
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:12,559
up with so many people that

1509
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:15,880
um

1510
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:18,960
just because I knew Phil took extra good

1511
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:22,079
care of me you know so I was getting the

1512
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:24,159
plug on nutrients I was I got the plug

1513
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:26,079
on the room design and the buildout and

1514
01:05:24,159 --> 01:05:29,278
stuff I mean these guys came down and

1515
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:31,039
they moved into the warehouse with me

1516
01:05:29,278 --> 01:05:33,440
down in Colorado Springs and we're like

1517
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:36,880
building this thing out 24 you know

1518
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:40,318
around the clock so they grind

1519
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:43,240
and that just comes from his kind of his

1520
01:05:40,318 --> 01:05:44,440
work mentality yeah dude I I really

1521
01:05:43,239 --> 01:05:45,959
think if he would have stuck with the

1522
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:48,798
black market scene at least he would

1523
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:51,798
have been uh much more on the CSI level

1524
01:05:48,798 --> 01:05:54,239
in respect you know what I mean um but

1525
01:05:51,798 --> 01:05:55,440
dipping away you know a lot of people

1526
01:05:54,239 --> 01:05:57,278
don't remember him as well and I think

1527
01:05:55,440 --> 01:06:00,318
he name deserves more respect and should

1528
01:05:57,278 --> 01:06:02,440
be back out there you know he's one of

1529
01:06:00,318 --> 01:06:05,199
those guys too who's always doing a

1530
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:06,880
breeding project and exactly probably

1531
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:10,719
got

1532
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:12,559
like Walkin freezers full of gear I know

1533
01:06:10,719 --> 01:06:14,759
I need to see that I need to get up in

1534
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:16,680
there I need to get my hands on it I

1535
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:18,760
need to man I've already been asking him

1536
01:06:16,679 --> 01:06:20,399
I was like hey remember when you gave me

1537
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:22,240
all those beans you should do something

1538
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:26,880
like that again so I

1539
01:06:22,239 --> 01:06:29,959
can right right so

1540
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:33,440
um but man Phil is awesome he's probably

1541
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:33,440
one of my biggest

1542
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:39,720
uh I mean he's like somebody I actually

1543
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:42,440
looked up to in the weed like a mentor

1544
01:06:39,719 --> 01:06:45,759
of sort yeah you know he always did it

1545
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:49,039
uh big and as I started getting into

1546
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:52,119
managing commercial facilities

1547
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:55,119
and um bigger projects and stuff like

1548
01:06:52,119 --> 01:06:59,160
that you realize like the undertaking

1549
01:06:55,119 --> 01:07:02,920
that they actually are you know I mean

1550
01:06:59,159 --> 01:07:06,199
everybody everybody can grow good weed

1551
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:09,519
but can you do scale can you do it at

1552
01:07:06,199 --> 01:07:11,838
scale and growing it at scale is

1553
01:07:09,519 --> 01:07:14,559
uh

1554
01:07:11,838 --> 01:07:16,440
just bigger challenges bigger risks

1555
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:19,798
bigger losses you know what I mean

1556
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:22,480
something goes wrong and uh your four

1557
01:07:19,798 --> 01:07:26,358
lighter it's a lot easier to recover

1558
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:28,240
from you know a 40 Lightroom you know

1559
01:07:26,358 --> 01:07:32,400
issue that's why you're looking at a

1560
01:07:28,239 --> 01:07:32,399
bunch of bald guys right now

1561
01:07:33,079 --> 01:07:38,599
yeah right so yeah and I don't think I

1562
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:39,760
probably would have had the confidence

1563
01:07:38,599 --> 01:07:42,039
to

1564
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:45,119
do

1565
01:07:42,039 --> 01:07:47,960
uh um these bigger facilities if I

1566
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:50,838
hadn't been able to spend the time

1567
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:53,159
asking questions and seeing Rojo's

1568
01:07:50,838 --> 01:07:54,278
facilities and how the things that he

1569
01:07:53,159 --> 01:07:57,440
was doing

1570
01:07:54,278 --> 01:07:57,440
to uh

1571
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:02,000
just make everything run smooth and just

1572
01:08:00,519 --> 01:08:04,199
well oiled machine and that's what you

1573
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,318
got to have on a commercial level you

1574
01:08:04,199 --> 01:08:08,399
know so I kind of got a question for you

1575
01:08:06,318 --> 01:08:12,119

Greywolf at some point yeah but he put

1605
01:09:34,238 --> 01:09:38,278
me on game to this place back in the day

1606

called Glacier tanks and I want to say

1607
01:09:38,279 --> 01:09:43,640
they were up in Oregon or Washington or

1608
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:48,759
somewhere Northeast and I started buying

1609
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:48,759
all these stainless steel tubes and

1610
01:09:49,838 --> 01:09:55,640
uh my dad uh owns a welding company and

1611
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:58,000
got a machine shop and stuff and so like

1612
01:09:55,640 --> 01:10:01,400
when I had an idea it was easy for me to

1613
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:03,880
execute like oh let's try this let's do

1614
01:10:01,399 --> 01:10:07,238
that and uh I would get these stainless

1615
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:10,960
steel tubes and I had like 50 of them

1616
01:10:07,238 --> 01:10:13,678
and three feet by an inch and a half and

1617
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:16,600
you could pack them with a half pound of

1618
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:19,800
weed and

1619
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:24,280
um I started

1620
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:26,760
ordering um tin and I was in Colorado

1621
01:10:24,279 --> 01:10:29,039
I'm pretty sure I was the first person

1622
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:32,400
had that license right that wanted

1623
01:10:29,039 --> 01:10:33,840
entain because when I was asking General

1624
01:10:32,399 --> 01:10:35,799
Air which is like the biggest gas

1625
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:39,119
supplier out in Denver across the

1626
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:41,400
country like man I need some butane and

1627
01:10:39,119 --> 01:10:42,760
they were just for what what what could

1628
01:10:41,399 --> 01:10:46,439
you possibly

1629
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:49,159
need you know a bottle of butane for for

1630
01:10:46,439 --> 01:10:50,839
yeah and uh they had to do some research

1631
01:10:49,158 --> 01:10:52,279
to even find it to see if they could get

1632
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:55,119
it and they ended up getting it from

1633
01:10:52,279 --> 01:10:57,800
Texas and I'd have to give them heads up

1634
01:10:55,119 --> 01:10:59,319
um um when I need it and then I started

1635
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:02,960
just telling them I was like here's your

1636
01:10:59,319 --> 01:11:05,439
heads up like I need it like yeah just

1637
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:06,279
keep shipping it up here like have me on

1638
01:11:05,439 --> 01:11:09,678
a

1639
01:11:06,279 --> 01:11:12,880
rotation and so I had I had quick

1640
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:16,560
connects and I just boom turn my bottle

1641
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:18,600
of butane on blast through a tube fill

1642
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:22,159
it into a one gallon glass

1643
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:25,800
pitcher pour it into a pie pan

1644
01:11:22,158 --> 01:11:27,679
and for a long time

1645
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:32,679
I don't want to say a long time for a

1646
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:36,440
short time I was getting more money

1647
01:11:32,679 --> 01:11:39,000
doing 5050 splits with people than I was

1648
01:11:36,439 --> 01:11:40,919
like on a regular crop someone would

1649
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:44,960
give me their crop and I was able to pay

1650
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:47,440
them more for their crop off of their

1651
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:50,639
50% sure

1652
01:11:47,439 --> 01:11:53,719
than they could even get selling 100% of

1653
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:56,840
it in flour there was so damn much need

1654
01:11:53,719 --> 01:11:57,920
for it at the time that market mive and

1655
01:11:56,840 --> 01:12:00,560
it

1656
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:02,800
was there's not a lot of markets that

1657
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:04,840
I've hit at the right time where it's

1658
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:06,600
like I got in like right at the right

1659
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:09,760
time that was the right time I wasn't

1660
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:13,360
one I was early uh so not a lot of

1661
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:16,880
people had volume like I had somebody

1662
01:12:13,359 --> 01:12:20,039
might had access and all of it yeah yeah

1663
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:21,880
so yeah to this day to this day one of

1664
01:12:20,039 --> 01:12:23,960
my best friends who's you know he was

1665
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:25,760
out in Oakland he was up on the hill you

1666
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:28,359
know 15 years ago

1667
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:31,600
and he he went out to one of kiry's

1668
01:12:28,359 --> 01:12:33,519
Barbecues in Aurora and when when KB had

1669
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:36,239
first built like the first Clos Loop and

1670
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:38,639
he was like bro even to this day like my

1671
01:12:36,238 --> 01:12:41,000
my buddy and Cali be like your your boy

1672
01:12:38,639 --> 01:12:44,239
Kirby was like ahead of the curve ahead

1673
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:45,920
of everybody on the cloth Loop Tech yeah

1674
01:12:44,238 --> 01:12:47,919
that's that's the one thing I I think

1675
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:50,279
you're pretty legendary for in my mind

1676
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:52,920
like when I think of Kirby I think of

1677
01:12:50,279 --> 01:12:56,079
all those like V trays all that [ __ ]

1678
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:59,960
just never seen anybody do it so it once

1679
01:12:56,079 --> 01:13:03,279
the the closed loop Tech 2 came from the

1680
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:05,960
forums yeah and it all

1681
01:13:03,279 --> 01:13:08,439
started I can't I can't remember who did

1682
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:11,439
it or the name of the what even Forum it

1683
01:13:08,439 --> 01:13:17,359
was on but it was

1684
01:13:11,439 --> 01:13:19,839
a uh some pressurized paint cans that uh

1685
01:13:17,359 --> 01:13:22,559
I did my first clothes Loop out of man

1686
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:27,079
out of Harbor Freight pressurized paint

1687
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:29,920
cans and yeah so I've I've done it every

1688
01:13:27,079 --> 01:13:32,399
single way possible uh good ways and bad

1689
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:34,760
ways so yes yeah I did the bad ways

1690
01:13:32,399 --> 01:13:37,119
early on the open blasting and [ __ ]

1691
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:41,199
yeah and then it got to a point where it

1692
01:13:37,119 --> 01:13:44,238
just the science of it all outgrew me

1693
01:13:41,198 --> 01:13:46,158
and these new guys with some of their

1694
01:13:44,238 --> 01:13:48,638
Clos Loop texts

1695
01:13:46,158 --> 01:13:50,759
and um the things that they're doing to

1696
01:13:48,639 --> 01:13:53,760
clean up the fats and the lipids and all

1697
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:57,320
you know all the things uh it's amazing

1698
01:13:53,760 --> 01:14:00,600
man and um one of my boys went the other

1699
01:13:57,319 --> 01:14:03,599
way to rosin yeah right I went to rosin

1700
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:05,840
man freeze dried rosin bro that that

1701
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:08,360
that's another Phil Story another Rojo

1702
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:11,840
story is

1703
01:14:08,359 --> 01:14:15,479
uh I was going out I was going to his

1704
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:18,440
warehouse and um kind

1705
01:14:15,479 --> 01:14:21,399
Bill uh was working there doing the

1706
01:14:18,439 --> 01:14:23,960
extracts and

1707
01:14:21,399 --> 01:14:25,719
um they were telling me about this new

1708
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:29,439
thing that they had done man they're

1709
01:14:25,719 --> 01:14:33,719
like oh man we we've invented live resin

1710
01:14:29,439 --> 01:14:37,198
and um it's uh it's so good and the tur

1711
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:39,319
profiles are this and it's just like

1712
01:14:37,198 --> 01:14:41,238
that they started showing it to me and

1713
01:14:39,319 --> 01:14:43,079
they were like telling me how to do it

1714
01:14:41,238 --> 01:14:45,759
and I was like oh all you got to do is

1715
01:14:43,079 --> 01:14:47,198
freeze it and then just yeah yeah do it

1716
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:49,679
do it the same way you just got to

1717
01:14:47,198 --> 01:14:53,559
freeze it beforehand like yeah I was

1718
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:55,119
like well [ __ ] bro I can do that and uh

1719
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:57,520
so they were telling me they're like

1720
01:14:55,119 --> 01:15:00,279
yeah you got to you got to get a cryo

1721
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:02,360
freezer and they're this expensive I'm

1722
01:15:00,279 --> 01:15:04,559
like oh [ __ ] but they didn't even have

1723
01:15:02,359 --> 01:15:05,880
the cryo freezer at the time like they

1724
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:09,320
were just telling me like they were

1725
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:11,760
gonna get it I wasn't even I don't think

1726
01:15:09,319 --> 01:15:14,000
I'd even started my car up from the

1727
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:16,400
parking lot before I had ordered a cryo

1728
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:20,279
freezer used off of

1729
01:15:16,399 --> 01:15:22,719
eBay and uh so for 500 bucks off eBay

1730
01:15:20,279 --> 01:15:25,479
man I had a used cryo freezer shipped up

1731
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:28,439
here and um

1732
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:33,158
I started doing live resin and uh I

1733
01:15:28,439 --> 01:15:36,479
taught my boy Lord rude booy how to

1734
01:15:33,158 --> 01:15:38,920
blast and process material uh when we're

1735
01:15:36,479 --> 01:15:40,479
at the lion and he's one of those guys

1736
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:43,319
where it's just like when the student

1737
01:15:40,479 --> 01:15:46,839
becomes the master because he just took

1738
01:15:43,319 --> 01:15:50,158
it to a whole another level and he can

1739
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:52,960
do it all disate rosin you know he's

1740
01:15:50,158 --> 01:15:55,119
he's a hashm can you real quick explain

1741
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:56,439
for me the definition of live resonance

1742
01:15:55,119 --> 01:15:58,760
something I've never been able because I

1743
01:15:56,439 --> 01:16:00,879
know you were at the base of it what is

1744
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:04,280
the true definition of live resin as it

1745
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:07,480
was originally meant to be live res I

1746
01:16:04,279 --> 01:16:09,679
mean to me it's just the preservation of

1747
01:16:07,479 --> 01:16:12,319
the freshest turps possible by freezing

1748
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:14,920
it as quickly as possible when you cut

1749
01:16:12,319 --> 01:16:16,519
it down and I always I always assumed

1750
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:18,719
like they were taking the live plant

1751
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:21,120
still in the pot like smashing it that

1752
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:23,119
way and that's the only way I had no

1753
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:26,880
clue what it meant well that's why you

1754
01:16:23,119 --> 01:16:29,840
want the cryo freezer cuz it gets colder

1755
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:32,639
faster so you can cut your plant down

1756
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:36,800
and there's less wilting and things like

1757
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:42,440
that uh in the freezing process how much

1758
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:43,920
of a difference does it make um it does

1759
01:16:42,439 --> 01:16:46,039
make a difference because you get less

1760
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:48,399
condensation and you get less water

1761
01:16:46,039 --> 01:16:51,359
build up

1762
01:16:48,399 --> 01:16:54,279
uh um but did the resins mature before

1763
01:16:51,359 --> 01:16:56,439
you do that no not if you're like

1764
01:16:54,279 --> 01:16:58,319
literally cutting it down putting it in

1765
01:16:56,439 --> 01:17:00,559
the bag getting it in the free do that

1766
01:16:58,319 --> 01:17:02,119
make a difference to some degree it's

1767
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:03,800
literally how fast you can do it you

1768
01:17:02,119 --> 01:17:07,599
don't want to cut it down let your plant

1769
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:09,520
sit outside for an hour two hours before

1770
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:11,199
it gets bagged up and put in the freezer

1771
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:13,760
it's like you want to chop it get it in

1772
01:17:11,198 --> 01:17:17,439
the bag get it in the freezer get it

1773
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:19,639
Frozen and uh that sounds like a forum

1774
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:22,479
argument already though you know someone

1775
01:17:19,639 --> 01:17:25,279
like no bro my shit's so dank it doesn't

1776
01:17:22,479 --> 01:17:27,599
matter I'll leave it out for a day still

1777
01:17:25,279 --> 01:17:28,759
make better hatch than your [ __ ] well

1778
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:30,400
like I think about it like with

1779
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:32,199
blueberry like a lot of the blueberries

1780
01:17:30,399 --> 01:17:34,879
need to cure for a month before they get

1781
01:17:32,198 --> 01:17:36,198
their blueberry TPS back in full form

1782
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:37,480
and I'm just wondering how difference

1783
01:17:36,198 --> 01:17:39,399
that would be how different that would

1784
01:17:37,479 --> 01:17:41,559
be with live resin and if it would be

1785
01:17:39,399 --> 01:17:44,599
worth it to do with that well man it I

1786
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:46,880
think it's totally worth it to compare

1787
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:51,840
the differences between a live resin

1788
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:54,079
turp and a well cured turp um

1789
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:55,600
cuz they're going to be totally

1790
01:17:54,079 --> 01:17:57,439
different you know if you're harvesting

1791
01:17:55,600 --> 01:18:01,159
a plant on harvest day when you're

1792
01:17:57,439 --> 01:18:05,238
cutting it down it smells different than

1793
01:18:01,158 --> 01:18:07,559
when it's smoke day after it's cured

1794
01:18:05,238 --> 01:18:10,198
absolutely same principle with live

1795
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:12,719
resin like you're cutting it down with

1796
01:18:10,198 --> 01:18:15,039
that tur profile that you're preserving

1797
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:16,639
at that moment in time and there was

1798
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:18,479
stuff like strawberry cream though that

1799
01:18:16,639 --> 01:18:20,880
smelled like strawberry straight off the

1800
01:18:18,479 --> 01:18:22,919
bush bro that would be perfect for live

1801
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:25,400
resin oh

1802
01:18:22,920 --> 01:18:28,920
manly I had uh

1803
01:18:25,399 --> 01:18:31,198
uh obsolete had sent me a bunch of his

1804
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:34,119
orange crosses when he had first made

1805
01:18:31,198 --> 01:18:37,119
orange juice Bud the orange juice bud

1806
01:18:34,119 --> 01:18:41,679
and I had you know the orange juice Bud

1807
01:18:37,119 --> 01:18:45,920
times sour dub times ghost OG

1808
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:48,480
times um

1809
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:51,199
GSC I can't even remember all of them

1810
01:18:48,479 --> 01:18:55,359
but that's what we were doing the the

1811
01:18:51,198 --> 01:18:58,000
dab bar down in Colorado Springs at The

1812
01:18:55,359 --> 01:19:00,279
Lazy Lion and yeah that's kind of like

1813
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:03,119
what made us famous man was these live

1814
01:19:00,279 --> 01:19:06,800
resin orange turps that we had down

1815
01:19:03,119 --> 01:19:08,399
there because like people were kind of

1816
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:11,920
just getting into dabs and they would

1817
01:19:08,399 --> 01:19:15,079
take a dab of you know some regular dab

1818
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:18,119
and be coughing and like oh sure almost

1819
01:19:15,079 --> 01:19:21,519
a painful experience man but then like

1820
01:19:18,119 --> 01:19:24,039
when people started like you know turp

1821
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:25,960
started coming through on dabs and you

1822
01:19:24,039 --> 01:19:29,119
know the live resin and all of that like

1823
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:31,359
it changed how people were smoking it

1824
01:19:29,119 --> 01:19:33,479
man it yeah especially with orange juice

1825
01:19:31,359 --> 01:19:36,519
but that [ __ ] Citrus is [ __ ] from the

1826
01:19:33,479 --> 01:19:40,000
jump oh undeniable flavor it's one of

1827
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:42,960
those uh you know obsolete just posted

1828
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:47,198
up on Instagram that his orange apricot

1829
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:48,840
got voted like best TPS and yeah they're

1830
01:19:47,198 --> 01:19:52,439
still doing like the legend orange

1831
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:55,480
apricot stuff like uh jaing on them yeah

1832
01:19:52,439 --> 01:19:58,759
yeah and uh those TS definitely need to

1833
01:19:55,479 --> 01:20:01,119
be preserved for sure but unfortunately

1834
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:04,000
those original crosses and I know OB

1835
01:20:01,119 --> 01:20:06,039
still has a few packs of The Originals I

1836
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:07,679
tried to get them off of them man and

1837
01:20:06,039 --> 01:20:10,439
he's kick him down

1838
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:13,960
OBS no he needs to hold on to him he

1839
01:20:10,439 --> 01:20:17,519
needs to do something with them but

1840
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:19,000
uh those TPS man out of that batch those

1841
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:22,280
were probably some of the best turps

1842
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:25,119
that's come out of a of

1843
01:20:22,279 --> 01:20:27,039
a public seed release and I don't even

1844
01:20:25,119 --> 01:20:28,439
know like how public those were I don't

1845
01:20:27,039 --> 01:20:30,359
know if he really sold them or if he

1846
01:20:28,439 --> 01:20:35,678
just kind of gave orange cookies was out

1847
01:20:30,359 --> 01:20:37,799
there a bunch yeah but uh man probably

1848
01:20:35,679 --> 01:20:41,199
some of the best TPS to hit the market

1849
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:44,960
in a noticeable while yeah yeah they

1850
01:20:41,198 --> 01:20:47,158
were good man they real good

1851
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:49,319

stoked been working on it for years they

1869
01:21:31,719 --> 01:21:37,239

1870
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:40,920
regular seeds where you can reliably

1871

1881
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:07,079
lot of interest because he's missed the
