00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,560
it's evolved into something bigger

8
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:20,920
better and more of a team effort we will

00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:05,679
all right uh welcome to Peter Syndicate

28
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,758
I'm Matthew here with my co-host

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,640
thousandfold and our friend farmer Dan

30
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:12,079
who's been a main stay on the show

31
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:16,079
welcome my friends um today we're going

32
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:20,879
to be talking kind of revisiting our our

33
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:23,359
uh cookies breeding with cookies and and

34
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:26,078
the dead ends of cookies and whether it

35
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:28,078
is a breeding dead end or not um I

36
00:01:26,078 --> 00:01:29,639
decided and actually we kind of as a

37
00:01:28,078 --> 00:01:30,359
group decided to revisit this a little

38
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,680
bit

39
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:35,359
uh I was rewatching the episode that we

40
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,920
did and I think it was super informative

41
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:40,799
at the beginning but um there's a few

42
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,759
narratives that got spun in it that just

43
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:47,079
don't ring true and I tried to kind of

44
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,519
put that put that out there during the

45
00:01:47,078 --> 00:01:50,039
episode while we were recording it but

46
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:53,438
it doesn't seem like it was heard very

47
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:56,200
well and now like I'm seeing stuff pop

48
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:58,158
up on social media that XYZ is

49
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,359
responsible for cookies and this and

50
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:04,079
that and it's just not true

51
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:07,519
and and of all things that we want to do

52
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:10,239
with this show is combat misinformation

53
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:12,639
like first and foremost it's it's not

54
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,878
good it's it's it's the opposite of our

55
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,559
mission to make it about an ego thing

56
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,560
like I'm responsible for this this and

57
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,920
this and no one else you know like all

58
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,319
that is is the opposite of what we want

59
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,639
to do and it is our biggest episode and

60
00:02:23,318 --> 00:02:26,878
uh it was a hard decision but we're

61
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,639
going to go ahead and redo it reshoot it

62
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:30,560
and try to keep it as accurate as we can

63
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:32,839
for the time being and again if things

64
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,560
change we'll do another one you know uh

65
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,759
as much as all of us are kind of sick of

66
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,280
talking about cookies and all its

67
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:40,120
derivatives it's uh un necessary thing

68
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,000
and it just seems like people only heard

69
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,400
the last I don't know two minutes of the

70
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,919
episode so with that thousand you want

71
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,280
to kick it off and and tell them where

72
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:52,919
we're taking

73
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:55,439
it yeah so I think where we start um is

74
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:59,359
looking at the major components at least

75
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:03,158
that we are aware of of cookies so I

76
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,200
think out of F1 derb cherry pie uh GDP

77
00:03:03,158 --> 00:03:07,719
purple urk and OG Kush maybe we start

78
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:10,439
with the F1 derb what do you think Matt

79
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:13,039
okay so the F1 derb is a very unique

80
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:17,759
plant uh it was not passed around a lot

81
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:20,359
there's a lot of um debate be it from

82
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:23,318
Kenny flowers or Powers

83
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,599
um he says that he's never passed the

84
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:27,518
cut but we know like he doesn't really

85
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:29,399
gr and like he has other people make

86
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,879
seeds for them so of course he has to

87
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,319
pass [ __ ] cut um but you know there

88
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,039
was a guy named Cookie Monster who kept

89
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:37,919
the F1 derb for a long time and he was

90
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:40,199
responsible for the F1 derb account on

91
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:44,280
Instagram and that's the exact cut that

92
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:46,359
we have in the circle um yeah it's it's

93
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,959
a unique cut it obviously has a lot of

94
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,560
the structure that you see in cookies

95
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:54,120
the really unique structure um the

96
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,598
bubbly bra very very specifically um the

97
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,959
knobby look that cookies has comes from

98
00:03:56,598 --> 00:04:03,318
a lot of the F1 derb stuff uh it's it's

99
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:04,719
debatable on whether it's an S1 or not

100
00:04:03,318 --> 00:04:07,399
again it's one of those things where we

101
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:10,000
just won't know there is another cut

102
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:13,799
called we call the the Durban Bay or the

103
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,918
bay Durban that um CSI got from Green

104
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:19,439
Dragon uh I think five six years ago and

105
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,680
he was growing him side by side because

106
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:24,319
we've been doing our F1 derb projects

107
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,478
together and he was grown him side by

108
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:27,759
side and thought somebody screwed up the

109
00:04:25,478 --> 00:04:30,159
cut because in veg they were so

110
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,720
identical that he was sure someone

111
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,840
screwed up like one of his workers

112
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,520
screwed up the cut so he was all pissed

113
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:38,679
off and then they start flowering and

114
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:41,159
they're almost identical looking except

115
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,840
one is green and one is a deep black

116
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,639
purple um there's differences in the tur

117
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:49,079
profiles but we'll see over time like

118
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,800
how at you know acclimatizing and being

119
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:52,918
in the same room over time being fed the

120
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,840
same stuff over time we'll see how much

121
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:57,879
those tur profiles like either get you

122
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:59,879
know similar or if they break further

123
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:02,199
apart or they stay where they're at but

124
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:03,600
as of right now it seems like one one is

125
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:05,280
a descendant of the other one is a

126
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,120
sister of the other bag seat of the

127
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:12,359
other hybrid of the other we just don't

128
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:15,038
know um it's a really really unique cut

129
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:18,560
and as much as I've always taken what

130
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:20,599
cookie fam says with a grain of salt

131
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,120
because none of them are breeders barely

132
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:26,720
any of them are Growers um it does seem

133
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:30,199
to hold true that F1 derb is a major

134
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:33,240
component of forum cookies proper and

135
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:34,759
probably thin mint as well so yeah I

136
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,840
don't know Dan what do you have you have

137
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:40,360
any takes on F1 derb at all I've never

138
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:42,679
even had a chance to see it I've never

139
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:46,000
come across the Clone I've got more

140
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,720
thoughts on the next few okay so one

141
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,240
other thing I'll add is this is one of

142
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,199
the main reasons I'm redoing the show

143
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,960
too is that you know there were some

144
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,720
rumors going around that the anus cut um

145
00:05:54,959 --> 00:06:00,638
or anise you know you can call what you

146
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:04,039
want I call it the anus um is the mother

147
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,280
or is F1 derb um yeah there's no

148
00:06:04,038 --> 00:06:07,719
relation um when that claim was made the

149
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:10,758
person who made that claim had never

150
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:13,880
smoked grown seen F1 derb so it was kind

151
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:16,680
of a bold claim

152
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:19,519
um but going off what me and CSI have

153
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,478
seen there's no way uh it's just not

154
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:26,719
it's just not there um it does anus does

155
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:28,839
look like a a uh meno pers type um

156
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,199
whether F1 der is a meno pers type or

157
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:33,359
not known it's it's very different

158
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,160
looking than F1 derb I'm sorry than than

159
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,879
men perss um yeah I'm going to leave it

160
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,039
there uh that's that's one of the I

161
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,560
can't believe how fast that spread and

162
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:45,360
when I'm a part of something that's

163
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,319
misinformation I gotta cut it yeah with

164
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,840
that one I I don't feel like it was ever

165
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:52,919
like explicitly said too cuz I kind of

166
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:54,758
filled that Gap in myself as well and

167
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:57,120
thought that for a few months there

168
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:59,199
where I was just like oh I don't think

169
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,840
he wants to say it out of like humility

170
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,478
or or something but like I completely

171
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:06,318
fell into that trap too yeah and and in

172
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:08,159
In fairness like I got to watch from

173
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:11,319
behind the scenes how that Nar that

174
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,199
narrative started evolving and it

175
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:15,080
started with like hey I think someone

176
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,199
else saying hey I think this the meno

177
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:19,878
perss is in cookies and then it just

178
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,280
kind of slowly evolved into connecting

179
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:24,280
this Dot and string and Dot and string

180
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:26,198
yeah but without actually any additional

181
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:28,198
data points yeah zero data points no

182
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:31,680
more grows no more flowers no more

183
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:34,080
nothing else Anis Cuts not around to be

184
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,240
even compared now like there's a whole

185
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:39,878
lot of stuff that was missing from that

186
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,759
um yeah that that data point so I'd

187
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:43,160
rather I'd rather stick to what we know

188
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,240
and what we've seen and what we've

189
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,560
experienced and I've actually grown F1

190
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,478
durb sourced it very early on used it

191
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,918
bred with it ran the plants from it the

192
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:57,240
progyny uh chased it back down via Frost

193
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:59,959
boss and and Stony rest in peace um yeah

194
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,918
I mean it takes it takes growing stuff

195
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:05,598
smoking it learning about it their

196
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:07,359
progyny their supposed progyny to really

197
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:10,399
try to make educated conclusions on

198
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,038
stuff like that just saying it and isn't

199
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:13,959
enough and that's probably where I'll

200
00:08:12,038 --> 00:08:15,598
leave the F1 dur conversation app for

201
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:18,279
now I did want to ask you one more thing

202
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:20,680
Matt which is what was your anecdotal

203
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:22,878
experience with it like um I'm not

204
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,240
asking you to obviously make any claims

205
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,039
but maybe like you know what are your

206
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,918
speculations on it based on what you saw

207
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:29,959
of its traits or you know anything

208
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:33,278
interesting that you noticed

209
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:34,958
um so when I grew it it was very like

210
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:37,759
what's the word for it like it had a

211
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:40,199
champagne Mero type smell there's some

212
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:42,000
pissin but I never caught the

213
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,759
gingerbread end of it and I think there

214
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,679
is some sort of gingerbread end to it

215
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:48,838
that other people smell um it's very

216
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:50,159
Herm prone that's that's like the first

217
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:52,160
thing you notice when running it very

218
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:56,039
Herm prone

219
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:57,559
um it's looser than it looks uh like

220
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:59,799
visually you look at it you might think

221
00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:03,559
it it's more dense like cookies

222
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:04,879
but it's not at all um is it a Durban

223
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:06,838
Poison is probably one of the questions

224
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:10,120
I get the most I would say there's no

225
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:12,000
way in hell it's a pure Durban Poison um

226
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,200
it's got a lot of Afghan type traits to

227
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,200
it which Durban Poison is

228
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:18,320
a well there's a lot of different things

229
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,160
called deran Poison it's an area in

230
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,959
Africa um there's a lot of things that

231
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:25,480
come out of that area um traditionally

232
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:27,359
there's the Dutch Passion Durban Poison

233
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:30,600
that most people think of there is the

234
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,879
NorCal Durban Poison which is ultra

235
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:37,839
um I believe it was the Mel Frank Urban

236
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:39,480
Poison cut that was all an you know like

237
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:44,880
aniseed

238
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:46,680
so this isn't necessarily that um with

239
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:49,240
Kenny Powers he said a few time a few

240
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:50,759
different things he said that F1 derb is

241
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:53,759
the derb crossed to

242
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:55,519
F1 and what is an F1 he said it's like a

243
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:58,480
Formula 1 race car and that's why we

244
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:02,320
called it that and then he also later

245
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:05,920
said it is is Durban cross

246
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:08,320
to Durban cross to something cross to

247
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:09,679
purple pain which was like a purple from

248
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,839
the bay area which is probably like an

249
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:17,199
Urkel GDP but hard to say hard to say

250
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,600
don't see a lot of Urkel in it so yeah

251
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,360
that's that's probably the most I I

252
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,920
could say about the traits other than

253
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,399
what we talk about later on in its

254
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:26,599
relation to other things yeah super

255
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,879
interesting and obviously people are now

256
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,680
starting to grow out some of those

257
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:32,879
crosses so we might

258
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:35,838
might learn more over over time okay so

259
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:36,838
we can move on to Cherry Pie you want to

260
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:41,560
kick it off

261
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:45,200
Dan yeah I started seeing it in like

262
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:47,599
20145 I think um the Clone was at hprc

263
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,959
in Arcada and so that's where I picked

264
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,240
it up at least and um I grew it a little

265
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:55,479
bit I kind of wasn't a good grower yet

266
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:58,159
and so I got like little popcorn buds of

267
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,360
just like rock hard it was like green

268
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:05,600
with marbling like Stripes of purple

269
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,600
through it and how hard was it rock

270
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:12,120
hard sorry and uh it was really nice man

271
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,399
I remember that a pound of it was like

272
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,240
the size of a football yeah it was the

273
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,958
smallest pound I think I've still seen

274
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:23,200
the date and so um it was really killer

275
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:25,039
I enjoyed it the smoke was kind of me

276
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,560
like it was tasty but didn't get you

277
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:29,679
that high compared to like the diesel

278
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:31,799
headband OG that kind of everyone

279
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:34,879
cropped out at that time it was just

280
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:37,120
another one like that people kept a few

281
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:40,039
plants of in like their outdoor patch

282
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,078
just as like variety but like it wasn't

283
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:43,599
like a bulk produced plant that I I

284
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:47,799
don't think I've seen anyone ever bulk

285
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:50,759
produce it yeah so my first experience

286
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:52,159
with the Cherry Pie was on IC mag uh

287
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:54,639
lump status had just gotten a hold of

288
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:56,838
the cut and was growing that and some of

289
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,399
the other cookie fam cuts and I remember

290
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:00,880
looking at the Cherry Pie on there and

291
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,320
just thinking this is so gorgeous and it

292
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:05,278
was a The Forum was he was also growing

293
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,480
The Forum publicly on there and it was

294
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:09,799
very unique looking but cherry pie

295
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,120
really really like is it Cherry is it

296
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:14,479
like a cherry pie like that all was very

297
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,879
intriguing and looking at it it was just

298
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,959
it looked like more of what I wanted to

299
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:20,278
grow uh versus The Forum and I remember

300
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,958
reaching out to him we weren't friends

301
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:23,679
yet and I reached out to him and I was

302
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:25,239
like hey dude what do you want for that

303
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:28,159
like what do you want to trade for that

304
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,360
cut and uh we ended up doing some sort

305
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:32,198
of Exchange giving him right bar G or

306
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:36,079
something like that like my mom cut of

307
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:39,599
that and um a a mutual friend of ours

308

310
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:48,000
San Diego he ran a place called people's

311
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:49,680
nursery care PNC and he had some of the

312
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,440
most legit he's where I saw strawberry

313
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:57,078
cream originally from that clone um the

314
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:59,920
soul assassin number three and one that

315
00:12:57,078 --> 00:13:02,679
was nice Source from him La

316
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:04,599
afy just all kinds of stuff dude like he

317
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:07,399
was so responsible for so much ending up

318
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,959
in my hands um so shout out to Gail

319
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:11,440
Gail's legit and like there were so few

320
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:13,000
clones that I ever gotten I was like I

321
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,199
don't know about that one from him he

322
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,159
was so much before his time doing great

323
00:13:15,198 --> 00:13:19,599
uh provenance of research serious about

324
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:21,360
it and he had a good business down there

325
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,440
really good business and uh he's still

326
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,919
up and running somewhere I think I don't

327
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,760
know what he's necessarily doing now but

328
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:28,198
he's still out there kicking it and he

329
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:30,078
came and brought down cherry pie along

330
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:31,120
with some other stuff and uh it was

331
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:34,239
about

332
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,919
2011 and my first time running it the

333
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,919
first thing I noticed was oh my God this

334
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:40,159
is gassy like there's a lot of gas to

335
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,719
Cherry Pie not just the sweet end but

336
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:43,919
there's a gassy end that you could pull

337
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,600
out of it um reminded me a lot of like

338
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:50,639
an OG gassy type when you pull gassy OG

339
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:52,879
out um what else was there beautiful

340
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:56,680
purple colors that you can pull out of

341
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:58,399
it uh structure s very I I'll bring this

342
00:13:56,679 --> 00:14:00,479
up right now it there's a structure so

343
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,360
remn inent of the F1 derb that it's

344
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,480
almost hard to ignore that they're

345
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:10,519
absolutely related um I would venture to

346
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:13,480
guess URL GDP type uh with the F1 derb

347
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:17,159
makes sense to me um but there is some

348
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:19,800
kind of gassy OG Kush to it and there

349
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:22,480
there's some speculation like with me on

350
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:26,240
on F1 der maybe having OG cross to it at

351
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,000
some point um or inside of it um yeah

352
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,360
that's I think that's most of the Cherry

353
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,278
Pie tail unless you guys got any

354
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,039
questions or to add yeah anything else

355
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:35,759
you wanted to add then or any other

356
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:38,360
questions just remember it had like

357
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:40,839
little like triangle buds yeah you know

358
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,600
like it was all popcorn it was very

359
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:44,959
similar to Forum in that regard where it

360
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:48,000
was like all small buds that were like

361
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:49,719
very very dense and you could tell they

362
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,720
like looking at them even as clones when

363
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,720
they were growing that they were

364
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,278
probably directly related in some way as

365
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,560
well the for and the Cherry Pie I also

366
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:59,439
vaguely remember it growing pretty slow

367
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:00,559
and shitty

368
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,759
I don't know if it was growing slow and

369
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:04,000
shitty at the time because it was so

370
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:05,480
young at that time it hadn't been passed

371
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,360
yeah I'm not I'm not sure I can't

372
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:10,639
remember really um but like when I think

373
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,519
about it I I vaguely remember just like

374
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,278
kind of a

375
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,919
shorter um slow growing plant which

376
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:19,320
would kind of lend itself to something

377
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:23,719
like a an Urkel or a GDP oh let me add

378
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:26,639
in intersects inter big time Big Time

379
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:29,120
and and if it is related to uh the F1

380
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,159
derb then that's probably why um that

381
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,799
trait seems to be pretty heavy in

382
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:36,759
cookies and Cherry Pie and and a lot of

383
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:39,000
stuff so yeah for

384
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:40,879
sure I kind of want to foreshadow at

385
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,278
this point that we're probably not going

386
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:45,360
to get around to constructing any kind

387
00:15:42,278 --> 00:15:48,639
of timeline and that this is kind of a

388
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:52,639
that these genetics are like a crazy

389
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:56,440
Circle don't know you know inbred nested

390
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:59,480
uh ring of whatever uh cannabis Human

391
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:02,800
Centipede Vibe um

392
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:06,720
yeah but yeah we can move on to

393
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:08,240
GDP oh GDP so there this is another one

394
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,278
has I don't even know if I want to go

395
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:14,120
into the history of GDP so much as kind

396
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:16,159
of reference it I know CSI like his

397
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,519
opinion on GDP has changed a lot on what

398
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:20,000
is GDP what is Urkel which I don't even

399
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,759
know if he's brought up publicly but

400
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,198
it's it's it's interesting real

401
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,839
interesting and I'll leave that to him

402
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:28,078
maybe when uh he owes us an episode and

403
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:32,160
I reminded him just this weekend you owe

404
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:33,638
us an so buddy and Kush apparently Kush

405
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,919
of the Giants and little Hill are both

406
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:37,000
going to try and add some pressure as

407
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:41,559
well I don't know if it'll help or not

408
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:46,759
but he he knows he knows what's up um

409
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:49,000
GDP so there is a wonderful video with

410
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:51,199
Ken Estes talking about the history of

411
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,440
GDP and I remember a long time ago on

412
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:54,838
the forums I transcribed it so people

413
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,519
could actually read what Mumble mouth

414
00:16:54,839 --> 00:17:01,399
was saying and essentially he said that

415
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:02,959
he was given the Clone by Native

416
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:06,078
American

417
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:09,198
shamans in front of some headlights at a

418
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:11,159
ceremony of sorts and uh because he was

419
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,839
such a cool white man they decided to

420
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:17,600
gift him this magical clone that was not

421
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:20,159
only skunk but like from Vietnam and all

422
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:24,279
this other stuff and it was most purple

423
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:26,199
weed he'd ever seen um yeah I mean GDP

424
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:28,639
reminds me a lot of an Urkle type and

425
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:30,440
they seem to be directly related in some

426
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,559
way I don't know if one came before the

427
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:36,038
other uh back in the day almost

428
00:17:33,558 --> 00:17:38,160
everything was called GDP whether it was

429
00:17:36,038 --> 00:17:40,279
Urkel whether it was gra Vape whether

430
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,720
all those names were so interchangeable

431
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:44,200
that it became really hard to tie it

432
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,759
down to a specific clone there was the

433
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:49,279
Ken GDP referring to Ken Estes that was

434
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:50,599
super purple um and then he made a

435
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:52,319
seedline that he called Granddaddy

436
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:55,119
Purple which really screwed everything

437
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:57,558
up and all of a sudden everybody had the

438
00:17:55,119 --> 00:18:02,359
real GDP Ken's GDP because he put out

439
00:17:57,558 --> 00:18:05,519
the seed line of seeds um as far as

440
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:08,038
relation is I don't see much difference

441
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:10,960
between it and Urkel and how it breeds

442
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:12,440
to really say again which came first the

443
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,840
chicken or the egg but they're both so

444
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:19,519
heavily involved in thin Min in in Forum

445
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:21,439
u in my opinion that they could be

446
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:26,119
synonymous and used interchangeably in

447
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:27,880
that way grapey purple slow growing um

448
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:29,719
super Afghani Outdoors they have more

449
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,720
narrow leaves than they would Broad Leaf

450
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,360
so some people would confuse it for a

451
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:37,640
sativa Outdoors but I mean it's short

452
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:42,439
squat short inter node spacing um yeah

453
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:45,480
super grapey um but in veg both the GDP

454
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,679
and KKL are some of the absolute

455
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,159
skunkiest

456
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:51,000
Cuts you can have when you take cuts of

457
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:53,400
those things it fills up a room and

458
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,319
smells like just straight skunk spray um

459
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,840
but when flowering about week six they

460
00:18:56,319 --> 00:19:01,678
go from that skunky smell to

461
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:04,079
sweet grape and it it's a big change up

462
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,038
but yeah that's what I got I don't know

463
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:08,359
if you have much experience with it Dan

464
00:19:06,038 --> 00:19:11,599
no so I've never actually held like a

465
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:14,199
verified cut of any of the real purples

466
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:15,879
um they were a little bit before my time

467
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,519
like I remember buying bags of stuff

468
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,840
called GDP and there's really good

469
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:22,279
purple weed in it you know um but one

470
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:26,000
thing that I've always thought was

471
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:27,639
interesting was I saw this um uh peer

472
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,079
reviewed paper that where they had

473
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:32,440
collected a bunch of clones out of

474
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:33,839
American grows and um you know done the

475
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,919
gene correlations and made a

476
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:39,720
philogenetic tree and um all of the

477
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:41,559
purples were clustered together yeah and

478
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,000
then all of them were also very much

479
00:19:41,558 --> 00:19:46,200
more basil so like you have the tree

480
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,200
going off of like all the modern cuts

481
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:53,038
and you see like OG and you see c99 and

482
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:55,480
all the [ __ ] just on this main branch

483
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:58,599
and then out of nowhere from way more

484
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:00,599
basil the purple shoot up to the top and

485
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:02,678
to me that kind of lends itself to the

486
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:05,240
stories there's a few stories that we've

487
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:08,840
heard on the show of um people being

488
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:10,480
given seeds from the 70s yeah um and

489
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:12,678
I've heard a few of those stories myself

490
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,440
outside the show as well and I think

491
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:18,360
that's kind of where most of them arrive

492
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:21,159
from is from like afghanis and like you

493
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:24,959
know cuts from the from the East over

494
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:27,880
there and um them getting stored and

495
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,798
then popped by people in the 90s and I

496
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,559
think that's where most of these Cuts

497
00:20:29,798 --> 00:20:33,519
come from and it actually showed that

498
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:35,798
Grape Ape was the most basil out of all

499
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:38,720
of them does that mean like the the

500
00:20:35,798 --> 00:20:41,079
parental yeah like further Upstream

501
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,319
right is what you when you say basil

502
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:45,678
yeah yeah exactly like it it would be

503
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:48,000
like Grape Ape and then like a branch

504
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,600
off of that and it would show GDP and a

505
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,038
branch off of that and it would show URL

506
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:54,359
um and like I can't remember the

507
00:20:52,038 --> 00:20:56,839
placement of each of them in regards to

508
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:58,678
each other but it also depends on like

509
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:00,639
what the named cut that those people

510
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:02,320
collected were because I've never been

511
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,679
able to tell the difference when someone

512
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:08,279
says oh this is purple kush clone this

513
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:10,440
is a GDP this is a purple Urkle like

514
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:12,200
they all are really really similar in my

515
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:14,880
opinion and

516
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:17,080
um uh yeah I think that they're all

517
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,559
probably very closely related if not

518
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:22,519
renames of cuts or bag seeds of each

519
00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:24,798
other yeah the SR71 Purple Kush was a

520
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:26,158
big one and I had that growing side by

521
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:28,558
side with Urkle back in the day and that

522
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:31,440
was sourced from Blue Sky C

523
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:34,480
or SR71 which became Blue Sky Cafe later

524
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,558
on and I could never tell the difference

525
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,440
between the two like sometimes we'd say

526
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:41,480
oh the SR71 is more hashy more earthy

527
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,960
hashy but like it could have just been

528
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:46,599
different you know just small little

529
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:49,319
different I don't even know bro like

530
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:51,359
they were all so similar all of them GDP

531
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:54,678
they all grew short squat short intern

532
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:55,959
node spacing um had less trouble with

533
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:58,400
grap ape I always thought it was kind of

534
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:02,240
prettier and had more narrow type but

535
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:04,240
I've seen URL perform that way too um

536
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,240
yeah it's I think you're right too I

537
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,240
think it's just an an introduction of

538
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,960
old purple afghanis

539
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,558
um yeah I don't know like it's it's one

540
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:16,319
of those things where it was so many

541
00:22:13,558 --> 00:22:18,519
clones were passed around in the same

542
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:20,759
area of California with these different

543
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:23,599
names obviously Urkel didn't pop up as a

544
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:25,720
name until Family Matters was a TV show

545
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:28,959
but before that it had other names you

546
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:31,278
know like just purple purple bud skunk

547
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,360
you know things like that were around um

548
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:35,558
GDP was named what it was because it was

549
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:37,199
supposed to be the OG purple the one

550
00:22:35,558 --> 00:22:39,918
that came before all the other ones the

551
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,600
granddaddy of them you know but whether

552
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,480
that's true or not or just like someone

553
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:47,558
trying to push a narrative again like

554
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,679
trying to find that original called it

555
00:22:47,558 --> 00:22:51,200
would be damn near impossible to untie

556
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,320
that unless you find someone that's had

557
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,558
it with good provenance going back

558
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:55,558
however

559
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,640
long yeah I was going to I was going to

560
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:02,678
prompt this next one which is uh we're

561
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,278
going to obviously talk about OG as well

562
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:08,440
but we've also seen uh We've also seen

563
00:23:05,278 --> 00:23:10,640
oal hybrids of OG uh Ural OG hybrids out

564
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:13,200
there uh made by other people like

565
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,080
obviously Caleb's got T1000 and I can't

566
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,880
remember the line that that was from

567
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:20,798
what do you guys think based on looking

568
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:23,880
at just straight OG oal type hybrids and

569
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:25,918
how they might resemble cookies or not

570
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:28,760
you can get really really close you can

571
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:31,278
get damn close to cookies with it

572
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:34,079
um it's not the most common expression

573
00:23:31,278 --> 00:23:36,038
but you can get really damn close

574
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:38,759
without without

575
00:23:36,038 --> 00:23:40,119
the without the F1 derb essentially but

576
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:41,839
you've got a little bit different of a

577
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:45,479
structure you'll always get a more OG

578
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:47,199
type structure um I do still think that

579
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:50,640
it's part of the reason why I think OG

580
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,038
is in F1 derb though because it's only a

581
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:56,799
little bit of a hint of a difference

582
00:23:53,038 --> 00:24:00,640
between an URL OG hybrid and what we

583
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:03,079
knew as forum per se you know um yeah

584
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,320
the The Thin Mint to me was always more

585
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:07,199
narrow Leaf which I was kind of wondered

586
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:10,639
where that came from as opposed to this

587
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,480
URL OG hybrid and it may just be that

588
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,640
difference between what's dominating in

589
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:18,880
there and that's the F1 but F1 durb also

590
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:22,278
looks pretty broadleaf in many ways so I

591
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:25,360
don't really know um yeah Caleb did a

592
00:24:22,278 --> 00:24:27,278
lot of uh urk and OG hybrids before he

593
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:32,000
made it up to T1000 he had the Savage

594
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:34,558
purple which was sfv per uh f sfv purle

595
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,919
um there was God's Gift back in the day

596
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:40,720
which was GDP OG that was real famous in

597
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:43,320
in California I used that early on um I

598
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,798
think I even did some but a lot of

599
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:46,759
people were doing that combination you

600
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:48,398
know OG was hype and purples were hype

601
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:49,879
and that's what people wanted like the

602
00:24:48,398 --> 00:24:52,158
solo assassin number three looked like

603
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:54,200
an urk OG looked just dead on like an Ur

604
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:57,600
OG G didn't have the same na'vi

605
00:24:54,200 --> 00:25:01,240
structure or bubbly cxes that um or bra

606
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:03,278
that that uh cookies has but the resin

607
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:06,558
production was absolutely insane there

608
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:09,640
was a lot of gassy skunkin to it um it

609
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:11,519
was short low yielding like popcorn

610
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,880
structure it had a lot of the it ticked

611
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:19,720
a lot of the bo same boxes really really

612
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:19,720
high THC testing really dull High

613
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:29,120
yeah Dam any thoughts on that one yeah

614
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:31,519
like I've seen some OG hybrids with

615
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:34,599
different purples and the only thing

616
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:37,278
that makes me go back to Meo meno per is

617
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:39,558
the the Anis and the licorice TPS

618
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:41,359
because those turps are they're so

619
00:25:39,558 --> 00:25:44,278
prevalent when you breed with cookie

620
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:46,798
stuff and like it's I think one of the

621
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:49,000
main components that makes that sherb

622
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:50,398
Aroma as it's like referenced you know

623
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,919
oh yeah that's good point and I don't

624
00:25:50,398 --> 00:25:54,359
really get a lot of like when I've bred

625
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:57,440
with this stuff I don't really get

626
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:59,839
skunky or grapey ever you know it's

627
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:03,919
pretty pretty much always like some

628
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:06,639
creamy licorice type thing with some gas

629
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:09,559
and uh that's the only reason I think it

630
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:12,320
in some way in the most incestuous way

631
00:26:09,558 --> 00:26:15,200
possible leads back to meno per as the

632
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:16,519
the donor for the purple and um Al also

633
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,080
I mean it's hard to say though because

634
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:21,960
meno perss also its purple traits are

635
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:25,639
true purple you know versus the other

636
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:27,720
ones they're very um uh climate

637
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:31,080
dependent you know like the temperature

638
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:32,919
dependent and so um that's like the

639
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:34,720
counter argument is that it's like oh

640
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:37,559
well there's not a lot of true breeding

641
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,558
purple in cookies lines either you know

642
00:26:37,558 --> 00:26:42,200
it's always kind of that gray purple and

643
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:43,839
it comes on late whereas like meno per

644
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:47,798
and some of its hybrids will like purple

645
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:49,759
out in a hot room in week two and so um

646
00:26:47,798 --> 00:26:51,798
it goes back and forth I see data data

647
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:54,038
points that point in both

648
00:26:51,798 --> 00:26:56,240
directions you know and meno perss

649
00:26:54,038 --> 00:26:57,919
another thing about that is that it has

650
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,159
a lot of Magenta in it that's true

651
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:02,278
breeding as well like yeah it's hard to

652
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,440
shake magenta out ofendo pers hybrids

653
00:27:02,278 --> 00:27:07,440
down the line and I just never see that

654
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,600
in the cookies on its own I just saw it

655
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,240
but it doesn't mean that you can't

656
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:11,519
directionally breed you know what I mean

657
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,000
like it could always be a directional

658
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:16,798
breeding and and manage to avoid that

659
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,119
magenta trait it's just it's like with

660
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:22,000
uh the other place I see it is in

661
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:23,278
chatral and like double purple DOA stuff

662
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,960
like that from the Blackberry and

663
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:27,798
there's always been some kind of um

664
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:30,159
theories on whether you know BlackBerry

665
00:27:27,798 --> 00:27:32,200
was related to meno perss or not it meno

666
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,399
perss may be one of those old purple

667
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,080
afghanis that was floating around and

668
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:37,639
God knows where it came from I mean I

669
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:40,519
don't know if I necessarily believe

670
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:43,200
every story I hear now but I do think it

671
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:45,480
was a base for a lot of the purples I do

672
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,120
um how it got to be that base whether it

673
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:50,038
was a sister whether it was one cut

674
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:52,079
whether it was bag seeds going around um

675
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:55,079
NorCal and it wasn't even necessarily

676
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:56,960
the first thing called mesino Purple

677
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:59,639
there was other mesino purples earlier

678
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,840
sure yeah

679
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:04,480
so we were gonna do an episode on that

680
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:07,439
too right like we were GNA do

681
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:10,038
a for pink magenta maybe oh yeah yeah

682
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,038
yeah yeah we were huh see I'm all making

683
00:28:10,038 --> 00:28:13,038
fun of you yeah we were gonna do that

684
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:16,038
instead of this yeah that's right we

685
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:18,158
were yeah originally yeah but this

686
00:28:16,038 --> 00:28:21,158
needed to be done for

687
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:24,679
sure so we've sort of talked about OG

688
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:27,200
already is there anything else to add um

689
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:30,200
on the OG side of things as far as this

690
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,278
goes like with cookies like um a really

691
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:34,399
good example of an OG dominant cookies

692
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:37,159
would have been something like animal

693
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:39,879
cookies to me it was it was the the more

694
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:42,039
OG end of forum I mean they almost again

695
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,480
they almost looked identical in veg they

696
00:28:42,038 --> 00:28:46,119
almost looked identical in flower except

697
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:48,319
it had more of an OG Kush structure and

698
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:50,000
more of an OG cush scent and that was

699
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:51,439
probably one of my favorite cuts out of

700
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,480
all of them because I really like OG

701
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,798
Kush um I don't think you get cookies

702
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,159
without OG cush I don't think you get it

703
00:28:56,798 --> 00:29:02,558
I don't think so you can get OG KB OG

704
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:04,159
Kush breath looking stuff without OG but

705
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:08,359
I don't think you can get the gassiness

706
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:11,360
in ogkb and the potency with just Urkle

707
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:13,558
or with just like an Urkle type you can

708
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:16,038
get the mutation you won't necessarily

709
00:29:13,558 --> 00:29:18,678
get the gassy and all that stuff with it

710
00:29:16,038 --> 00:29:21,558
though yeah I look at it and I see the

711
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:23,320
structure and like the leaf ToBD ratio

712
00:29:21,558 --> 00:29:25,158
where it's like basically just like a

713
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:27,038
two little leaves that are at the base

714
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:28,480
of the bud and then it's all flower

715
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:30,720
above

716
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,360
that is like the modern structure that I

717
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,839
see and I think all of that comes from

718
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:36,719
OG from my own breedings with it and

719
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:39,319
it's it's the number one thing that gets

720
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,558
pasted even if you miss by a mile on the

721
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:44,079
turps um you still end up with that

722
00:29:41,558 --> 00:29:45,839
structure and that look yeah

723
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:47,639
definitely yeah it's just a major

724
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:49,158
component of what we're talking about I

725
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,399
just don't think you have it without the

726
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:53,200
OG

727
00:29:51,398 --> 00:29:56,359
essentially

728
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:59,319
nice well uh coming up we have we have

729
00:29:56,359 --> 00:30:01,959
another cut or at least another name

730
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:04,240
that we've covered quite a bit the sherb

731
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,480
I'll let you run with this one Dan and I

732
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,798
guess it's like yeah which Sher are we

733
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,440
talking about I guess you can go into

734
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:12,119
that too I only talk about Sunset when I

735
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,320
talk about Sher because in my opinion

736
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:16,439
it's the main one that matters like the

737
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:18,678
whole green sherb thing and Skittles and

738
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:21,360
all that is it's fun to talk about but

739
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:23,159
like Sunset sherb to me was like the

740
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:25,558
first one that was like a really really

741
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:28,559
good cash crop plant that came out of

742
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:31,720
all these lines and you could get great

743
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:34,278
weight great potency a variety of Aromas

744
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:37,640
from creamy to like pure fuel on the

745
00:30:34,278 --> 00:30:40,640
same cut um and uh I have pictures from

746
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:43,640
some grows that I did of it in I think

747
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,038
2017 um that are just like whole rooms

748
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:49,240
just filled with donkey dick buds just

749
00:30:46,038 --> 00:30:52,319
swaying in the fans and um I love that

750
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:54,640
plant I wish I still had it but um as

751
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:57,240
far as like what it what it's made of

752
00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:00,519
like I don't really believe the story of

753
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:02,638
OG Kush pink panties I mean we've seen

754
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:04,880
that picture of pink panties now that

755
00:31:02,638 --> 00:31:09,158
we've passed around to each other and um

756
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:10,799
I maybe I could see it but it's uh it's

757
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:15,720
so

758
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:19,638
purple yeah you know like it's a turd

759
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:22,360
bro [ __ ] turd it's not it's Airy

760
00:31:19,638 --> 00:31:22,359
again Herm

761
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:28,439
prone turs like no resin

762
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,880
production and

763
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,759
this can kind of go into the last one

764
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,399
too of the pink panties like Buu

765
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:37,599
conversation it's like I don't see how

766
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:41,000
you could like cross a burmes to an OG

767
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:42,278
and have that plant in one hybrid I just

768
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,319
don't think it's

769
00:31:42,278 --> 00:31:47,440
possible because a burmes would be like

770
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:50,678
a 20we flowering like e equatorial

771
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,679
Southeast Asian sativa and so maybe

772
00:31:50,679 --> 00:31:54,639
something went around called burmes at

773
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:56,639
that point and they crossed it to an OG

774
00:31:54,638 --> 00:31:58,278
but I don't it looks way more like it's

775
00:31:56,638 --> 00:32:01,038
some sort of of like an F1 derb

776
00:31:58,278 --> 00:32:02,839
derivative to me there was a Burmese

777
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:05,599
that reeferman passed around that was

778
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:08,158
predominantly like Afghan like it

779
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:10,638
obviously was not a you know High

780
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:13,159
Burmese land race at all stretch yeah

781
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:16,079
close enough though right um I could

782
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:18,639
definitely see that be in buku um it was

783
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:22,000
also very Herm from but there was a line

784
00:32:18,638 --> 00:32:25,879
from Vancouver called the black burmes

785
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:28,119
that was definitely super purple

786
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:30,440
definitely super Herr

787
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:32,398
and using re I'm pretty sure it's reer

788
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:34,880
man's burmes I don't know if if he got

789
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:36,599
it from the dude at VC or they traded it

790
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,080
or one came from the other but I'm

791
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:40,558
betting it's the same one and God it was

792
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:42,678
trash and that's the only thing I can

793
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:43,960
see with pink panties with sure my my

794
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:46,639
biggest problem with it is there's a

795
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:48,798
scent in sherb that goes through every

796
00:32:46,638 --> 00:32:51,519
single thing that has sherb in it I can

797
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:53,158
always smell it it's it's a lot of it's

798
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,679
pretty smelling but it's like a

799
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:57,120
pepperine note that I don't like and and

800
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:59,120
I don't really hear people mention it

801
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:00,798
but it's just like a it's so hard to

802
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:03,359
explain but it's a no it's like what

803
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:05,038
biscotti has yeah yeah I mean it's but

804
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:08,319
it's so prevalent in everything that

805
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:10,000
sherb is touched but it's I I just I

806
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,960
couldn't I just never liked it it was

807
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,200
one of those ones I can't like like uh

808
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:16,278
rs1 has it like it's a big component of

809
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,120
rs11 the scent that I'm talking about

810
00:33:16,278 --> 00:33:21,119
but some people love it you know it's

811
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:24,918
just one of those personal subjective

812
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:27,558
things yeah it's um Sunset sherb is also

813
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:29,759
responsible for what I would say is like

814
00:33:27,558 --> 00:33:31,918
the majority of like the modern hype

815
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:35,000
cuts at the moment like jealousy and all

816
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:37,480
that it's all from like sure biscotti

817
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,440
incrosses of one type or another and so

818
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,519
I think it's by far the best breeding

819
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,679
out of all of them like if you want

820
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:47,240
pretty consistent plants that throw big

821
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:49,440
buds that are purple have these modern

822
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:51,798
tur profiles like it's probably the one

823
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,200
you actually want to use I don't think

824
00:33:51,798 --> 00:33:56,480
using the gelados I haven't seen it

825
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,480
really go anywhere besides making more

826
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,798
gelato

827
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:02,360
yeah you know same whereas like and same

828
00:33:59,798 --> 00:34:04,480
thing with Sher but sher's just better

829
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:08,000
and so maybe it's just like that one

830
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:10,199
step removed farther back that makes it

831
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,559
breed slightly better I don't know but

832
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:15,000
um I have not been a fan of breeding

833
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:16,918
with gelato for really

834
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,440
anything good segue because we were

835
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:20,000
gonna go into that you know I don't know

836
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,559
if it's fair to call that next

837
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,838
Generation but gelato wedding cake I

838
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:27,320
don't know like you guys know the tonomy

839
00:34:24,838 --> 00:34:29,440
better than me so wedding cake to me me

840
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,079
is it you know like a lot of people lump

841
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:34,838
that in with cookies but to me it's more

842
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:36,760
of a triangle type of plant you can find

843
00:34:34,838 --> 00:34:38,559
that tur profile that and to me I just

844
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:41,280
call cardboard tur profile some people

845
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:43,559
think it's like creamy you know add a

846
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:47,079
creamy component but I just think it's

847
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:48,320
Garb Garb profile and um you know

848
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:50,240
everybody always shits on me because I

849
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,679
naysay all this [ __ ] but like I really

850
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:54,078
don't like it's to me it's the the One

851
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:57,160
Direction I would not want to take

852
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:59,960
triangle it's the midy uh commercial

853
00:34:57,159 --> 00:35:02,679
version of triangle to me and someone

854
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:04,280
locked it in and called it wedding cake

855
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:06,319
I can't remember jce Ley something like

856
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:09,280
his name's one of those

857
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:11,160
names but I'm not really so into it I

858
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,480
spent a lot of time trying to like map

859
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:15,319
this stuff with the last job that I had

860
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,079
because like I really wanted to see like

861
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,880
what directions you could go down by

862
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:24,160
like mixing and matching some of these

863
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:27,760
cuts and like the um there is like a

864
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:30,519
very big gap between like where everyone

865
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,560
went with gelato and the sherb cuts um

866
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:35,079
which I would consider more similar

867
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:37,320
versus like the animal mints hybrids

868
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:40,599
that jbzy made that's honestly kind of

869
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:42,480
like its own side shoot and um it's just

870
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:44,640
as incestuous you know what I mean like

871
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,159
look up like ice cream cake to wedding

872
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:49,199
cake to animal mint like it's all the

873
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:52,358
same cut basically just reworked a

874
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:54,279
thousand different ways but um they are

875
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:56,318
separate lines in my opinion I think

876
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,359
that wedding cake and gelato are two

877
00:35:56,318 --> 00:36:01,519
different things

878
00:35:58,358 --> 00:36:04,318
things yeah I just yeah if you forced to

879
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:05,639
like oh sorry Mt go ahead go ahead I was

880
00:36:04,318 --> 00:36:07,159
going to ask Dan like you know he

881
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:08,960
mentioned that like he could see these

882
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:10,679
like broad distinctions across these

883
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,159
broad groups like if you could if you

884
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:15,118
had to put words to those distinctions

885
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:17,000
what would they be do you think um well

886
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:19,358
like wedding cake like Matt was [ __ ]

887
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,760
on CU like it was a seedline originally

888
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:23,440
that was released and so there's I've

889
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,640
barely ever come across the same cut of

890
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:28,079
wedding cake twice you know same thing

891
00:36:25,639 --> 00:36:30,279
with gelato 33 you know it's just like I

892
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,920
think it was originally a seedline that

893
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:36,280
was released or like maybe he did like a

894
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:39,119
gelato 33 BX or something like that and

895
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:45,119
so um oh great my power's

896
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:45,119
fluttering um and so uh it

897
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:52,480
uh what am I trying to say it uh there's

898
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,160
just so many of them I've had really

899
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,639
nice cuts of wedding cake that I liked

900
00:36:54,159 --> 00:37:01,199
that I bred with and um but it's just

901
00:36:57,639 --> 00:37:04,519
one of those things that um wedding cake

902
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:08,279
is creamy huge buds some purple not

903
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:09,639
always um potency is meh same and

904
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,839
they're they're honestly just like

905
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:14,118
flavors of the same thing or the same

906
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:16,799
family but that they were taken in

907
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:18,599
separate directions and then ran with

908
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,200
you know what I mean like wedding cake

909
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:22,280
doesn't have in those lines they don't

910
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:24,358
really have a lot of overcross back into

911
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:26,040
gelato until you get to ice cream cake

912
00:37:24,358 --> 00:37:29,679
because that's like wedding cake times

913
00:37:26,039 --> 00:37:31,159
gelato 3 I'm pretty sure um and actually

914
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:33,639
I loved ice cream cake I thought it was

915
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:36,639
a good cut as a good cash propper made

916
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:38,480
me some money over a few years and so um

917
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:40,759
it's not something that I miss that I

918
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,039
now that I don't have it I've never it

919
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:46,319
or smoked it ever I kind of look at the

920
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:49,838
three main categories as like the sherb

921
00:37:46,318 --> 00:37:51,679
gelato the green sherb Skittles and then

922
00:37:49,838 --> 00:37:53,239
the animal mints wedding cake stuff

923
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:54,159
those are like the three main groupings

924
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:56,719
in my

925
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:59,519
mind that you can actually like map out

926
00:37:56,719 --> 00:38:02,078
as separate for me like wedding cake the

927
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:04,480
way I look at wedding cake is the dead

928
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:08,000
end of triangle whereas gelato would be

929
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,599
the dead end of urel triangle to me like

930
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,639
like that once you hit that point like

931
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,960
you can make a whole bunch more wedding

932
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:14,519
cake type stuff and name it whatever you

933
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,760
want it's always going to be very

934
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:17,920
similar to wedding cake and I think

935
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,720
that's what 99% of the market is is

936
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,280
either the dead end of gelato and once

937
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:25,159
you've got to that it's almost like uh

938
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:27,160
having a a trinoline haze once you get

939
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:29,440
there you can't really wipe out that

940
00:38:27,159 --> 00:38:30,759
well you could try but it's always going

941
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,358
to be there I mean I was trying to do it

942
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,599
with blue bonnet and wedding cake and it

943
00:38:32,358 --> 00:38:37,519
just to me it just made like a man

944
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:42,318
creamy commercial Blue Bonnet it was not

945
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:44,800
novel unique um and it when you start

946
00:38:42,318 --> 00:38:46,639
inbreeding you start back Crossing and

947
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,920
not knowing what you're doing that's

948
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:50,239
kind of where you're going to end up in

949
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,838
my opinion or or or bad seeds a bad

950
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:54,479
seeds a bag seeds and bag seeds in the

951
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:55,639
same direction you know like gelato yeah

952
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,079
in my opinion so you're essentially in

953
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:58,480
like a genetic C

954
00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:00,039
at that point right yes that's the best

955
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:03,039
way to put all this like I I always say

956
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:04,838
it's like a [ __ ] breeding dead end but a

957
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:07,480
genetic culdesac is probably a nicer way

958
00:39:04,838 --> 00:39:09,719
of putting it

959
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:12,519
yeah yeah and so really the question I'm

960
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:15,719
just paraphrasing you is like why like

961
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:18,519
there is no real value to taking those

962
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:20,078
things any further like within within

963
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:22,199
those constraints right well what you

964
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:24,680
end up seeing what you end up seeing

965
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:26,759
nowadays is that people take things from

966
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:29,000
outside these lines or from like more

967
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:31,520
basil regions and then they try and

968
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,318
reflavor it while keeping the look the

969
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:35,838
structure the trim ability like all that

970
00:39:34,318 --> 00:39:38,800
and so they're like well now we've got

971
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:40,199
Cherry gelato yeah now we've got Z

972
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,920
flavored gel you know what I mean with

973
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:46,679
runs kind of thing and um it's all still

974
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,159
the same [ __ ] whether you throw a little

975
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:50,279
you know like you're were saying like a

976
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:53,358
blue bonnet like oh yeah my blueberry

977
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:55,960
gelato now you know it's but it's still

978
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:57,759
midy and it's still like has all the

979
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,880
problems and it you can't take it

980
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,079
further really because like you start

981
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:05,200
ending up with all these negative traits

982
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:07,160
like the little aborted seed pods that

983
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:09,719
are in they're in everywhere in these

984
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:12,559
lines like you can't get away from them

985
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:14,439
and so like if you hybridize like a

986
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:17,400
bunch of gelato and Skittles together

987
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:19,358
like or a permanent marker Skittles

988
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:22,119
whatever these crosses you want to make

989
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:23,920
together you end up losing like 50% of

990
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:25,640
it to a lot of these negative traits

991
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,639
even if it's good smoke It's usually the

992
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:29,318
best cut too where you're like oh this

993
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:30,879
smells good this has actually got some

994
00:40:29,318 --> 00:40:33,039
potency to it and you grind it up and

995
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,280
there's like a million little aborted

996
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:38,279
seeds in in your you know little pile of

997
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,839
weed and so um it just depends on if

998
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,280
that's like a deal breaker for you I

999
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:45,400
guess or not but it's not something I

1000
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:47,920
want to see yeah for sure I just I just

1001
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:52,559
wish that people would do more novel

1002
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:55,358
stuff than like gelato runs gelato OG

1003
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:58,159
gelato gelato you know like and it and

1004
00:40:55,358 --> 00:40:59,440
to me just the that's 99% of the market

1005
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:01,440
that's what people have been told that

1006
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:05,200
they want is buds that look just like

1007
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:07,838
this and that's what I mean to me that's

1008
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:10,239
what compound was was gelato gelato

1009
00:41:07,838 --> 00:41:14,400
gelato and just ran with it and it's

1010
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:16,719
still being run with it's I just it's

1011
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,920
people what the reason I really really

1012
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:19,959
dislike it just from a breeding

1013
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,039
perspective is because so much was

1014
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:25,760
dropped in place that was novel unique

1015
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:26,759
old because the market was demanding so

1016
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,920
much of that

1017
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:31,359
crap that like like I've been talking

1018
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,240
about a lot of breeders are asking me

1019
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:35,119
hey do you know where I can get a good

1020
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:36,639
OG cut because there's no there's not a

1021
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,358
lot of OG cuts out there anymore because

1022
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:40,838
people wanted gelato and demanded it so

1023
00:41:38,358 --> 00:41:43,279
much that OG just wasn't in demand bags

1024
00:41:40,838 --> 00:41:45,000
wouldn't sell of OG and realistically it

1025
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,240
costs money to keep moms of something

1026
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:51,280
that you cannot make money with so it's

1027
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:53,639
either done out of like a sense of Duty

1028
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:57,000
um a a love for

1029
00:41:53,639 --> 00:42:00,358
collecting uh or monetary car and if you

1030
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,838
don't have all three in some cases it's

1031
00:42:00,358 --> 00:42:07,119
just not going to fly and it seems like

1032
00:42:02,838 --> 00:42:09,279
that's what's going on and it's it's

1033
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:12,880
hype at its finest marketing at its

1034
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:14,720
finest and easiest and sheepish to me

1035
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:18,280
and people are get so mad that I say

1036
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:19,719
that but it's it's all I see it another

1037
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,599
phrase comes to mind for me which is

1038
00:42:19,719 --> 00:42:24,039
that these again paraphrasing both of

1039
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:27,359
you like these these names are just like

1040
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:30,400
all like false alter alternative

1041
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:31,598
Alternatives yeah I can see that yeah

1042
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,240
it's the illusion that you're you're

1043
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:35,880
choosing between varying things but

1044
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:38,639
actually you're not really choosing at

1045
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:40,519
all and I mean realistically of choice

1046
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:42,558
with with all the cookie stuff like from

1047
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:44,318
day one like none of this that didn't

1048
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:45,880
Girl Scout cookies doesn't smell like

1049
00:42:44,318 --> 00:42:47,880
thin mint cookies doesn't taste like

1050
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:50,400
thin mint cookies chocolate you know

1051
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:51,838
like Andes mints what the and and it

1052
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,039
just carried on whether you're talking

1053
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:56,960
about sherbet tasting like like orange

1054
00:42:54,039 --> 00:42:59,679
sherbet no it doesn't like

1055
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:03,000
uh wedding cake to me creamy yeah is it

1056
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:05,960
sweet creamy battery no

1057
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:10,280
like just I it's marketing it's

1058
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:12,679
marketing and it's just so dishonest and

1059
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:15,240
I don't know why like I specifically I

1060
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:17,399
remember when animal cookies came out

1061
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:19,759
and before I had it there were a couple

1062
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,800
of um gentlemen I don't remember who

1063
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,119
they were talking about it and reviewing

1064
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:25,400
the bud and they're sitting smelling

1065
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:26,838
like oh my God this smells so much like

1066
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,559
animal cracker

1067
00:43:26,838 --> 00:43:30,799
oh my God I was like godamn that would

1068
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:32,480
be [ __ ] awesome animal cracker Bud

1069
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,559
like that would be the [ __ ] I like the

1070
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,159
smell of animal crackers and so it got

1071
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:39,960
really built up until I grabbed it and I

1072
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:42,838
was like this is not crack this is OG

1073
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:45,960
like [ __ ] you know like a lot of false

1074
00:43:42,838 --> 00:43:48,239
promises get sold but at some point that

1075
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:50,838
expectation was just wiped and people

1076
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:52,838
didn't have the expectation for a name

1077
00:43:50,838 --> 00:43:55,078
to have anything to do with the scent

1078
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:56,440
taste or there's something psychosomatic

1079
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:58,880
going on where they're convincing

1080
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:02,880
themselves that yeah it's totally animal

1081
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:05,240
crackers you know either way tards yeah

1082
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:08,519
you can influence people's perception of

1083
00:44:05,239 --> 00:44:10,519
Aromas by the marketing of its naming

1084
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:13,239
and all that you know if you say like

1085
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:14,679
hey this is you know smells like cookies

1086
00:44:13,239 --> 00:44:17,439
people smell it and maybe they get some

1087
00:44:14,679 --> 00:44:18,960
of that battery an and they're like oh

1088
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,400
yeah it kind of does smell like cookies

1089
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,838
and I'm like what [ __ ] cookie is that

1090
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,318
you know what I mean that's not

1091
00:44:22,838 --> 00:44:26,719
chocolate chip man that's not that's not

1092
00:44:24,318 --> 00:44:29,358
peanut butter cookies you know yeah

1093
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:31,598
blows my mind bro yeah but it's like you

1094
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:33,719
really you can influence people's

1095
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:35,838
perception of Aroma very easily and so

1096
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:38,000
like when I want people's opinions on

1097
00:44:35,838 --> 00:44:39,799
like what something smells like in a jar

1098
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,519
I don't tell them anything because if I

1099
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:43,559
say like do you smell the lime they'll

1100
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:46,358
be

1101
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:48,440
like yeah actually I do you know what I

1102
00:44:46,358 --> 00:44:50,400
mean because your brain is filling it in

1103
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:52,880
you know yeah when you I think when you

1104
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,519
experience uh a field of complexity or

1105
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,480
noise it's very easy to project things

1106
00:44:54,519 --> 00:44:57,880
onto it kind of like looking at clouds

1107
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,679
right daydreaming looking at clouds and

1108
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:01,160
stuff and your friend goes oh do you see

1109
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:03,480
do you see the like Battleship and

1110
00:45:01,159 --> 00:45:07,159
you're like yeah I can see that and it's

1111
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:10,039
like yeah sure yeah the human mind is

1112
00:45:07,159 --> 00:45:13,118
very malleable in our like perception of

1113
00:45:10,039 --> 00:45:14,558
reality yeah unfortunately some people

1114
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:16,680
have it worse than others I guess I

1115
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:19,160
don't know uh you have to have a certain

1116
00:45:16,679 --> 00:45:21,039
certain sense of skepticism to to get

1117
00:45:19,159 --> 00:45:24,159
past that I think like just be an

1118
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:26,719
inherently skeptical person to not have

1119
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:30,679
your mind made up before you something I

1120
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:32,919
guess yeah I mean same as Dan like yeah

1121
00:45:30,679 --> 00:45:34,318
if if my if my Partners bought us some

1122
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:35,920
new coffee I'm I don't want to read the

1123
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:37,400
bag because it's going to say that has

1124
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:40,318
apricot

1125
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:41,920
strawberry you know whatever I want to

1126
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:44,079
try for myself and then see what they

1127
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:46,639
said about it afterwards just so I can

1128
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:48,440
compare you know it's like yeah

1129
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:50,440
otherwise it is too easy I can't imagine

1130
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:52,358
those things too easily either you're

1131
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:54,400
the kid that sniffs your friend's finger

1132
00:45:52,358 --> 00:45:58,318
when he says smell my finger or you're

1133
00:45:54,400 --> 00:46:00,599
not that's down to well and like most of

1134
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:03,079
the time without any information like

1135
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:05,440
that's why I love showing my wife weed

1136
00:46:03,079 --> 00:46:07,680
cuz like she's just like yeah smells

1137
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,039
good and that's like how I am with most

1138
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:11,279
things if it's like if I'm smelling a

1139
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:12,759
bag of coffee I'm not thinking about

1140
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,359
like all the other things it could

1141
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:16,160
possibly smell like or taste like I'm

1142
00:46:14,358 --> 00:46:17,400
like oh yeah smells good and you make a

1143
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:19,039
cup and you're like yeah it tastes

1144
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:21,480
pretty [ __ ] good but yeah then you

1145
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:24,440
you read the bag and you fill in like oh

1146
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:26,199
yeah notes of caramel and you know like

1147
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:29,240
all the things and like suddenly brain's

1148
00:46:26,199 --> 00:46:30,879
like oh yeah yeah for sure I tasted that

1149
00:46:29,239 --> 00:46:32,358
the Starbucks graham cracker coffee

1150
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,559
really does taste like graham crackers

1151
00:46:32,358 --> 00:46:35,199
though oh yeah because they probably

1152
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:37,440
purade some [ __ ] graham crackers in

1153
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:40,558
it so good

1154
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:42,280
bro so good I'm glad to be able to drink

1155
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:43,880
coffee again that was a long time I

1156
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:46,760
couldn't drink coffee without

1157
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:49,599
puking yeah dude I'm I'm there with you

1158
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:53,000
if I have more than one cup I'm like B

1159
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:54,680
yeah it was bad for a while so was it

1160
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,559
worth us talk I mean you guys already

1161
00:46:54,679 --> 00:46:59,598
you know reference permanent marker and

1162
00:46:56,559 --> 00:47:01,680
rs11 and jealousy like is it is it worth

1163
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:04,160
talking about those at all yeah you go

1164
00:47:01,679 --> 00:47:06,279
ahead Dan yeah I've bred with them in

1165
00:47:04,159 --> 00:47:08,118
the past year like pretty extensively

1166
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:10,200
with the last place I was working with

1167
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:11,960
and um permanent marker I think is

1168
00:47:10,199 --> 00:47:13,598
actually some pretty good smoke it's not

1169
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:15,639
something I would take to a desert

1170
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:18,559
island with me but it's like good

1171
00:47:15,639 --> 00:47:20,799
variety because it takes that like sherb

1172
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:23,599
Anis profile and it's just like cranked

1173
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:25,359
up you know and it's not that potent but

1174
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:28,359
it's just it's really really amazing

1175
00:47:25,358 --> 00:47:30,759
flavor like I think I sent um I sent

1176
00:47:28,358 --> 00:47:32,440
someone on the server a couple bags of

1177
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:35,400
like I think it was a skittles S1

1178
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,760
permanent marker and um a few other

1179
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,960
things I can't remember off the top of

1180
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:40,720
my head and even he agreed he was just

1181
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,240
like the permanent markers like even

1182
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:44,838
compared to the Skittles it's like a

1183
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:46,879
very similar profile it like has

1184
00:47:44,838 --> 00:47:50,759
elements of the same thing it's just

1185
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:53,119
like turned up to 11 and so um I thought

1186
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:54,720
it was really nice it was the first like

1187
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:56,119
cookies directional thing that I had

1188
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:58,039
smoked in a long time I was like oh I

1189
00:47:56,119 --> 00:48:00,720
kind of actually [ __ ] like this but

1190
00:47:58,039 --> 00:48:02,199
it lasted a day the tolerance part you

1191
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:04,879
know what I mean like that quick cookies

1192
00:48:02,199 --> 00:48:08,399
buildup of a tolerance to where it

1193
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:10,720
just you know you see it in you see it

1194
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,920
in the lab analysis too it's like not a

1195
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:15,719
very diverse sample as far as like any

1196
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:18,159
accessory canabo or like small amounts

1197
00:48:15,719 --> 00:48:21,318
of different um Turpin that you look at

1198
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:23,920
it's it's kind of just like cool um and

1199
00:48:21,318 --> 00:48:25,679
it breeds they all breed very dominantly

1200
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:28,240
because they've been so like

1201
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:30,000
inadvertently linebred by multiple

1202
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:32,959
different people over the last you know

1203
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:36,838
15 years yeah um and so permanent marker

1204
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:38,199
is very much like rs11 and that like not

1205
00:48:36,838 --> 00:48:39,679
that they breed the same but that

1206
00:48:38,199 --> 00:48:41,960
they're very consistent in their

1207
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:43,960
structures that they pass you'll see

1208
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:45,599
like when I crossed permanent marker

1209
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:48,760
everything looked like permanent marker

1210
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:50,680
and it just depended on whether the um

1211
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:53,000
the other plant had like a more dominant

1212
00:48:50,679 --> 00:48:54,759
Aroma profile or something so like I was

1213
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,679
crossing it to some fruit punch type

1214
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:58,680
stuff and the fruit punch just always

1215
00:48:56,679 --> 00:49:00,118
came through and it looked exactly like

1216
00:48:58,679 --> 00:49:01,039
permanent marker and I was like this is

1217
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:03,720
[ __ ]

1218
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:06,519
boring terrible same thing with RS 11

1219
00:49:03,719 --> 00:49:08,039
rs1 does like like a nice gelato

1220
00:49:06,519 --> 00:49:09,920
structure and then these like thin

1221
00:49:08,039 --> 00:49:11,880
little finger buds that are just like

1222
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:14,760
you know A small collection of kix's

1223
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:16,798
just like stacked on each other and um

1224
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:18,599
it was all garbage in my opinion I

1225
00:49:16,798 --> 00:49:20,358
looked at it and I was just like oh let

1226
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:23,720
me take notes on another [ __ ] plant

1227
00:49:20,358 --> 00:49:25,798
that's exactly like the last one and um

1228
00:49:23,719 --> 00:49:28,358
they're very predictable and that's I

1229
00:49:25,798 --> 00:49:31,159
don't think people get is that these

1230
00:49:28,358 --> 00:49:34,239
things may be massive poly hybrids but

1231
00:49:31,159 --> 00:49:36,879
they've poly hybrids with the same base

1232
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:39,598
components and so things actually do get

1233
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:42,400
fairly fixed over time and um It's

1234
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:46,119
usually the bad stuff and um pretty

1235
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:49,639
looks you know low potency pretty looks

1236
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:51,680
some a lot of cardboard TPS but um

1237
00:49:49,639 --> 00:49:54,239
they're very consistent in what they do

1238
00:49:51,679 --> 00:49:55,719
like rs11 like unless you cross it to

1239
00:49:54,239 --> 00:49:57,358
something like a bully like a train

1240
00:49:55,719 --> 00:49:59,480
wreck or a blue dream or something like

1241
00:49:57,358 --> 00:50:01,119
that like I can tell you exactly the

1242
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:03,280
breakdown of like the types of

1243
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:06,280
Expressions you're likely to see because

1244
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:07,680
it is so consistent um but it's

1245
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:10,559
consistently

1246
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:12,118
bad like the the really nice clones that

1247
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:14,119
get pulled out of these hyers are the

1248
00:50:12,119 --> 00:50:16,079
exception to the rule So when you buy

1249
00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:18,519
these seeds and you're like oh it's you

1250
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:21,119
know zope times this or that like you're

1251
00:50:18,519 --> 00:50:22,639
going to find mostly trash and like you

1252
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:24,880
may be the one that gets lucky that

1253
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:26,838
finds like a really nice tasting one or

1254
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:30,480
one that has unusual potency for the

1255
00:50:26,838 --> 00:50:32,960
line but um they rarely all line up in

1256
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:35,079
one you know like I'll run 50 to 100

1257
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,480
seeds of some of that stuff and just be

1258
00:50:35,079 --> 00:50:39,680
like oh my God why can't I find one that

1259
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:42,199
has the looks the potency and the aroma

1260
00:50:39,679 --> 00:50:44,719
they're all segregated in different

1261
00:50:42,199 --> 00:50:47,159
combinations and I cannot find them

1262
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:50,279
together and um it's really frustrating

1263
00:50:47,159 --> 00:50:52,358
work to do and what if low population

1264
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:54,119
breeding what other than other than just

1265
00:50:52,358 --> 00:50:57,199
inbreeding I wonder if it's just low

1266
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:59,000
population pops bags population pops

1267
00:50:57,199 --> 00:51:01,838
yeah for sure like things can get fixed

1268
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,599
inadvertently and be kind of like bred

1269
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:05,679
quote

1270
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:07,640
unquote completely unintentionally and

1271
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:09,159
you can have traits that get fixed you

1272
00:51:07,639 --> 00:51:11,159
know and some of them can be good and

1273
00:51:09,159 --> 00:51:12,358
some of them are bad I I just like the

1274
00:51:11,159 --> 00:51:14,558
reason it made me think of that was like

1275
00:51:12,358 --> 00:51:17,119
DJ's blueberry like I always go back to

1276
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:20,280
that almost all of my my thoughts on on

1277
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:23,519
stuff like that are uh what I've seen in

1278
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:25,920
blueberry from a low population playing

1279
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:27,920
around type situation where you know was

1280
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:30,159
three plants in a room one Herms on the

1281
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,720
other one one pollinates two other ones

1282
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:33,798
you mix up the seeds and then for the

1283
00:51:31,719 --> 00:51:35,759
next four years you cross the sativa

1284
00:51:33,798 --> 00:51:38,838
type to the indicia type so you're

1285
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:41,599
inbreeding small population yeah even

1286
00:51:38,838 --> 00:51:42,558
though it just and it turns into variant

1287
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:47,318
but

1288
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:49,440
inbred low floor you know yeah and and

1289
00:51:47,318 --> 00:51:51,960
you can fix it it's very easy to fix

1290
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:56,039
throughout Crossing to the right thing

1291
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:58,480
but not everybody does that yeah

1292
00:51:56,039 --> 00:52:00,960
no and like I at this point I really

1293
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:02,599
like like uh for like the future of this

1294
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,838
kind of stuff like I don't really think

1295
00:52:02,599 --> 00:52:06,920
there is one it's like what hasn't been

1296
00:52:04,838 --> 00:52:08,480
crossed to one of these cookies things

1297
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:09,960
like what are we really going to find

1298
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:12,119
like I've done it where I like take a

1299
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,880
nice cut of Blue Dream and work it into

1300
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:16,000
some of these lines and like you know

1301
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:17,798
what it's all trash the best ones are

1302
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
always like oh yeah it's like basically

1303
00:52:17,798 --> 00:52:22,280
Blue Dream yeah the best on light

1304
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,760
reflavoring you know but like I don't

1305
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:25,839
think that there's anything you can like

1306
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,680
cross to this stuff to really make it

1307
00:52:25,838 --> 00:52:30,679
new and exciting for me at least like

1308
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:32,919
I've Just Seen A lot of it and um the

1309
00:52:30,679 --> 00:52:35,879
further back you go the better it is not

1310
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:37,599
forward at all and so yeah I had a

1311
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:39,200
question originally that was like oh how

1312
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:41,720
do you you know quote unquote fix or

1313
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:43,639
Counterpoint it but I think you that we

1314
00:52:41,719 --> 00:52:46,358
saw a good example of them trying to do

1315
00:52:43,639 --> 00:52:48,759
this using bod's congales Kashmir like

1316
00:52:46,358 --> 00:52:50,880
yeah much more like unique and wild than

1317
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:52,119
the Congo cash I got to run it you know

1318
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,358
so I got to see what it was like it was

1319
00:52:52,119 --> 00:52:57,920
unique but even in doing that I've not

1320
00:52:55,358 --> 00:52:59,279
heard of anything like insanely amazing

1321
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:01,159
coming from and that's not just [ __ ] on

1322
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:03,200
bod because he's a [ __ ] amazing guy

1323
00:53:01,159 --> 00:53:06,759
doing cool [ __ ] it's just that's where

1324
00:53:03,199 --> 00:53:08,519
cookies was at I think yeah and like

1325
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,720
what they end up wanting is because like

1326
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:12,159
I've been in these rooms on these

1327
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:13,838
breeding panels where like you do the

1328
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:16,159
work and then someone else gets to pick

1329
00:53:13,838 --> 00:53:18,199
through it and [ __ ] and like catch muu

1330
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:20,598
yeah yeah and like you do the work you

1331
00:53:18,199 --> 00:53:22,279
try and make something new and unusual

1332
00:53:20,599 --> 00:53:25,039
and you know what they do they pick the

1333
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:27,160
one that's most like the modern parent

1334
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:28,679
yeah and it'll be the worst cut out of

1335
00:53:27,159 --> 00:53:30,159
all of it you're just like that's trash

1336
00:53:28,679 --> 00:53:32,598
I didn't even want to show you that jar

1337
00:53:30,159 --> 00:53:34,798
but I had to because the way this works

1338
00:53:32,599 --> 00:53:35,960
and like like why did you pick that and

1339
00:53:34,798 --> 00:53:37,358
then they want to breed with it

1340
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:40,079
afterwards and they're like look at this

1341
00:53:37,358 --> 00:53:42,239
new thing we made and it's just not true

1342
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:44,359
it's all it's all trash most of it at

1343
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:47,479
least and like maybe you can find

1344
00:53:44,358 --> 00:53:48,920
something that has like a novel Aroma

1345
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:50,838
but most of the time it's just like a

1346
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:53,159
jack Aroma from one of the parents and

1347
00:53:50,838 --> 00:53:55,558
then you added it to this structure and

1348
00:53:53,159 --> 00:53:56,960
this like thing that people like but I

1349
00:53:55,559 --> 00:53:59,400
think people need to get away from that

1350
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:02,760
it's like the structure of the weed like

1351
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:04,920
doesn't matter at all just like if I

1352
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:07,280
need a seven gram jar to put an eighth

1353
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:10,440
in it because it's larpy but it's really

1354
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:12,839
good really nuanced tasty weed like why

1355
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:15,119
does weed have to be Rock little little

1356
00:54:12,838 --> 00:54:17,639
rocks little Pebbles and dense and like

1357
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:19,798
why does it have to be purple and like

1358
00:54:17,639 --> 00:54:21,440
why does it have to have this dessert

1359
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:22,960
name attached to it and I think that

1360
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,798
people just don't even especially the

1361
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,318
younger people I talk to like they don't

1362
00:54:24,798 --> 00:54:28,838
even really know about like real

1363
00:54:27,318 --> 00:54:30,199
diversity in weed they think that

1364
00:54:28,838 --> 00:54:33,239
they're looking at all these names

1365
00:54:30,199 --> 00:54:34,838
permanent marker sherb jealousy and they

1366
00:54:33,239 --> 00:54:36,838
think that they're all these distinct

1367
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:39,639
things from each other and they're just

1368
00:54:36,838 --> 00:54:42,558
not at all it's all marketing and so

1369
00:54:39,639 --> 00:54:45,199
like the way forward is to just like ask

1370
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:46,599
for new things like actually new things

1371
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:48,318
maybe don't buy your weed from a

1372
00:54:46,599 --> 00:54:50,400
dispensary if you have the option you

1373
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:52,000
know what I mean because like there's a

1374
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,760
lot of people that still grow in their

1375
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,358
homes and in their backyards that don't

1376
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,839
give a [ __ ] about what's popular popular

1377
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:59,159
and what sells because it's just for

1378
00:54:56,838 --> 00:55:01,960
them and their family and their friends

1379
00:54:59,159 --> 00:55:03,558
and um that's the like move that I'm

1380
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:05,838
trying to do is just like I'm going to

1381
00:55:03,559 --> 00:55:08,079
grow things that I like make things that

1382
00:55:05,838 --> 00:55:10,358
I like and then I'm G to find the people

1383
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:12,640
that jive with that you know I don't

1384
00:55:10,358 --> 00:55:14,239
care about making sales and like growing

1385
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:16,358
something that's guaranteed to make me

1386
00:55:14,239 --> 00:55:18,118
sales because at the end of the day I'm

1387
00:55:16,358 --> 00:55:20,318
not a one- trick pony I don't like need

1388
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:23,400
to make money off of weed it's just nice

1389
00:55:20,318 --> 00:55:25,558
to like do the work and feel rewarded at

1390
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:27,960
the same time or like have it not just

1391
00:55:25,559 --> 00:55:31,680
like cost you money for having this like

1392
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:34,199
very life consuming hobby um yeah but

1393
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:37,519
yeah we need to get away from this like

1394
00:55:34,199 --> 00:55:38,960
fixation on color and density and I

1395
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:41,358
think that would solve most of the

1396
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:43,880
problems you know you can still cross

1397
00:55:41,358 --> 00:55:47,239
GDP into other weird stuff and like some

1398
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:50,000
of these more basal components um and F

1399
00:55:47,239 --> 00:55:52,439
get really interesting weed yeah this is

1400
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,159
more or less where I wanted to where I

1401
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:57,079
wanted us to conclude which is maybe

1402
00:55:54,159 --> 00:56:00,118
just for fun speculating or reflecting

1403
00:55:57,079 --> 00:56:02,760
on what those possibilities are even

1404
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:05,318
like for example whether it's we talked

1405
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:07,920
about uh different uhal OG hybrids

1406
00:56:05,318 --> 00:56:10,519
earlier on but even like thinking okay

1407
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:12,760
in an alternate his in an alternate like

1408
00:56:10,519 --> 00:56:15,559
timeline where instead of URL there was

1409
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:18,039
Blue Bonnet like what would that what

1410
00:56:15,559 --> 00:56:19,960
would have happened you know something

1411
00:56:18,039 --> 00:56:23,359
or any other thing that's like equally

1412
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:25,559
distinctive Jolley CH trolley u double

1413
00:56:23,358 --> 00:56:29,038
purple Dojo was a big one during like

1414
00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:31,000
the the late 2000s double purple Doo

1415
00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:33,200
based on BlackBerry or Blackberry Widow

1416
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,358
whatever they were really using um a lot

1417
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:40,199
of that stuff is so different and far

1418
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:41,440
removed from what Oracle types are um

1419
00:56:40,199 --> 00:56:43,118
there could have been a lot of Novel

1420
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:45,599
cool [ __ ] done with that like even

1421
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:47,599
subcool as much as much as people know

1422
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:50,559
my contentious relationship with a human

1423
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:53,200
being was when he was around um the

1424
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:55,839
double purple DOA was insane like it was

1425
00:56:53,199 --> 00:56:59,318
a basically a purple like a Blackberry

1426
00:56:55,838 --> 00:57:01,078
version of Apollo 13 and we don't really

1427
00:56:59,318 --> 00:57:03,038
see a lot of Apollo 13 types anymore

1428
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:04,640
especially now that that TGA is

1429
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:08,119
temporarily gone but we're going to see

1430
00:57:04,639 --> 00:57:10,519
a Resurgence soon but uh like that was

1431
00:57:08,119 --> 00:57:12,358
cool that was way different than than

1432
00:57:10,519 --> 00:57:14,798
any of the cookie stuff and you still

1433
00:57:12,358 --> 00:57:17,199
got like the novel purple maybe not as

1434
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:19,679
much Leaf resin maybe it wasn't geared

1435
00:57:17,199 --> 00:57:21,480
as much to Bubble has and that's another

1436
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:23,838
part of it is like people just see resin

1437
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:25,440
and they think oh hash bro you know yank

1438
00:57:23,838 --> 00:57:28,639
it but

1439
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:31,760
you got the colors you got unique TPS

1440
00:57:28,639 --> 00:57:34,598
you got really potent highs in many

1441
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:36,280
cases um chatr has very similar

1442
00:57:34,599 --> 00:57:37,760
beautiful magenta colors and it's just

1443
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:40,519
so far out of the realm of what people

1444
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:42,640
are using today you know a base

1445
00:57:40,519 --> 00:57:45,440
Pakistani which is essentially you know

1446
00:57:42,639 --> 00:57:46,199
very similar to an Afghani um slightly

1447
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,240
different

1448
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:49,358
elevations that could take things in so

1449
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:51,519
many different

1450
00:57:49,358 --> 00:57:53,480
directions just randomly as well like

1451
00:57:51,519 --> 00:57:55,679
even if you kept URL like why would be

1452
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:59,599
like to not use OG right like we we've

1453
00:57:55,679 --> 00:58:00,759
seen we've seen URL kimd yes dogs Walts

1454
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:04,119
is that what it

1455
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:06,480
is I mean Loosely tra dog sorry so not

1456
00:58:04,119 --> 00:58:08,240
exactly but you know like that that even

1457
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:10,639
that's quite different and quite

1458
00:58:08,239 --> 00:58:13,000
interesting yeah yeah dude that's a a

1459
00:58:10,639 --> 00:58:15,480
lot of people's favorite cut it's a cool

1460
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:18,119
it's a cool cut um urle what I did like

1461
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:19,719
an a GDP bubbleberry that was really

1462
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:22,880
unique back in the day it was one of my

1463
00:58:19,719 --> 00:58:25,558
very first crosses um there's a lot of

1464
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:28,920
different things you could do at GDP and

1465
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:31,079
um even like an Urkle tie like you know

1466
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:32,798
like the like the like banana tie or the

1467
00:58:31,079 --> 00:58:35,119
Juicy Fruit tie that was in banana tie

1468
00:58:32,798 --> 00:58:37,239
cross the URL be insane it would be

1469
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:40,838
really really neat um two totally

1470
00:58:37,239 --> 00:58:43,719
different types it's not I just it's

1471
00:58:40,838 --> 00:58:46,279
like to me URL wasn't the problem it

1472
00:58:43,719 --> 00:58:50,000
was

1473
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:51,839
really not not unique thinkers the the

1474
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,760
everybody trying to do the same thing

1475
00:58:51,838 --> 00:58:56,279
and capitalize on the same thing really

1476
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:58,119
easily like for me cookies was very easy

1477
00:58:56,280 --> 00:59:00,240
to grow it made everyone look like they

1478
00:58:58,119 --> 00:59:03,519
could grow really well because you it

1479
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:05,318
grew itself you know and um that in

1480
00:59:03,519 --> 00:59:07,038
itself made everybody start growing it

1481
00:59:05,318 --> 00:59:09,199
too like oh I look like a rock star look

1482
00:59:07,039 --> 00:59:11,039
how Frosty this is I'm a dank grower bro

1483
00:59:09,199 --> 00:59:14,000
I can feed this nitrogen like a tomato

1484
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:16,640
all the time and it still blows up

1485
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,920
Frosty yeah and there's so many

1486
00:59:16,639 --> 00:59:20,558
different directions and people are just

1487
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:23,200
so sheepish I hate it it's it's what's

1488
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:25,559
turned me off in general I realized I

1489
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:27,399
when asking uh alternative to cookies

1490
00:59:25,559 --> 00:59:30,798
I.E like the rest of

1491
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:33,400
breeding yeah I mean not asking anything

1492
00:59:30,798 --> 00:59:35,159
yeah it's just a small niche of it even

1493
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:38,039
outside of cookies though if you really

1494
00:59:35,159 --> 00:59:40,318
think about it it's like people think

1495
00:59:38,039 --> 00:59:42,680
that nowadays people would think

1496
00:59:40,318 --> 00:59:44,400
breeding with OG is probably original

1497
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:46,519
and I'm like once again like what hasn't

1498
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:49,639
been crossed to OG I can't think of a

1499
00:59:46,519 --> 00:59:52,559
single thing you know and so like if you

1500
00:59:49,639 --> 00:59:55,639
look back we are actually still just

1501
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:57,440
using the pieces from previous Hy Paras

1502
00:59:55,639 --> 01:00:00,279
where it's like the purple cuts and the

1503
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:01,838
ogs and then now all the modern stuff

1504
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:03,559
and so like that's the only thing I

1505
01:00:01,838 --> 01:00:06,159
really care about nowadays is stuff that

1506
01:00:03,559 --> 01:00:08,079
predates almost all of it yeah because

1507
01:00:06,159 --> 01:00:10,759
the rest of it's already been done and

1508
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:12,640
it was done well a lot of the times too

1509
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:14,359
and like you're probably not going to

1510
01:00:12,639 --> 01:00:15,639
have the same access to the versions of

1511
01:00:14,358 --> 01:00:18,920
the cuts that the people that did it

1512
01:00:15,639 --> 01:00:22,440
really well when it was around um did

1513
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:23,920
and so um I just look for 90s weed now

1514
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:27,200
you know I want to Super Skunk

1515
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:29,559
everything like yeah right the thing

1516
01:00:27,199 --> 01:00:32,199
yeah but to me also like but that's

1517
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:33,640
almost like a little bit like souring

1518
01:00:32,199 --> 01:00:35,879
everything up or like cheeming

1519
01:00:33,639 --> 01:00:37,400
everything up or oging everything up I

1520
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:39,079
think there's it's the same component in

1521
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:40,920
all those three they give it like the

1522
01:00:39,079 --> 01:00:43,519
soapiness sometimes when you explore the

1523
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:45,280
s1's in different directions um so it's

1524
01:00:43,519 --> 01:00:47,318
really not that novel or unique but it's

1525
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:48,920
taking a step back to where you can see

1526
01:00:47,318 --> 01:00:50,358
all the other components that are in

1527
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:51,280
those things and then stuff that you've

1528
01:00:50,358 --> 01:00:54,159
never

1529
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:55,640
seen yeah yeah it's going to be

1530
01:00:54,159 --> 01:00:58,480
interesting inter to see where everyone

1531
01:00:55,639 --> 01:01:00,838
goes cuz it's like it's so standardized

1532
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:02,920
now you know like things only get

1533
01:01:00,838 --> 01:01:04,759
selected when they grow a certain way

1534
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:06,639
and they flower in a certain time frame

1535
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:10,280
and they respond to nutrients that

1536
01:01:06,639 --> 01:01:12,519
everyone uses the same now and so like

1537
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:15,160
like what we've seen now is and I think

1538
01:01:12,519 --> 01:01:17,719
it's already there is like like we're

1539
01:01:15,159 --> 01:01:19,639
all drinking Budweiser yeah you know

1540
01:01:17,719 --> 01:01:22,439
what I mean like it doesn't matter where

1541
01:01:19,639 --> 01:01:23,838
you buy it from and like it it can have

1542
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:27,318
all kinds of different names but it's

1543
01:01:23,838 --> 01:01:29,239
really the iction between like Bud MGD

1544
01:01:27,318 --> 01:01:32,000
Miller you know what I mean like it's

1545
01:01:29,239 --> 01:01:33,798
like all the same cheap shitty beer it's

1546
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,920
all the same cheap shitty weed and it's

1547
01:01:33,798 --> 01:01:38,199
grown with no love and like a lot of

1548
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:40,639
times because of the way testing

1549
01:01:38,199 --> 01:01:42,960
standards work you would be appalled to

1550
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:45,480
look in the rooms that these big

1551
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:49,199
companies with good reputations have and

1552
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:50,960
so um need a whole episode on that bro

1553
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:52,759
yeah there's just like it's it's

1554
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:54,920
terrifying like people that actually

1555
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:56,599
love this and actually care about what

1556
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:59,680
they consume and what they give to other

1557
01:01:56,599 --> 01:02:03,359
people like you would all hate to see

1558
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:04,679
where it's gone and um they can spin it

1559
01:02:03,358 --> 01:02:07,558
whatever the way they want with their

1560
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:09,239
marketing but there's a lot of really

1561
01:02:07,559 --> 01:02:11,839
horrendous things that you'll see in a

1562
01:02:09,239 --> 01:02:13,679
modern grow nowadays and the absolute

1563
01:02:11,838 --> 01:02:16,440
lack of caring the only thing that

1564
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:18,278
matters is the schedule yep it doesn't

1565
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:20,720
matter what the plant wants what would

1566
01:02:18,278 --> 01:02:22,278
make it Excel what would make it a

1567
01:02:20,719 --> 01:02:24,000
better product it doesn't matter there's

1568
01:02:22,278 --> 01:02:24,880
a schedule to meet there's pounds that

1569
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,760
need to

1570
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:29,920
like shipped out on this dat to these

1571
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:32,559
people and um it's the beaster era all

1572
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:34,358
over again just with fancy new packaging

1573
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:36,640
yeah a lot more money involved lot more

1574
01:02:34,358 --> 01:02:39,480
corporate money involved lot more Chads

1575
01:02:36,639 --> 01:02:42,639
and that's the only difference

1576
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:45,559
yeah way I see it too brother yeah it's

1577
01:02:42,639 --> 01:02:47,159
a sad time for commercial weed but once

1578
01:02:45,559 --> 01:02:49,039
again just don't buy like if you have

1579
01:02:47,159 --> 01:02:51,159
the opportunity like don't buy weed from

1580
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:53,119
a shop like if you have the opportunity

1581
01:02:51,159 --> 01:02:55,000
with your backyard or your garage or

1582
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:58,079
whatever like gross some plants for

1583
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:59,798
yourself like even on your first go with

1584
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:02,119
some some plants or some seeds that you

1585
01:02:59,798 --> 01:03:03,679
can buy commercially or as a as a home

1586
01:03:02,119 --> 01:03:05,440
grower like you're probably going to

1587
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:08,358
like that weed so much more than what

1588
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:10,119
you're paying 4 to $60 an e at a store

1589
01:03:08,358 --> 01:03:12,519
for most people would be surprised with

1590
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:14,559
what they can do for sure it's been made

1591
01:03:12,519 --> 01:03:16,880
to look very inaccessible you know like

1592
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:19,000
seeing all these like 90 lighters 200

1593
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:21,760
lighters it looks really inaccessible it

1594
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:23,679
looks really expensive but uh it's not

1595
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:27,319
there's there's better there's there's

1596
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:31,118
ways to do it small and efficient and

1597
01:03:27,318 --> 01:03:32,358
better you know better controls yeah no

1598
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:35,519
just a little you don't have enough

1599
01:03:32,358 --> 01:03:37,838
space you need to see Migra yeah exactly

1600
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:39,719
man like or if you like live in an

1601
01:03:37,838 --> 01:03:41,719
illegal State still or an illegal

1602
01:03:39,719 --> 01:03:44,358
portion of the world like people do it

1603
01:03:41,719 --> 01:03:45,838
man you're even more lucky like

1604
01:03:44,358 --> 01:03:47,798
realistically like you're more lucky

1605
01:03:45,838 --> 01:03:50,239
because then you could get some some

1606
01:03:47,798 --> 01:03:54,400
some money for your [ __ ] make it worth

1607
01:03:50,239 --> 01:03:55,598
it you know spot also yeah I mean I'm

1608
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,119
you know you guys know I'm not in that

1609
01:03:55,599 --> 01:04:01,920
I'm not advocating doing a little Stu by

1610
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:04,240
the way oh never but even being so

1611
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:05,798
remote like we don't really exposed to

1612
01:04:04,239 --> 01:04:09,679
even like those Market pressures or

1613
01:04:05,798 --> 01:04:11,000
those weird demands like yeah no for

1614
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:13,239
sure and those are the those are where

1615
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,838
the pockets of diversity usually Thrive

1616
01:04:13,239 --> 01:04:17,358
is where there isn't this substantial

1617
01:04:14,838 --> 01:04:19,440
Market pressure and like and what the

1618
01:04:17,358 --> 01:04:22,798
Last Frontier in America is the the

1619
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:25,079
homeg grower you know and so like we all

1620
01:04:22,798 --> 01:04:26,278
need to keep keep going with this and so

1621
01:04:25,079 --> 01:04:29,119
I don't know maybe there's some

1622
01:04:26,278 --> 01:04:31,278
opportunity to like form just like weed

1623
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:33,000
appreciation groups in your community

1624
01:04:31,278 --> 01:04:34,440
kind of thing where it's just like hey

1625
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:36,278
like it doesn't cost you anything to be

1626
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:39,559
a part of it or it's a very small fee

1627
01:04:36,278 --> 01:04:41,519
like on a a patreon thing or a Discord

1628
01:04:39,559 --> 01:04:43,640
thing and just like hey we all meet up

1629
01:04:41,519 --> 01:04:45,719
in person we share jars we talk about

1630
01:04:43,639 --> 01:04:48,239
weed we all love it maybe a little clone

1631
01:04:45,719 --> 01:04:50,159
swap here and there but like we need to

1632
01:04:48,239 --> 01:04:52,558
get back to more

1633
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:55,118
Grassroots methods like that and just

1634
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:56,920
like Community Based stuff because if we

1635
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:58,640
just give it away to the corporations

1636
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:00,440
they're going to make you pay more than

1637
01:04:58,639 --> 01:05:02,759
full price like I don't remember paying

1638
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:05,119
$60 for an eighth at a shop during the

1639
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:06,920
215 era like they were there you know

1640
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:09,318
what I mean there was a few but it's

1641
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:11,880
like by the end of the 215 era you could

1642
01:05:09,318 --> 01:05:14,558
get [ __ ] $35 eights a top shelf

1643
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:16,920
anywhere in California and it was

1644
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:18,440
absolutely killer diversity just

1645
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:21,159
anything you could want you could go

1646
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:23,720
into a shop and pick from a 100 jars and

1647
01:05:21,159 --> 01:05:27,038
how did we got from there in a short

1648
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:29,480
number of years to basically all the

1649
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:32,640
same weed with different marketing

1650
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:36,039
packaging you know and it's all full

1651
01:05:32,639 --> 01:05:37,759
price more so than when it was illegal

1652
01:05:36,039 --> 01:05:40,640
even though it's more over produced than

1653
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:45,400
ever like it just doesn't add up to me I

1654
01:05:40,639 --> 01:05:47,278
call [ __ ] like artificial scarcity

1655
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:48,519
you know I mean but like this is what I

1656
01:05:47,278 --> 01:05:50,318
keep trying to drive home in all these

1657
01:05:48,519 --> 01:05:52,079
episodes like you vote with your dollars

1658
01:05:50,318 --> 01:05:54,079
you literally vote with your dollars

1659
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:56,039
there is and trying to explain to people

1660
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:59,200
people that there's maybe like seven or

1661
01:05:56,039 --> 01:06:01,480
eight people on Earth with these big

1662
01:05:59,199 --> 01:06:05,159
collections with good provenant on these

1663
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:07,440
clones that's shrinking so fast they're

1664
01:06:05,159 --> 01:06:09,239
having to make hard [ __ ] choices and

1665
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:10,679
if you keep if you if you're ever

1666
01:06:09,239 --> 01:06:12,358
interested in smoking something that's

1667
01:06:10,679 --> 01:06:14,879
not cookies or gelato if you're if

1668
01:06:12,358 --> 01:06:17,358
you're you know one of those people who

1669
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:19,358
doesn't just follow the straight line

1670
01:06:17,358 --> 01:06:20,679
like vote with your dollars that's it

1671
01:06:19,358 --> 01:06:23,558
it's all it's left and if you don't

1672
01:06:20,679 --> 01:06:25,358
it'll be gone and that's s yeah and what

1673
01:06:23,559 --> 01:06:28,240
sucks is that like the kind of

1674
01:06:25,358 --> 01:06:31,679
connoisseur part portion of the American

1675
01:06:28,239 --> 01:06:35,399
weed Market is heady Bros who buy

1676
01:06:31,679 --> 01:06:38,000
expensive [ __ ] dab torches and and pu

1677
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:40,318
puff Coes and [ __ ] and like they love

1678
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:43,000
the newest greatest drop from [ __ ]

1679
01:06:40,318 --> 01:06:44,880
compound and [ __ ] whoever else like

1680
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:47,199
whoever the big name of the day is you

1681
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:48,559
know yeah they're only like I don't

1682
01:06:47,199 --> 01:06:50,598
understand how The Connoisseur portion

1683
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:53,359
of the market is run by people who love

1684
01:06:50,599 --> 01:06:54,760
the most midy [ __ ] possible even if it's

1685
01:06:53,358 --> 01:06:56,480
grown well it's just like well dude

1686
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:59,000
that's not that great of weed like yeah

1687
01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:00,679
it was tasty but like like I want to get

1688
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,440
[ __ ] up like I think people forgot

1689
01:07:00,679 --> 01:07:04,960
that the point of this is to not smoke

1690
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:06,920
weed all day and not get high it's like

1691
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:09,639
no I want to take one bong rip and like

1692
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:12,159
sit down for four hours and like forget

1693
01:07:09,639 --> 01:07:13,838
about like the hard [ __ ] in my life and

1694
01:07:12,159 --> 01:07:16,239
you know what I mean like that's like

1695
01:07:13,838 --> 01:07:17,838
what I go for at least with weed I don't

1696
01:07:16,239 --> 01:07:20,278
want to have to get up five times during

1697
01:07:17,838 --> 01:07:22,400
a movie to go re up again just to be

1698
01:07:20,278 --> 01:07:25,559
high and like suspend disbelief and

1699
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:27,760
enjoy the show you know and so remember

1700
01:07:25,559 --> 01:07:29,319
when Exotics meant something from like

1701
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:32,880
another country that you couldn't get a

1702
01:07:29,318 --> 01:07:36,119
hold of that was wild types yeah now it

1703
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:37,480
zah like yeah defines cookies crap

1704
01:07:36,119 --> 01:07:40,640
almost like the

1705
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:42,480
opposite almost the opposite exact for

1706
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:45,400
sure smoking mirrors right in your face

1707
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:47,719
boom yeah and so like I don't know yeah

1708
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:50,000
I I hope people see through these games

1709
01:07:47,719 --> 01:07:52,879
that people are playing to take your

1710
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,719
dollar out of your pocket and give you

1711
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:56,838
the dumpiest version of Something

1712
01:07:54,719 --> 01:07:59,399
possible for and then ask them to say

1713
01:07:56,838 --> 01:08:03,038
thank you you know

1714
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:05,920
like it's just like yeah I did want to

1715
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:07,559
prompt you both so yeah I think you know

1716
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:10,838
good nice reflection on the state of the

1717
01:08:07,559 --> 01:08:13,160
market uh at the end there but I think

1718
01:08:10,838 --> 01:08:15,038
we're also coming to an end uh with

1719
01:08:13,159 --> 01:08:16,719
regards to cookies was there anything

1720
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:19,400
else that either of you wanted to say

1721
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:20,759
about cookies um parting thoughts

1722
01:08:19,399 --> 01:08:24,759
parting

1723
01:08:20,759 --> 01:08:28,119
shots I mean for me it's just like

1724
01:08:24,759 --> 01:08:29,759
it's not it's not what that last episode

1725
01:08:28,119 --> 01:08:32,278
said it was and we were really doing a

1726
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:34,119
good job of laying out like what it is

1727
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:35,839
and what it isn't and it kind of got

1728
01:08:34,119 --> 01:08:38,278
crushed so that's why we had to redo

1729
01:08:35,838 --> 01:08:40,079
this so apolog you guys are sick really

1730
01:08:38,279 --> 01:08:42,520
great job by the way I think I think

1731
01:08:40,079 --> 01:08:45,359
what we got this episode is yeah more or

1732
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:47,000
less what I wanted last time yeah yeah

1733
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:49,600
yeah it was the direction it was going

1734
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:51,679
so hopefully hopefully this will be a

1735
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:54,440
good marker for it for people to return

1736
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:56,319
to um another thing is like

1737
01:08:54,439 --> 01:08:58,519
I've read the comments every time we do

1738
01:08:56,319 --> 01:09:00,359
a cookies episode there's cookie Bros

1739
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:02,359
coming in calling me a [ __ ] hater and

1740
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:04,239
all that [ __ ] I was one of the first

1741
01:09:02,359 --> 01:09:07,239
people using it and breeding with it so

1742
01:09:04,238 --> 01:09:09,238
like while I don't enjoy it and love it

1743
01:09:07,238 --> 01:09:12,039
I have contributed to the problem and

1744
01:09:09,238 --> 01:09:13,519
I'm very transparent about that and um I

1745
01:09:12,039 --> 01:09:17,198
didn't realize I was doing it at the

1746
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:18,799
time it took a while uh but I get it

1747
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:21,079
like I get why some people like it

1748
01:09:18,798 --> 01:09:22,640
because it's novel and new to them but

1749
01:09:21,079 --> 01:09:23,798
from a breeding pers I speaking about

1750
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:25,359
everything from a breeding persp

1751
01:09:23,798 --> 01:09:26,439
perspective and a lot of people don't

1752
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:28,239
understand that because they don't breed

1753
01:09:26,439 --> 01:09:29,838
they don't make seeds they don't explore

1754
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:32,519
different lines from a breeding

1755
01:09:29,838 --> 01:09:33,960
perspective it is a dead ass end and

1756
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:35,080
that's all there is to it and whether

1757
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:39,000
they like it or not I'm still gonna say

1758
01:09:35,079 --> 01:09:41,600
it y now that's all I have to say too is

1759
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:44,798
that it's like we've got a

1760
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:49,000
mean pretty but shitty girlfriend and

1761
01:09:44,798 --> 01:09:51,838
it's time to dump her yeah yeah you know

1762
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:54,399

1770
01:10:10,198 --> 01:10:15,639
still stuck in this remodel behind me um

1771
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:17,320
once I get out of here and the next

1772
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:20,159
couple weeks and get done and moved into

1773
01:10:17,319 --> 01:10:22,799
this place then um I can actually start

1774
01:10:20,158 --> 01:10:25,279
working again and uh doing cool [ __ ]

1775
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:26,800
that isn't permanent marker hybrids so I

1776
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:28,119
mean have you even talked about it on

1777
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:31,480
the show that you're just doing your own

1778
01:10:28,119 --> 01:10:33,479
thing now no I haven't yeah no I got La

1779

La Land yeah you got yeah I I got dumped

1780
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:39,439
by the corporate Bros um oh well I was

1781
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:41,840
too real apparently you're still too

1782
01:10:39,439 --> 01:10:43,919
nice to to like really pull weight on

1783
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:46,520
him I still think we should Flex on but

1784
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:48,119
you know that's up to you always at the

1785
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:50,199
end of the day man like they've

1786
01:10:48,119 --> 01:10:52,359
tarnished their own reputation it's just

1787
01:10:50,198 --> 01:10:54,678
going to be fun watching them release

1788
01:10:52,359 --> 01:10:57,719
stuff that I made uh for probably the

1789
01:10:54,679 --> 01:10:59,440
next two plus years you know and so I've

1790
01:10:57,719 --> 01:11:01,880
already heard a few murmur from people

1791
01:10:59,439 --> 01:11:03,198
that I know that still work there and um

1792
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:05,679
they're like oh did you make this this

1793
01:11:03,198 --> 01:11:08,678
was [ __ ] amazing and I'm like

1794
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:10,039
yeah it's not like interesting to me

1795
01:11:08,679 --> 01:11:13,039
though none of the work that I did there

1796
01:11:10,039 --> 01:11:14,679
was interesting to me at all and so uh

1797
01:11:13,039 --> 01:11:16,319
I'm more stoked on the stuff that I have

1798
01:11:14,679 --> 01:11:18,920
going now and some of the projects that

1799
01:11:16,319 --> 01:11:23,399
I have planned for the near future and

1800
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:26,640
so um yeah maybe maybe a seedline drop

1801
01:11:23,399 --> 01:11:28,319
um which I haven't done in years and uh

1802
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:31,440
I don't know we're still fiddling around

1803
01:11:28,319 --> 01:11:32,799
with the reversal sprays and stuff so um

1804
01:11:31,439 --> 01:11:34,359
we got to get back on track now that

1805
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:36,400
I've lost my workspace but I have

1806
01:11:34,359 --> 01:11:39,238
already built my new one so it's just

1807
01:11:36,399 --> 01:11:41,238
more a Time allocation thing so I'm

1808
01:11:39,238 --> 01:11:43,399
proud of how you handled it I I you know

1809
01:11:41,238 --> 01:11:44,839
like I've lost jobs where it's your

1810
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:45,920
livelihood whether you loved it or not

1811
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:47,360
it's your livelihood and you have to

1812
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:50,039
make big changes and you handled it like

1813
01:11:47,359 --> 01:11:52,079
a [ __ ] man so proud of you yeah man

1814
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:55,560
thank you no I mean I bought a house a

1815
01:11:52,079 --> 01:11:55,559
month before I got fir

1816
01:11:56,279 --> 01:12:01,519
yeah and I got to keep spending money to

1817
01:11:58,039 --> 01:12:02,840
like make it nice you know so it's like

1818
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:04,760
one of those things where it's just like

1819
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:09,000
yep but luckily I've already got new

1820
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:12,239
work and uh uh out of the weed industry

1821
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:16,238
and so it's much more rewarding and um

1822
01:12:12,238 --> 01:12:19,319
I'm already happier so all that matters

1823
01:12:16,238 --> 01:12:20,799
bro yep all right thousand what you got

1824
01:12:19,319 --> 01:12:25,039
but couldn't have done it I've got

1825
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:29,679
gotten a lot of support from the

1826
01:12:25,039 --> 01:12:33,560
yeah um love you I don't think I have

1827
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:36,000
too much to add yeah I'm uh by this

1828
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:37,400
point Matt would have had an out well

1829
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,840
Matt would have mentioned the 10K

1830
01:12:37,399 --> 01:12:41,559
subscribers thing so I'll just like but

1831
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:43,400
in reality when we're recording this

1832
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:46,360
this has just happened so bit of you

1833
01:12:43,399 --> 01:12:47,759
know timey wiy stuff um yeah so still

1834
01:12:46,359 --> 01:12:49,920
thinking about that still stoked about

1835
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:51,239
that very satisfying I knew we would get

1836
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:54,440
there of course it was just a matter of

1837
01:12:51,238 --> 01:12:57,079
when but yeah I'm stoked about that

1838
01:12:54,439 --> 01:13:00,719
um I wrote this really long nice thing

1839
01:12:57,079 --> 01:13:02,639
on Instagram by the way follow us at I

1840
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:04,600
think it's what is it the. breeders.

1841
01:13:02,639 --> 01:13:08,239
Syndicate I believe that's the one that

1842
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:10,199
I have now um or I'm sorry breeders.

1843
01:13:08,238 --> 01:13:12,919
syndicate.net we

1844
01:13:10,198 --> 01:13:15,678
put yeah we'll put it in the description

1845
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:17,920
um IG sniped our page because people

1846
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:20,158
obviously report us because what I say

1847
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:22,520
conflicts with their money making and

1848
01:13:20,158 --> 01:13:24,158
that's how it goes you know um so we

1849
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:26,440
lost everything that had to do with the

1850
01:13:24,158 --> 01:13:29,679
podcast on there but we do have the new

1851
01:13:26,439 --> 01:13:33,238
one up and uh I I wrote about doing like

1852
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:35,279
a nice you know a a cool contest

1853
01:13:33,238 --> 01:13:37,599
giveaway with everybody who's following

1854
01:13:35,279 --> 01:13:39,840
on Instagram do something cool to you

1855
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:42,079
know for the 10K subscribers on YouTube

1856
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:43,480
do a do a contest there and then one for

1857
01:13:42,079 --> 01:13:45,760
the patreon as well something really

1858
01:13:43,479 --> 01:13:47,759
cool for all our patreon Discord people

1859
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:51,199
just to celebrate like hitting 10K that

1860
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:53,719
was a big big milestone and uh yeah I

1861
01:13:51,198 --> 01:13:55,719
mean thousand was the driving part

1862
01:13:53,719 --> 01:13:58,560
behind that like I that just seemed so

1863
01:13:55,719 --> 01:14:00,679
unrealistic when he first came in to

1864
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:03,560
like 10 thou okay bro that'll be like

1865
01:14:00,679 --> 01:14:06,359
nine years whatever KCK around [ __ ] till

1866
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:09,560
then you know but um so thank you for

1867
01:14:06,359 --> 01:14:11,319
that I just I did want to say I think uh

1868
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:15,320
just quickly in the response to that

1869
01:14:11,319 --> 01:14:16,880
like I think when I started helping out

1870
01:14:15,319 --> 01:14:19,439
I just knew that all I had to do was

1871
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:21,400
keep going for a bit longer and it would

1872
01:14:19,439 --> 01:14:23,759
work I just kind of was fully confident

1873
01:14:21,399 --> 01:14:26,479
that if we could still have some of our

1874
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:28,600
good people around us and still make the

1875
01:14:26,479 --> 01:14:30,479
show and make it more sustainable that

1876
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:33,000
we would just get there and I think we

1877
01:14:30,479 --> 01:14:35,399
actually doubled the subs in six months

1878
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:38,679
I think um when I first started helping

1879
01:14:35,399 --> 01:14:41,238
we were at like four or 5K yep and so

1880
01:14:38,679 --> 01:14:44,039
yeah I I I I'm still pretty amazed that

1881
01:14:41,238 --> 01:14:45,279
we got there in half a year um but I was

1882
01:14:44,039 --> 01:14:48,519
also hoping that that's how long it

1883
01:14:45,279 --> 01:14:49,759
would take so yeah yeah no I mean like a

1884
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:51,800
lot of people don't know but I was ready

1885
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:53,880
to clock out like on the whole show I

1886
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:55,880
was done I was like I'm not happy with

1887
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:59,639
the direction I'm not happy with what's

1888
01:14:55,880 --> 01:15:01,639
being said I'm not saying anything uh

1889
01:14:59,639 --> 01:15:03,400
and it wasn't just about me it was just

1890
01:15:01,639 --> 01:15:07,719
a lot of misinformation and I couldn't

1891
01:15:03,399 --> 01:15:09,198
stop some of it and um I was done I was

1892
01:15:07,719 --> 01:15:11,719
really done

1893
01:15:09,198 --> 01:15:13,158
and without thousand the show wouldn't

1894
01:15:11,719 --> 01:15:14,880
exist right now and I could say that

1895
01:15:13,158 --> 01:15:16,359
confidently super confident I wouldn't

1896
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:19,319
have kept doing it it would not be

1897
01:15:16,359 --> 01:15:22,439
consistent um I was done so that's why

1898
01:15:19,319 --> 01:15:25,039
we're here so yeah and I will say as

1899
01:15:22,439 --> 01:15:29,319
well like uh I'm also just a proxy for

1900
01:15:25,039 --> 01:15:30,719
people like Dan local ER uh little Hill

1901
01:15:29,319 --> 01:15:33,039
Kush of the Giants

1902
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:34,960
peaches you know probably many other

1903
01:15:33,039 --> 01:15:36,238
people i' I've forgotten to mention but

1904
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:39,279
you know

1905
01:15:36,238 --> 01:15:42,759
everyone everyone helped me too you know

1906
01:15:39,279 --> 01:15:46,399
so and helped us and so being able

1907
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:48,000
to um get our friends on and and help

1908
01:15:46,399 --> 01:15:49,519
them support us was just huge as well

1909
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,238
and I think once we made it more of a

1910
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:55,480
group effort um it just changed the vibe

1911
01:15:52,238 --> 01:15:58,079
as well um yeah in a nice way I think

1912
01:15:55,479 --> 01:15:59,638
yeah made it easier for me too and it

1913
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:02,719
gave me a lot more hope for for the

1914
01:15:59,639 --> 01:16:04,600
future Generations like I was jaded as

1915
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:06,158
hell like it's really easy to get very

1916
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:07,280
jaded and stuck in your ways and like

1917
01:16:06,158 --> 01:16:08,960
just being like I don't want to talk

1918
01:16:07,279 --> 01:16:11,039
about new stuff I don't want to meet new
