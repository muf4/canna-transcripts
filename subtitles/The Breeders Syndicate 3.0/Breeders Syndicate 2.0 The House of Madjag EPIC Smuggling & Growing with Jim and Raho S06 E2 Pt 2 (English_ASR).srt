a simple handshake deal

13
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:32,039
got the idea for this from another

14
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,420
YouTuber named Jesse on fire and I felt

15
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:35,700
like it was a fair it was fair for him

16
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:40,160
to ask so I figured I'd do the same

so dog breeder and grower from Mendocino

28
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,920
to speak on these subjects and sometimes

29
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,659
interview other participants our goal is

30
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,340
to document this history before it's

31
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,540
written by corporations and others who

32
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,359
just weren't there

33
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,560
let's start writing some wrongs welcome

34
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:15,560
to the underground

35
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,880
hey everyone welcome to breeder

36
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,478
Syndicate this is going to be part two

37
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:27,239

38
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:29,400

dog

40
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,618
peace everyone so yeah everybody uh we

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,359
we really had a good time recording the

42
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:39,299
show last time I think it was probably

43
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:41,640
the largest response we've ever gotten

44
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,040
for any show as far as the positive

45
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,560
positivity that we received

46
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:50,100
um it really really resonated with a lot

47
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:54,180
of people and uh yeah I'm really excited

48
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:56,399
to start with round two so to speak

49
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,500
um we we tried to go in a more linear

50
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,379
pattern and

51
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:04,200
um we covered some of the the canyon era

52
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:05,819
but I know we after after we recorded

53
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,859
last time we spoke a little bit and you

54
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:09,299
have some notes and a good direction so

55
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:10,739
I'm going to let you uh go ahead and

56
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,840
start Mad Jack where do you want to

57
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:14,640
start the tail

58
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:19,739
hahaha

59
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:22,500
um the 1978 map that I drew okay

60
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:24,239
it says OG stands for original Garden

61
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,639
there we go

62
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,140
here's the 1978 map if you want to

63
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,659
explain it a little bit and break it

64
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:32,519
down the key is at the bottom this is

65
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:36,180
before

66
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:38,099
skunk number one this is the very first

67
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:42,719
um we had

68
00:02:38,098 --> 00:02:46,620
a friend in Kauai who who um had well

69
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:50,818
haken Hawaiian crosses yeah and they're

70
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:54,420
the h10 H9 HK and then

71
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:55,859
we had somehow some a few Thai seeds I

72
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:58,139
don't know where they came from the

73
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,940
Colombian came from my friend and

74
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:02,238
they're the ones that on Thanksgiving

75
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:05,699
while it was snowing above us on the rim

76
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:08,878
weren't even close to being finished so

77
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:10,919
this was the layout of that Garden that

78
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:13,739
you showed photos of last time that

79
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:15,738
that's right in so well it's surrounded

80
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:19,080
by pine trees and

81
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:24,360
lots of heavy dark green brush

82
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:28,620
this Garden was probably I'm thinking

83
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:30,480
100 feet long and 50 feet wide you that

84
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,219
was the size

85
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:34,439
this is from the old notebooks that you

86
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:36,060
have it was a strong like at the time

87
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:38,400
you were drawing this as you were

88
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,780
looking on or oh how did it work that's

89
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,580
amazing

90
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,598
it's absolutely amazing

91
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:48,060
just all of them every year I did one

92
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:52,619
this was at the middle part of our

93
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:56,640
Canyon the subsequent years 80 79 80 and

94
00:03:52,620 --> 00:04:00,959
81 were about two or three miles further

95
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:04,798
up the canyon okay this one so this one

96
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:07,739
was closer to 1800 feet down it was a

97
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,739
longer hike more difficult and the

98
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:12,480
others were anywhere from 14 to 1600

99
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:14,878
feet down in

100
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,019
wow which makes a difference at the end

101
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:19,978
of the year of course when you're

102
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:22,139
carrying this your your Harvest out

103
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:24,959
that's why we did as much as possible

104
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:27,240
down inside the canyon later

105
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:29,099
by having friends come down in and camp

106
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,759
with us because

107
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,699
um

108
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,520
it wasn't feasible to carry out whole

109
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:36,960
plants or branches or anything else did

110
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:39,060
you find that any of these grew any

111
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:41,099
different in these little micro climates

112
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:45,180
in the canyon like any of these strains

113
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:47,040
from like 78 between 78 and 79 if you

114
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,840
moved or grew any of the same exact

115
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,060
strains in different little locations in

116
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:52,739
the canyon did you find any phenotypic

117
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:56,100
variations

118
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:58,800
I don't really think so it was it was

119
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:02,639
just more the size and ripeness because

120
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:06,418
this particular Garden was got the sun

121
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,519
east to west so it had the most on 10 11

122
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:11,698
hours at some days you know in the

123
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:13,379
summer yeah so they grew much larger

124
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:15,960
plants I mean there some of these plants

125
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:18,180
were 13 14 feet tall

126
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:21,180
um my friend my partner who's six foot

127
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:24,600
seven there's a photo of him reaching up

128
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:27,240
in in his um wizard outfit that's right

129
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,120
his his reach is at nine feet

130
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:33,120
and they're wow four or five feet Beyond

131
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:36,959
his reach so yeah they were the

132
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:41,819
Hawaiians h10 over here where it says

133
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:44,698
h10 yeah if you go down right let's see

134
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:49,379
right over in this region h10 each left

135
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:51,900
of this photo or this drawing and also

136
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:53,759
in the middle there h10 they they were

137
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:56,939
just massive plants

138
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,919
beautiful and it was good smoke too

139
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:01,259
um it was Will Hawken again cross with

140
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:03,000
whatever they were calling Hawaiian

141
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:06,300
which

142
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,120
yeah has a Thai background just because

143
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:12,478
Hawaii probably in the 40s and 50s

144
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,160
people from the Far East that visited

145
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:16,860
there that it'd be very easy to see

146
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,820
those sorts of varieties showing up in

147
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:22,860
another tropical area sure

148
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:25,918
and this is great this is crazy magic

149
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:28,680
because I used to um you know I drew a

150
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:30,899
plot like this for you know a map like

151
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:34,680
this for just about every outdoor plot I

152
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:37,859
ever did and it's crazy to see you know

153
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,319
that two people on you know other sides

154
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,538
of the country at the same time are

155
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,699
doing the same stuff but you know beyond

156
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:48,000
the fact that I did it yours is the

157
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:51,120
level of detail and Artistry is Way

158
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,120
Beyond anything I ever did man just this

159
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,240
is really cool to see it really is

160
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,579
yeah one thing I might I might want to

161
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,280
ask uh just because I I remember

162
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:04,620
something you mentioned last time which

163
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:07,978
was basically like you kind of averaged

164
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:09,240
about 6.8 or 7 ounces of plant or

165
00:07:07,978 --> 00:07:10,800
something

166
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,139
um and then I just heard you say that

167
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,600
like you had these nine to 13 foot tall

168
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:17,579
plants these Giants

169
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,379
um so maybe you could talk a little bit

170
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:20,879
about some of the different stuff that

171
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:23,038
you grew

172
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:25,259
um was a nine or third was a nine foot

173
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:27,598
or ten foot tall plant only giving you

174
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:30,180
that amount of flour because of how

175
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:31,860
loose it was did you have some that were

176
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,800
a lot denser and they were smaller

177
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:37,199
plants but yielded more because I have

178
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,060
old timers that would tell me that back

179
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,978
in the day you know they would get

180
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,240
ounces that were like the size of my

181
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:44,579
forearm

182
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,819
just because the the weed wasn't as

183
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:49,800
dense and so I'm curious as to like uh

184
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:51,780
was the 6.8 ounces the stuff that

185
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,759
happened in in subsequent years when you

186
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:56,159
were doing like the skunk one did you

187
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,960
get a massive variance of of weights and

188
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,939
sizes these first couple years when you

189
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:01,939
were experiencing them just curious

190
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:09,139
and the 6.8 ounces average across the

191
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:13,319
entire two gardens that we did later

192
00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:16,680
were all almost all skunk number one and

193
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:18,840
the tallest plants were six seven eight

194
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,780
feet and

195
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:24,299
the Hawaiian in this particular

196
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:26,939
um drawing that we're so tall they were

197
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,978
multi-pound plants we didn't have a

198
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:31,560
scale at the time down in there in the

199
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:34,620
series we brought a dialogram down o

200
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:37,979
house good old dialogram and it would go

201
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:40,560
up to two pounds I think I forget but

202
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:44,820
um this plant in particular

203
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:47,518
it it was obviously pounds of weed and

204
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:50,959
they were tight buds they aren't Rock

205
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,959
buds you know like some

206
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,419
um especially the ones I know of friends

207
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:58,139
who grow

208
00:08:54,419 --> 00:09:01,079
heavily uh Indica backgrounds yeah those

209
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:02,639
buds just get rock hard density is yeah

210
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,440
dried

211
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:09,240
um these

212
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:12,300
a pound of this or probably was twice

213
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,759
the size of the of the um

214
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:17,958
later skunk number one the skunk number

215
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:21,000
one were denser definitely yeah

216
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:22,739
I have a quick question that that I've

217
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,500
just been as going through the pictures

218
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,200
and stuff which wizard were you which

219
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,580
which color

220
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,820
we alternated out

221
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:36,440
um so did you this this was not this was

222
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:40,260
not me this was my friend Doug yeah

223
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:42,300
the the light blue one was my UK partner

224
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:44,458
that you have in a photo where he's

225
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:46,439
pointing off in well actually you used

226
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:49,679
it in this advertisement

227
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,779
um yes pointing out into the distance

228
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,579
um the garden is actually right below

229
00:09:51,778 --> 00:09:55,620
him but we had him pointing in a

230
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:59,040
direction that wouldn't be

231
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:03,720
um as easy to figure out if you got to

232
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:05,699
that Canyon yeah and I I was never I

233
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,339
never wore the light blue one because I

234
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:10,500
think it was a smaller

235
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:13,140
um robe so we had a

236
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:16,320
know what is the one I'm wearing there's

237
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:18,679
one of me in in my tall partner walking

238
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,480
across a rug there it is the white one

239
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:24,000
right I'm the one in front and you can

240
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,440
just see my beard back then showing a

241
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,299
little bit

242
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,040
my

243
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:31,859
my ex-wife

244
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:34,259
my kid's mom she's the one who sewed

245
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:37,320
these up for us she made all of these

246
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:40,919
and uh that red bag there was

247
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:43,680
particularly colorful so she was up with

248
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:45,599
the idea too and it was great I don't

249
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:48,059
know whatever happened to these costumes

250
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,060
yeah I was gonna ask that was my name I

251
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:52,319
didn't keep at least one around but I

252
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:54,299
think

253
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:58,200
um

254
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:59,939
45 years later you know it's it's what

255
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,160
really pulled me to your story when I

256
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:04,440
first like I first like I said heard

257
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:07,078
about or even

258
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,360
found out what mad Jag was going through

259
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:11,159
Sam's old posts and going through the

260
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,079
kilo art and I kept seeing this really

261
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:14,639
pretty kilo art that said Mad Jack on it

262
00:11:13,078 --> 00:11:16,799
and that's what started that journey and

263
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:18,539
then when I saw these pictures of of the

264
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:20,699
robes is when I was like these are my

265
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:23,899
people these are my people I gotta find

266
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:26,339
out who they are you know

267
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:28,200
yeah that log right there that we're

268
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:31,200
walking across

269
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:33,540
there was a storm I was camped on on the

270
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,540
side that this photo was taken from by

271
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:39,778
our third friend and water was almost

272
00:11:36,539 --> 00:11:41,819
touching the bottom of this this log and

273
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:43,620
I had to sit on it and Scoot across with

274
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:46,980
a bag of weed in front of me and Scoot

275
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:48,299
across it ran for like three days from

276
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:53,639
this massive

277
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:55,139
fall storm like in October and uh

278
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:56,458
it's a good thing that thing was there

279
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:59,578
else I would have been stuck on the

280
00:11:56,458 --> 00:12:00,719
other side and as it was I was in a

281
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:04,319
silly

282
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,820
old army tent and and Waters had didn't

283
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,620
have a built-in bottom and the water was

284
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:09,720
flowing through as I get out in the

285
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,820
pouring rain and cut a trench around it

286
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,680
like you do in Boy Scouts to funnel the

287
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:16,339
water away and

288
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:16,338
um it's funny

289
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:22,620
Wilderness experience okay

290
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:25,019
you know MJ uh you remember last week we

291
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,860
were talking about how the

292
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:28,740
um

293
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:31,820
how growing these plants kind of turns

294
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:34,860
you into an instant young entrepreneur

295
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:38,100
and the inspiration you know I've I've

296
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:40,680
often wondered you know what kind of

297
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,659
what what were your intentions you know

298
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:45,359
when you guys came up with this whole

299
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:48,179
mad Jag branding idea and started

300
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,620
sending stuff into High Times you know

301
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:51,659
what was what was going through your

302
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:54,539
head when you were

303
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:57,778
um when you were starting that thing it

304
00:12:54,539 --> 00:13:00,360
looks it looks like you know early viral

305
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:01,919
marketing stuff is what it looks like

306
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,500
that's fun

307
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:07,500
yeah viral didn't even exist that term

308
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,458
right that's right

309
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,860
um

310
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:13,619
we were inspired by High Times magazine

311
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:16,919
by the Grower's guide

312
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:19,799
um and then later Robert Clark's book

313
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:22,379
um it just seemed like

314
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:25,078
let's make our own Legend you know and

315
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:27,000
maybe someday we'll be doing a photo a

316
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:30,559
movie about it or

317
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,539
it was It was kind of with that in mind

318
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:36,419
uh it wasn't that it would make us

319
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:38,879
richer and we would get paid more for

320
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:42,179
the herb it was just

321
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:44,700
it would set us apart so that's why we

322
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:46,979
went and had labels made the crack and

323
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,060
peel labels I'll be glad to send you

324
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,860
guys some

325
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:54,179
um because I've kept a lot of them over

326
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:56,579
the years oh wow they still work we

327
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:58,559
would I would go through like an airport

328
00:13:56,578 --> 00:14:00,299
I remember I was going up the escalator

329
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:02,338
and I had one cracked and open I just

330
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:06,838
slapped it on the side of the paper

331
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:10,440
magazine dispenser in Los Angeles and

332
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:13,560
um one of my friends the guy in in Tempe

333
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,060
his brother who was a bigger dealer even

334
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:17,099
than he

335
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:19,379
um said did you put one of your stickers

336
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:24,259
in the airport in LA and I said yeah I

337
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:24,259
did yes it's not because

338
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:29,099
that that reminds me so much of like

339
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:31,079
early skateboarding culture you know in

340
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,360
the 70s

341
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:34,979
um and that that was you know some of

342
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,919
the earliest

343
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:40,680
kind of uh viral marketing like you said

344
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:42,419
viral marketing absolutely the things

345
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:44,458
that they that they pioneered back then

346
00:14:42,419 --> 00:14:48,000
in skateboarding with skateboarder

347
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:50,698
magazine um you know is is absolutely

348
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,620
the foundation of of viral internet

349
00:14:50,698 --> 00:14:56,039
marketing today and

350
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:57,899
you know social media influencers

351
00:14:56,039 --> 00:15:00,299
um all that stuff has roots going

352
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:03,480
directly back to that and I see a lot of

353
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:07,799
that in in your mag stuff too Jim yeah

354
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:10,199
yeah I see I see a lot of that like in

355
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:12,778
the haze poster the cosmic Boogie poster

356
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:14,879
you know that was like why I chased that

357
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:17,759
so hard was because as a person who

358
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:20,278
sells seeds and has made that my passion

359
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:23,819
breeding and all that to me that was the

360
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:26,578
first time that I could find a a

361
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:30,000
physical tangible representation or

362
00:15:26,578 --> 00:15:32,458
something I could possess that was a

363
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,799
perfect example of the first strain

364
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:36,719
marketing that I could find you know and

365
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,458
and the Mad Jack label I put it in that

366
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,940
same kind of category it's one of those

367
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:43,799
early just things it's striking imagery

368
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:45,779
that you never forget and it was done so

369
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:48,120
well but I had I never forgot it and

370
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:51,120
always chased it it's almost it's almost

371
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,379
like a pre-reagan era of Freedom where

372
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,440
everyone thought things were about to

373
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:57,179
lose loosen up yep and then they were

374
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,440
kind of loose for a bit and then they

375
00:15:57,179 --> 00:16:01,078
went in a totally different direction

376
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:03,600
for 15 more years

377
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:05,458
all these old posters that you can I

378
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,139
found him a few times and I never bought

379
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:10,319
one but there's an old poster where it's

380
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:12,000
like they made them declaring like that

381
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,220
ah we finally did it you know like

382
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,899
prohibition's over and posters but they

383
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,560
were just a little bit too early you

384
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:18,659
know

385
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:22,458
yeah they're really cool yeah like 40

386
00:16:18,659 --> 00:16:25,139
years yeah just a little bit

387
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:27,479
one thing I'm curious about and like the

388
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:29,698
actual growing part of it is since

389
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,320
it sounds like you were basically this

390
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:33,659
first season you were just collecting

391
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,699
seeds from friends and people you could

392
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:38,039
get access to

393
00:16:35,698 --> 00:16:40,019
um what were the things that you liked

394
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:41,698
and disliked about the first crop like

395
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:43,019
did you look at those things when you

396
00:16:41,698 --> 00:16:45,719
were trying to get away with it and you

397
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:47,698
were like oh my God this 13-foot plant

398
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,079
is blowing past all the bushes and

399
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:51,059
everything else that we were trying to

400
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:53,578
contain it and like make it look like it

401
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:57,359
was normal I don't want to do that giant

402
00:16:53,578 --> 00:16:59,039
again because it it makes me nervous or

403
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,659
like what was the what were the thoughts

404
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:02,399
there because obviously like this is the

405
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:05,039
first time that you were seeing a lot of

406
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,259
these things grown correct

407
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,119
yeah

408
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:11,640
definitely

409
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,318
so was there what to expect really like

410
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,880
you just oh this is oaxacan and this is

411
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:16,619
Hawaiian and this is this and this is

412
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,780
that and it was kind of like plant

413
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:20,519
spacing and how big they were gonna get

414
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:22,619
and what they were gonna do was all kind

415
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:25,078
of a mystery I would imagine

416
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:27,539
oh yeah we were

417
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:30,240
I had had the one year before this with

418
00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:34,139
my dealer friend from Tempe

419
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,700
in a neighboring Canyon and that's the

420
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,799
first time I

421
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,940
got a chance to see plants actually

422
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:42,119
reach

423
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:45,120
Harvest Time and they were all Mexican

424
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:48,000
strains like you said but

425
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:49,019
in the next over the next year which the

426
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,960
next year

427
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:55,619
we tried a garden in that Canyon that

428
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:58,140
was massive it was so huge we had to get

429
00:17:55,619 --> 00:18:00,678
a we had to pump up 200 feet to the

430
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:03,900
alluvial Plateau we had found Jesus and

431
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:07,820
it wasn't really smart it's a good thing

432
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:10,679
it failed but we we got a we got a

433
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:14,159
submersible pump that weighed like 40

434
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:16,798
pounds and hosed going up and the first

435
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,538
time we watered we laid a hose on the

436
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:21,599
ground and it just went it disappeared

437
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:24,298
into the soil is it this time we moved

438
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:26,759
it another 50 feet it's just

439
00:18:24,298 --> 00:18:30,058
made a hole and went down in we couldn't

440
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:32,819
flood irrigate it it just it was so

441
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:34,319
loose with Boulders and stuff below even

442
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:36,960
though it was this beautiful smooth

443
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:40,079
Garden on top that

444
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,579
it it just didn't work it was like

445
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:44,220
dredging

446
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:46,079
yeah and then the following year we had

447
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:50,220
collected all these other seeds Thai

448
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:52,678
Colombian and we and I knew from that

449
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:55,259
very first year how to do it

450
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:57,780
and

451
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:59,339
we just went on a larger scale

452
00:18:57,779 --> 00:19:00,899
these

453
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:03,538
um

454
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:06,780
the Colombians though that we had no

455
00:19:03,538 --> 00:19:09,240
idea like we discovered that how long it

456
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:11,759
took to finish we just knew it was super

457
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,500
great we that we had smoked and we kept

458
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:15,720
the seeds and

459
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,400
um so

460
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,759
these

461
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:23,100
on this Garden I'd say

462
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:25,558
30 percent of it failed

463
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:28,019
because oh no it was just it wasn't

464
00:19:25,558 --> 00:19:29,339
ready is this the garden that's up here

465
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:30,839
correct

466
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:34,259
um so the year you're speaking about

467
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:35,519
this is no this one is 1980

468
00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:37,919
it's

469
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:39,960
we were looking at the 78 earlier that

470
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:41,400
had the key at the bottom which is what

471
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,259
are you speaking about currently that's

472
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,679
one that I want to hit

473
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:49,319
um the original one 1978 oh gee so

474
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:51,240
that's the one that 30 failed yeah and

475
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:54,359
by failed you mean just didn't finish

476
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:57,720
right they were huge plants see that one

477
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:59,219
photo that he has from last episode

478
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,720
um they were beautiful plants in

479
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,360
slightly different colors because they

480
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:10,019
were different Colombian seeds but the

481
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:13,259
C10 here uh C9 wherever the C shows up

482
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:15,359
they were big big plants does that make

483
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:17,759
it easier to see right there if I zoom

484
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:19,379
out and it might be too much but So

485
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:22,319
eventually did you just end up having to

486
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:24,000
chop them down uh did you just and and

487
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:26,099
you just realized they weren't done they

488
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,259
weren't they weren't real weed yet and

489
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:30,659
and kind of composted them down there or

490
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:32,879
no we took them out they're the ones

491
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:34,679
that I had to scoot across that Boulder

492
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,320
with in a bag

493
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:39,360
um once we cut them down to Branch size

494
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,619
and they were the size of my little

495
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:43,379
fingertip

496
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:46,379
Buds and they were kind of tight and

497
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:49,200
nice and we sold them actually they they

498
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:52,380
were just a very mild smoke they they

499
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,660
had resin but not not like they would

500
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:56,820
have been super killer weed if they'd

501
00:20:54,660 --> 00:21:00,000
gotten a month and a half more or two

502
00:20:56,819 --> 00:21:02,038
yeah like the end of December or early

503
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,460
January like they would in the tropics

504
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:07,319
but it was so let me let me maybe ask

505
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,779
you this because I didn't I don't think

506
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:11,298
we talked about this last time in the

507
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:14,759
area that you were in

508
00:21:11,298 --> 00:21:17,940
what month or around what date was it

509
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:19,919
safe to plant and then what was kind of

510
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,840
like the latter part of your Harvest

511
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,900
window where after that it was cold and

512
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:25,379
rainy and you were in fear of losing

513
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,400
[Music]

514
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:29,159
um

515
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,100
luckily those giant Hawaiian plants they

516
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:34,919
because they were oaxacan crosses too

517
00:21:31,099 --> 00:21:37,558
they were ready in October and like no

518
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:41,460
later than mid-october I'd say probably

519
00:21:37,558 --> 00:21:43,678
and the rains and coal didn't really hit

520
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:46,200
us October traditionally in Arizona is

521
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,298
the second driest month of the year June

522
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:52,080
is the driest October and this is in the

523
00:21:48,298 --> 00:21:54,720
70s it has changed since then but we had

524
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:56,279
a beautiful fall so down in the canyon

525
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,500
to have cool nights but the days would

526
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:59,940
be warm and nice

527
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:03,179
um so

528
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:05,159
it it just we harvested everything out

529
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:08,159
of this can out of this Garden except

530
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:11,159
those Colombian and we were going back

531
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:13,620
and watering them and back and watering

532
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:15,120
them and finally on Thanksgiving when it

533
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:18,899
was snowing up above and we had to go

534
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:22,979
out on the mesas in inches of snow and

535
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:25,380
big clouds of mud on our feet uh it was

536
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:28,079
just we decided we have to take them now

537
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:32,580
because we didn't want to come back any

538
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:34,500
colder and wetter yeah and so you know

539
00:22:32,579 --> 00:22:37,019
it

540
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:39,720
it just what it just never reached

541
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:42,119
maturity but the earlier ones all these

542
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,140
other clients were the came out

543
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:45,538
wonderful

544
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:49,559
and we were able to hang them there in

545
00:22:45,538 --> 00:22:52,500
the shade dry them and I don't remember

546
00:22:49,558 --> 00:22:55,259
actually we didn't have breakdown boxes

547
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:58,919
like we did in following years

548
00:22:55,259 --> 00:23:03,419
we just um I think put them in our in

549
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:05,820
big bags you know garbage bags and

550
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:08,580
carried them up through the top of the

551
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:10,439
rim with our um pack frames we had metal

552
00:23:08,579 --> 00:23:12,000
pack frames celties and we would just

553
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,860
strap everything to them

554
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,500
so they didn't get handled as well

555
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:18,599
that's another thing the when we had

556
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:21,000
breakdown boxes after they were met

557
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:23,579
after the skunk number one was manicured

558
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,919
it was put right into these wonderful

559
00:23:23,579 --> 00:23:27,720
cardboard boxes that we bought stacks of

560
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,240
and brought them down and then we

561
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,980
assembled them down in the canyon taped

562
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,519
them and

563
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:38,339
you could carry six or seven stacked on

564
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:40,918
a pack frame any more than that they

565
00:23:38,339 --> 00:23:44,639
would be catching on branches and and it

566
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:46,799
wasn't feasible so yeah that came out

567
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,419
very nice they they didn't get crushed

568
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:51,900
they didn't get smashed

569
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:55,860
pounded the time roughly in each box

570
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:57,419
was that does that that 1979 Harvest was

571
00:23:55,859 --> 00:23:59,459
that the one that ended up in the High

572
00:23:57,419 --> 00:24:01,200
Times is that what it was referred to in

573
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:04,319
that High Times that is up here on the

574
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,940
page and you'll see here it says

575
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:07,319
um

576
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:11,519
uh

577
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:13,859
Colombian stock killer purple 2015.

578
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:15,720
um we it was

579
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:20,119
it was funny because one guy actually

580
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:22,740
paid us two thousand a pound for it yeah

581
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:25,739
and they loved it you know and then we

582
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:29,220
had some lightly seeded Hawaiian

583
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:30,900
one branch out of all this Garden we

584
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:34,259
came back after

585
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:36,298
as we traditionally did every week we

586
00:24:34,259 --> 00:24:38,400
were looking through inspecting and then

587
00:24:36,298 --> 00:24:39,480
we found one branch that was seated it

588
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,419
had

589
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:45,240
you know hurt me back yeah yeah the

590
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:48,059
garbage bag and put it over quickly

591
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,460
cut that Branch off but it had enough

592
00:24:48,058 --> 00:24:53,700
time to lightly seed a few of the plants

593
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:55,679
neighboring to it but people love

594
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,400
finding those few seeds and they were

595
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,759
like

596
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,860
do you have any more of this

597
00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:04,740
they like the smoke and

598
00:25:01,859 --> 00:25:07,139
um it was the oaxacan Hawaiian kind of

599
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:08,759
rock wow

600
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:11,340
and so how many of these in this list

601
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:14,158
are from you guys

602
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:17,240
on this yes on this particular list just

603
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:20,100
the one that says magic Hawaiian Magic

604
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:22,079
sensimilla God damn

605
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:24,298
um all these others were current things

606
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:26,599
on the market yeah I mean like downtown

607
00:25:24,298 --> 00:25:29,819
Maryland

608
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:31,678
good wow that's something we didn't

609
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:33,178
actually chat about last time but it's

610
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,278
pretty interesting when you guys were

611
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:38,038
doing your gorilla

612
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:40,079
um you know obviously like you can get a

613
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:42,839
wildly Divergent amount of males and

614
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:44,879
females off a batch of seeds

615
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:46,740
um did you plant everything in your

616
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,320
alluvial planes and all that and then

617
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:53,339
just cut males as they appeared did you

618
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:55,079
plant them in pot you did yep and um did

619
00:25:53,339 --> 00:25:58,439
you go out there more than once a week

620
00:25:55,079 --> 00:26:00,418
when things were turning from Veg to

621
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,759
flour so that you didn't show up and all

622
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:04,980
of a sudden a stray male had like nuked

623
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:06,538
a whole patch with seed or how did you

624
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:09,058
handle the transition when you were

625
00:26:06,538 --> 00:26:10,679
worried about maybe we haven't caught

626
00:26:09,058 --> 00:26:13,440
all the males yet

627
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:16,980
right well

628
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,840
the next Garden that was 19 marked as

629
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:20,940
1979.

630
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:22,798
as the double e

631
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:25,860
the reason we called it the double e is

632
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:29,220
it was on a topo map right under the

633
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:31,199
word Creek where the double E's were and

634
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:34,558
so we went oh that's an easy way to spot

635
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:37,200
it so we called it the double e we spent

636
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:40,440
three nights I mean three days and two

637
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,600
nights every week on the next three

638
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:45,240
years we didn't just go out overnight

639
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:48,359
and water and then leave the next day so

640
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:50,519
we were there three days out of seven

641
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:53,579
and we

642
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:56,579
anything that was even remotely spooky

643
00:26:53,579 --> 00:27:00,538
looking like wow this might be a male

644
00:26:56,579 --> 00:27:02,220
change in here we then I don't know we

645
00:27:00,538 --> 00:27:05,278
might have just prematurely cut them out

646
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:08,460
but everything was grown from seed and

647
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:12,000
the the year we ran two gardens our big

648
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:14,220
big year the one Garden good thing I

649
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,319
bought three thousand seeds because the

650
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:18,778
plants were about a foot tall and we

651
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:21,178
came back a week

652
00:27:18,778 --> 00:27:24,119
um three days later four days later and

653
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:26,519
grasshoppers had eaten them down every

654
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:30,538
single one unbelievable we had to

655
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:33,538
replant on the first of June oh no we

656
00:27:30,538 --> 00:27:36,798
put them in a tiny seed Garden area

657
00:27:33,538 --> 00:27:40,259
where we could put a screening over it

658
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:42,658
and they were super crowded and we were

659
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:44,940
just digging them out with wet with

660
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:46,980
inner Palm in our hands and plugging

661
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:48,840
them in plugging them in plugging them

662
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:51,179
in and replacing everything that had

663
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:52,678
been eaten by and what was weird there

664
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:55,679
was a few plants that made it through

665
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:58,559
from the uh grasshopper play

666
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,840
yeah wow the ones that we planted and

667
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:03,599
they were like a month a month earlier

668
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:06,418
than the ones we had to replant in June

669
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:08,879
maybe more than a month and the June

670
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:10,620
ones caught up with them it was amazing

671
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,020
because of the 100 degree weather and

672
00:28:10,619 --> 00:28:14,399
the Sun and the watering

673
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:16,379
um by the time

674
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,538
end of the summer like let's say August

675
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:21,360
was around they were all equal

676
00:28:18,538 --> 00:28:22,200
yeah that was good but having that

677
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:24,058
little

678
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:28,080
um

679
00:28:24,058 --> 00:28:30,119
six foot by 10 foot garden full of seeds

680
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:31,319
luckily we we were able to replant

681
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:32,879
otherwise it would have been

682
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:36,000
catastrophic

683
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,940
oh I bet I mean maybe maybe another

684
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,880
angle is where did you first learn about

685
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:43,860
what an early female or an early male

686
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,778
even looked like back then was it Rob

687
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:47,699
Clark's book

688
00:28:45,778 --> 00:28:49,679
um was it High Times was it people

689
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:51,419
telling you

690
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,400
um you know because obviously like now

691
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:56,100
you know like you look at it and like

692
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:58,679
two pistols mean a female and a little

693
00:28:56,099 --> 00:29:00,899
claw looking thing means a male

694
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:02,580
um but back then did you have that kind

695
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,380
of knowledge beforehand did they get

696
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:07,019
kind of advanced before you realized

697
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,919
what they were

698
00:29:07,019 --> 00:29:09,679
um

699
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,659
well

700
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:15,900
I I'm not exactly sure I know from the

701
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:18,840
first year in 1976 that we grew I got to

702
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:21,240
see what males look like in females but

703
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:24,319
not till they were probably more

704
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,319
advanced and visible

705
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:32,700
I think Rob Clark I mean his early book

706
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:34,980
uh the one that he did in 77 on pod

707
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,798
press that was actually his dissertation

708
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:40,380
yeah yeah

709
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:43,740
that he he hand Drew all the drawings in

710
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:46,260
there oh wow yeah yeah it's hover every

711
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:49,079
single plant he hand Drew this so he's

712
00:29:46,259 --> 00:29:52,319
not only yeah he's a he's a good artist

713
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:53,759
plus his photography later man he says

714
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:56,339
when he traveled around and did that

715
00:29:53,759 --> 00:30:00,359
book on hashish the photos are just

716
00:29:56,339 --> 00:30:03,839
excellent you know Mountain watering and

717
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:06,839
the Grower's guide by Mel Frank

718
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:08,898
that I think

719
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:12,599
showed I don't know if they were photos

720
00:30:08,898 --> 00:30:14,519
but it it was a learning curve but by

721
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:17,398
this year this I had

722
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:20,759
already grown for two years before this

723
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:23,339
so not the original Garden but by 1980

724
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:25,859
so when we went for two gardens at once

725
00:30:23,339 --> 00:30:27,720
we had enough experience to know what to

726
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:29,879
look for plus we were spending three

727
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,200
days a week in the garden

728
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,899
and

729
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,960
I think maybe even at the time when the

730
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:39,599
males had to be separated we might have

731
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,860
um just had one of our we had a third

732
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:42,839
partner who

733
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:45,119
helped us part-time and he was from

734
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:47,398
Switzerland he's still a good friend of

735
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:49,678
mine I I saw him when I went to span of

736
00:30:47,398 --> 00:30:53,579
this in 2019 and stayed at his house

737
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:56,820
well that's nice and he's

738
00:30:53,579 --> 00:30:58,319
five years older than I am he's he still

739
00:30:56,819 --> 00:31:01,319
smokes hash

740
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:04,079
mixed with tobacco he's been doing it

741
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:05,700
for 50 years as is the custom over there

742
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:08,339
yeah

743
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:11,038
and he's an artist of course Swiss

744
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:12,898
artist and he may have just been down

745
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:15,058
there and as

746
00:31:12,898 --> 00:31:17,879
because I know what you're saying we

747
00:31:15,058 --> 00:31:21,778
ended up it was almost 50 50 with the

748
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:25,140
skunk 50 50 males 50 50 females it was

749
00:31:21,778 --> 00:31:28,440
wow we didn't end up with big huge empty

750
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:30,840
sections of the garden and we also

751
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:33,058
transplanted into any open sections if

752
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:35,579
we had to we would dig up a plant that

753
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:39,298
was four feet tall with a big room oh

754
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:41,519
wow and slide it over five more feet to

755
00:31:39,298 --> 00:31:43,619
get it in the hole that had more sun and

756
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:45,778
and was empty because a male had been

757
00:31:43,619 --> 00:31:48,658
removed yeah we did a lot of

758
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:50,159
transplanting and movements it was

759
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:52,320
experimental to see if it would work in

760
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:56,100
it yeah they did sure they're very Hardy

761
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:58,859
plants yeah there was resilience the

762
00:31:56,099 --> 00:32:02,038
term wheat is is accurate I mean wow

763
00:31:58,859 --> 00:32:03,959
yeah you know you know Jackie we last

764
00:32:02,038 --> 00:32:06,658
week we talked about the Terps and

765
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:08,220
flavors of Colombian and and you know

766
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:10,080
you were just talking about that first

767
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:12,120
year where the Colombians didn't finish

768
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:13,980
but you got a few purple ones out of

769
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:15,599
there that were you know that were made

770
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:17,399
good smoke

771
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:19,798
um but you know I wasn't really

772
00:32:17,398 --> 00:32:22,439
satisfied with my answer last week when

773
00:32:19,798 --> 00:32:25,019
when I was asked what what did I you

774
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:27,419
know describe those those flavors and

775
00:32:25,019 --> 00:32:29,639
smells coming off of Colombian

776
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:32,820
and you know I realized as I thought

777
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:34,380
back on it that you know that most of my

778
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:37,619
experience and what I know about

779
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:40,440
Colombian is more about what came

780
00:32:37,619 --> 00:32:43,500
imported you know and and was bought

781
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:45,538
than what I grew because it just it was

782
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:47,339
just so difficult to pull those things

783
00:32:45,538 --> 00:32:49,980
off

784
00:32:47,339 --> 00:32:52,798
um and so you know for me it's it's such

785
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:54,000
a treat that we have you know we have

786
00:32:52,798 --> 00:32:57,240
it's

787
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,919
the the essence of it captured in in the

788
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:03,720
ohaze

789
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:06,299
um as Sam shared it you know that that

790
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:08,100
because otherwise it's so hard to grow

791
00:33:06,298 --> 00:33:10,619
you know Growers all over the country

792
00:33:08,099 --> 00:33:12,298
were like they tried and it didn't turn

793
00:33:10,619 --> 00:33:14,038
out well and then they found something

794
00:33:12,298 --> 00:33:15,240
better and this stuff just kind of

795
00:33:14,038 --> 00:33:17,158
disappeared

796
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,960
so

797
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:22,200
um but yeah you know can can you talk

798
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,019
about that that Colombian the the smells

799
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:26,460
I mean did the

800
00:33:24,019 --> 00:33:29,519
anthocyanin or whatever the the purple

801
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:31,620
yeah um did that really take over and

802
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:35,038
dominate the one that you managed to to

803
00:33:31,619 --> 00:33:37,139
harvest and or you know no they were

804
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:40,919
they

805
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:42,538
yeah because it was like you know it was

806
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:45,059
Thanksgiving

807
00:33:42,538 --> 00:33:47,460
um and as you know when the light starts

808
00:33:45,058 --> 00:33:50,819
dropping down the purple

809
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:53,880
tends to happen more and

810
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:56,939
it it didn't really

811
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,620
have a characteristic the Hawaiians that

812
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:01,019
were wilhakan crosses they had a

813
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:02,099
wonderful scent growing but the

814
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:04,019
Colombian

815
00:34:02,099 --> 00:34:07,199
because they didn't even have the tiny

816
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:09,239
buds till like late October

817
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:13,019
um beginning of November they they

818
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:16,138
didn't it wasn't warm like the hot

819
00:34:13,019 --> 00:34:18,418
summer end of the summer they didn't

820
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:21,300
have really much scent at all until they

821
00:34:18,418 --> 00:34:23,460
were dried and then you crushed them yep

822
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:25,019
but the uh

823
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,878
I know what you're talking about the

824
00:34:25,019 --> 00:34:29,519
Piney that's how you would you know

825
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:31,739
focus on the Piney last week and that's

826
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:33,960
you know I had a lot of that too then

827
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:36,178
and you know like I said all my school

828
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:38,460
all my friends at school everybody was

829
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:40,679
growing these Colombian plants and

830
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:43,320
Christmas Trees Everybody had these

831
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:45,659
little Christmas trees out there but

832
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,760
um some people they got more mature and

833
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:49,139
you know you got you got a really nice

834
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,679
buds

835
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:54,240
um but the pine was was dominant for

836
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:56,220
sure

837
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:58,618
um but you know that the diversity of

838
00:34:56,219 --> 00:35:00,959
what we got in the imported smoke was

839
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:03,960
just above and beyond

840
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:07,800
you know because the golds and the Reds

841
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:10,338
and you know uh yeah yeah just some

842
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:12,839
amazing stuff you know and

843
00:35:10,338 --> 00:35:15,299
distinctive you know each one just such

844
00:35:12,838 --> 00:35:17,099
a unique distinctive thing just like

845
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:20,240
Mexico all of them you know whether it's

846
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:22,380
Sinaloa or Guerrero or Oaxaca yeah

847
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:25,979
entirely the way they looked they

848
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:28,140
smelled and the highs too yeah whereas

849
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:30,838
Mexico is a long country Colombia is

850
00:35:28,139 --> 00:35:33,659
pretty big but there's in Columbia it

851
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:36,719
was like tropical versus

852
00:35:33,659 --> 00:35:38,699
yeah 5 000 foot level versus Santa Marta

853
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:42,299
way up at eight thousand nine thousand

854
00:35:38,699 --> 00:35:44,759
feet so it they were um land races that

855
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:47,460
didn't really get mixed up too much back

856
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,320
in the old days at least until the 60s

857
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:51,659
maybe yeah

858
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:54,539
and the the impact of the processing and

859
00:35:51,659 --> 00:35:56,699
transport to you know whatever it was in

860
00:35:54,539 --> 00:35:59,099
Colombia before it went on the boat or

861
00:35:56,699 --> 00:36:01,078
in the in the case or the high grade

862
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:03,420
stuff like the golds and the Reds you

863
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:05,400
know maybe on an airplane

864
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:08,460
um you know that that had such an impact

865
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:10,800
on it too but so I think a lot about the

866
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:12,659
commercial stuff that that you know we

867
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:16,500
used to buy on the street or sell even

868
00:36:12,659 --> 00:36:19,019
and you know what I think is interesting

869
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:21,420
is that the essence of that you know

870
00:36:19,019 --> 00:36:25,079
that it was a shadow of what it was when

871
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:27,180
they when they finished it yeah yeah but

872
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:29,160
the essence of it good point

873
00:36:27,179 --> 00:36:31,500
um one one thing that we could throw in

874
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:33,118
there is that a number of people that

875
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:36,179
have talked to Matt and I about growing

876
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:39,358
in that era when they first grew green

877
00:36:36,179 --> 00:36:40,618
marijuana they got scared because they

878
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:42,598
didn't think people would want it

879
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:46,019
because all the stuff they got was brown

880
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:47,579
or yellow or gold that's why that's why

881
00:36:46,019 --> 00:36:50,159
I asked last week

882
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:52,200
um if they if they sun dried because

883
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:53,819
that tends to be the way that the the

884
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:56,819
Mexicans and stuff are getting their

885
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:58,800
Golds like girdling or sun drying

886
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:00,838
but we've heard that consistently that a

887
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,460
lot of times the first home grows or the

888
00:37:00,838 --> 00:37:03,960
first Outdoors that people did in

889
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:06,659
different regions they're like oh my God

890
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:08,220
it's such a weird color it's green are

891
00:37:06,659 --> 00:37:11,098
people gonna like it they've never seen

892
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:13,439
it before and like obviously like now it

893
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:16,079
shifted but I I'm curious is when you

894
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,880
did your when you did your uh your shade

895
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,980
drying and stuff like that what kind of

896
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:22,320
colors were you getting was it staying

897
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:25,019
green was it turning Golds and yellows

898
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:27,599
and Browns no gold yellows or Browns

899
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:30,900
just greens or dark greens the the skunk

900
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:34,200
number one was super dark green uh I

901
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:38,639
understand yeah interesting they

902
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:42,239
but even in 76 when we my

903
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:44,759
dealer friend and I grew that first year

904
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:47,039
the the proof was in the pudding we

905
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:50,760
would give people a smoke just one puff

906
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:52,980
or two and they were overwhelmed if they

907
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:55,320
were used to commercial stuff and

908
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,639
seedless they had not seen seedless

909
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:58,680
really unless they had gotten Thai

910
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:00,960
sticks Thai sticks were pretty much

911
00:37:58,679 --> 00:38:03,480
always seedless and the Thai sticks back

912
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,699
then were not green they were brown or

913
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,619
you know

914
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:10,739
right I always colored

915
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:12,838
Olive yeah maybe but the light green

916
00:38:10,739 --> 00:38:15,899
you're right I didn't even give that a

917
00:38:12,838 --> 00:38:17,039
thought because once our few people that

918
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,200
bought from us

919
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:20,880
smoked it that's that's all they cared

920
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:22,559
man they bought everything two people

921
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,960
bought everything we grew basically

922
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:26,759
that's so cool because we heard we heard

923
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,679
people telling us stories about how when

924
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:31,200
they first grew green weed they tried to

925
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:32,879
Brown it up because they were like oh

926
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:34,919
man No One's Gonna want this it's not

927
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,059
the right color it doesn't look right it

928
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,740
doesn't look like anything we've ever

929
00:38:36,059 --> 00:38:40,619
had we need to do something it's it's

930
00:38:37,739 --> 00:38:42,118
this is wrong well and not only that but

931
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:44,099
some of the earliest you know when

932
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:47,220
people have a bad experience with green

933
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:49,320
weeds so you know the guy who grows a

934
00:38:47,219 --> 00:38:52,078
you know a patch full of Colombian and

935
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:54,480
it doesn't finish and he harvests this

936
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:57,780
leafy stuff with just a few white hairs

937
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,820
and mostly tops and and you know he

938
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:02,579
handles it poorly it's loaded with

939
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:04,500
chlorophyll and he he tries he sells it

940
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:06,539
to people and and you know all of a

941
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:10,260
sudden there's this bad reputation green

942
00:39:06,539 --> 00:39:13,139
weed is bad right and then the next year

943
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:16,079
people grow different seeds this [ __ ]

944
00:39:13,139 --> 00:39:17,460
gets mature they handle it better you

945
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,560
know and all of a sudden they're there's

946
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:21,960
there's high quality green weed but

947
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:24,420
people's perception of the color is that

948
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:26,099
it's a turn off so you got to try and

949
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:27,599
overcome that

950
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:29,700
um getting them to you know try it

951
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:32,519
listen this is different or whatever or

952
00:39:29,699 --> 00:39:34,319
or the thing about renaming or changing

953
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:37,159
the appearance I mean a lot of people

954
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:40,260
would you know we we knew that the stuff

955
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:42,960
molded you know that the Colombian that

956
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:45,060
turned it brown it was some sort of mold

957
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,760
from being pressed when it was still wet

958
00:39:45,059 --> 00:39:50,279
or carried in the in the cargo bay of

959
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,320
the ship or whatever and and so it since

960
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:55,140
we've been smoking that stuff for years

961
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:58,200
and and you know people thought that was

962
00:39:55,139 --> 00:40:00,000
okay and uh they might try and you know

963
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:03,059
they might try and press some of their

964
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,579
wet homegrown and uh get a different

965
00:40:03,059 --> 00:40:08,759
appearance but it it never turned out

966
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:10,740
like the Colombians you know and uh it

967
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,780
only wound up making it worse but that

968
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:14,759
chlorophyll was pretty horrible to smoke

969
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:16,619
if you had those unfinished tops that

970
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,119
somebody was trying to pass off as smoke

971
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:20,640
and

972
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:23,039
um you know and plus High Times was you

973
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:25,379
know was was becoming really popular and

974
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:28,380
people were here about Green from Hawaii

975
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:30,480
and California at least by the time I

976
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:32,400
was in it so that the thing for us was

977
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,338
you know I mean I would I had produced

978
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:37,980
some amazing freaking Indica buds but I

979
00:40:35,338 --> 00:40:39,900
would say it was Hawaiian you know or

980
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:42,420
from California

981
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:44,940
um just because you know your homegrown

982
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:47,220
isn't you know because I was charging

983
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:50,460
200 an ounce for this stuff

984
00:40:47,219 --> 00:40:52,319
and um and people were happy to pay it

985
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:54,000
even though you know as kids they didn't

986
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,180
have a lot of money they would find a

987
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,179
way

988
00:40:56,219 --> 00:41:01,078
I had a guy I had a guy trade me a PA

989
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:05,820
system with you know with a beautiful

990
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:08,760
mic and a and a fender backstage 20 for

991
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:11,940
um for a half ounce of tie purple tie

992
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:13,740
and he loved it he loved it so much he

993
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:15,838
came back for more and unfortunately I

994
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:17,759
was out of that and all I had was the

995
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:20,699
green Fino which didn't finish at all

996
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,619
and I I was like okay well you know I

997
00:41:20,699 --> 00:41:24,779
knew it wasn't the same stuff but I

998
00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:28,079
wanted the money so I I

999
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:31,140
sold in that second bag and and he was

1000
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:33,300
so pissed off because I wound up giving

1001
00:41:31,139 --> 00:41:35,219
his money back because it wasn't even

1002
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:39,300
close to the same thing as the purple

1003
00:41:35,219 --> 00:41:40,679
one man so with with the skunk one did

1004
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:43,500
you notice any

1005
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:46,078
um like solely broadleaf Expressions

1006
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:48,179
stuff that looked just pure Afghani in

1007
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:52,079
the skunk one cup

1008
00:41:48,179 --> 00:41:54,779
well one of the photos that you posted

1009
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:56,640
last week I think

1010
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:58,380
um what was interesting about the skunk

1011
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:02,819
was it

1012
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:05,760
it grew like long colas and they were

1013
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:07,800
almost self-prooning in the fall the the

1014
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,060
sun leaves would all turn yellow and you

1015
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,220
could just shake the plant they would

1016
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:14,519
fall off and leave these long green

1017
00:42:11,219 --> 00:42:18,539
colors and I have one photo on my from

1018
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:21,659
that I took that is just slightly blurry

1019
00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:22,858
but it's just a series of the

1020
00:42:21,659 --> 00:42:25,500
four

1021
00:42:22,858 --> 00:42:27,679
four to six foot tall colas you know

1022
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:31,079
like one Cola coming out of the ground

1023
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:33,179
and those are the ones that were 6.8

1024
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:37,320
ounces you know on average

1025
00:42:33,179 --> 00:42:40,139
it was dense and and nice uh very deep

1026
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:42,780
deep green but there was no

1027
00:42:40,139 --> 00:42:46,858
Indica fat Leaf

1028
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:49,200
um Expressions solely it was uniform it

1029
00:42:46,858 --> 00:42:52,679
was truly true breeding at that time

1030
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:55,919
what Robert and Sam had accomplished I

1031
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:58,980
think Robert was more the geneticist in

1032
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:01,019
doing it but there's some some place in

1033
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:04,318
the history where they said they had ten

1034
00:43:01,019 --> 00:43:07,019
thousand Foods going in Red Cups and

1035
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:09,059
they chose from that and I don't know if

1036
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:11,759
that's accurate but I'm not sure yeah

1037
00:43:09,059 --> 00:43:14,338
and it it really um

1038
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:17,819
when we planted it it grew the way it

1039
00:43:14,338 --> 00:43:20,338
looked each plant they had a little bit

1040
00:43:17,818 --> 00:43:22,880
wider leaves certainly than like

1041
00:43:20,338 --> 00:43:27,299
Acapulco Gold or Santa Martin or

1042
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:28,619
tropical thin Leaf but uh nothing like

1043
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:32,400
the uh

1044
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:35,220
deep chunk or Maple Leaf indicas that

1045
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:38,519
you know people had on on icy mag that

1046
00:43:35,219 --> 00:43:41,239
look just like you know umbrellas almost

1047
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:44,219
you could yeah your head if it's raining

1048
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:47,098
dinosaur leaves yeah

1049
00:43:44,219 --> 00:43:48,659
exactly was it your impression then I

1050
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:50,579
mean obviously you said before that you

1051
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:53,039
reached out to

1052
00:43:50,579 --> 00:43:55,920
um you reached out to to Rob through a

1053
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:57,480
letter and contacted him

1054
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,338
um and he brought you the seeds is what

1055
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:02,639
you said previously

1056
00:43:59,338 --> 00:44:05,039
um when it did you meet Sam back then

1057
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:07,679
did he talk about their partnership did

1058
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:09,179
he did they did he tell you any of the

1059
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:10,739
work that he had done to get to skunk

1060
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:11,598
one

1061
00:44:10,739 --> 00:44:14,519
um

1062
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:16,859
all my info came from Robert I never met

1063
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:19,980
Sam I've never talked to him personally

1064
00:44:16,858 --> 00:44:24,000
I've I've private message with him on

1065
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:24,719
icmag in 2012 but nothing

1066
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,099
um

1067
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:31,618
I've I've sent him some labels for his

1068
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:34,500
collection but I don't

1069
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:36,119
I've never met him it was all second

1070
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:38,219
hand from Robert

1071
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:40,680
when he described

1072
00:44:38,219 --> 00:44:42,899
um and I I don't know if Rob was when I

1073
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:44,940
got on when I got on there Sam was very

1074
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:47,338
big that's where I saw all of his

1075
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:49,440
collection of of you know essentially

1076
00:44:47,338 --> 00:44:50,880
breeder art and grower art that they

1077
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,318
would that they would make and attach to

1078
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,760
their pounds

1079
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:55,619
um he would post a lot in something

1080
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,880
called I was was it called the Breeders

1081
00:44:55,619 --> 00:44:58,740
lab

1082
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,660
maybe something like that yeah something

1083
00:44:58,739 --> 00:45:02,699
along those lines but he was pretty

1084
00:45:00,659 --> 00:45:04,379
active in that

1085
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:06,299
um and so

1086
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:08,760
I I was just I'm just always curious

1087
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:10,560
just about like what you know had did

1088
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:13,440
Rob tell you how long he'd been working

1089
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:16,078
on skunk one when he gave it to you or

1090
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,099
any kind of like any info along those

1091
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,318
lines

1092
00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:21,838
yeah that you know

1093
00:45:19,318 --> 00:45:24,960
he worked in Ben Loman which is a little

1094
00:45:21,838 --> 00:45:27,779
town up in the Redwoods just above

1095
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,338
um Santa Cruz you you might go through

1096
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:30,180
Ben Lomond for instance if you're going

1097
00:45:29,338 --> 00:45:33,239
to go up

1098
00:45:30,179 --> 00:45:36,179
further up to like lahonda where Neil

1099
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:39,000
Young lived still a distance from San

1100
00:45:36,179 --> 00:45:40,318
Francisco and he told me that that's

1101
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,579
where he they had their little

1102
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:45,960
Underground

1103
00:45:41,579 --> 00:45:48,300
Greenhouse going in and but he made it

1104
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:51,720
sound like it they had been doing it for

1105
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:54,119
a year or two before he never went into

1106
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:57,000
the history of these other neighbors and

1107
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:59,099
Santa Cruz that Sam knew that were the

1108
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,420
two brothers and yeah

1109
00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:02,818
um

1110
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:04,019
all those stories those I read more

1111
00:46:02,818 --> 00:46:07,199
about later

1112
00:46:04,019 --> 00:46:08,940
in on icmag and people disputing it and

1113
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:10,439
one person saying oh no it was this and

1114
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:11,159
that so

1115
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:14,039
um

1116
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:16,920
yeah he he he mentioned though that he

1117
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:18,719
had been working on it I bought his 1977

1118
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:20,639
Treatise

1119
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:22,858
um not from him I don't know where I

1120
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:24,539
found it but somewhere online and then

1121
00:46:22,858 --> 00:46:26,940
when he came out with marijuana botany

1122
00:46:24,539 --> 00:46:28,739
you know everyone bought it

1123
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:31,800
but if it wasn't for the Growers guide

1124
00:46:28,739 --> 00:46:34,039
Mel Franks we would have failed because

1125
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:37,019
when we had that year the second year

1126
00:46:34,039 --> 00:46:39,659
where we got this Twist on the end of

1127
00:46:37,019 --> 00:46:42,480
all of our plants and they were already

1128
00:46:39,659 --> 00:46:44,098
six foot seven foot plants we were like

1129
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,420
freaking out because they were supposed

1130
00:46:44,099 --> 00:46:47,818
to be getting

1131
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:51,000
flowers instead they had the leaves

1132
00:46:47,818 --> 00:46:53,279
twisting and we

1133
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:56,280
he talked about micronutrients and how

1134
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:59,339
you could have a you could be short and

1135
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:00,480
a couple micronutrients in your soil and

1136
00:46:59,338 --> 00:47:04,619
that could make the world of difference

1137
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:06,300
so we got some concentrated

1138
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:10,140
um

1139
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:11,579
seaweed extract yeah we have 90

1140
00:47:10,139 --> 00:47:14,338
different

1141
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:18,480
sure yeah minerals from the ocean

1142
00:47:14,338 --> 00:47:20,940
nothing even comes close and we bought a

1143
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:23,159
big backpack pump sprayer and then

1144
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:25,200
filled it with water I think it held two

1145
00:47:23,159 --> 00:47:28,858
gallons and just walked around and

1146
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:31,799
sprayed the plants and I think we did it

1147
00:47:28,858 --> 00:47:34,019
once and waited a three or four days and

1148
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:36,000
then we did it again and but by the end

1149
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:38,338
of a week or eight or nine days they

1150
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,199
were all untwisting so whatever what

1151
00:47:38,338 --> 00:47:42,179
they were missing and it was because of

1152
00:47:40,199 --> 00:47:46,078
Mel Frank's book about Mike talking

1153
00:47:42,179 --> 00:47:47,879
about micronutrient problems we

1154
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:50,119
kind of zoned it down to being

1155
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:52,680
molybdenum

1156
00:47:50,119 --> 00:47:56,099
lack of malignant you know what's what's

1157
00:47:52,679 --> 00:47:58,858
amazing about that to me is that uh many

1158
00:47:56,099 --> 00:48:01,140
years later in 1993 when I was planning

1159
00:47:58,858 --> 00:48:03,119
on growing for the first time

1160
00:48:01,139 --> 00:48:07,139
two of the three books that taught me

1161
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:10,019
things was uh Rob Clark's uh marijuana

1162
00:48:07,139 --> 00:48:12,358
botany and Mel Frank's Growers guide

1163
00:48:10,019 --> 00:48:14,460
yeah you know there are different

1164
00:48:12,358 --> 00:48:16,019
additions by then obviously they'd been

1165
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:18,720
through some revisions and things as

1166
00:48:16,019 --> 00:48:21,480
time had gone on but the same knowledge

1167
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:23,759
uh to a young kid desperate for it so

1168
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:25,380
that's pretty cool that that Grower's

1169
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,680
guide there was nothing that even came

1170
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:31,260
close when it first came out I mean

1171
00:48:27,679 --> 00:48:34,139
really yeah it really was really was

1172
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:37,500
fantastic mine got so dog-eared I I put

1173
00:48:34,139 --> 00:48:40,078
some like Rings through it uh to hold it

1174
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:42,358
together and I I passed it on to you

1175
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:45,780
know another another guy that

1176
00:48:42,358 --> 00:48:48,059
you know wound up growing and

1177
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:49,980
breeding and taking seeds to dead

1178
00:48:48,059 --> 00:48:53,519
concerts and stuff which was pretty

1179
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:56,338
pretty foreign to me as a skateboard

1180
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:57,838
punk rocker you know yeah interesting

1181
00:48:56,338 --> 00:48:59,578
Mel it was I think I can't remember

1182
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:01,739
there was three people involved in that

1183
00:48:59,579 --> 00:49:03,780
book Mel Frank and Ed Rosenthal are the

1184
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:06,539
two I remember off the top of my head

1185
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:08,460
but there was a third author uh that was

1186
00:49:06,539 --> 00:49:10,500
that contributed to it to some degree I

1187
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:13,139
still have the books at my house was Ang

1188
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:15,599
Lee no he's another photographer yeah

1189
00:49:13,139 --> 00:49:18,358
that's it right there yeah that's the

1190
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:21,599
one yeah that book that book I've

1191
00:49:18,358 --> 00:49:23,338
probably read a hundred times in this in

1192
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:25,980
the six or eight months before I set up

1193
00:49:23,338 --> 00:49:28,519
my first indoor because I had no idea

1194
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:31,260
what I was doing

1195
00:49:28,519 --> 00:49:33,900
you got it not so it was probably called

1196
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:35,940
the indoor outdoor marijuana growers

1197
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:38,240
guide but the original one was just

1198
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:42,000
Grower's guide Grower's guide yeah

1199
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:44,879
indeed I indexed my books

1200
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:47,880
so that I could go in there and find

1201
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:49,680
whatever page I needed to really quickly

1202
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:51,119
um

1203
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:54,899
and

1204
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:56,039
then on the marijuana experience guide

1205
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:58,440
yeah

1206
00:49:56,039 --> 00:50:00,480
more stuff you know five hours direct

1207
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:02,220
flight minimum

1208
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:05,760
I think it's probably hard for young

1209
00:50:02,219 --> 00:50:08,338
people today to like conceive of just

1210
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:10,740
how sparse and hard to come by some of

1211
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:12,659
this information was because they're

1212
00:50:10,739 --> 00:50:15,899
used to the internet and typing things

1213
00:50:12,659 --> 00:50:18,118
in and forums and resources but it was

1214
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:20,700
really limited back then

1215
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:23,160
um in terms of what you could access and

1216
00:50:20,699 --> 00:50:25,559
you know and how to learn and so those

1217
00:50:23,159 --> 00:50:28,799
books played them obviously even with

1218
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:31,019
you guys they played a massive role in

1219
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:33,660
uh in teaching people exactly how to

1220
00:50:31,019 --> 00:50:36,900
pull off a successful crop this is the

1221
00:50:33,659 --> 00:50:39,000
first first year came out 1978 it was

1222
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:42,180
the first edition and or press in

1223
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:44,460
Berkeley and mine is kind of falling

1224
00:50:42,179 --> 00:50:45,899
apart so I understand what you're

1225
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:48,420
talking about

1226
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:51,358
um oh look what's one of my book markers

1227
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:52,680
in here I didn't even remember oh yeah

1228
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:54,598
look at that

1229
00:50:52,679 --> 00:50:55,980
that's another one so I have at least

1230
00:50:54,599 --> 00:50:56,579
two of them

1231
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:58,619
um

1232
00:50:56,579 --> 00:51:00,539
and

1233
00:50:58,619 --> 00:51:03,180
we used to we used to go to the library

1234
00:51:00,539 --> 00:51:05,880
and I mean I would search for everything

1235
00:51:03,179 --> 00:51:08,219
on hydroponics because I even growing

1236
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:11,338
outdoors I was doing outdoor hydroponics

1237
00:51:08,219 --> 00:51:13,558
in in 1981 you know

1238
00:51:11,338 --> 00:51:16,078
um five gallon buckets filled with peat

1239
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:20,280
moss cow [ __ ] perlite and vermiculite

1240
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:22,440
and then you know fed with Eco grow

1241
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:26,220
um you know granular

1242
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:28,858
two-part mix and uh

1243
00:51:26,219 --> 00:51:31,078
yeah so I went to the library and I I

1244
00:51:28,858 --> 00:51:33,598
started started researching Hydroponics

1245
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:37,740
and basically I stole any good book from

1246
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:39,660
the library that Hydroponics and uh kept

1247
00:51:37,739 --> 00:51:43,919
it you know

1248
00:51:39,659 --> 00:51:46,318
that was uh very much cell study this is

1249
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,420
the book um we are referring to the the

1250
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:51,358
Rob Clark thesis it's called the botany

1251
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:54,300
and Ecology of cannabis this is my copy

1252
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:56,239
that I scanned in is it loaded on the

1253
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:59,359
screen they're numbered

1254
00:51:56,239 --> 00:52:01,858
mine's not mine's actually not

1255
00:51:59,358 --> 00:52:04,259
it's one of the few that's not

1256
00:52:01,858 --> 00:52:05,880
um Clark actually uh the one of the few

1257
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:08,339
times that he's ever responded about

1258
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:10,079
anything was to give me the print run on

1259
00:52:08,338 --> 00:52:12,420
it and apparently there were I think

1260
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:14,640
1500 total

1261
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:16,200
um when it was a first print of 500 and

1262
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:17,699
a second print of a thousand but you

1263
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:20,719
can't tell the difference between the

1264
00:52:17,699 --> 00:52:24,419
two summer number and some are not

1265
00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:26,459
but another example this is he we drew

1266
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:28,740
this by hand and all through the book

1267
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:31,318
this book are his drawings yeah

1268
00:52:28,739 --> 00:52:34,259
extraordinary I can just imagine him

1269
00:52:31,318 --> 00:52:37,679
getting wasted and just sitting and just

1270
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:38,460
digging drawing I could not draw that by

1271
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:40,618
hand

1272
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:42,539
no they're they're beautiful drawings in

1273
00:52:40,619 --> 00:52:45,780
here like and that's one of the things

1274
00:52:42,539 --> 00:52:47,940
like I've been sitting on it forever and

1275
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:50,220
you know it's not really out there for

1276
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:51,960
people to see but there are some of the

1277
00:52:50,219 --> 00:52:53,939
most beautiful drawings of cannabis in

1278
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:55,639
the in the Cannabis part the parts of

1279
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:59,338
the cannabis plant

1280
00:52:55,639 --> 00:53:03,019
I've ever seen yeah it's it's crazy he

1281
00:52:59,338 --> 00:53:03,019
did such an amazing job back then

1282
00:53:06,139 --> 00:53:12,779
it kind of It kind of you know it kind

1283
00:53:09,179 --> 00:53:15,118
of reminds me of early early botanists

1284
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:17,940
and explorers geneticists they'd travel

1285
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:20,640
around you know different Iowans and

1286
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:22,280
stuff and discovering dodo birds and

1287
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:25,139
things like that and sitting around

1288
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:28,380
drawing in their sketchbooks describing

1289
00:53:25,139 --> 00:53:31,500
the fauna and Flora of these these

1290
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:35,160
exotic locations it's just gorgeous and

1291
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:37,500
he got it so accurately I mean just they

1292
00:53:35,159 --> 00:53:40,078
looked exactly right the the Indica

1293
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:43,260
plants that he he drew in marijuana

1294
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:46,740
botany were just spot on you know yeah

1295
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:49,200
and uh the elegant the Elegance of the

1296
00:53:46,739 --> 00:53:51,779
branches and the weaves that he drew I I

1297
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:53,939
just I I always I didn't know if he drew

1298
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:56,040
him or somebody else did but I did I

1299
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:57,780
asked him yeah he drew him I just

1300
00:53:56,039 --> 00:54:00,239
thought they were gorgeous

1301
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:03,480
yeah there's another book he did called

1302
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:05,459
hence that was released in Germany that

1303
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:08,460
has some beautiful illustrations of his

1304
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:10,980
and um but it's not available in the

1305
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:12,960
United States but if you guys can trace

1306
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:13,980
down a puppy of hand which is German for

1307
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,659
him

1308
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:17,338
um there's more beautiful drawings from

1309
00:54:15,659 --> 00:54:19,318
him in there

1310
00:54:17,338 --> 00:54:22,380
cool

1311
00:54:19,318 --> 00:54:25,920
if you zoom over to the humbled uh up

1312
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:28,440
here on your list the article that I

1313
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:30,838
found on humble growing

1314
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:34,139
I thought not the dog would find this

1315
00:54:30,838 --> 00:54:36,539
interesting it has a it has Rob Clark in

1316
00:54:34,139 --> 00:54:40,679
the corner here when he's 29 years old

1317
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:42,900
oh wow sure does holding a Bud and it's

1318
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:45,358
in color but I I only scan in in black

1319
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:47,818
and white because I my I'm running low

1320
00:54:45,358 --> 00:54:49,578
on the other well actually I could have

1321
00:54:47,818 --> 00:54:52,199
scanned it that's true

1322
00:54:49,579 --> 00:54:55,920
it's okay this works I wasn't thinking

1323
00:54:52,199 --> 00:54:59,539
about it but I I met him

1324
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:01,920
I I think this article is from about

1325
00:54:59,539 --> 00:55:03,659
1982 because they mentioned something

1326
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:08,838
the price of Marijuana

1327
00:55:03,659 --> 00:55:11,940
in 82 so yeah right up here yeah

1328
00:55:08,838 --> 00:55:14,940
in 82 an estimated 1.8 billion dollars

1329
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:17,579
the street value yeah so he was 29 in

1330
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:21,179
82. if so you can go backwards and

1331
00:55:17,579 --> 00:55:22,680
figure that out how old he is and and

1332
00:55:21,179 --> 00:55:25,379
I met Rob

1333
00:55:22,679 --> 00:55:28,858
he came down to Negril once with his

1334
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:31,318
wife at the time and I was we hung out

1335
00:55:28,858 --> 00:55:33,058
together for a few days in the grill and

1336
00:55:31,318 --> 00:55:35,880
the concept was he was going to look for

1337
00:55:33,059 --> 00:55:37,800
some you know land races there Jamaican

1338
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:39,960
I yeah I didn't see him after those

1339
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:42,059
first few days but I think he traveled

1340
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:43,920
around a bit

1341
00:55:42,059 --> 00:55:47,460
um but this is great because it talks

1342
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:50,240
about the helicopters in in Humboldt and

1343
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:50,240
at this time

1344
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:53,940
I'm so glad you saved this stuff that's

1345
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:54,838
the second photo

1346
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:57,420
um

1347
00:55:54,838 --> 00:55:58,500
I figure where it is

1348
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:00,358
oh well

1349
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:02,400
one of the uh one of the interesting

1350
00:56:00,358 --> 00:56:04,619
things about when helicopters first

1351
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,720
started flying is that people were

1352
00:56:04,619 --> 00:56:09,119
growing all these giant sativas in the

1353
00:56:06,719 --> 00:56:10,799
hills and Humboldt and Mendocino and

1354
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:12,420
nobody as long as you were tucked away

1355
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:14,760
nobody cared how big they were because

1356
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:16,440
no one was looking for them and so

1357
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:18,059
there's articles I've read where like

1358
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:20,760
the very first

1359
00:56:18,059 --> 00:56:23,460
Gardens that got busted by helicopters

1360
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:26,640
they actually chopped down most of the

1361
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:29,280
gardens with chainsaws yeah because the

1362
00:56:26,639 --> 00:56:30,779
the stocks were like this they were so

1363
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:33,540
big and thick and the people weren't

1364
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:36,660
worried about about getting caught

1365
00:56:33,539 --> 00:56:41,338
um so they just had these ginormous uh

1366
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:45,019
you know these huge sativa plants

1367
00:56:41,338 --> 00:56:47,880
um oh goodness look at that yeah right

1368
00:56:45,019 --> 00:56:50,280
gangster oh that's yeah that that's

1369
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:52,640
that's pushing a certain narrative not

1370
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,640
at all

1371
00:56:55,699 --> 00:57:01,019
chainsaw thing uh was that's that was

1372
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:03,000
common down in where I was living too

1373
00:57:01,019 --> 00:57:06,838
you know the National Guard helicopters

1374
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:09,358
were flying uh looking looking for the

1375
00:57:06,838 --> 00:57:11,699
crop and you know when we would go out

1376
00:57:09,358 --> 00:57:14,519
when I went out to my Gardens I was

1377
00:57:11,699 --> 00:57:16,799
always dressed in camouflage

1378
00:57:14,519 --> 00:57:20,219
um you know the the whole gorilla

1379
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:22,859
mindset leaving no Trail you you would

1380
00:57:20,219 --> 00:57:25,679
create a trail to your spot where you

1381
00:57:22,858 --> 00:57:27,838
would go from step to step always

1382
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:30,539
putting your foot in exactly the same

1383
00:57:27,838 --> 00:57:33,299
spot that you did the time before you

1384
00:57:30,539 --> 00:57:35,279
know crawling under bushes and stuff to

1385
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:38,039
it was um

1386
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:41,040
yeah you're probably familiar rajo we

1387
00:57:38,039 --> 00:57:42,960
have we have a bunch of manzanitas uh in

1388
00:57:41,039 --> 00:57:44,400
Mendocino County which are for people

1389
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:47,639
that aren't familiar they're kind of

1390
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:50,099
these like Smooth limbed bushes that get

1391
00:57:47,639 --> 00:57:52,379
anywhere from six to 12 feet tall

1392
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:54,359
and you can kind of thin them out

1393
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:55,980
underneath and a lot of people grew in

1394
00:57:54,358 --> 00:57:57,960
Manzanita patches because you could

1395
00:57:55,980 --> 00:58:00,119
still get some filtered light but it

1396
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:02,519
wasn't going to be totally exposed

1397
00:58:00,119 --> 00:58:04,559
so uh crawling around in Manzanita

1398
00:58:02,519 --> 00:58:07,739
patches and and cutting off lower

1399
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:11,460
branches to make spots for Gardens is is

1400
00:58:07,739 --> 00:58:13,679
like my first outdoor experiences up

1401
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:15,720
there right there sir can you zoom in on

1402
00:58:13,679 --> 00:58:18,719
this this is these are humble photos

1403
00:58:15,719 --> 00:58:21,118
from that same article let's see here

1404
00:58:18,719 --> 00:58:23,159
I'm gonna try to zoom in a little bit

1405
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:25,318
no he's holding up something on his

1406
00:58:23,159 --> 00:58:27,078
thing Matt oh okay let me see you over

1407
00:58:25,318 --> 00:58:29,519
here

1408
00:58:27,079 --> 00:58:31,619
it's not easy to get back to you hold on

1409
00:58:29,519 --> 00:58:32,759
there we go there we go

1410
00:58:31,619 --> 00:58:36,240
um

1411
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:38,940
damn it Matt oh look at that guys

1412
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:43,379
pruning their father and son pruning

1413
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:45,599
some big leaf plants too yeah and they

1414
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:47,400
both have 38 caliber weapons in their

1415
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:50,220
back pocket that they point out in this

1416
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:54,059
article on the guard dog and then here's

1417
00:58:50,219 --> 00:58:56,818
an aerial shot of a huge Garden like the

1418
00:58:54,059 --> 00:58:58,859
chainsaw you're just describing

1419
00:58:56,818 --> 00:59:00,619
um people took that risk but it didn't

1420
00:58:58,858 --> 00:59:03,659
always work once the helicopters came

1421
00:59:00,619 --> 00:59:06,140
the helicopters dramatically changed

1422
00:59:03,659 --> 00:59:09,298
people's approaches

1423
00:59:06,139 --> 00:59:11,759
to a huge degree because most of these

1424
00:59:09,298 --> 00:59:13,679
things were grown in in like like you

1425
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:16,319
know I mean that's super easily visible

1426
00:59:13,679 --> 00:59:19,858
from the air but like now not from

1427
00:59:16,318 --> 00:59:22,318
driving around that's him yeah

1428
00:59:19,858 --> 00:59:25,139
yeah the color difference is just so

1429
00:59:22,318 --> 00:59:27,599
obvious from the air you know it the

1430
00:59:25,139 --> 00:59:29,519
tactics for hiding this stuff became you

1431
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:31,619
know pretty oh look at those guys

1432
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:34,559
they're creative these are your Humboldt

1433
00:59:31,619 --> 00:59:37,019
sheriffs yeah in the garden that they

1434
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:39,839
just dismantled

1435
00:59:37,019 --> 00:59:43,619
you know that Newsweek magazine um mad

1436
00:59:39,838 --> 00:59:45,838
Jag the that came out that at the same

1437
00:59:43,619 --> 00:59:47,880
time there was another article I can't

1438
00:59:45,838 --> 00:59:51,119
remember if it was time or it was a

1439
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:53,640
national publication where they came out

1440
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:57,358
with an article talking about this new

1441
00:59:53,639 --> 01:00:00,358
high potency kind of super weed that was

1442
00:59:57,358 --> 01:00:03,199
that was you know flooding the streets

1443
01:00:00,358 --> 01:00:05,639
called skunk yeah

1444
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:08,219
I've been I've been looking for this

1445
01:00:05,639 --> 01:00:10,078
magazine or this article ever since and

1446
01:00:08,219 --> 01:00:12,419
I honestly I thought the reference was

1447
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:13,798
in that Newsweek that had the guy with

1448
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:16,798
the mask

1449
01:00:13,798 --> 01:00:19,139
um and the and the M16 but

1450
01:00:16,798 --> 01:00:20,880
um it's it wasn't you know I've read

1451
01:00:19,139 --> 01:00:22,798
that article since and I don't think

1452
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:25,260
there's a reference to it but they

1453
01:00:22,798 --> 01:00:28,559
described the effects of skunk

1454
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:31,140
in that article it's it's classic Reefer

1455
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:33,420
Madness you know writing yeah

1456
01:00:31,139 --> 01:00:35,578
um you know but they honestly they got

1457
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:37,380
it right and they they described the

1458
01:00:35,579 --> 01:00:40,859
appearance of it they describe the

1459
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:44,460
effects and uh it was pretty spot on for

1460
01:00:40,858 --> 01:00:47,279
what I thought skunk was tears what is

1461
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:52,139
this one a reason for Tears look at that

1462
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:54,540
this is um from the state of of Utah and

1463
01:00:52,139 --> 01:00:57,000
it's a it's an entire region Madness

1464
01:00:54,539 --> 01:00:58,739
basically

1465
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:01,039
um about

1466
01:00:58,739 --> 01:01:01,039
foreign

1467
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:11,298
High School undercover it's an article

1468
01:01:08,239 --> 01:01:13,919

1471
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:20,400
it's a whole article about going

1472
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:23,460
undercover in the various high schools

1473
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:26,160
in Utah like 21 Jump Street like the TV

1474
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:28,260
show oh yeah I mean I'll tell you this

1475
01:01:26,159 --> 01:01:31,318
is obviously so much later but the first

1476
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:33,720
time that I ever saw a guy with waist

1477
01:01:31,318 --> 01:01:37,079
long dreadlocks tackle someone and then

1478
01:01:33,719 --> 01:01:40,519
put cuffs on them oh wow and on dead

1479
01:01:37,079 --> 01:01:40,519
tour I was like oh man

1480
01:01:47,719 --> 01:01:53,098
they're labeled like Hawaiian Maui

1481
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:55,379
stickless Thai orange Colombian they

1482
01:01:53,099 --> 01:01:57,440
smell Colombian wrong too they always

1483
01:01:55,380 --> 01:02:01,140
spell it wrong

1484
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:01,798
Maui so they had some really good

1485
01:02:01,139 --> 01:02:04,379
um

1486
01:02:01,798 --> 01:02:06,719
photos here of different things that

1487
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:10,400
they had confiscated well Hawken red

1488
01:02:06,719 --> 01:02:11,939
Colombian red Guerrero gold

1489
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:14,099
wow

1490
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:16,318
um I always love those pictures the

1491
01:02:14,099 --> 01:02:18,720
reference pictures from point of origin

1492
01:02:16,318 --> 01:02:21,119
and time are so valuable so so so

1493
01:02:18,719 --> 01:02:22,318
valuable but it's hard when it's cops

1494
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:23,640
you know taking the pictures and you

1495
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:25,500
gotta hope that they got your bag right

1496
01:02:23,639 --> 01:02:26,659
and got kept the strain name with it and

1497
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:28,980
[ __ ]

1498
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:31,098
I think if it's your bag you probably

1499
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:35,219
got other things to worry about then

1500
01:02:31,099 --> 01:02:37,920
indeed freaking provenance you know

1501
01:02:35,219 --> 01:02:39,959
I mean one thing one thing that I think

1502
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,760
is kind of interesting too and it's it's

1503
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:44,220
it's obviously we don't need to dwell on

1504
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:45,900
it too much but I do think that like

1505
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:47,159
from what I'm listening to and you guys

1506
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:49,440
are talking about all these different

1507
01:02:47,159 --> 01:02:51,118
Highland and lowland Colombians and all

1508
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:52,679
these different regions and stuff like

1509
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:54,298
that and all these different Mexicans

1510
01:02:52,679 --> 01:02:57,058
and what they were

1511
01:02:54,298 --> 01:02:59,639
I kind of think that like the cocaine

1512
01:02:57,059 --> 01:03:01,680
trade and profitability with that sort

1513
01:02:59,639 --> 01:03:03,598
of blocked off the next generation of

1514
01:03:01,679 --> 01:03:06,000
Americans from being able to experience

1515
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:07,619
that because the groups that we're all

1516
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,659
bringing in those Colombians and

1517
01:03:07,619 --> 01:03:12,180
bringing in those Mexicans they shifted

1518
01:03:09,659 --> 01:03:14,818
to a more profitable thing and then it

1519
01:03:12,179 --> 01:03:16,739
also became unsafe for people a lot of

1520
01:03:14,818 --> 01:03:19,139
times that looked like us to go down to

1521
01:03:16,739 --> 01:03:22,078
those regions and get those things

1522
01:03:19,139 --> 01:03:23,879
so there was this era it was two things

1523
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:27,119
that were happening at the same time yes

1524
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:29,099
the cocaine you know became much more

1525
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:30,900
profitable for the same people that you

1526
01:03:29,099 --> 01:03:33,599
you know were formerly smuggling

1527
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:36,660
cannabis but at the same time the

1528
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:38,940
American you know homegrown Market had

1529
01:03:36,659 --> 01:03:41,818
had happened

1530
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:44,940
and and that product was just such a

1531
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:47,219
higher level of quality than what what

1532
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:49,740
the Imports had because of the freshness

1533
01:03:47,219 --> 01:03:52,798
and you know the introduction of

1534
01:03:49,739 --> 01:03:55,679
hard-hitting uh hard-hitting indicas and

1535
01:03:52,798 --> 01:03:57,659
in their hives what what year do you

1536
01:03:55,679 --> 01:04:03,118
think that was

1537
01:03:57,659 --> 01:04:04,500
80 82 83. oh wow yeah because I mean we

1538
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:06,298
don't need to Sidetrack on it but

1539
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:08,818
there's been an interplay between like

1540
01:04:06,298 --> 01:04:11,940
what Mexico and down south does versus

1541
01:04:08,818 --> 01:04:14,400
what's going on in America and like each

1542
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:16,619
one responding to the other in terms of

1543
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:18,358
cannabis that's been going on for I

1544
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:20,220
guess that's not a that's not a side

1545
01:04:18,358 --> 01:04:24,318
track at all as a matter of fact it's

1546
01:04:20,219 --> 01:04:26,759
another mad Jag story yeah

1547
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:29,159
because should we dive on into that I

1548
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:31,980
think that's a good idea I would love to

1549
01:04:29,159 --> 01:04:35,039
I mean that the the story about you know

1550
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:36,240
how you know mad Jag's uh contribution

1551
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:40,558
to the

1552
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:43,679
to the the Mexican uh cannabis gene pool

1553
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:46,380
my peoples you represent my peoples in

1554
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:48,899
Mexico all right so how did they how did

1555
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:51,358
this start happening what era did the um

1556
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:52,559
the Mexico stuff start occurring uh Jag

1557
01:04:51,358 --> 01:04:55,798
and Howe

1558
01:04:52,559 --> 01:05:02,400
well the last year I

1559
01:04:55,798 --> 01:05:06,960
grew in Mad Jack Canyon was 81. so by 82

1560
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:09,240
I I knew a guy who was a pilot and it's

1561
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:10,079
not the pilot I wrote about like

1562
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:12,358
um

1563
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:16,200
that you know when we talked about 60

1564
01:05:12,358 --> 01:05:18,539
tons of Packy hatch yeah this is a guy

1565
01:05:16,199 --> 01:05:19,679
I met him when I was working a regular

1566
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:21,298
job

1567
01:05:19,679 --> 01:05:23,399
at a truck

1568
01:05:21,298 --> 01:05:26,759
loading place I worked for Georgia

1569
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:30,420
Pacific for two years in Phoenix in the

1570
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:32,880
late 70s and this guy one day he walked

1571
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:34,740
up to me I was loading his truck up with

1572
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:37,079
empty plastic bottles which is what they

1573
01:05:34,739 --> 01:05:41,519
produced at Georgia Pacific and he said

1574
01:05:37,079 --> 01:05:43,859
uh hey if if I found a whole bunch of of

1575
01:05:41,519 --> 01:05:47,599
weed out in the desert

1576
01:05:43,858 --> 01:05:50,818
um could you sell it I said what

1577
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:53,180
I had short hair too and but he just

1578
01:05:50,818 --> 01:05:55,558
figured he felt that Vibe

1579
01:05:53,179 --> 01:05:56,460
and and I said what do you mean he says

1580
01:05:55,559 --> 01:05:59,760
well

1581
01:05:56,460 --> 01:06:02,940
I was flying over this area and I see

1582
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:05,040
where someone jettisoned when an empty

1583
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:06,420
fuel canister and it's stuck in the

1584
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:08,338
ground and I'm gonna go out there and

1585
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:10,200
check it and it I think it's they were

1586
01:06:08,338 --> 01:06:14,338
smuggling weed and I went

1587
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:15,659
sure man just let me know and he came

1588
01:06:14,338 --> 01:06:17,699
back a week later and he was all

1589
01:06:15,659 --> 01:06:20,578
disappointed because it was just an

1590
01:06:17,699 --> 01:06:22,919
empty fuel canister and it was actually

1591
01:06:20,579 --> 01:06:24,059
Air Force that had dropped it and it was

1592
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:26,099
stuck in the ground it looked like a

1593
01:06:24,059 --> 01:06:28,559
bomb you know yeah and it didn't explode

1594
01:06:26,099 --> 01:06:32,039
but then he started talking about other

1595
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:34,260
things and then all of a sudden

1596
01:06:32,039 --> 01:06:36,780
like two months later he comes back and

1597
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:41,160
I'm loading his truck and he says

1598
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:43,519
um I I met the people in Mexico and and

1599
01:06:41,159 --> 01:06:47,578
I said what and so

1600
01:06:43,519 --> 01:06:49,619
he's he stole a twin engine Cessna from

1601
01:06:47,579 --> 01:06:52,380
Scottsdale airport flew it to

1602
01:06:49,619 --> 01:06:54,119
Guadalajara and gave it to the cartel to

1603
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:58,500
prove to them that he was not a nerd

1604
01:06:54,119 --> 01:07:00,720
that is a gangster I know later he stole

1605
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:03,420
a helicopter out of Apache Junction and

1606
01:07:00,719 --> 01:07:05,578
flew it down but he only got 20 miles

1607
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:08,099
into Mexico before something went wrong

1608
01:07:05,579 --> 01:07:11,039
mechanically and he had to crash Landon

1609
01:07:08,099 --> 01:07:12,359
and Hike his way back and the FBI came

1610
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:14,819
to his house because he found his

1611
01:07:12,358 --> 01:07:17,279
fingerprints in Mexico on this and he

1612
01:07:14,818 --> 01:07:19,079
denied everything so they couldn't do

1613
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:20,519
anything scared the [ __ ] out of him but

1614
01:07:19,079 --> 01:07:24,720
I bet

1615
01:07:20,519 --> 01:07:28,920
they good Lord they brought several

1616
01:07:24,719 --> 01:07:31,679
loads of of weed I found an airstrip in

1617
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:34,079
along the Mogan Rim in a small town area

1618
01:07:31,679 --> 01:07:37,139
way out by itself

1619
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:38,640
and they were like within five minutes

1620
01:07:37,139 --> 01:07:40,818
they said they would be there at one

1621
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:44,460
o'clock they were like there at 105

1622
01:07:40,818 --> 01:07:46,558
kicking out Bales onto the airstrip and

1623
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:48,900
they would they would bring 500 kilos

1624
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:51,298
each flight and that's where one of two

1625
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:53,519
of the flights had labels already in

1626
01:07:51,298 --> 01:07:55,019
them from someone who was supposed to

1627
01:07:53,519 --> 01:07:58,259
get them in California but something

1628
01:07:55,019 --> 01:07:59,818
went wrong and we got them instead still

1629
01:07:58,260 --> 01:08:02,339
I'm still hunting for those labels I've

1630
01:07:59,818 --> 01:08:04,980
got them somewhere but

1631
01:08:02,338 --> 01:08:07,980
um anyway

1632
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:11,940
so you had a connection with those guys

1633
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:14,400
yeah it was 82 and 83. now Buffalo that

1634
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:16,679
Raphael Carl in general

1635
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:18,539
um you could see it from space it was a

1636
01:08:16,679 --> 01:08:20,520
square couple miles you know they show

1637
01:08:18,539 --> 01:08:22,920
it in that TV show

1638
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:25,140
um Narco Mexico yeah so that's that's

1639
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:26,060
the name of the Garden or the farm El

1640
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:28,219
Buffalo

1641
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:31,980
Rancho Buffalo

1642
01:08:28,219 --> 01:08:33,000
and with this at the beginning of the

1643
01:08:31,979 --> 01:08:37,579
the

1644
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:40,319
um Gallardo era of the development

1645
01:08:37,579 --> 01:08:41,698
when they were just doing weed yeah

1646
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:45,000
exactly

1647
01:08:41,698 --> 01:08:48,298
what happened was they they grew

1648
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:50,039
thousands and thousands of hectares of

1649
01:08:48,298 --> 01:08:52,619
of

1650
01:08:50,039 --> 01:08:55,380
weed but they didn't have anyone Growing

1651
01:08:52,619 --> 01:08:57,960
Seeds seed crops so they they were

1652
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:59,219
desperate for seeds and so my pilot

1653
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:01,859
friend

1654
01:08:59,219 --> 01:09:04,140
along with my other friend who was the

1655
01:09:01,859 --> 01:09:07,620
weed dealer in Tempe we filled two

1656
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:09,798
quart-sized bags half full and he stuck

1657
01:09:07,619 --> 01:09:12,539
one in each of his cowboy boots

1658
01:09:09,798 --> 01:09:15,899
and gave it to them and they were so

1659
01:09:12,539 --> 01:09:19,920
grateful because it they they had no

1660
01:09:15,899 --> 01:09:21,358
seeds yeah so unfortunately I was part

1661
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:24,239
of this because

1662
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:26,460
seeds from five different zones in

1663
01:09:24,238 --> 01:09:29,519
Mexico ended up in their hands and

1664
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:31,319
became the new hybrid and

1665
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:32,819
um oh well

1666
01:09:31,319 --> 01:09:36,539
I was like why would you say

1667
01:09:32,819 --> 01:09:38,580
informatically in 1980s Dutch genetics

1668
01:09:36,539 --> 01:09:40,560
were already in the grill of Jamaica and

1669
01:09:38,579 --> 01:09:42,179
the people go wild over them they were

1670
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:45,120
growing them up in Orange Hill and all

1671
01:09:42,179 --> 01:09:49,380
this so land races were getting squeezed

1672
01:09:45,119 --> 01:09:50,338
out and um to find true Jamaican I don't

1673
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:52,859
think it's

1674
01:09:50,338 --> 01:09:54,899
there anymore yeah Mexico there's

1675
01:09:52,859 --> 01:09:58,440
probably land race that's still in stash

1676
01:09:54,899 --> 01:10:01,198
spots and certainly in Colombia but boy

1677
01:09:58,439 --> 01:10:02,879
Jamaica being a little island it so

1678
01:10:01,198 --> 01:10:04,619
maybe you could clarify for a second

1679
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:06,840
then those seeds that you brought down

1680
01:10:04,619 --> 01:10:09,840
or he brought down smuggled in his boots

1681
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:13,679
what were they a mix of they were a mix

1682
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:15,719
of guerreran sin alone Michoacan oaxacan

1683
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:18,060
that my dealer friend and Tempe had

1684
01:10:15,719 --> 01:10:19,158
hydrated over the course of like two or

1685
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:21,780
three years

1686
01:10:19,158 --> 01:10:24,179
the best of the loads that had passed

1687
01:10:21,779 --> 01:10:25,679
through the loads and so that's why you

1688
01:10:24,179 --> 01:10:27,420
were like oh you were a little bummed

1689
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:30,000
about it because you kind of mixed the

1690
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:31,560
strains and then they started growing it

1691
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,179
and then instead of it being like a

1692
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:35,880
regional thing where these specific

1693
01:10:33,179 --> 01:10:38,819
kinds were coming from it was sort of a

1694
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:42,239
blend coming back right and we have no

1695
01:10:38,819 --> 01:10:43,559
idea El Buffalo got discovered um I

1696
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:46,979
wrote down this

1697
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:50,699
November 14th of 84 is when they found

1698
01:10:46,979 --> 01:10:52,799
it and burned it and it actually the

1699
01:10:50,698 --> 01:10:54,259
smoke affected people within a hundred

1700
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:57,300
mile radius

1701
01:10:54,260 --> 01:11:00,539
they've earned 500 hectares and they

1702
01:10:57,300 --> 01:11:04,199
estimate that it was worth 2.5 billion

1703
01:11:00,539 --> 01:11:06,300
dollars at that time in 84. so there's a

1704
01:11:04,198 --> 01:11:09,658
famous zillion it's a famous scene in

1705
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:12,420
narcos where he um I think it was it was

1706
01:11:09,658 --> 01:11:15,539
guyana's brother RAF is that a brother

1707
01:11:12,420 --> 01:11:17,940
it produces in the in the in the series

1708
01:11:15,539 --> 01:11:20,158
like this is the super the super strain

1709
01:11:17,939 --> 01:11:22,399
the the sinsamia

1710
01:11:20,158 --> 01:11:25,079
um right

1711
01:11:22,399 --> 01:11:27,299
was this before or after you met him

1712
01:11:25,079 --> 01:11:28,619
that or is this the the hybrid that

1713
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:32,100
you're talking about

1714
01:11:28,619 --> 01:11:35,399
well we gave them seats in 82 and 83 and

1715
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:37,140
El Buffalo was captured and burned I

1716
01:11:35,399 --> 01:11:41,099
don't know if it ran for years before

1717
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:42,900
that but just in general they Quintero

1718
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:44,880
was growing weed in other places but

1719
01:11:42,899 --> 01:11:46,738
Buffalo was like their

1720
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:48,420
huge place they had their own Wells

1721
01:11:46,738 --> 01:11:50,339
drilled there

1722
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:53,279
um it was in Sinaloa

1723
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:56,400
um and I've I've read about it in a book

1724
01:11:53,279 --> 01:11:59,359
called The Underground I forget I've got

1725
01:11:56,399 --> 01:12:03,899
the book it's like 900 pages long and

1726
01:11:59,359 --> 01:12:05,519
it's uh written by a DEA agent who is in

1727
01:12:03,899 --> 01:12:07,920
charge of all this stuff going on then

1728
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:10,080
and it has three chapters one on heroin

1729
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:13,079
one on cocaine and one on weed and the

1730
01:12:10,079 --> 01:12:15,359
one on Weeds about Buffalo being spotted

1731
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:17,579
by a TWA pilot or something they're

1732
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:19,019
flying over and they went what in the

1733
01:12:17,579 --> 01:12:22,260
world and they just mentioned it

1734
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:24,780
casually that's where Kiki Camarena got

1735
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:28,460
a job and what and actually penetrated

1736
01:12:24,779 --> 01:12:31,559
it and in the second movie of sicario

1737
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:33,539
it's so popular it's kind of similar

1738
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:35,580
because he's dressed up as a composino

1739
01:12:33,539 --> 01:12:38,519
and he gets a job

1740
01:12:35,579 --> 01:12:40,380
um yeah Kiki is the is that the that's

1741
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:42,860
the name of the de agent that got killed

1742
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:46,079
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

1743
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:48,960
and that caused a huge amount of

1744
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:51,179
problems oh yeah that was it yeah I left

1745
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:52,679
it alone you know but they didn't

1746
01:12:51,179 --> 01:12:55,520
um and that's when they were switching

1747
01:12:52,679 --> 01:12:59,880
over to cocaine just about then

1748
01:12:55,520 --> 01:13:02,960
84.85 I think that being burned Quintero

1749
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:07,199
um from what I read just became

1750
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:08,460
an addict of you know drug addict of

1751
01:13:07,198 --> 01:13:09,139
whatever

1752
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:11,640
um

1753
01:13:09,140 --> 01:13:14,219
he was sad he didn't want to see them go

1754
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:17,880
into cocaine but Raphael

1755
01:13:14,219 --> 01:13:20,158
um Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo he went

1756
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:21,840
ahead and went you know he became he

1757
01:13:20,158 --> 01:13:25,079
formed the first cartel with all these

1758
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:28,140
loose plazas that were existing guys

1759
01:13:25,079 --> 01:13:31,979
over here and guys over there and

1760
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:35,100
I stayed at his hotel in 84 wanted as

1761
01:13:31,979 --> 01:13:37,319
many he owned apparently a lot and my

1762
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:39,659
friend who was the pilot we went down

1763
01:13:37,319 --> 01:13:42,119
there and my friend from Colombia

1764
01:13:39,658 --> 01:13:45,779
found his way there from Colombia and we

1765
01:13:42,119 --> 01:13:48,899
all had a big party and they were hoping

1766
01:13:45,779 --> 01:13:50,939
that my friends from Colombia would be

1767
01:13:48,899 --> 01:13:52,738
able to turn them on to newer

1768
01:13:50,939 --> 01:13:55,259
connections and stuff I don't know

1769
01:13:52,738 --> 01:13:58,319
really what happened because he loved to

1770
01:13:55,260 --> 01:14:00,179
do Coke but he and I both decided we

1771
01:13:58,319 --> 01:14:04,380
didn't want to be in that business yeah

1772
01:14:00,179 --> 01:14:07,380
and the pilot this guy he he kept going

1773
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:09,480
they were using our airstrip the one

1774
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:12,000
that we had found for weed

1775
01:14:09,479 --> 01:14:14,459
sixteen hundred to two thousand pounds

1776
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,619
of coke at the time they did nine loads

1777
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:18,600
and then they an off-duty Sheriff who

1778
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:22,019
was cutting wood saw them landing and

1779
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:24,000
unloading and they got busted and um I

1780
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:27,120
have no idea what happened it was in the

1781
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:30,300
newspaper I've got a clip I've I've

1782
01:14:27,119 --> 01:14:31,559
posted before I think on icy mag

1783
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:35,340
but

1784
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:38,520
I I never met I never met Miguel Felix

1785
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:42,300
but um my partners did

1786
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:44,400
I did enjoy his Hospitality because we

1787
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:48,179
went in this hotel room there was a just

1788
01:14:44,399 --> 01:14:50,879
like in the movies a plate with a four

1789
01:14:48,179 --> 01:14:52,319
ounce pile of cocaine on it and two

1790
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:54,960
other guys who did nothing but just

1791
01:14:52,319 --> 01:14:58,139
bring cases of beer all through the

1792
01:14:54,960 --> 01:15:01,020
games that's nice of them yeah

1793
01:14:58,140 --> 01:15:03,420
sounds like a weekend at not so's place

1794
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:08,340
I guess yeah it is it is except except

1795
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:08,340
there's a lot more men a lot crazy

1796
01:15:08,819 --> 01:15:14,099
Matt loves that if he doesn't at least

1797
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:16,500
wants a show try to throw me off my game

1798
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:19,560
with something like that he's upset so

1799
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:22,560
yeah uh yeah my bound is opening and he

1800
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:25,679
took it yeah that's what she said

1801
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:28,560
but I mean just just you know Rahul said

1802
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:31,380
that that whole thing is just crazy but

1803
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:33,659
when I when I was when I was starting to

1804
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:36,420
do gorilla in California one of the

1805
01:15:33,658 --> 01:15:38,460
things that the Mexicans did was that

1806
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:40,920
um even with the cocaine I was told that

1807
01:15:38,460 --> 01:15:44,698
like still 70 of their profits was

1808
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:46,980
marijuana and so they really didn't like

1809
01:15:44,698 --> 01:15:50,039
um all this homegrown in the west coast

1810
01:15:46,979 --> 01:15:52,319
sort of taking their taking their you

1811
01:15:50,039 --> 01:15:55,560
know their their sales really well and

1812
01:15:52,319 --> 01:15:58,079
so they started sending these teams all

1813
01:15:55,560 --> 01:16:00,780
from down by where Matt is all the way

1814
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:03,059
up to the Oregon border and going in the

1815
01:16:00,779 --> 01:16:04,800
national forests and just growing a huge

1816
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:07,500
amount as much as they could get away

1817
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:08,940
with in all the national forests so that

1818
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:12,179
way they didn't have to smuggle it over

1819
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:13,439
the Border yeah you know and that's that

1820
01:16:12,179 --> 01:16:15,239
was kind of so there's been this

1821
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:17,399
obviously this like that's what I was

1822
01:16:15,238 --> 01:16:20,279
saying before about like how one one

1823
01:16:17,399 --> 01:16:22,198
country influences the other is the

1824
01:16:20,279 --> 01:16:24,539
Homegrown movement has dramatically

1825
01:16:22,198 --> 01:16:26,879
changed changed how the how the Mexicans

1826
01:16:24,539 --> 01:16:29,100
approach growing weed because you know

1827
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:30,480
for a long time they were sort of the

1828
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:31,620
primary weed people

1829
01:16:30,479 --> 01:16:33,238
yeah

1830
01:16:31,619 --> 01:16:35,519
yeah for sure

1831
01:16:33,238 --> 01:16:36,599
especially in Arizona with the Border

1832
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:38,400
here

1833
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:42,060
um Tucson was like the capital of

1834
01:16:38,399 --> 01:16:43,979
Smugglers and and dealers and then it

1835
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:47,039
moved up to Phoenix and Tempe and

1836
01:16:43,979 --> 01:16:50,879
Scottsdale but they they busted a big

1837
01:16:47,039 --> 01:16:53,100
grow in the canyon next to us just 10 15

1838
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:56,159
years ago and it was a gang from from

1839
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:58,739
Mexico operating out of Phoenix and they

1840
01:16:56,158 --> 01:17:01,019
had a spring that they had found up on

1841
01:16:58,738 --> 01:17:04,139
the side of this mountain and they had a

1842
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:08,159
system of drip irrigation that ran a

1843
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:10,619
mile down into the Canyons yeah they

1844
01:17:08,158 --> 01:17:12,799
just went too big these guys they just

1845
01:17:10,619 --> 01:17:16,198
didn't even think about hunters and

1846
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:18,360
ranchers and they just threw a team at

1847
01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:22,039
it group all this stuff and then they

1848
01:17:18,359 --> 01:17:25,319
all got busted they blew it out yeah

1849
01:17:22,039 --> 01:17:27,060
I mean to some degree on a spring on a

1850
01:17:25,319 --> 01:17:28,859
hillside model that's that's the way it

1851
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:31,199
was done in NorCal when I was out there

1852
01:17:28,859 --> 01:17:33,779
that summer I'm sure lots of that right

1853
01:17:31,198 --> 01:17:36,059
I mean the I think the cartels kind of

1854
01:17:33,779 --> 01:17:38,698
had a uh they viewed their a lot of

1855
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:40,320
their workers as semi-disposable and so

1856
01:17:38,698 --> 01:17:42,779
they sort of expected a certain amount

1857
01:17:40,319 --> 01:17:44,158
to get in trouble and they just threw a

1858
01:17:42,779 --> 01:17:45,840
lot of people out there in a lot of

1859
01:17:44,158 --> 01:17:47,639
different regions and they figured most

1860
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:48,539
of them will be successful and some of

1861
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:50,100
them won't

1862
01:17:48,539 --> 01:17:52,380
yep and that's kind of how they went

1863
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:54,840
about it I think just a numbers game

1864
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:56,279
yeah I mean they had money

1865
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:58,440
but you know when the pal when the

1866
01:17:56,279 --> 01:18:00,840
powder came in you know I think a lot of

1867
01:17:58,439 --> 01:18:04,139
that Colombian uh import just

1868
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:06,300
disappeared stopped entirely yeah and

1869
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:09,239
the Mexican commercial became they

1870
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:12,719
probably filled the gap for that for

1871
01:18:09,238 --> 01:18:15,359
that uh tier of product quality around

1872
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:17,158
the country I can tell you that

1873
01:18:15,359 --> 01:18:19,619
um you know I mean I started smoking in

1874
01:18:17,158 --> 01:18:21,658
the 90s there was brown Mexican and

1875
01:18:19,619 --> 01:18:24,539
green Mexican I didn't see Thai I didn't

1876
01:18:21,658 --> 01:18:26,279
see Colombian I didn't see Panamanian I

1877
01:18:24,539 --> 01:18:29,219
didn't see any of those of those famous

1878
01:18:26,279 --> 01:18:32,759
things that people wax poetic about it

1879
01:18:29,219 --> 01:18:34,859
was Mexican yeah and and I'm a decade

1880
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:37,320
later and all I saw was Mexican too you

1881
01:18:34,859 --> 01:18:40,079
know just you know I never saw Ty never

1882
01:18:37,319 --> 01:18:43,679
saw anything other than just Mexican yep

1883
01:18:40,079 --> 01:18:47,158
yeah it was gone okay so we got a little

1884
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:48,960
bit into Mexico just just a hair do you

1885
01:18:47,158 --> 01:18:51,238
want to go more into that is there some

1886
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:54,658
more details you want to add in there

1887
01:18:51,238 --> 01:18:56,399
not really it's just rubbing shoulders

1888
01:18:54,658 --> 01:18:58,439
with these famous people was kind of

1889
01:18:56,399 --> 01:19:00,599
weird I didn't know who they were at the

1890
01:18:58,439 --> 01:19:03,658
time they were just

1891
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:05,699
um guys exporting weed from Guadalajara

1892
01:19:03,658 --> 01:19:07,439
area but then when we found out it was

1893
01:19:05,698 --> 01:19:10,619
Miguel Angel

1894
01:19:07,439 --> 01:19:14,819
um and yeah we were like whoa [ __ ] man

1895
01:19:10,619 --> 01:19:17,880
yeah I bet we I'm so glad we didn't get

1896
01:19:14,819 --> 01:19:20,939
sucked into the cocaine deal because the

1897
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:22,560
the guy who who was a truck driver he

1898
01:19:20,939 --> 01:19:26,539
could fly helicopters he could fly

1899
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:29,580
planes he he went that direction and

1900
01:19:26,539 --> 01:19:32,340
installed 10 kilos to an undercover

1901
01:19:29,579 --> 01:19:34,979
agent north of Phoenix in the biggest

1902
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:37,319
hand-to-hand sale Buy in Arizona history

1903
01:19:34,979 --> 01:19:39,238
at the time and he got I think it was

1904
01:19:37,319 --> 01:19:41,519
seven kilos and he got 10 years in

1905
01:19:39,238 --> 01:19:45,178
prison Jesus and his brother kept going

1906
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:47,340
and did those loads on our air our the

1907
01:19:45,179 --> 01:19:49,140
Airship that we found

1908
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:52,020
um and they got nine of them before they

1909
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:54,719
got busted and we calculated at the

1910
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:57,560
price of coke at the time that it was it

1911
01:19:54,719 --> 01:20:01,260
came to around a quarter billion dollars

1912
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:03,420
whoa 250 million dollars of coke that

1913
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:06,060
they successfully brought in before they

1914
01:20:03,420 --> 01:20:07,859
got busted and I have no idea what

1915
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:12,840
happened to those boys boy

1916
01:20:07,859 --> 01:20:15,179
geez yeah roselda Blanco I had never

1917
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:18,000
heard her name until I read about it in

1918
01:20:15,179 --> 01:20:19,739
Newsweek or time but that's who my

1919
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:23,219
Colombian friend was actually working

1920
01:20:19,738 --> 01:20:25,019
for and his job was to count money and

1921
01:20:23,219 --> 01:20:27,719
he would go to Aspen where they bring in

1922
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:31,500
dc-9s or something like six tons at a

1923
01:20:27,719 --> 01:20:33,539
time of Colombian and he would just

1924
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:34,800
his fingers he could barely move them

1925
01:20:33,539 --> 01:20:36,859
after a week because they didn't have

1926
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:40,020
machines yet then she's I can imagine

1927
01:20:36,859 --> 01:20:44,479
hand counting five million dollars you

1928
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:44,480
know in 20s and tens and

1929
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:50,880
and that's where the stories started

1930
01:20:48,479 --> 01:20:53,519
happening about how they weighed their

1931
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:57,119
their money because in Florida he went

1932
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:59,580
to a apartment building once and he said

1933
01:20:57,119 --> 01:21:01,319
there'd be like five apartments and

1934
01:20:59,579 --> 01:21:03,059
they'd have a secret door in the closet

1935
01:21:01,319 --> 01:21:05,819
that would link it to the next apartment

1936
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:07,440
into the next apartment so that if they

1937
01:21:05,819 --> 01:21:08,899
had to Barrel they could just disappear

1938
01:21:07,439 --> 01:21:12,178
yeah

1939
01:21:08,899 --> 01:21:14,639
he went into one apartment and he said

1940
01:21:12,179 --> 01:21:16,859
it was floor to ceiling with tiny

1941
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:19,199
passageways in the hallways of just

1942
01:21:16,859 --> 01:21:21,359
money piled floor to ceiling every

1943
01:21:19,198 --> 01:21:23,698
single room and he said there was

1944
01:21:21,359 --> 01:21:26,158
millions of millions of dollars and and

1945
01:21:23,698 --> 01:21:28,859
that was one of the kind of places where

1946
01:21:26,158 --> 01:21:31,738
they would just weigh money yeah you

1947
01:21:28,859 --> 01:21:34,259
know and then send it back to Colombia

1948
01:21:31,738 --> 01:21:35,639
it's so wild and the responsibility of

1949
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:36,960
being the dude who has to count it

1950
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:38,159
because like you get that [ __ ] wrong

1951
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:39,179
you're going to be the first person they

1952
01:21:38,158 --> 01:21:39,979
look at

1953
01:21:39,179 --> 01:21:42,779
right

1954
01:21:39,979 --> 01:21:44,459
not me

1955
01:21:42,779 --> 01:21:47,698
yeah like you're making friends in

1956
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:51,658
Brooklyn the guy who's in charge he goes

1957
01:21:47,698 --> 01:21:55,439
by the nickname SATA he overpaid us once

1958
01:21:51,658 --> 01:21:57,299
two thousand dollars and I know him and

1959
01:21:55,439 --> 01:21:59,399
he did it as a trick to see if we were

1960
01:21:57,300 --> 01:22:01,380
going to tell him and be honest oh

1961
01:21:59,399 --> 01:22:04,920
interesting we counted the money a

1962
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:07,859
second time and I I said in his house in

1963
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:09,960
Brownsville and I said you know Sada

1964
01:22:07,859 --> 01:22:13,619
you're overt by two thousand dollars he

1965
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:15,899
goes what no no not even possible it was

1966
01:22:13,619 --> 01:22:18,359
just messing with us because he wanted

1967
01:22:15,899 --> 01:22:20,279
we were it was early in our relationship

1968
01:22:18,359 --> 01:22:23,880
and you wanted to see if we were honest

1969
01:22:20,279 --> 01:22:27,119
enough and we passed we passed the test

1970
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:29,159
so that was good yeah that's a good

1971
01:22:27,119 --> 01:22:32,099
thing yeah I used to do that with my

1972
01:22:29,158 --> 01:22:33,539
spray like my reversal spray I'd give it

1973
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:36,060
to different people and you know give

1974
01:22:33,539 --> 01:22:37,560
them different like yeah you know for

1975
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:39,780
this exchange or this exchange and

1976
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:41,280
knowing mostly that I was never going to

1977
01:22:39,779 --> 01:22:43,619
get anything but just trying to get a

1978
01:22:41,279 --> 01:22:45,359
good gauge of who is going to just take

1979
01:22:43,619 --> 01:22:47,460
it run with it use it to make themselves

1980
01:22:45,359 --> 01:22:50,819
a bunch of money or who would do you

1981
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:53,158
know what they said it's a good way I

1982
01:22:50,819 --> 01:22:54,719
mean it's it's a small loss but it's a

1983
01:22:53,158 --> 01:22:56,759
good way to judge a potential future

1984
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:58,819
lifelong friend too

1985
01:22:56,760 --> 01:23:03,000
yeah

1986
01:22:58,819 --> 01:23:06,299
cheap way to to figure out who you can

1987
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:08,039
trust absolutely and to them and to the

1988
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:10,320
other person it's almost like

1989
01:23:08,039 --> 01:23:12,238
from a greedy person's angle it's like

1990
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:13,920
well this one bottle could potentially

1991
01:23:12,238 --> 01:23:15,839
make me you know several thousand

1992
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:18,420
dollars worth of feminized seed so is it

1993
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:21,060
worth the bird you know and a lot of

1994
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:24,179
times it is worth the burn to people hmm

1995
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:25,500
yeah magic magic always says if there is

1996
01:23:24,179 --> 01:23:28,319
a doubt

1997
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:31,260
about a person then there is no doubt

1998
01:23:28,319 --> 01:23:32,039
it's a good quote that's a line from the

1999
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:32,760
movie

2000
01:23:32,039 --> 01:23:37,920
um

2001
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:39,900
Ronin and from running yep and yep um he

2002
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:42,119
says if there's a doubt there is no

2003
01:23:39,899 --> 01:23:43,859
doubt and yeah it's near the end of the

2004
01:23:42,119 --> 01:23:45,658
movie and that's when you find out that

2005
01:23:43,859 --> 01:23:47,460
he never quit and he was still working

2006
01:23:45,658 --> 01:23:50,639
for the

2007
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:54,600
CIA or something yeah um Robert De Niro

2008
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:58,020
right classical movie but it's true it

2009
01:23:54,600 --> 01:24:01,020
if you I treat my life that way if I

2010
01:23:58,020 --> 01:24:04,020
have a doubt about something I just go

2011
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:07,460
I'll wait and see what the universe does

2012
01:24:04,020 --> 01:24:09,719
I I didn't do that when I was younger

2013
01:24:07,460 --> 01:24:11,760
you seem to have jumped in with both

2014
01:24:09,719 --> 01:24:14,039
feet you know you seem to have a very

2015
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:17,760
magical touched life though I mean a lot

2016
01:24:14,039 --> 01:24:21,539
of people you know only live a fraction

2017
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:24,179
or see a fraction of what what you uh

2018
01:24:21,539 --> 01:24:26,819
managed to get yourself wound up in time

2019
01:24:24,179 --> 01:24:29,699
and time again and and the fact is you

2020
01:24:26,819 --> 01:24:31,920
guys weren't Outlaws as far as carrying

2021
01:24:29,698 --> 01:24:34,738
guns and being Cowboys and stuff like

2022
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:36,199
that you carried this very humble

2023
01:24:34,738 --> 01:24:39,419
um

2024
01:24:36,198 --> 01:24:41,879
yeah I had a great big throwing knife on

2025
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:43,859
my hip when I'm going to the canyon and

2026
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:44,940
you know I don't know what good that

2027
01:24:43,859 --> 01:24:48,539
would do

2028
01:24:44,939 --> 01:24:50,099
um but we specifically didn't we knew

2029
01:24:48,539 --> 01:24:52,738
other people some of the guys from

2030
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:54,780
Jerome they are all heavily armed and

2031
01:24:52,738 --> 01:24:56,819
they would have barbed wire in the

2032
01:24:54,779 --> 01:24:58,738
bushes and weird stuff you read about

2033
01:24:56,819 --> 01:24:59,939
this in magazines and yeah and I was

2034
01:24:58,738 --> 01:25:02,399
just going that's

2035
01:24:59,939 --> 01:25:05,158
that makes them instantly

2036
01:25:02,399 --> 01:25:06,619
um dangerous criminals yeah we were just

2037
01:25:05,158 --> 01:25:08,819
hippies

2038
01:25:06,619 --> 01:25:12,000
criminals that's an important

2039
01:25:08,819 --> 01:25:14,340
distinction to make because I think

2040
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:16,380
uh We've chatted for long enough now

2041
01:25:14,340 --> 01:25:19,199
that I can safely say that everybody on

2042
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:21,779
on this uh this little this little call

2043
01:25:19,198 --> 01:25:24,960
that we're doing is is a weed nerd you

2044
01:25:21,779 --> 01:25:26,519
know yeah in that regard and so for me

2045
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:28,980
um having been in a bunch of Counter

2046
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:32,040
Culture kind of my whole life I totally

2047
01:25:28,979 --> 01:25:33,959
differentiate between like people who do

2048
01:25:32,039 --> 01:25:36,539
certain substances but are otherwise

2049
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:37,920
like honorable and very good people it's

2050
01:25:36,539 --> 01:25:40,079
just some of the things they decided to

2051
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:43,679
get into happen to not be societally

2052
01:25:40,079 --> 01:25:46,738
acceptable right right and then people

2053
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:48,779
that are like actual criminals

2054
01:25:46,738 --> 01:25:50,218
you know yeah where it's and there's a

2055
01:25:48,779 --> 01:25:52,380
big difference there because there's a

2056
01:25:50,219 --> 01:25:53,698
lot of weird people that are wonderful

2057
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:55,679
people

2058
01:25:53,698 --> 01:25:56,879
um and the only thing that they do wrong

2059
01:25:55,679 --> 01:26:00,960
really they could get them into

2060
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:02,760
significant trouble is marijuana yeah

2061
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:04,139
you know and I and I was looking when I

2062
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:06,480
was listening to you guys talk about

2063
01:26:04,139 --> 01:26:08,219
some of the the the transition into

2064
01:26:06,479 --> 01:26:09,779
powders and stuff like that one of the

2065
01:26:08,219 --> 01:26:12,840
things that I've always thought about is

2066
01:26:09,779 --> 01:26:15,658
that like the weed game or the weed

2067
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:18,539
scene is inherently just like less

2068
01:26:15,658 --> 01:26:20,460
dangerous than that other world like

2069
01:26:18,539 --> 01:26:22,500
when that other world started happening

2070
01:26:20,460 --> 01:26:24,719
maybe it's because of the way it makes

2071
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:26,579
people think or the way people act or

2072
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:30,239
the money was so much bigger

2073
01:26:26,579 --> 01:26:32,399
but it seemed to bring out a lot of like

2074
01:26:30,238 --> 01:26:35,039
negative qualities in people that when

2075
01:26:32,399 --> 01:26:37,379
you were in the weed game existed but

2076
01:26:35,039 --> 01:26:40,198
maybe weren't like maybe weren't like

2077
01:26:37,380 --> 01:26:44,400
accented quite so much right you know

2078
01:26:40,198 --> 01:26:46,500
yep well my friends in Brooklyn they

2079
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:48,779
would oh Sato would open the door and

2080
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:50,880
he'd have a Mach 9 in his hand you know

2081
01:26:48,779 --> 01:26:54,238
and he'd look around and make sure it

2082
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:56,159
was cool to let us in but they had they

2083
01:26:54,238 --> 01:26:58,379
had plenty of weapons but my friend

2084
01:26:56,158 --> 01:27:00,420
Ricky who is still my friend I see him

2085
01:26:58,380 --> 01:27:03,060
when I go to New York he lives in

2086
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:07,079
Brooklyn in the same apartment since 74.

2087
01:27:03,060 --> 01:27:10,139
he uh never ever had a gun the other

2088
01:27:07,079 --> 01:27:13,319
rostas did and but he was he's a

2089
01:27:10,139 --> 01:27:13,920
philosopher he's a real gentle guy

2090
01:27:13,319 --> 01:27:17,460
um

2091
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:22,079
is a good brother of mine I've known him

2092
01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:24,060
40 years now and he uh he's wonderful I

2093
01:27:22,079 --> 01:27:26,039
go have curry goat with him whenever

2094
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:28,920
we're there he takes me a different

2095
01:27:26,039 --> 01:27:31,439
restaurant and

2096
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:32,880
Aki and saltfish they have in these

2097
01:27:31,439 --> 01:27:34,379
those Caribbean neighborhoods you know

2098
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:35,940
you can still get all that the

2099
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:36,719
restaurants

2100
01:27:35,939 --> 01:27:38,879
um

2101
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:41,639
they cater to the people who live there

2102
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:43,739
so it's very cool I love that stuff

2103
01:27:41,639 --> 01:27:45,480
I would say too like for Mendocino

2104
01:27:43,738 --> 01:27:47,519
County there's definitely people that

2105
01:27:45,479 --> 01:27:49,439
have guns that have the intention on

2106
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:51,420
using them you know if they were

2107
01:27:49,439 --> 01:27:54,359
accosted by other humans but there was a

2108
01:27:51,420 --> 01:27:57,300
lot of Growers that had guns on them

2109
01:27:54,359 --> 01:27:59,639
simply because they were in some remote

2110
01:27:57,300 --> 01:28:01,980
ass spot on the hill and if they came

2111
01:27:59,639 --> 01:28:04,980
across a bear with Cubs or a mountain

2112
01:28:01,979 --> 01:28:06,959
lion they didn't want to just die right

2113
01:28:04,979 --> 01:28:09,119
they wanted to have a fighting chance so

2114
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:12,420
there was there was this idea of I'm

2115
01:28:09,119 --> 01:28:15,238
alone in the Deep Woods by myself

2116
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:17,340
and this is not my territory

2117
01:28:15,238 --> 01:28:19,500
and there's bear and Mountain Lion and

2118
01:28:17,340 --> 01:28:23,159
other things that that uh I'm a lot

2119
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:25,439
weaker than even Jaguars yeah yeah and

2120
01:28:23,158 --> 01:28:27,539
the Jaguars yeah I mean even that I mean

2121
01:28:25,439 --> 01:28:29,339
mountain lions this you know Bears

2122
01:28:27,539 --> 01:28:30,840
usually hear

2123
01:28:29,340 --> 01:28:32,699
um mountain lions they they've been

2124
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:34,260
watching you for a while if you ever

2125
01:28:32,698 --> 01:28:35,638
even know that they're there

2126
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:37,139
you know

2127
01:28:35,639 --> 01:28:39,239
um but we would encounter all that that

2128
01:28:37,139 --> 01:28:40,440
kind of stuff like a lot of times all of

2129
01:28:39,238 --> 01:28:41,698
a sudden something would go wrong with

2130
01:28:40,439 --> 01:28:43,738
our water

2131
01:28:41,698 --> 01:28:46,019
and we'd have to walk the water line

2132
01:28:43,738 --> 01:28:47,759
back to like the the cat you know the

2133
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:49,920
the spring box that we had made or

2134
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:54,000
something right and you're walking

2135
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:56,520
through Deep Woods totally alone

2136
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,960
you know and you're in the Deep Woods

2137
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:59,820
and you know you don't have teeth or

2138
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:01,980
Claws and you're not super strong

2139
01:28:59,819 --> 01:29:03,539
so some people would have pistols or

2140
01:29:01,979 --> 01:29:05,339
shotguns or something just to make

2141
01:29:03,539 --> 01:29:07,920
themselves feel okay when they're out

2142
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:10,739
there in the sticks yeah dual dual

2143
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:14,399
Dobermans is is popular with some people

2144
01:29:10,738 --> 01:29:16,619
I know yeah two Dobermans and they were

2145
01:29:14,399 --> 01:29:19,460
you know they went wherever they went

2146
01:29:16,619 --> 01:29:22,319
they had their Dobermans and

2147
01:29:19,460 --> 01:29:26,300
one's name was Tor and the other one was

2148
01:29:22,319 --> 01:29:26,299
Tia tortilla I know

2149
01:29:26,359 --> 01:29:32,460
this one guy and you know they they were

2150
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:34,139
not quite command dogs but they were

2151
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:37,260
close and we tell them to do something

2152
01:29:34,139 --> 01:29:39,119
and they would just do it yeah so and

2153
01:29:37,260 --> 01:29:41,699
they'd sniff out a bear or a bear would

2154
01:29:39,119 --> 01:29:45,479
you know better let your dogs fight the

2155
01:29:41,698 --> 01:29:48,178
bearer than you yeah I mean in my era

2156
01:29:45,479 --> 01:29:50,099
too it became uncomfortable because

2157
01:29:48,179 --> 01:29:53,039
um the penalty for getting caught with a

2158
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:54,840
gun at a at a row was actually like

2159
01:29:53,039 --> 01:29:57,899
quite a bit worse than the grow itself

2160
01:29:54,840 --> 01:30:00,600
yeah then it was kind of like a do you

2161
01:29:57,899 --> 01:30:02,099
risk it even because even if even if you

2162
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:03,900
were gonna beat the case on a medical

2163
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:05,820
thing or something like that later on

2164
01:30:03,899 --> 01:30:08,819
with the grow they'd be like oh no he's

2165
01:30:05,819 --> 01:30:10,799
a hardened criminal armed right he was

2166
01:30:08,819 --> 01:30:13,619
ready to hurt people and we caught him

2167
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:16,260
well you know that's what this is from

2168
01:30:13,619 --> 01:30:19,198
that humbled article and they're they're

2169
01:30:16,260 --> 01:30:23,460
pointing out this machine gun

2170
01:30:19,198 --> 01:30:26,460
yeah and it says Humboldt deputies

2171
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:29,939
sees this menacing array of Weaponry

2172
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:32,279
including an Uzi and an AK-47 along with

2173
01:30:29,939 --> 01:30:34,019
marijuana in raids on Growers you know

2174
01:30:32,279 --> 01:30:35,579
they love to point those out and make

2175
01:30:34,020 --> 01:30:37,739
everybody think that that's what most

2176
01:30:35,579 --> 01:30:40,679
Growers are doing they do absolutely

2177
01:30:37,738 --> 01:30:43,559
they do and some people sadly I mean

2178
01:30:40,679 --> 01:30:45,359
when wherever there's profit involved uh

2179
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:48,000
people get into it for different reasons

2180
01:30:45,359 --> 01:30:50,519
yeah you know and and some of the people

2181
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:52,439
involved certainly were that way I

2182
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:56,900
wouldn't classify it as the majority but

2183
01:30:52,439 --> 01:30:56,899
certainly a percentage you know yeah

2184
01:30:58,340 --> 01:31:04,079
to tell you the truth because everyone

2185
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:06,539
was packing in those the guys carrying

2186
01:31:04,079 --> 01:31:09,238
the beer were packing them I don't know

2187
01:31:06,539 --> 01:31:11,579
just they that's their job they took us

2188
01:31:09,238 --> 01:31:13,079
out to Sushi in walahari and it was some

2189
01:31:11,579 --> 01:31:15,479
of the best sushi I've ever had in my

2190
01:31:13,079 --> 01:31:17,819
life and they

2191
01:31:15,479 --> 01:31:21,000
um they were it was a lieutenant of

2192
01:31:17,819 --> 01:31:23,759
Miguel's he went by the name of Guapo

2193
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:26,340
which means handsome and they took us

2194
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:28,800
out and it was amazing because the guy

2195
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:31,020
who ran it he'd speak in Japanese to his

2196
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:32,699
crew then he'd turn to us and speak in

2197
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:35,400
English perfectly and then he turned and

2198
01:31:32,698 --> 01:31:37,859
talked to these guys in Spanish it was

2199
01:31:35,399 --> 01:31:40,859
quite quite amazing

2200
01:31:37,859 --> 01:31:43,619
yeah it doesn't doesn't fit in with the

2201
01:31:40,859 --> 01:31:46,339
stereotype of the dump of the the dumb

2202
01:31:43,619 --> 01:31:50,760
Stoner right yeah

2203
01:31:46,340 --> 01:31:52,860
oh I mean I think Americans are uh we're

2204
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:55,020
very we're very isolated because we've

2205
01:31:52,859 --> 01:31:56,939
got uh Canadians who also speak English

2206
01:31:55,020 --> 01:32:00,000
for the most part besides the people in

2207
01:31:56,939 --> 01:32:01,799
Quebec uh above us

2208
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,539
um and we've got two oceans next to us

2209
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:06,480
but I think a lot of parts of the world

2210
01:32:03,539 --> 01:32:08,819
are multilingual just because they

2211
01:32:06,479 --> 01:32:10,738
encounter so many different languages as

2212
01:32:08,819 --> 01:32:13,500
part of their daily life and in America

2213
01:32:10,738 --> 01:32:15,079
we are we're kind of broken from that in

2214
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:18,479
a bit you know

2215
01:32:15,079 --> 01:32:20,279
this makes five languages perfectly yeah

2216
01:32:18,479 --> 01:32:22,138
I have an aunt who's Swiss and she

2217
01:32:20,279 --> 01:32:23,639
speaks four

2218
01:32:22,139 --> 01:32:26,699
you know

2219
01:32:23,639 --> 01:32:28,619
and and and so much so yes very much so

2220
01:32:26,698 --> 01:32:30,419
and I I actually kind of regret that

2221
01:32:28,619 --> 01:32:32,819
because I think the long the younger you

2222
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:35,219
learn language the more fluent and fluid

2223
01:32:32,819 --> 01:32:36,420
you are in in speaking and and reading

2224
01:32:35,219 --> 01:32:38,158
it

2225
01:32:36,420 --> 01:32:40,260
um and I think Americans a lot of times

2226
01:32:38,158 --> 01:32:42,599
like uh it does something to your brain

2227
01:32:40,260 --> 01:32:45,179
to be able to speak multiple languages

2228
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:47,659
and communicate you know I I think it's

2229
01:32:45,179 --> 01:32:47,658
super cool

2230
01:32:47,698 --> 01:32:53,638
um yeah so we have the the story of the

2231
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:57,060
Peyote Prince

2232
01:32:53,639 --> 01:32:59,400
can you briefly or maybe not even

2233
01:32:57,060 --> 01:33:02,000
briefly can you tell us what a Peyote

2234
01:32:59,399 --> 01:33:02,000
Prince is

2235
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:06,300
um

2236
01:33:03,420 --> 01:33:08,639
one of they're they're both I don't know

2237
01:33:06,300 --> 01:33:10,980
how they came into this but they both

2238
01:33:08,639 --> 01:33:14,400
knew Sam

2239
01:33:10,979 --> 01:33:15,839
and Sam was a road Chief in the Native

2240
01:33:14,399 --> 01:33:18,960
American Church on the Navajo

2241
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:21,179
reservation and he had a license that

2242
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:23,460
allowed him to go to Northern Mexico

2243
01:33:21,179 --> 01:33:25,380
across the border from Texas and he'd

2244
01:33:23,460 --> 01:33:27,480
come back with a quarter million or a

2245
01:33:25,380 --> 01:33:31,139
half a million of peyote buttons yeah

2246
01:33:27,479 --> 01:33:33,299
for the church where actually

2247
01:33:31,139 --> 01:33:35,699
ninety percent of it wasn't going to the

2248
01:33:33,300 --> 01:33:39,659
church it was going to these two guys

2249
01:33:35,698 --> 01:33:42,059
and they would one lived in Tempe

2250
01:33:39,658 --> 01:33:45,000
two blocks from the police station and

2251
01:33:42,060 --> 01:33:47,940
the other one lived in

2252
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Cottonwood Arizona and

2253
01:33:47,939 --> 01:33:53,460
um that's where I lived at the time

2254
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:56,460
and these were fresh buttons so they had

2255
01:33:53,460 --> 01:33:59,939
to dry them so the guy in Tempe had date

2256
01:33:56,460 --> 01:34:01,980
date racks that they dry dates in and it

2257
01:33:59,939 --> 01:34:04,738
was perfect for peyote and if you went

2258
01:34:01,979 --> 01:34:06,238
into his little old house in Tempe you

2259
01:34:04,738 --> 01:34:08,698
had to turn sideways to go down the

2260
01:34:06,238 --> 01:34:10,259
hallways or go into any room in this

2261
01:34:08,698 --> 01:34:12,599
case it wasn't the stacks of money it

2262
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:16,260
was just stacks of date trades drawing

2263
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:17,460
200 000 buttons and once they drive as

2264
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:20,940
you've if you've seen them they look

2265
01:34:17,460 --> 01:34:22,980
like little flat discs and

2266
01:34:20,939 --> 01:34:24,779
almost like jerky you know like a little

2267
01:34:22,979 --> 01:34:27,479
piece of jerky

2268
01:34:24,779 --> 01:34:32,399
but don't be fooled but until you taste

2269
01:34:27,479 --> 01:34:34,500
it and they would just sell

2270
01:34:32,399 --> 01:34:36,719
this was 19

2271
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:39,779
73.

2272
01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:43,020
when I was first in Arizona and

2273
01:34:39,779 --> 01:34:45,079
um you could get them as low as a nickel

2274
01:34:43,020 --> 01:34:47,400
a button if you bought a certain amount

2275
01:34:45,079 --> 01:34:52,260
yeah and then you could sell them for a

2276
01:34:47,399 --> 01:34:55,738
quarter so in Illinois in Chicago

2277
01:34:52,260 --> 01:34:57,480
all over the United States these two

2278
01:34:55,738 --> 01:34:59,459
guys had friends who who would come to

2279
01:34:57,479 --> 01:35:01,678
Arizona and get them I don't think they

2280
01:34:59,460 --> 01:35:04,380
shipped in UPS or in the mail people

2281
01:35:01,679 --> 01:35:07,380
always took them one of my friends

2282
01:35:04,380 --> 01:35:10,739
gave a guy 200 and he was going through

2283
01:35:07,380 --> 01:35:14,940
custom or through the gate to go to his

2284
01:35:10,738 --> 01:35:18,119
air his flight this was about 19

2285
01:35:14,939 --> 01:35:20,939
80 I'm thinking in Phoenix or maybe it

2286
01:35:18,119 --> 01:35:23,639
was 78 somewhere in there and he looked

2287
01:35:20,939 --> 01:35:25,259
back to see his friend leaving and one

2288
01:35:23,639 --> 01:35:27,119
of the security guys was holding the bag

2289
01:35:25,260 --> 01:35:30,600
of peyote up in the air and looking at

2290
01:35:27,119 --> 01:35:32,279
it and and that and he asked him what

2291
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:35,400
are these and he said they're peyotes

2292
01:35:32,279 --> 01:35:36,800
they're um Cactus seeds and the guy oh

2293
01:35:35,399 --> 01:35:39,479
okay

2294
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:41,820
they didn't even have it wasn't even in

2295
01:35:39,479 --> 01:35:46,439
the Raider in their training yet yeah at

2296
01:35:41,819 --> 01:35:48,539
that point sure the princes were amazing

2297
01:35:46,439 --> 01:35:51,658
um I know both of them still they're

2298
01:35:48,539 --> 01:35:54,658
still both alive and one of them isn't

2299
01:35:51,658 --> 01:35:55,979
as healthy as the other but they were

2300
01:35:54,658 --> 01:35:57,779
you know

2301
01:35:55,979 --> 01:36:00,479
it was just a

2302
01:35:57,779 --> 01:36:03,000
amazing thing that millions and millions

2303
01:36:00,479 --> 01:36:06,119
of buttons they sold and some of them

2304
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:08,460
were diverted to Redway

2305
01:36:06,119 --> 01:36:11,819
who the guy there two of my friends

2306
01:36:08,460 --> 01:36:15,239
would drive 50 to 70 000 buttons to up

2307
01:36:11,819 --> 01:36:20,658
to Northern California and they would

2308
01:36:15,238 --> 01:36:24,658
get turned into mescaline sulfate pure

2309
01:36:20,658 --> 01:36:27,299
and masculine is only like 40 percent I

2310
01:36:24,658 --> 01:36:29,960
think is some number like that of the

2311
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:29,960
alkaloids

2312
01:36:31,279 --> 01:36:35,819
then they even call it mescaline you

2313
01:36:33,658 --> 01:36:38,759
know or whatever but there's many other

2314
01:36:35,819 --> 01:36:41,420
alkaloids that are significant in a

2315
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:44,880
Peyote Journey but when you extract just

2316
01:36:41,420 --> 01:36:47,699
the uh mescaline sulfate then it's a

2317
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:51,359
different journey and I would I did them

2318
01:36:47,698 --> 01:36:54,238
both and I I compared it to

2319
01:36:51,359 --> 01:36:56,519
the mescaline sulfate was like peyote

2320
01:36:54,238 --> 01:36:58,439
without the teacher

2321
01:36:56,520 --> 01:37:01,440
oh

2322
01:36:58,439 --> 01:37:03,599
coyote or experience it there's this

2323
01:37:01,439 --> 01:37:06,599
inner voice

2324
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:08,280
um it's it's hard to describe but you it

2325
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:09,659
seems like it's someone else but it's

2326
01:37:08,279 --> 01:37:12,000
you actually

2327
01:37:09,658 --> 01:37:13,500
just your inner Consciousness you're

2328
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:16,319
hearing your thoughts in a way that it

2329
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:18,179
sounds like it's an external voice wow

2330
01:37:16,319 --> 01:37:20,819
yeah I've never done peyote it's it's

2331
01:37:18,179 --> 01:37:23,340
let me I'm terrified of throwing up so

2332
01:37:20,819 --> 01:37:25,139
well let me let me let me interject

2333
01:37:23,340 --> 01:37:27,300
something here my um

2334
01:37:25,139 --> 01:37:29,819
my experience with peyote is probably a

2335
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:32,639
lot less than yours but I will say that

2336
01:37:29,819 --> 01:37:34,738
the buttons were some of the more bitter

2337
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:37,500
things that I ever intentionally

2338
01:37:34,738 --> 01:37:39,779
swallowed in my life

2339
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:41,939
um so I can see how the masculine pills

2340
01:37:39,779 --> 01:37:44,579
might might go down a little smoother

2341
01:37:41,939 --> 01:37:46,619
for some people because you really have

2342
01:37:44,579 --> 01:37:50,579
to be like okay this is going to be good

2343
01:37:46,619 --> 01:37:53,279
for me oh because they don't taste good

2344
01:37:50,579 --> 01:37:55,679
yeah not as bitter as wormwood but it's

2345
01:37:53,279 --> 01:37:58,019
right up there it's a pretty intense

2346
01:37:55,679 --> 01:38:00,960
bitter I I mean I remember that was

2347
01:37:58,020 --> 01:38:03,360
that's my strongest memory of trying to

2348
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:04,800
consume them was like man

2349
01:38:03,359 --> 01:38:05,880
yeah and

2350
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:08,219
um yeah

2351
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:10,560
there was people doing peyote enemas to

2352
01:38:08,219 --> 01:38:16,880
avoid it going into their gut that was

2353
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:19,260
big in the area mostly a couple ladies

2354
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:21,480
yeah they would make tea and then just

2355
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:23,039
tune them and then you would have this

2356
01:38:21,479 --> 01:38:25,138
wonderful trip and you never throw up

2357
01:38:23,039 --> 01:38:27,960
you don't get any discomfort because you

2358
01:38:25,139 --> 01:38:31,199
hit your gut your stuff yeah I mean like

2359
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:36,359
I've I've done uh Ayahuasca and Brazil

2360
01:38:31,198 --> 01:38:37,579
all the time good Lord I do not but I

2361
01:38:36,359 --> 01:38:40,799
um

2362
01:38:37,579 --> 01:38:42,359
that when you when you are like you know

2363
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:44,699
meeting your creator or whatever and

2364
01:38:42,359 --> 01:38:46,559
you're and you're super fired up

2365
01:38:44,698 --> 01:38:48,658
um having your stomach hurt and having

2366
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:51,060
to purge any which way you have to purge

2367
01:38:48,658 --> 01:38:53,399
is pretty intense yeah and I remember

2368
01:38:51,060 --> 01:38:55,800
when I did it in Brazil I had to run out

2369
01:38:53,399 --> 01:38:57,779
and I had to do it I had to get rid of

2370
01:38:55,800 --> 01:39:01,020
some things out outside of myself in the

2371
01:38:57,779 --> 01:39:04,559
jungle and I really wanted a bright

2372
01:39:01,020 --> 01:39:06,800
American clean bathroom because I felt

2373
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:10,679
so exposed just like running in the dark

2374
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:14,159
and and uh that experience of other

2375
01:39:10,679 --> 01:39:16,380
people yeah South America very intense

2376
01:39:14,158 --> 01:39:18,238
and you know peyote it doesn't it

2377
01:39:16,380 --> 01:39:20,880
doesn't feel good digesting some of

2378
01:39:18,238 --> 01:39:23,459
those alkaloids you were discussing your

2379
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:24,600
body is not ready to digest them

2380
01:39:23,460 --> 01:39:27,198
comfortably

2381
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:29,460
yeah so sometimes

2382
01:39:27,198 --> 01:39:31,079
chocolate masculine and the stuff that

2383
01:39:29,460 --> 01:39:33,239
was being sold on The Hill in Boulder

2384
01:39:31,079 --> 01:39:36,600
was not mescaline

2385
01:39:33,238 --> 01:39:38,759
um even at the low price of five or six

2386
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:40,500
or eight sets a button when this was

2387
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:43,739
being made by that

2388
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:46,020
that um wizard chemist in Northern

2389
01:39:43,738 --> 01:39:48,178
California it it

2390
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:49,860
enough to get you high would cost you

2391
01:39:48,179 --> 01:39:52,440
ten dollars

2392
01:39:49,859 --> 01:39:54,420
so these one and two dollar hits of

2393
01:39:52,439 --> 01:39:58,198
chocolate Mexican were just

2394
01:39:54,420 --> 01:40:00,500
um LSD yeah oh wow mixed in Because

2395
01:39:58,198 --> 01:40:02,960
unless you paid her 10 15

2396
01:40:00,500 --> 01:40:05,520
and the cookbook

2397
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:09,119
it's photos on my

2398
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:11,179
I'm one of my um Chronicles they look

2399
01:40:09,119 --> 01:40:13,920
like Pickup Sticks about an inch long

2400
01:40:11,179 --> 01:40:15,719
sharp needles if you poured them out of

2401
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:18,658
a bottle they would just

2402
01:40:15,719 --> 01:40:20,399
pile up in these sharp needle looks and

2403
01:40:18,658 --> 01:40:21,839
they'd have to be crushed into a powder

2404
01:40:20,399 --> 01:40:25,019
to put them in a cap

2405
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:27,600
we um just ate some of the crystals once

2406
01:40:25,020 --> 01:40:29,100
and but the guy who said you know if

2407
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:32,940
you're measuring this out a good trip

2408
01:40:29,100 --> 01:40:34,980
it'd be 10 to 15 so very few people have

2409
01:40:32,939 --> 01:40:37,500
actually even seen or done mescaline

2410
01:40:34,979 --> 01:40:39,238
sulfate is the point I I agree with you

2411
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:41,219
I would even say in my era when I was

2412
01:40:39,238 --> 01:40:44,279
experimenting with that stuff it's

2413
01:40:41,219 --> 01:40:46,198
almost all relabeled LSD

2414
01:40:44,279 --> 01:40:48,179
um you know it just was

2415
01:40:46,198 --> 01:40:50,279
yep uh it most people haven't

2416
01:40:48,179 --> 01:40:51,779
experienced it because the pa the

2417
01:40:50,279 --> 01:40:53,519
buttons are hard to come by and they

2418
01:40:51,779 --> 01:40:55,859
taste gross

2419
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:57,179
um and and people are just marketing to

2420
01:40:55,859 --> 01:41:00,599
a different thing so they're like oh

2421
01:40:57,179 --> 01:41:02,699
yeah here's some masculine but it um

2422
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:05,460
yeah there's some really good advice you

2423
01:41:02,698 --> 01:41:09,539
gave in one of your stories uh bad Jack

2424
01:41:05,460 --> 01:41:12,179
about juicing buttons can you talk about

2425
01:41:09,539 --> 01:41:16,079
that a little bit well the last time I

2426
01:41:12,179 --> 01:41:21,179
did peyote I Juiced 15 buttons fresh

2427
01:41:16,079 --> 01:41:24,300
buttons and it's happy a lot yes

2428
01:41:21,179 --> 01:41:26,520
Tennessee you eat 10 fresh buttons If

2429
01:41:24,300 --> 01:41:29,520
you could get those down you will have a

2430
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:32,100
really strong Journey oh wow we took 50

2431
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:34,139
and Juiced them and I had a quart bottle

2432
01:41:32,100 --> 01:41:37,860
of beautiful

2433
01:41:34,139 --> 01:41:40,859
emerald green liquid and my friend who

2434
01:41:37,859 --> 01:41:42,539
is the tall fellow my first grow partner

2435
01:41:40,859 --> 01:41:45,059
he drank a third of the bottle and I

2436
01:41:42,539 --> 01:41:47,100
drank two-thirds of the bottle and he

2437
01:41:45,060 --> 01:41:48,900
spent the whole night face down on his

2438
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:52,320
sleeping bed

2439
01:41:48,899 --> 01:41:54,539
um he never moved for like 10 hours and

2440
01:41:52,319 --> 01:41:56,039
I would ask him a question and he

2441
01:41:54,539 --> 01:41:59,300
wouldn't answer and then about three or

2442
01:41:56,039 --> 01:42:01,859
four minutes later he'd go no

2443
01:41:59,300 --> 01:42:04,260
it was a time lag it was really funny

2444
01:42:01,859 --> 01:42:06,479
and I had a fire going and I was saying

2445
01:42:04,260 --> 01:42:08,639
let's go for a hike let's do this and he

2446
01:42:06,479 --> 01:42:11,399
just he was immobilized

2447
01:42:08,639 --> 01:42:12,779
um but he had a good when he woke up in

2448
01:42:11,399 --> 01:42:15,799
the morning he said

2449
01:42:12,779 --> 01:42:18,960
I had the strangest dreams

2450
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:21,060
so he did enjoy it though like the the

2451
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:23,460
do you ever see the movie Young Guns

2452
01:42:21,060 --> 01:42:26,159
with Emilio Estevez and all those young

2453
01:42:23,460 --> 01:42:28,260
kids stars that were there's a scene in

2454
01:42:26,158 --> 01:42:30,479
there where they eat peyote yeah and

2455
01:42:28,260 --> 01:42:34,320
they're the one guy shooting his gun

2456
01:42:30,479 --> 01:42:37,678
wildly out at this mining claim and in

2457
01:42:34,319 --> 01:42:40,799
the what other guys talking and you hear

2458
01:42:37,679 --> 01:42:44,399
his voice but he's not talking and

2459
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:46,320
whoever produced that movie has done

2460
01:42:44,399 --> 01:42:50,099
peyote because they knew about the voice

2461
01:42:46,319 --> 01:42:53,399
yeah it was so clear in that scene I I

2462
01:42:50,100 --> 01:42:56,460
was just amazed that someone had um or

2463
01:42:53,399 --> 01:42:58,738
they had a technical advisor that knew

2464
01:42:56,460 --> 01:43:00,960
that that's how they would do it because

2465
01:42:58,738 --> 01:43:03,118
he was stumbling around and you could

2466
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:06,420
hear this voice talking to him

2467
01:43:03,118 --> 01:43:08,158
yeah it was good I man has tried to get

2468
01:43:06,420 --> 01:43:09,600
me to talk about psychedelics on the

2469
01:43:08,158 --> 01:43:12,118
show and I've kind of kept it weed

2470
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:16,020
focused but I will say that sometimes

2471
01:43:12,118 --> 01:43:17,460
when when things get very intense

2472
01:43:16,020 --> 01:43:20,159
um you're kind of locked in your own

2473
01:43:17,460 --> 01:43:22,560
mind like if your friend was laying down

2474
01:43:20,158 --> 01:43:25,679
what they're experiencing and feeling

2475
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:27,900
and thinking is so intense you just lose

2476
01:43:25,679 --> 01:43:29,639
track of the fact that you have legs and

2477
01:43:27,899 --> 01:43:31,979
arms and you can you can't really

2478
01:43:29,639 --> 01:43:34,260
interact with the world because you have

2479
01:43:31,979 --> 01:43:36,658
so much sensory data that's coming into

2480
01:43:34,260 --> 01:43:38,280
your brain and you're thinking about so

2481
01:43:36,658 --> 01:43:40,019
many things that like all that other

2482
01:43:38,279 --> 01:43:42,840
stuff is extraneous

2483
01:43:40,020 --> 01:43:44,880
to some degree you know and that that's

2484
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:47,300
common I've seen that on mushrooms on

2485
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:50,400
LSD on high doses of different things

2486
01:43:47,300 --> 01:43:51,600
where you just end up kind of in your

2487
01:43:50,399 --> 01:43:53,519
own head

2488
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:55,260
you know it's not a very physical thing

2489
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:58,920
it's a very inward thing

2490
01:43:55,260 --> 01:44:00,239
yeah you know and so

2491
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:03,260
um sometimes that's good and sometimes

2492
01:44:00,238 --> 01:44:05,638
that's bad but it usually is is is is is

2493
01:44:03,260 --> 01:44:07,560
positive long term

2494
01:44:05,639 --> 01:44:10,319
you know as long as you got a safe space

2495
01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:11,639
and you're with friends yep set and

2496
01:44:10,319 --> 01:44:14,880
setting is everything

2497
01:44:11,639 --> 01:44:18,118
yeah and I think I think for uh episode

2498
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:21,179
three we might adventure maybe if you're

2499
01:44:18,118 --> 01:44:24,299
open to it maybe make that more of the

2500
01:44:21,179 --> 01:44:27,179
um full expansive psychological uh

2501
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:29,219
psychedelic aspect of your life the

2502
01:44:27,179 --> 01:44:31,440
spiritual journey that that it brought

2503
01:44:29,219 --> 01:44:33,480
magic to this point because we're

2504
01:44:31,439 --> 01:44:35,158
butting up against the end and I know

2505

2540
01:46:04,698 --> 01:46:09,479
yeah I can say from my perspective that

2541
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:12,420
first Matt will tell you it takes a lot

2542
01:46:09,479 --> 01:46:14,759
to shut me up and I try to talk as

2543
01:46:12,420 --> 01:46:17,279
little as possible but I burn with

2544
01:46:14,760 --> 01:46:20,100
questions almost every third sentence

2545
01:46:17,279 --> 01:46:22,198
that you or raho talk about and I try to

2546
01:46:20,100 --> 01:46:24,960
afterwards write down various questions

2547
01:46:22,198 --> 01:46:26,638
and ideas that I have and so it's really

2548
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:29,819
cool that we're having like this

2549
01:46:26,639 --> 01:46:31,859
multi-stage thing because an hour or two

2550
01:46:29,819 --> 01:46:34,380
after we do these things I get I'm like

2551
01:46:31,859 --> 01:46:36,599
oh my God why didn't I yeah I want to

2552
01:46:34,380 --> 01:46:38,100
follow up on that so bad I gotta

2553
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:40,139
remember we'll do it you know because

2554
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:41,579
there's this offhanded comment and you

2555
01:46:40,139 --> 01:46:43,199
know conversations Go in different

2556
01:46:41,579 --> 01:46:45,179
directions and you don't always get to

2557
01:46:43,198 --> 01:46:48,299
follow up on stuff

2558
01:46:45,179 --> 01:46:51,239
um and we like free-flowing but uh

2559
01:46:48,300 --> 01:46:54,000
there's a wealth there's a wealth of uh

2560
01:46:51,238 --> 01:46:56,759
of of information and just enjoyable

2561
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:59,158
convo here so I'm I'm super stoked well

2562
01:46:56,760 --> 01:47:01,760
remember this for next time pay phones

2563
01:46:59,158 --> 01:47:01,759
and quarters

2564
01:47:08,479 --> 01:47:12,959
if we ever talk about the Psychedelic

2565
01:47:11,039 --> 01:47:15,118
aspect that was my era pay phones and

2566
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:17,939
quarters do you know what a chinger is

2567
01:47:15,118 --> 01:47:20,939
yeah yeah it's a black box it's it's to

2568
01:47:17,939 --> 01:47:23,519
make it yeah so what we did when we were

2569
01:47:20,939 --> 01:47:25,618
on dead tour is we someone discovered

2570
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:27,659
that when you put quarters into a pay

2571
01:47:25,618 --> 01:47:30,599
phone the pay the pay the company

2572
01:47:27,658 --> 01:47:33,420
actually knows what

2573
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:36,900
coin you're putting in by the tone right

2574
01:47:33,420 --> 01:47:39,719
so a dime is One Tone a nickel is One

2575
01:47:36,899 --> 01:47:41,819
Tone a quarter is One Tone somebody got

2576
01:47:39,719 --> 01:47:43,739
the clever idea that you could get these

2577
01:47:41,819 --> 01:47:46,019
little recorders from Radio Shack that

2578
01:47:43,738 --> 01:47:48,299
recorded about 30 seconds and you could

2579
01:47:46,020 --> 01:47:51,960
record them and you could just push

2580
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:53,940
in quarters into the thing and record

2581
01:47:51,960 --> 01:47:57,179
right and then when you go to make a

2582
01:47:53,939 --> 01:47:59,279
long distance call yep you know you we

2583
01:47:57,179 --> 01:48:01,739
would so we would use pay phones and and

2584
01:47:59,279 --> 01:48:03,059
all these different things and like you

2585
01:48:01,738 --> 01:48:04,979
know tell each other where we're gonna

2586
01:48:03,060 --> 01:48:07,199
be at what time of day and what hour and

2587
01:48:04,979 --> 01:48:10,019
call us not so is a boomer he calls

2588
01:48:07,198 --> 01:48:11,839
themers us young men call them black

2589
01:48:10,020 --> 01:48:14,699
boxes

2590
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:16,440
of the mouthpiece of the phone and hit

2591
01:48:14,698 --> 01:48:18,299
play and it would make the sound of the

2592
01:48:16,439 --> 01:48:19,979
coins falling into the machine right and

2593
01:48:18,300 --> 01:48:21,779
eventually eventually the phone company

2594
01:48:19,979 --> 01:48:24,178
caught on to it and you would get an

2595
01:48:21,779 --> 01:48:27,059
operator going sir hello hello sir yeah

2596
01:48:24,179 --> 01:48:30,179
and you would have to bail but

2597
01:48:27,060 --> 01:48:32,159
um you know yeah it's uh that was that

2598
01:48:30,179 --> 01:48:34,020
was before cell phones uh when pay

2599
01:48:32,158 --> 01:48:36,179
phones were everywhere

2600
01:48:34,020 --> 01:48:38,840
nine dollars and ninety cents for three

2601
01:48:36,179 --> 01:48:43,679
minutes to Cali Colombia from New York

2602
01:48:38,840 --> 01:48:45,539
in 1982 and The Operators will be going

2603
01:48:43,679 --> 01:48:48,779
what and you know

2604
01:48:45,539 --> 01:48:51,840
I yeah it was I used a lot of quarters

2605
01:48:48,779 --> 01:48:54,779
but my friend in Manhattan one of the

2606
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:56,760
three brothers of the weed people

2607
01:48:54,779 --> 01:48:59,340
he would buy a thousand dollars worth at

2608
01:48:56,760 --> 01:49:01,020
a time at a bank and he had a cart and

2609
01:48:59,340 --> 01:49:03,179
he'd bring him out and he'd load up his

2610
01:49:01,020 --> 01:49:07,080
car and whenever he'd go out he just put

2611
01:49:03,179 --> 01:49:08,880
like 10 rolls in his pockets because you

2612
01:49:07,079 --> 01:49:10,738
never know how many phone calls you're

2613
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:12,118
gonna have to make and how long because

2614
01:49:10,738 --> 01:49:13,678
he was always calling to different

2615
01:49:12,118 --> 01:49:18,059
states

2616
01:49:13,679 --> 01:49:20,460
um yeah pay phones wow yeah

2617
01:49:18,060 --> 01:49:23,699
uh you know a little spy versus spy on

2618
01:49:20,460 --> 01:49:25,618
that level they were safer you know they

2619
01:49:23,698 --> 01:49:27,599
were safer especially if you rotated and

2620
01:49:25,618 --> 01:49:29,880
didn't use the same ones all the time it

2621
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:31,380
always sucked following not so though

2622
01:49:29,880 --> 01:49:35,039
after a pay phone because they're just

2623
01:49:31,380 --> 01:49:36,900
so sticky I just cannot do it and indeed

2624
01:49:35,039 --> 01:49:39,000
see he's got two in this episode he

2625
01:49:36,899 --> 01:49:41,099
didn't get one last time so he's bummed

2626
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:44,219
it's really practically three with the

2627
01:49:41,100 --> 01:49:46,340
whole boofing thing but yeah yeah I'm

2628
01:49:44,219 --> 01:49:49,920
glad someone remembered that one

2629
01:49:46,340 --> 01:49:52,739
especially messages at the bottom we're

2630
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:55,500
at almost two hours here yeah so Matt if

2631
01:49:52,738 --> 01:49:57,359
you want to plug anything and um and

2632
01:49:55,500 --> 01:49:59,698
we'll keep we'll keep this thing going I

2633
01:49:57,359 --> 01:50:02,399
mean there's a lot of paths we can go

2634
01:49:59,698 --> 01:50:04,259
down and uh we still only scratch the

2635
01:50:02,399 --> 01:50:08,039
surface on some of it yeah I mean we

2636
01:50:04,260 --> 01:50:10,260
made it to map one 1979 so I think yeah

2637
01:50:08,039 --> 01:50:12,719
next round we're gonna go to the 1980

2638
01:50:10,260 --> 01:50:16,079
map and then continue on

2639

2646
01:50:31,560 --> 01:50:36,539
a a game plan

2647
01:50:33,658 --> 01:50:38,158
to limit or Focus discussions that way

2648
01:50:36,539 --> 01:50:39,658
we won't spin off so much we'll be able

2649
01:50:38,158 --> 01:50:41,939
to drill down

2650
01:50:39,658 --> 01:50:43,500
