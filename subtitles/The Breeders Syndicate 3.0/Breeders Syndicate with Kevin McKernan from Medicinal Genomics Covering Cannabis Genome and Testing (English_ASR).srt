00:00:02,649 --> 00:00:09,849
[Music]

2
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:09,849
[Applause]

3
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:23,778
you

4
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,760
Brin did not like my song choice today I

5
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,880
just want to make that clear

6
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:21,150
that was all me there we go me invite

7
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:31,739
you to Kevin it should since then just

8
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:32,939
hit yes lay down we all right this will

9
00:01:31,739 --> 00:01:35,309
work on my phone I guess it's probably

10
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:36,689
gonna be easier than my cell phone you

11
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,090
hear me yeah I can hear you it's a

12
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:42,649
little quiet alright let me try some

13
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,650
music you try some earbuds

14
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,570
you

15
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,349
how's that better yeah yeah it's good

16
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:06,289
it's good just talk loud as loud as you

17
00:02:03,349 --> 00:02:08,750
can I think it's just yeah okay yeah

18
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:12,020
alright how's that perfect thank you for

19
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:14,120
coming on no worries it's about time

20
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:16,430
right now you know with everything going

21
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,230
on with philos the fallout from all that

22
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:21,080
I know people have a lot of questions

23
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:22,518
for four other companies in the industry

24
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,989
they're looking they're looking for

25
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:27,439
someone that they can trust

26
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:32,239
obviously that's that's Benny right okay

27
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:33,039
so I would say that in general don't

28
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,629
trust me

29
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,879
because Trust trust is what has gotten

30
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:40,699
us where we are and I think you should

31
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:43,219
look at people's actions yeah we we saw

32
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:44,689
this coming many years ago and it

33
00:02:43,219 --> 00:02:48,229
happens in every like genomics industry

34
00:02:44,689 --> 00:02:50,239
I've been in people startup company they

35
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:52,129
offer a very low-cost test to entice

36
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,989
people to submit they harvest that data

37
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:55,400
it turns into surveillance capitalism

38
00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:58,519
and then they run off and make a

39
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:01,069
database all of that is is fine I think

40
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:03,019
if you're forward with that and if yes

41
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:05,780
that stated intent and I don't think

42
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:07,189
anyone on this thread is arguing that no

43
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,109
one has a right to breed everyone has a

44
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:10,969
right to grow this plant absolutely they

45
00:03:09,109 --> 00:03:13,820
have a right to go and breed I think it

46
00:03:10,969 --> 00:03:16,039
is the concern on the table is did you

47
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:17,539
have you know in notorious intent did

48
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:18,798
you deceive people in the process of

49
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:21,979
doing this and I think that's probably

50
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:23,569
where most the upper is so how you know

51
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:25,219
how would we not deceive people well

52
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:29,180
don't trust us look at our actions but

53
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:31,669
I'd say since 2016 when we saw this

54
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,980
coming we realized all right we got to

55
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:36,679
build an antidote and the best antidotes

56
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:38,449
to this are to enable point of grow

57
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,980
testing so people don't have to hand

58
00:03:38,449 --> 00:03:42,979
over their DNA so we've been building

59
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:44,479
those tools for the last few years if

60
00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:46,548
folks aren't familiar with them they're

61
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:47,750
there on our website there's a variety

62
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:49,939
of people that actually run them as a

63
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,620
service we don't run serve that service

64
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:53,509
here and because we just don't we're not

65
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,509
comfortable shipping stuff across state

66
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:57,889
lines sure the farm bill has made

67
00:03:56,509 --> 00:03:59,628
changes a little bit we're still trying

68
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:02,119
to get our head around that but we do

69
00:03:59,628 --> 00:04:03,979
accept

70
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,170
samples that can go in the mail if

71
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:08,659
they're if they're non-viable that's the

72
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:10,068
ruling from hemp industry associations

73
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:11,659
versus the DEA you can't have viable

74
00:04:10,068 --> 00:04:11,958
stuff so you have to isopropanol treat

75
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:13,669
them

76
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:15,170
I think finalist is doing the same thing

77
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:17,599
and I don't know whether their stuff is

78
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:19,039
viable or not the I don't think that's

79
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,600
the real issue at hand it's that they

80
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,569
have your genomic DNA and they can do a

81
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,129
lot with that the leaf smears our

82
00:04:23,569 --> 00:04:26,418
lawyers wouldn't let us put those in the

83
00:04:25,129 --> 00:04:28,790
mail because they claim people could

84
00:04:26,418 --> 00:04:30,978
tissue culture them and I've never I've

85
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,510
done cell culture I've not done cannabis

86
00:04:30,978 --> 00:04:33,709
tissue culture so I don't know if that's

87
00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:37,639
true or not we just weren't allowed to

88
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:39,168
do it so I don't I think that's a very

89
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:40,519
thin chance unless people have given

90
00:04:39,168 --> 00:04:42,019
them tissue and seeds that they're

91
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:43,939
actually doing that I think they're real

92
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:47,089
I think it's a bit of a red herring when

93
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:48,860
they say we can resurrect or Jurassic

94
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:51,049
Park your your your strains in DNA

95
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:54,439
that's partially true what they can do

96
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:56,329
is they can take her genomic DNA amplify

97
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:58,038
certain regions of it and transform it

98
00:04:56,329 --> 00:05:01,159
into other plants and that's not part

99
00:04:58,038 --> 00:05:03,379
yeah in fact we saw that happen with Jay

100
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,060
Keasling he actually amplified out all

101
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:07,339
the cannabinoid pathway and put it into

102
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:09,560
yeast and he did this pretty quickly

103
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:11,239
when you consider how long a lot of the

104
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,280
other companies have been trying to get

105
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,319
THC expressing and he's accusing lab

106
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:18,918
came up I took everyone by storm and did

107
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:21,589
this very quickly John page did this -

108
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:23,449
he got cannabic Romijn into yeast and

109
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:26,029
and show them the most recent laughy

110
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:27,379
paper so the cannabinoid genes are very

111
00:05:26,029 --> 00:05:29,269
small they're very easy to clone and

112
00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:31,310
they're very portable so it's possible

113
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:32,870
they can taking scan through all the

114
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:34,970
genomic DNA that they've got and say

115
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:36,288
alright these strains make THC V these

116
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:37,820
ones make that we should call in a

117
00:05:36,288 --> 00:05:39,680
couple of these James into other plants

118
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:41,029
and see what happens so the genomic DNA

119
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,680
I think is the real crocks they have

120
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:45,079
that and to the extent that they're

121
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,610
turning and using that against the

122
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:49,509
manner in which they sold people will

123
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:51,379
dismiss it in you know that goes against

124
00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:53,240
that doesn't help that they had that

125
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:54,560
really broad data release policy because

126
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,550
that probably gives them an out to do

127
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,649
that oh yeah but it's certainly it's

128
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:03,710
certainly challenge Abul I think because

129
00:06:00,649 --> 00:06:06,918
it was done under false pretense there's

130
00:06:03,709 --> 00:06:10,939
even some post we've seen where they've

131
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:12,139
claimed that they they use that when

132
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:13,728
people press them on what are your

133
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:15,139
methods they say oh we use the same

134
00:06:13,728 --> 00:06:16,099
methods in the human genome project

135
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:17,479
well that's lately

136
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,830
false and I can attest to that in a

137
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,810
court of law that those aren't the

138
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:22,819
methods they used and you can tell that

139
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:24,589
by what they submitted into NCBI the

140
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:27,920
sequencers they use didn't even exist

141
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:30,169
back in 1999 so um that that's a clear

142
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,569
stretch and so there's false advertising

143
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:34,520
going on and I think that's where where

144
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:36,469
a lot of the attention should I think

145
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:38,240
she'd be placed the other thing we did

146
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:39,560
outside of trying to decentralize the

147
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,900
testing so people could do it at the

148
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,030
grow the sequencers aren't quite point

149
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:45,649
of grow yet they they maybe in like two

150
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:47,089
or three years with these nanopores but

151
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:49,159
they're still a little noisy and hard to

152
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:52,279
use so if people are still submitting

153
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:54,350
samples in we think you shouldn't trust

154
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:57,109
us you should assume one day we're gonna

155
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:59,780
get either pushed out of business you

156
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:02,509
know step on to the wrong law federal

157
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:03,529
law and get in trouble or that we're or

158
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:04,550
months not let's say the worst case

159
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:06,289
scenario but it's not so it comes and

160
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,990
buys us yeah what are we gonna do then

161
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:11,330
so what we've tried to do is make sure

162
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:13,819
the record of the time stamps of your

163
00:07:11,329 --> 00:07:15,560
material are not in our control and not

164
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:17,480
in anyone's control whoever owns our

165
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,120
business and the way we do that is we

166
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,920
take your sequence and create a hash of

167
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,709
it it's not the whole sequence it's just

168
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:26,990
a hash this is a so it's known as a

169
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:28,909
uni-directional hash function so your

170
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:30,560
sequence file turns into gibberish but

171
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:32,840
it turns it always turns into that

172
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,269
gibberish that fingerprint when you run

173
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:36,649
a program called sha-256 it makes a

174
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:38,629
cryptographic hash out of your data

175
00:07:36,649 --> 00:07:40,429
whenever you present that algorithm with

176
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:42,740
your DNA file it will make that same

177
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:45,410
hash you can't go from the hash back to

178
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:47,150
the sequence though that's impossible so

179
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:49,610
we put that hash in a blockchain

180
00:07:47,149 --> 00:07:51,259
transaction so that it's globally

181
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:52,910
distributed on a public ledger with a

182
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:55,339
timestamp on it that no one in the world

183
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:57,320
can change so if we disappear and you

184
00:07:55,339 --> 00:08:00,019
still have your DNA file you can prove

185
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:02,540
that my sample existed at this

186
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:04,669
particular time and we put that in place

187
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:07,490
from day one on canopy dia back in

188
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:08,870
probably 2014 or so long long before we

189
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:10,629
saw this risk happening we just knew

190
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:13,310
that was that was the right thing to do

191
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:15,439
so those are two things that we're

192
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:18,170
trying to do is we're we're actively

193
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:20,649
building business components that enable

194
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:23,270
point of grow testing as opposed to

195
00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:25,489
trying to horde those assays for ourself

196
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:27,079
to run them for breeding and and those

197
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,819
actions I think speak for themselves you

198
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:32,429
can see I mean Seth Crawford has

199
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:33,960
Viji line out there now because he used

200
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:36,120
some portable tools he used orange

201
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:39,660
photonics so look for CVG and are in our

202
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:41,879
UPC RSA so to the extent that we were

203
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:44,038
ever going to harvest information out of

204
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:45,990
the database our intent is to turn that

205
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:48,210
into a test the growers can buy and use

206
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:50,549
themselves not that we would keep that

207
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:51,030
private and use it as some advantage to

208
00:08:50,549 --> 00:08:54,179
breed

209
00:08:51,029 --> 00:08:55,589
we've never read before we're not it's

210
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:57,059
not our comfort zone we've always built

211
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:59,190
if you look at our history we've always

212
00:08:57,059 --> 00:09:00,899
built genetic assay tools that's our

213
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:02,100
sweet spot that's where we want to stay

214
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:03,929
and we actually think that's a very

215
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,659
attractive market that if we can build

216
00:09:03,929 --> 00:09:09,750
tools that all the breeders can use

217
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:16,409
there's plenty of upside to go around oh

218
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:18,659
sure yeah yeah so I I mean I hope that's

219
00:09:16,409 --> 00:09:21,269
compelling I can tell you in the test

220
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:23,759
the fact that every assay we've built to

221
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:24,870
date we have all privately funded but

222
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:26,009
that doesn't mean we wouldn't find

223
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,840
something I can't predict the future

224
00:09:26,009 --> 00:09:29,580
maybe we find some marker in the data

225
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,889
that's in canopy dia and that turns into

226
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,740
a test people can buy but it won't turn

227
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:36,750
into a proprietary advantage for us to

228
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,180
go and compete with customers that's not

229
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,620
our model in fact yeah I think that's a

230
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:42,839
very dangerous model when you when you

231
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,370
look at businesses whenever you polarize

232
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,210
your investors against your customers

233
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:47,940
your end

234
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:49,769
net result is a lawsuit yeah and so it's

235
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,720
not a healthy practice to do you've got

236
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:53,549
to find synergy between your investors

237
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,550
and your customers to make this work and

238
00:09:53,549 --> 00:09:59,309
if you can't do that you're I think

239
00:09:56,549 --> 00:10:00,689
you're in for a world of hurt yeah yeah

240
00:09:59,309 --> 00:10:02,699
I think I think the main issue with

241
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:04,230
philo States you know some people don't

242
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:07,320
quite understand what's going on and

243
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:09,240
they just here they they assume that

244
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,200
they're stealing genetics and I don't

245
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,970
know if they think they're going into

246
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,560
people's grows like you know pocketing

247
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:16,110
[ __ ] that's not what's right yeah I've

248
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:18,149
I've not heard any of that and and I

249
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:20,039
can't support any speculation I'm

250
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:21,539
certain our lawyers have told us like

251
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:24,029
you can only stick to facts or you'll

252
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:26,909
get libelous claims and yeah I can only

253
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:28,409
talk about the the facts that a few

254
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:29,819
people have provided we didn't even

255
00:10:28,409 --> 00:10:32,129
chime into this until it was three days

256
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,720
late because we felt it wasn't our place

257
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:37,169
to and then once we saw there's enough

258
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:39,810
evidence that others presented we can

259
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:43,189
confirm it but it wasn't our place to

260
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:43,189
snowball this yeah

261
00:10:43,528 --> 00:10:47,309
by first you know going to breeders like

262
00:10:45,568 --> 00:10:49,318
me and saying we're never ever gonna

263
00:10:47,309 --> 00:10:50,638
breed we're never we do not have a

264
00:10:49,318 --> 00:10:53,639
tissue culture lab we will never

265
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:54,959
participate in this and then they went

266
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:56,549
and did that and then came back and

267
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:58,049
called me a liar which which at that

268
00:10:56,549 --> 00:11:00,599
point I was like wait a minute now

269
00:10:58,049 --> 00:11:02,399
now you're yeah yeah yeah that's that's

270
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,528
you know yeah replications everything so

271
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,379
does anyone have that in writing that's

272
00:11:04,528 --> 00:11:10,078
that's the thing they delivered it all

273
00:11:07,379 --> 00:11:11,459
all verbally over the phone stuff like

274
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:12,808
that I don't know anybody that has it in

275
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:17,789
writing and that was what was dangerous

276
00:11:12,808 --> 00:11:20,669
yeah well it's hard to know what's real

277
00:11:17,789 --> 00:11:23,248
now we've seen a lot of double-talk so

278
00:11:20,669 --> 00:11:24,389
it's very hard to look through what

279
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,709
they've said and what they've presented

280
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:27,480
to know what is true and what's not true

281
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:29,578
I do know some things that they're

282
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,159
putting on paper aren't real and that's

283
00:11:29,578 --> 00:11:34,679
a different concern but the information

284
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:36,778
they're putting forward to investors is

285
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:38,599
is not a hundred percent true I mean

286
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:40,889
they've gone out the videos at least

287
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,839
suggested that they have some exclusive

288
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:44,639
right to Illumina tools and I know

289
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:46,559
Illumina really well I mean they tried

290
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,600
to purchase one of our companies in 2008

291
00:11:46,558 --> 00:11:51,719
and I know the CEO Jay Flatley really

292
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,939
well he's since retired but those people

293
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:57,269
are all in the same circle that I've

294
00:11:53,938 --> 00:11:58,679
been in since 1996 and I rang them up

295
00:11:57,269 --> 00:12:00,808
and said hey what is this is the first

296
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:02,878
exclusive license I've ever seen you do

297
00:12:00,808 --> 00:12:04,350
and that it's so it's a running joke in

298
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:05,610
the genomics field that I got an

299
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:07,558
exclusive from Illumina because you

300
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:08,669
can't these guys have been here monopoly

301
00:12:07,558 --> 00:12:10,889
in the space they never give out

302
00:12:08,669 --> 00:12:12,149
exclusives so I rang them up like to the

303
00:12:10,889 --> 00:12:14,818
did you guys give one out in cannabis

304
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:16,470
I'm curious no send us all the

305
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:18,599
informations going straight to legal

306
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:19,889
we're gonna put an end to that so if

307
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,899
he's out there presenting stuff to

308
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:24,688
investors if he has an exclusive he

309
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:26,879
needs to clarify that because he it's

310
00:12:24,688 --> 00:12:28,588
probably true he has his own chip like a

311
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:31,350
fifty thousand case separate that they

312
00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:33,089
designed it's their snips but there's

313
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,319
like 40 million to choose from in the

314
00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:36,089
genome and you can easily make a

315
00:12:34,318 --> 00:12:37,799
different one change one snip and it's a

316
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:40,350
new chip and Illumina doesn't police

317
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:41,698
that and they can't their position is

318
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:43,980
will make anybody a chip and they've

319
00:12:41,698 --> 00:12:45,899
offered to make us one as well we're

320
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,100
looking at it but it's the economy's of

321
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,389
it don't look as good as sequencing to

322
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,389
us right now so we're sticking with

323
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:53,568
sequencing approach but you know that's

324
00:12:51,389 --> 00:12:55,678
something that I think is a little bit

325
00:12:53,568 --> 00:12:57,240
maybe even have the time to fully

326
00:12:55,678 --> 00:12:59,069
explore that or explain

327
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,720
with you know on the stage and investors

328
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,010
were running people being a little too

329
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,450
probe him about the details not

330
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:05,850
exclusive but that's that's not

331
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:08,040
completely true and then there's others

332
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:09,720
on there that are listed as

333
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:12,509
collaborators of theirs and various of

334
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,279
their scientific presentations that

335
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:16,289
we've that we know very well and we've

336
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:17,789
run them up saying is this your are you

337
00:13:16,289 --> 00:13:19,889
really in bed with these guys and the

338
00:13:17,789 --> 00:13:21,449
answer has been no please send it to us

339
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:22,710
and we're gonna send it's illegal and

340
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,790
straighten this out we don't want to be

341
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:26,490
misrepresented in the cannabis industry

342
00:13:23,789 --> 00:13:28,500
so there's there's things on paper that

343
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:30,000
aren't real and what they're saying I

344
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,980
can't discern because they seem to be

345
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,600
giving a completely different story to

346
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:37,019
customers and they are to investors and

347
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:40,250
that leaves us somewhat ok what's true

348
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:50,100
what isn't true it becomes a respective

349
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:53,220
some questions I know so first question

350
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:55,590
from strain Lee says Kevin what prevents

351
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,540
mg medicinal genomics from selling the

352
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:59,759
data you would have acquired through Tet

353
00:13:57,539 --> 00:14:01,559
through the tests from your customers it

354
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:05,460
would be very complicated to demonstrate

355
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:07,369
if you did that's probably true we

356
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:10,050
haven't sold any database licenses today

357
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:11,460
we have had various synthetic biology

358
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:13,500
companies come and ask us if there's

359
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:15,570
anything valuable in the data and

360
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:18,240
unfortunately our answer has been we put

361
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:20,390
it most public so it's the Jamaican

362
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,710
lines you know we put public in 60 days

363
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:24,419
and then a lot of the canopy dia stuff

364
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:26,940
you'll see we put public immediately in

365
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:28,889
blotching hashes so it's hard to sell

366
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:32,190
something when a lot of its online yeah

367
00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:34,289
what you're seeing with FiOS is very

368
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:35,580
different though they they claimed they

369
00:14:34,289 --> 00:14:37,409
were going to be putting this stuff

370
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,580
public to give you guys prior art

371
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:41,490
protections but they were actually

372
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:43,170
hoarding it for two years at a time so

373
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:44,340
they did have the capacity to go and

374
00:14:43,169 --> 00:14:48,509
sell it to other people because it

375
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:49,800
hadn't been necessarily revealed so we

376
00:14:48,509 --> 00:14:51,600
we've not entered into those

377
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:52,889
arrangements I can't say that that would

378
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,740
never happen in the future

379
00:14:52,889 --> 00:14:57,269
but what we do have are two different

380
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,889
layers of data release policies right

381
00:14:57,269 --> 00:15:01,350
now and we're probably going to add a

382
00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:03,419
third after this whole mess just to add

383
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:05,220
a category where people can put data

384
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:07,860
into our database and it can never be

385
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:09,269
used for other analyses right now

386
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,710
there's a public option or your data

387
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:13,559
goes public and the whole world can

388
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:15,420
is it I'd point you actually to there's

389
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:17,099
been seven papers published off of

390
00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:18,719
canopy dia data that we're not authors

391
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,399
on that people just scrape the data and

392
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,410
reanalyzed it and published a paper on

393
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:26,459
it so the premise that a few these I

394
00:15:22,409 --> 00:15:27,809
think there's a few out them off the

395
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:30,480
list and afterwards I can't recall them

396
00:15:27,809 --> 00:15:33,059
off name offhand but people are grabbing

397
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,259
that data and publishing work on it

398
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:35,729
there's probably people grabbing into

399
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:37,460
not publishing work on it and keeping it

400
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:39,090
to yourselves there's a class of

401
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:42,240
customers that want to keep it all

402
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:44,370
private the only challenge we have in in

403
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,259
the privacy events is that we do need to

404
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,909
compare it to everybody else's data in

405
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:51,269
order to deliver the product so if they

406
00:15:47,909 --> 00:15:52,980
want to know if the sample is excuse me

407
00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:54,449
if the sample is related to anything

408
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,009
else in the database well it's hard to

409
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,640
have that data not compare it to

410
00:15:56,009 --> 00:15:58,470
everything else

411
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,350
yeah and still and still deliver the

412
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:03,720
relationships right we're now realizing

413
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:05,250
we need one more tier we're fine you can

414
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,690
do that you can compare it to everything

415
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,669
else in tell us the relationships but we

416
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:10,350
don't want you to then go and sell it to

417
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:12,059
somebody else we want that to remain

418
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:15,330
private so we need another another tier

419
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:18,779
after what we've seen here I can't say

420
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:20,550
that probably this is a rough guess but

421
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:22,289
probably 70% of the data is already

422
00:16:20,549 --> 00:16:24,329
public and only probably 30% of the

423
00:16:22,289 --> 00:16:26,159
people opt to keep it private and they

424
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:27,780
usually convert it to public once they

425
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:29,309
once they talk to more people and get

426
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:32,909
more legal opinions on what they should

427
00:16:29,309 --> 00:16:35,189
do so it's it's a rare case where people

428
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:38,639
are keeping everything entirely private

429
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:40,320
I think one of the biggest flaws I saw

430
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,710
from the beginning of Philo's was that

431
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,240
they they were crowdsourcing data for

432
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:47,550
their legacy strains what they called

433
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,799
their legacy strains meaning like let's

434
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:51,990
say for example chem 91 the original

435
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:54,389
chem 91 strain maybe the more people

436
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:56,279
that submit it the more likely it is to

437
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:58,169
be the original strain when in fact in

438
00:16:56,279 --> 00:17:04,170
cannabis that's not how it works

439
00:16:58,169 --> 00:17:05,670
yeah right have the original well we've

440
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:08,100
been reluctant to police the oral

441
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:09,720
history so what we have all we do is

442
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:11,429
present your relationships and you do

443
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,630
see clusters of like blue dreams they're

444
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:14,279
all next to each other and other ones

445
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,780
that aren't and and yeah I'll just make

446
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:18,599
their their assumptions is what they are

447
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:20,819
we have been reluctant to enable people

448
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:22,049
to edit the names that they send in and

449
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:24,568
that's a big debate in the company

450
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:28,259
whether we should and if we do do that

451
00:17:24,568 --> 00:17:30,629
we record that history because what what

452
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:32,669
can happen in a scenario like this is if

453
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:34,350
you allow people to edit the name after

454
00:17:32,669 --> 00:17:36,210
they see where it lines up to everything

455
00:17:34,349 --> 00:17:38,219
in the galaxy you tend to get a bias

456
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:40,860
toward the samples that seeded the

457
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:43,079
galaxy or the CVS canopy dia if people

458
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:44,729
start to see that oh look I'm I thought

459
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:46,439
it was og but I'm not in the og cluster

460
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,909
I must have mixed something up it splits

461
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,288
blue dream let me rename that one in the

462
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:52,110
galaxy so I don't look like an oddball

463
00:17:49,288 --> 00:17:54,750
in the galaxy that creates I think a

464
00:17:52,109 --> 00:17:57,569
real mess particularly if if the data

465
00:17:54,750 --> 00:18:00,450
that is that is deriving these

466
00:17:57,569 --> 00:18:02,158
relationships is questionable yeah this

467
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:04,379
becomes a chaos generator in the

468
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:05,580
nomenclature system of cannabis yeah and

469
00:18:04,378 --> 00:18:08,638
I do think it's questionable we've

470
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:11,849
downloaded their data and when we try to

471
00:18:08,638 --> 00:18:13,678
run their data through tools it throws a

472
00:18:11,849 --> 00:18:16,319
lot of it out in fact throws all of it

473
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:19,288
out now you can force it through because

474
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:21,178
we know why it's ROS it out so it's gets

475
00:18:19,288 --> 00:18:23,009
in the weeds a little bit but in the

476
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:24,379
best tools for doing sequencing QC come

477
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:27,298
out of the Broad Institute in Cambridge

478
00:18:24,378 --> 00:18:30,689
Brown Institute MIT runs this program

479
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:33,089
it's open source it's called gatk genome

480
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:34,710
analysis toolkit and you take sequencing

481
00:18:33,089 --> 00:18:37,138
data and you run it through here and it

482
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:40,079
screens it from the crap that creates

483
00:18:37,138 --> 00:18:44,849
bad calls and one thing it does not like

484
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:47,939
to see our single PCR implements because

485
00:18:44,849 --> 00:18:49,980
a single PCR amplification event could

486
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:52,590
get the maternal allele or the paternal

487
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:54,149
allele and miss one of the other and so

488
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:56,548
it wants to see at least two different

489
00:18:54,148 --> 00:19:00,119
molecules calling a variance that way it

490
00:18:56,548 --> 00:19:01,679
knows you surveyed both alleles turtle

491
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:03,298
in the paternal line you only have one

492
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,429
you don't know whether you surveyed both

493
00:19:03,298 --> 00:19:07,558
so it has a program in there called the

494
00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:09,120
card that rips anything out that has

495
00:19:07,558 --> 00:19:10,950
only a single amplicon and the entire

496
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:14,099
Philo's assay design is they've got a

497
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:16,169
single amplicon covering allele now the

498
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:17,908
broad wrote this because they sequence

499
00:19:16,169 --> 00:19:19,320
human genomes lots of human genomes

500
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:21,960
other things but humans have been there

501
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:24,720
mainly their focus and human genomes

502
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,940
this problem is tenfold less problematic

503
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,038
we have a variant human human of one

504
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,570
every thousand letters and cannabis is

505
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:32,519
one hundred ninety four letters so when

506
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:35,428
there's that many variants in the genome

507
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:37,500
and you're trying to design PCR primers

508
00:19:35,429 --> 00:19:38,220
to amplify one of the variants what

509
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,259
often happened

510
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,788
as you put these primers on top of other

511
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:45,210
variants you don't know about and

512
00:19:41,788 --> 00:19:46,769
therefore you artificially amplify what

513
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:48,090
your reference was what you thought you

514
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:49,109
were going to sequence from let's say

515
00:19:48,089 --> 00:19:50,668
they probably designed it off a

516
00:19:49,109 --> 00:19:54,779
catatonic cuz they have a nice catatonic

517
00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:56,100
reference yeah so in their design they

518
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:57,629
may have designed these primers so that

519
00:19:56,099 --> 00:19:59,129
they fall in these variants they amplify

520
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:00,600
only the modern line and up the father

521
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:02,549
line and they get it they get a skewed

522
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:04,109
tree now you present the community with

523
00:20:02,548 --> 00:20:05,579
these skewed trees without any

524
00:20:04,109 --> 00:20:07,349
peer-review on the methods you start

525
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:09,418
calling it certifications and you enable

526
00:20:07,349 --> 00:20:11,038
people to edit the actual names of the

527
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:11,429
strains and you have a [ __ ] show in your

528
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:14,190
hands

529
00:20:11,429 --> 00:20:15,330
oh yeah and so I don't believe anything

530
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,159
that comes out of that system because

531
00:20:15,329 --> 00:20:18,480
the methods behind it have never made it

532
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:20,340
through peer review and I don't think

533
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,409
they will because there's many papers

534
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:24,720
that have been published warning against

535
00:20:22,409 --> 00:20:27,330
doing this exact thing that you really

536
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,409
cannot do single amplicon variance and

537
00:20:27,329 --> 00:20:29,879
you really shouldn't do it in

538
00:20:28,409 --> 00:20:31,710
polymorphic genomes because you're gonna

539
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,200
get all types of reference bias when you

540
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:35,788
do this I so I think that's the reason

541
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,980
why their methods aren't peer reviewed

542
00:20:35,788 --> 00:20:39,690
all the other parties who have arguably

543
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,700
been working off of less funding than

544
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:43,620
they have have gotten papers out you see

545
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,690
Nolan Cain published lon we submitted

546
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:47,489
some data to that paper steep hill put

547
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:50,490
data in there mary jean put data in

548
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:52,109
there you've seen Phillipe Henry put

549
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:53,640
some things out you've seen and andia

550
00:20:52,109 --> 00:20:55,408
publishes all the time on their methods

551
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,030
I mean almost every other genetic

552
00:20:55,409 --> 00:21:00,720
provider out there has their methods

553
00:20:57,029 --> 00:21:02,158
published Soilers another one and so you

554
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:06,000
can review whether or not there's any

555
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:07,559
artifacts going on in the data so this

556
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,859
leads me to what I'm most concerned

557
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:14,399
about is that why did they hold the data

558
00:21:10,859 --> 00:21:15,658
back and for so long were they that

559
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,250
understaffed that they couldn't put the

560
00:21:15,659 --> 00:21:18,990
data public I don't think so

561
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:21,869
it takes about it it is hard to put data

562
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:23,609
in ncbi can take a whole day to have a

563
00:21:21,869 --> 00:21:25,529
bioinformatics person get burnt up

564
00:21:23,609 --> 00:21:29,009
putting that data into ncbi but it

565
00:21:25,529 --> 00:21:30,710
doesn't take two years and what else

566
00:21:29,009 --> 00:21:34,319
what are the data they have I mean they

567
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:37,048
are talking about a 50k zip array from

568
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:38,460
Illumina quite publicly well they're

569
00:21:37,048 --> 00:21:40,379
asked they only sequence a couple

570
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:42,900
thousand sniffs one to two thousand so

571
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,940
how did they design the 50k snip array

572
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,860
if they were only surveying two thousand

573
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,659
snips and everyone's samples they sent

574
00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:50,819
in where did they design the other 48

575
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:51,990
thousand from well they probably had the

576
00:21:50,819 --> 00:21:54,149
sequence more territory

577
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:57,390
every one sample to intelligently design

578
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:59,850
that ship or the chip is unintelligently

579
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:01,710
designed and it's perhaps not a very

580
00:21:59,849 --> 00:22:05,759
good breeding tool one of those two

581
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:08,370
things is true so it it does lead you to

582
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:09,420
question how much have they been putting

583
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:11,579
public and how much have they been

584
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:12,960
keeping private and what type of Vantage

585
00:22:11,579 --> 00:22:14,460
doesn't necessarily give them a breeding

586
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,450
program those are you know open

587
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,269
questions I don't think one has the

588
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:25,549
answer to actually really good questions

589
00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:25,549
to ask okay this is a great a great

590
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:30,210
Kevin will this data hurt or help

591
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:33,420
cannabis in the long term in your

592
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:35,400
opinion the whole not necessarily by

593
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:39,330
Llosa's what they're doing but overall

594
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:41,850
the breeding using these tools using

595
00:22:39,329 --> 00:22:44,159
these tools in general I think the tools

596
00:22:41,849 --> 00:22:46,969
will help I do think we need a chapter

597
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:49,830
out of the crypto space here of

598
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:53,640
decentralizing putting all of the data

599
00:22:49,829 --> 00:22:55,379
in one honeypot database where let's be

600
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,450
frank the security policy there was not

601
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:59,429
very good I mean I don't know people

602
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:01,170
have seen the threads but it Bert it was

603
00:22:59,429 --> 00:23:03,090
burping out admin password throughout

604
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:04,170
the years so we know we got it and we're

605
00:23:03,089 --> 00:23:05,579
their competitor were the last people

606
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:08,670
that should get their admin password but

607
00:23:05,579 --> 00:23:10,799
it ended up on our green one day oh that

608
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:12,390
means you have a collection of

609
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,859
everybody's data where the customers

610
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:15,480
have don't get to see the data for two

611
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:18,119
years but the people who got that admin

612
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:20,700
password probably did so that's the

613
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:22,889
worst possible scenario for getting a

614
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,940
prior art as you held it from the people

615
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:25,650
who paid you for it

616
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:28,620
and yet you were sloppy with the keys

617
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:32,370
and let other people get in that is not

618
00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:34,649
a prior art system yes yes yeah yeah

619
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:36,479
that I didn't quite recognize that

620
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,800
password until I went back and looked at

621
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,360
that after all this went down I'm like

622
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:42,119
wait a minute let me look at that email

623
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:43,979
oh my god so yeah if those who know the

624
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:45,269
password that bit burped out I don't

625
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:47,910
know if it's a real password or not and

626
00:23:45,269 --> 00:23:49,769
this was many years ago and I never put

627
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:51,990
this stuff public because it's it's it's

628
00:23:49,769 --> 00:23:54,690
bad policy to put someone else passwords

629
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:56,579
public but it was been 2 years and I

630
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:58,470
gave it to Mowgli privately and I'm

631
00:23:56,579 --> 00:24:00,240
assuming he went and changed all those

632
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:03,269
things the next day when he realized his

633
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,099
competitor had it he didn't I'm sorry

634
00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:08,819
that's a bad policy to be not too

635
00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:11,189
yes right I tell you what it is but in

636
00:24:08,819 --> 00:24:12,720
that list was the password was Otto

637
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:15,660
flower allele and I think someone else

638
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,819
that's right maybe some grown maids

639
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:21,750
pointed out that it the username was

640
00:24:17,819 --> 00:24:26,879
forged like forgery it's like those are

641
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:28,619
bad names so when they say we weren't

642
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,770
looking for anything in your data I mean

643
00:24:28,619 --> 00:24:32,939
yeah you made the Helen Keller would

644
00:24:31,769 --> 00:24:41,158
have been a better name you know not

645
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:42,630
Otto flower yeah but again that's

646
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:45,419
speculative I don't want to get involved

647
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:46,860
in too much speculation but I don't

648
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:49,190
think I need to speculate because the

649
00:24:46,859 --> 00:24:52,019
videos that were put out pretty much

650
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:53,759
show the Jekyll and Hyde of this right

651
00:24:52,019 --> 00:24:54,929
there's the investor side of the story

652
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:56,519
which this date is extraordinarily

653
00:24:54,929 --> 00:24:58,350
valuable we're gonna rule the world and

654
00:24:56,519 --> 00:24:59,519
then there's the customer side saying

655
00:24:58,349 --> 00:25:01,829
the data is all garbage don't worry

656
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:03,418
about it those two you can't square that

657
00:25:01,829 --> 00:25:06,000
circle very easily and I think that

658
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:10,409
video does you know it's basically the

659
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:13,319
nail in the coffin this whole time you

660
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:14,929
know people come to me for dirt on FiOS

661
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:17,339
or whatever because I've been I've been

662
00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:18,840
researching them for a long time and it

663
00:25:17,339 --> 00:25:20,788
padded out with them several times but

664
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:22,889
the fact of the matter is I don't even

665
00:25:20,788 --> 00:25:25,589
have to say anything from my opinion I

666
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:26,940
just show what they say and that's it

667
00:25:25,589 --> 00:25:28,769
and that's where I've left it and I

668
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:31,110
think that's been damaging enough you

669
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:32,970
know yeah unfortunately I mean it would

670
00:25:31,109 --> 00:25:34,589
have been nice to have everything on the

671
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:36,029
up-and-up from the beginning that would

672
00:25:34,589 --> 00:25:38,009
have been ideal but it's not it's not

673
00:25:36,029 --> 00:25:39,960
necessarily the case I like what you're

674
00:25:38,009 --> 00:25:42,269
saying about decentralization obviously

675
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:44,370
that's that's the goal for for having a

676
00:25:42,269 --> 00:25:47,119
company that's successful yeah I mean so

677
00:25:44,369 --> 00:25:50,428
there's maybe two things to consider is

678
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:52,349
you know I've seen a lot of growers like

679
00:25:50,429 --> 00:25:54,000
that are early on and they don't want to

680
00:25:52,349 --> 00:25:55,439
buy all their own sequencers yet and

681
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,269
that you know they either outsource to

682
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,210
us or other people and some will even go

683
00:25:57,269 --> 00:26:01,679
to their local universities because it's

684
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:03,659
unlikely University is gonna turn around

685
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,830
and breed on you right and so they'll

686
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:06,510
get the university so we're trying to

687
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:08,428
build tools that some universities could

688
00:26:06,509 --> 00:26:10,319
run that way you know we're not

689
00:26:08,429 --> 00:26:11,548
necessarily the data hoarding risk that

690
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:13,859
people may consider because we were

691
00:26:11,548 --> 00:26:15,450
understand after this went down no one's

692
00:26:13,859 --> 00:26:17,009
gonna trust anybody the sequence their

693
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:18,659
stuff I mean but we hope we can convince

694
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:19,558
you these blockchains work but have

695
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:21,419
time when we tell people about

696
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:23,940
blockchains our eyes glaze over and say

697
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:25,580
I don't get it go away so we understand

698
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,048
that's not gonna satisfy everybody and

699
00:26:25,579 --> 00:26:30,178
so we're gonna start building tools that

700
00:26:28,048 --> 00:26:32,098
may assist universities to be able to

701
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:33,929
sequence for you because frankly they're

702
00:26:32,098 --> 00:26:35,638
gonna have a big learning curve if you

703
00:26:33,929 --> 00:26:37,139
went to one today and said here's my DNA

704
00:26:35,638 --> 00:26:38,519
they're there they're gonna stumble on

705
00:26:37,138 --> 00:26:39,778
whether they can take it in or not or

706
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:41,819
whether it violates neither federal

707
00:26:39,778 --> 00:26:43,798
grants once they get past that hurdle

708
00:26:41,819 --> 00:26:44,848
they're gonna they're gonna be some

709
00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:46,048
bling on the fact they've never sequence

710
00:26:44,848 --> 00:26:47,339
genome before and it's very hard to

711
00:26:46,048 --> 00:26:48,929
sequence and we have a lot of that

712
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:50,638
worked out into kits where they could

713
00:26:48,929 --> 00:26:52,979
run these kits under their sequencers

714
00:26:50,638 --> 00:26:54,358
and get data that's very similar to

715
00:26:52,979 --> 00:26:56,669
other data that's gonna be that's been

716
00:26:54,358 --> 00:26:59,308
made before and then they could compare

717
00:26:56,669 --> 00:27:01,259
it excuse me the canopy dia data the

718
00:26:59,308 --> 00:27:03,388
biggest challenge we've had in PT

719
00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:05,339
testing in cannabis genomics is that for

720
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:06,689
the first few years of this every

721
00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:07,499
service provider was running with

722
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:09,149
sequencing a different part of the

723
00:27:07,499 --> 00:27:10,558
genome so it's really difficult to cross

724
00:27:09,148 --> 00:27:12,778
comparing ones data because you're not

725
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:16,319
covered sequencing the same basis yeah

726
00:27:12,778 --> 00:27:18,538
about two years ago we changed that and

727
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:20,339
we downloaded the file of data we

728
00:27:18,538 --> 00:27:22,079
downloaded the Kane data and the soiler

729
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:23,970
data and then we built a panel that

730
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:25,259
covers at least 50 snips and all of

731
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:28,409
those things so that we could try to

732
00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:29,909
triangulate you know if you sequence on

733
00:27:28,409 --> 00:27:31,429
our panel you can figure out what it's

734
00:27:29,909 --> 00:27:34,289
closest to and all the other data sets

735
00:27:31,429 --> 00:27:36,450
but we need more of that and so we're

736
00:27:34,288 --> 00:27:37,710
we're looking into ways to enable a lot

737
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:39,359
of the other universities to pick this

738
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:40,710
up that way it's it's somewhat

739
00:27:39,358 --> 00:27:42,509
decentralized if you don't like the

740
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:43,769
university in your state maybe you send

741
00:27:42,509 --> 00:27:45,329
it to another one and and then it

742
00:27:43,769 --> 00:27:47,909
doesn't become this surveillance

743
00:27:45,329 --> 00:27:50,098
capitalism approach in most other

744
00:27:47,909 --> 00:27:52,739
markets sequencing is very commoditized

745
00:27:50,098 --> 00:27:54,509
there isn't this this window for someone

746
00:27:52,739 --> 00:27:56,098
to do this because you can't shop around

747
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:57,538
for sequencing providers and and

748
00:27:56,098 --> 00:27:59,278
therefore they don't get to collect

749
00:27:57,538 --> 00:28:01,019
large hordes of your data you can send

750
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:02,519
one strain to one place and one to

751
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:05,909
another and one to another and and and

752
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:07,888
this means the the aggregation of that

753
00:28:05,909 --> 00:28:09,539
data doesn't fall into one person's

754
00:28:07,888 --> 00:28:10,678
hands who can be co-opted to sell it to

755
00:28:09,538 --> 00:28:13,919
a party you're not you're not thrilled

756
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:16,379
with that that does lead me to a couple

757
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,849
points people should be aware of this is

758
00:28:16,378 --> 00:28:19,829
the sequencing test that the people are

759
00:28:17,848 --> 00:28:22,229
running at Philo's is the most expensive

760
00:28:19,829 --> 00:28:24,839
sequencing per base I think of any test

761
00:28:22,229 --> 00:28:27,749
in the world you're only getting 300,000

762
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:29,728
letters out of this for about $285 to

763
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:31,470
put that in perspective and you might

764
00:28:29,729 --> 00:28:32,669
get 2,000 snaps one to two thousand

765
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:34,618
snaps the 23

766
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:37,440
test you get for like 99 bucks or

767
00:28:34,618 --> 00:28:41,428
surveying 1 - like 5 million snips right

768
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:43,980
so there is this is a complete ride when

769
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:47,249
it comes to sequencing costs even though

770
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:49,319
the tests that we run are sequencing 10

771
00:28:47,249 --> 00:28:51,179
times more than ten times the territory

772
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:55,019
of the Philo's test for nearly the same

773
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:57,350
price so there's a very heavy price

774
00:28:55,019 --> 00:29:00,358
that's being paid to give them your data

775
00:28:57,349 --> 00:29:02,668
yeah and you're giving them data to

776
00:29:00,358 --> 00:29:04,589
potentially be sold was what it looks

777
00:29:02,669 --> 00:29:05,580
like it's yeah in the data they're

778
00:29:04,589 --> 00:29:07,108
putting public I don't think it's very

779
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:09,028
valuable it's really the fact that they

780
00:29:07,108 --> 00:29:11,220
have the genomic DNA they've got

781
00:29:09,028 --> 00:29:15,628
presentations out that are public now

782
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:18,329
that demonstrate them cherry picking 99

783
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:19,648
samples out of the galaxy they have this

784
00:29:18,329 --> 00:29:23,009
structure thing that tells you whether

785
00:29:19,648 --> 00:29:24,358
it's like Barry or I can't remember all

786
00:29:23,009 --> 00:29:26,099
the names so they they they categorize

787
00:29:24,358 --> 00:29:28,019
things into six buckets and those

788
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:29,398
buckets are somewhat fictitious based on

789
00:29:28,019 --> 00:29:30,720
what you tell the program to look for

790
00:29:29,398 --> 00:29:32,608
you give it a values - how many

791
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,139
populations you think are there and it

792
00:29:32,608 --> 00:29:35,489
spits out it's like a consultant that

793
00:29:34,138 --> 00:29:36,868
tells you what time it is you you know I

794
00:29:35,489 --> 00:29:37,858
think there's six populations it gives

795
00:29:36,868 --> 00:29:39,898
you a pretty picture with six

796
00:29:37,858 --> 00:29:42,778
populations but anyway they use that

797
00:29:39,898 --> 00:29:45,538
data to cherry-pick 99 samples are gonna

798
00:29:42,778 --> 00:29:47,788
do whole genome sequencing on so when

799
00:29:45,538 --> 00:29:49,589
they say they're not using the galaxy to

800
00:29:47,788 --> 00:29:50,999
do the breeding program I think that

801
00:29:49,589 --> 00:29:52,648
project right there begins to blur that

802
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:54,419
line you're you're using the fact that

803
00:29:52,648 --> 00:29:57,358
the galaxy to figure out what the

804
00:29:54,419 --> 00:30:00,419
sequence - really extreme depth to start

805
00:29:57,358 --> 00:30:02,638
your breeding program yeah and that to

806
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:04,259
me looks as if it is utilizing the data

807
00:30:02,638 --> 00:30:05,849
for the breeding program and that's

808
00:30:04,259 --> 00:30:07,048
that's that's that's been publicly

809
00:30:05,849 --> 00:30:08,099
presented they also have publicly

810
00:30:07,048 --> 00:30:11,519
presented that they're looking for the

811
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:12,599
BTB D allele the the CBD allele which is

812
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:13,769
already out there I mean South

813
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:15,748
Crawford's already bought it and used

814
00:30:13,769 --> 00:30:18,028
our kit we have a we have a marker that

815
00:30:15,749 --> 00:30:19,950
tracks that and we didn't turn that into

816
00:30:18,028 --> 00:30:22,169
a breeding operation we turned that into

817
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:24,389
a kit that anyone could buy and and and

818
00:30:22,169 --> 00:30:25,710
any breeder could use and he's done it

819
00:30:24,388 --> 00:30:26,998
successfully I wouldn't know how to do

820
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:30,149
it successfully because I know how to

821
00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:32,730
breed but he's managed to know if I can

822
00:30:30,148 --> 00:30:35,099
track that which samples do not have any

823
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:38,909
CBD alleles and I'd start with type 3

824
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:40,769
plants and they're all CBD negative that

825
00:30:38,909 --> 00:30:42,960
means they're probably type 4 or type 5

826
00:30:40,769 --> 00:30:44,308
then one of those two and he was able to

827
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,529
figure that out with orange photonics

828
00:30:44,308 --> 00:30:50,339
that it was in fact a type a type 4

829
00:30:46,529 --> 00:30:52,559
and and move on with it so but

830
00:30:50,339 --> 00:30:53,730
nevertheless they're picking samples I

831
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,230
don't know where they got the samples

832
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:56,279
that's the question I can't answer they

833
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:58,019
have them listed in some of these

834
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:59,220
presentations they may have got they may

835
00:30:58,019 --> 00:31:01,139
have sourced them from Spencer's you

836
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,880
know I don't know but yeah they're

837
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:04,380
they're clearly hunting for markers for

838
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,540
the breeding program and it looks as if

839
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:09,360
it's being guided by their historical

840
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:11,519
data here's here's here's a good one and

841
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:13,379
I know you briefly touched on it you can

842
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:17,039
choose to answer it or not it is kind of

843
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:18,390
a personal opinion question it's

844
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:22,980
referring to what Bodie asked the other

845
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:24,990
night about chimera okay some data on

846
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:28,730
chimera cuz I know a lot of us like I

847
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:31,980
grew up I grew up like that was chimera

848
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:33,450
walks in and Clark we're the end-all

849
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:35,099
be-all when it came to breeding and

850
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:37,860
slowly over the years you learn things

851
00:31:35,099 --> 00:31:40,469
and you realize they may not be who I

852
00:31:37,859 --> 00:31:42,359
who I hoped they would be so I I have to

853
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:44,220
say the first three people that

854
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:47,369
contacted me after we put chem dog

855
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:50,990
public in 2011 were those three people

856
00:31:47,369 --> 00:31:54,000
in that exact order and I met and I met

857
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:55,829
Robert Clark and Dave Watson you know

858
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,490
the nice enough to host me over there in

859
00:31:55,829 --> 00:32:01,740
Amsterdam and show me around we never

860
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:03,059
came to any agreement on I think they

861
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:04,500
wanted to do something like Philo's back

862
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:06,299
then but we weren't funded and that was

863
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,559
early it was the laws in the United

864
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:09,629
States weren't really favorable at that

865
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:10,769
time so we got to put mgc on ice for a

866
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:13,020
little bit while we waited for the Cole

867
00:32:10,769 --> 00:32:17,670
memo to get you know more clarity on it

868
00:32:13,019 --> 00:32:18,809
but so I spent a lot of time with Brian

869
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:20,730
Lee and a lot of the ICRS

870
00:32:18,809 --> 00:32:22,710
meetings and I've had a great time with

871
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:24,269
him in person I I think I'm an [ __ ]

872
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:26,970
on mine I think it's becomes constant

873
00:32:24,269 --> 00:32:30,480
and I just pissed him off online in his

874
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:33,870
qualities but he's he is one of the

875
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:36,390
people that convinced me to back off on

876
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:37,769
FiOS in fact he got me to apologize to

877
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:39,990
them at an emerald couple couple years

878
00:32:37,769 --> 00:32:42,900
ago for calling them out on this so in

879
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:44,849
2016 there's a lot of news on our

880
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:47,310
Facebook site and arguably back then it

881
00:32:44,849 --> 00:32:50,759
was not as we didn't have the videos you

882
00:32:47,309 --> 00:32:53,639
have now we had information from people

883
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:54,839
well I I had the history of big scenes

884
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,950
you know Matt companies get billed this

885
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:58,379
is what always happens so I was

886
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:59,789
naturally suspicious and then I saw that

887
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,269
they weren't putting any data public but

888
00:32:59,789 --> 00:33:01,348
telling you

889
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:03,149
but if they were saving them from

890
00:33:01,348 --> 00:33:04,408
Monsanto by putting a star on the galaxy

891
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:06,358
star on the galaxy doesn't give you any

892
00:33:04,409 --> 00:33:08,639
prior art the USPTO can't do [ __ ] with

893
00:33:06,358 --> 00:33:10,798
that they if you look at the patents

894
00:33:08,638 --> 00:33:13,019
they issue they talk about the be TPD

895
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:14,598
allele which is a genotype and they talk

896
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:17,098
about chemo types those are the two

897
00:33:14,598 --> 00:33:19,678
languages the USPTO uses to evaluate

898
00:33:17,098 --> 00:33:21,178
strains right now might change it might

899
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,559
get broader in the future but the the

900
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:24,209
precedents that's been set with a

901
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:26,729
biotech LLC patent is that you need a

902
00:33:24,209 --> 00:33:28,669
genotype in any chemo type free for us

903
00:33:26,729 --> 00:33:30,450
to understand what it is you have

904
00:33:28,669 --> 00:33:31,619
there's some lawyers that may have

905
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:32,940
better information on this than me

906
00:33:31,618 --> 00:33:34,228
Reggie might be a good person or Dale

907
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:36,028
Han might be a good person to talk to on

908
00:33:34,229 --> 00:33:38,389
this because they're more versed in that

909
00:33:36,028 --> 00:33:41,308
and some of what's allowable there but

910
00:33:38,388 --> 00:33:43,678
so we made a noise and we probably

911
00:33:41,308 --> 00:33:46,499
weren't polite about it and a bunch of

912
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:48,209
people kind of yelled at us about it and

913
00:33:46,499 --> 00:33:49,828
convinced us to kind of shut up you're

914
00:33:48,209 --> 00:33:52,379
you're being a bad community member here

915
00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:55,528
you don't have enough hard data on this

916
00:33:52,378 --> 00:33:59,158
and you're being paranoid and then over

917
00:33:55,528 --> 00:34:00,838
time we've after we apologize I should

918
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:03,570
say I apologize about this

919
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:06,569
I saw the behavior didn't change they

920
00:34:03,569 --> 00:34:08,699
put out 845 samples a couple years ago

921
00:34:06,569 --> 00:34:10,528
and another two years went by nothing

922
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:12,148
else showed up and I was like well I

923
00:34:10,528 --> 00:34:14,190
thought we came to agreement that if

924
00:34:12,148 --> 00:34:16,828
you're gonna be open about this you had

925
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:19,278
to be open and not use the cover of the

926
00:34:16,829 --> 00:34:23,519
OCP to act like are open when you're not

927
00:34:19,278 --> 00:34:24,809
and that that's what kind of triggered

928
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:26,519
us to get back involved when we saw all

929
00:34:24,809 --> 00:34:27,929
this go down like Oh God we're kind of

930
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:29,668
complicit in this because we were

931
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:32,010
barking about it a few years ago and

932
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:36,480
then we backed off and now look what's

933
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:40,589
happened so so yeah I don't know I don't

934
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:41,909
to say I really spaced long enough to to

935
00:34:40,588 --> 00:34:44,099
really weigh in on those three

936
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:45,690
individuals and and where they live

937
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:47,369
you know weigh them in cannabis face but

938
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:50,099
you know and I know Ryan's had some

939
00:34:47,369 --> 00:34:51,720
fingerprints on on the biotech LLC stuff

940
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:54,149
and so he's generally been thoroughly

941
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:56,308
supportive of patents and I'm not anti

942
00:34:54,148 --> 00:34:58,288
patent either I generally I generally

943
00:34:56,309 --> 00:35:00,778
think they're evil but I think they

944
00:34:58,289 --> 00:35:02,039
exist and because they exist if you put

945
00:35:00,778 --> 00:35:05,548
your head in the sand over the rules of

946
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:07,380
that game you're gonna get screwed so

947
00:35:05,548 --> 00:35:10,409
you got to learn it and you got to play

948
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:11,700
the game at least defensively and if you

949
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:13,409
have enough money you might be able to

950
00:35:11,699 --> 00:35:14,189
afford the offensive tracks but a lot of

951
00:35:13,409 --> 00:35:16,379
companies

952
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:17,670
many years ago we're so new in the space

953
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:19,559
they couldn't afford the offensive

954
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:21,869
tracks offensive tracks can also be 20

955
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:23,250
to 30 grand a pack you can probably get

956
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:25,529
the Provisionals like chucked in for a

957
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:27,030
couple grand but a year later or 18

958
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:28,320
months later you're gonna be held to

959
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:30,060
make a decision on whether you're gonna

960
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,210
go full boat on this thing and those are

961
00:35:30,059 --> 00:35:35,820
gonna cost you more like 20 grand so

962
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:37,650
defensive IP seemed to be the cheap way

963
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:39,570
to start and that's what we tried to

964
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:41,250
enable with canopy do is get things on

965
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,840
broad chains got things public so you at

966
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:44,190
least don't get Submarine by somebody

967
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,829
else you can at least say my [ __ ]

968
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:49,019
existed here and it's not some [ __ ]

969
00:35:46,829 --> 00:35:50,880
site that might disappear there's

970
00:35:49,019 --> 00:35:52,139
actually it's we've got something on an

971
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,579
immutable ledger that seems to have a

972
00:35:52,139 --> 00:35:55,829
financial reason to exist for a long

973
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:57,119
period of time and the site's not gonna

974
00:35:55,829 --> 00:35:58,590
go down and my prior art it's not gonna

975
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,210
disappear I think that's the biggest

976
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:03,750
issue the USPTO has in the cannabis

977
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:05,010
space is the site's go down because

978
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:06,659
there's all the censorship on the

979
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:08,220
internet over cannabis sites and so you

980
00:36:06,659 --> 00:36:09,839
can put your stuff online and find it

981
00:36:08,219 --> 00:36:11,279
get wiped off my Facebook or something

982
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:14,130
else and then you no longer have your

983
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,420
prior art so we need these tools that

984
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:17,250
that are immutable

985
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:20,130
to you know survive all the censorship

986
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:22,889
that's going on yeah and that's a great

987
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:26,369
answer about academia I think it was

988
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:28,650
very informative yeah you know and it's

989
00:36:26,369 --> 00:36:31,259
just based on your opinion and your

990
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:32,369
brief interaction this smart guy he

991
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:34,830
knows the stuff I've learned a lot from

992
00:36:32,369 --> 00:36:36,839
doubt I've learned a ton from him so I

993
00:36:34,829 --> 00:36:38,069
know it's not discouraging there but

994
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,019
everyone gets different interests and

995
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:43,740
sometimes these you know these conflicts

996
00:36:40,019 --> 00:36:45,900
make us go different ways here we go if

997
00:36:43,739 --> 00:36:50,989
plants aren't patentable then who has

998
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:53,940
the prior art so plants are patentable

999
00:36:50,989 --> 00:36:56,669
unfortunately I'm not saying this as a

1000
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:59,340
supporter of what's going on in fact if

1001
00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:01,980
anyone wants to watch a very good review

1002
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:04,079
on IP I'd encourage people to look at

1003
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:05,849
Steven Gonzales work on this he's a

1004
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,590
patent attorney who hates IP and so he's

1005
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:10,349
got a very refreshing perspective but he

1006
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:12,000
also is very legit about it and that

1007
00:37:10,349 --> 00:37:13,500
look they exist and if you don't play by

1008
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,320
these rules you get your you know you're

1009
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,760
exposed so you can be as anti patent as

1010
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,019
you want but if you put your head in the

1011
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,540
sand you're probably gonna lose so you

1012
00:37:19,019 --> 00:37:23,579
have to respect the fact that the law is

1013
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:25,710
there so there's a lot of fun ways you

1014
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:27,929
can patent in fact the the best way I

1015
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:31,860
think that may have just emerged

1016
00:37:27,929 --> 00:37:36,359
is the USDA just opened up its doors to

1017
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:38,160
take in cannabis ease and that is that

1018
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:40,200
might be the best protection I think

1019
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:41,879
growers can get right now because I

1020
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:43,859
don't think violence has stabilized

1021
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:45,690
seeds and I just got to say they're

1022
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:48,000
there they just turn into breeding in to

1023
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:49,409
breed if they get cultivars in from

1024
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,210
other people that agree to license them

1025
00:37:49,409 --> 00:37:52,559
to them they then need to probably cross

1026
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:53,639
them and change them a little bit so

1027
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:55,049
that they're unique that'll take a

1028
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:56,699
couple cycles and then you got a back

1029
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:58,800
cross those so that they're stable and

1030
00:37:56,699 --> 00:38:00,149
what the USDA does is I think they want

1031
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,039
like three thousand see it's a lot of

1032
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:04,829
seeds they did check them for whether

1033
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:05,909
they are in fact stable you pop a few

1034
00:38:04,829 --> 00:38:07,289
and see if they're really extreme and

1035
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:11,389
phenotype and if they are they don't

1036
00:38:07,289 --> 00:38:13,529
consider it a viable PvP so there is

1037
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:15,449
plant variety Protection Act that's one

1038
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:17,250
there is there are plant patents which

1039
00:38:15,449 --> 00:38:20,250
are their own class of patents but those

1040
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:23,550
patents are for a sexually reproduced

1041
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:25,500
material clones and then there are

1042
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:26,730
utility patents which are the broadest

1043
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:30,480
patents which are the patents that we

1044
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:33,059
saw biotech LLC get and those can be

1045
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,190
very expensive to unravel once the

1046
00:38:33,059 --> 00:38:36,840
patent has issued you need to do an ex

1047
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:38,309
parte re-exam which can be a couple

1048
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:41,190
hundred grand to try and invalidate a

1049
00:38:38,309 --> 00:38:43,409
patent so that's that creates a

1050
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:45,450
different financial dynamic and feel now

1051
00:38:43,409 --> 00:38:47,549
now we've we've put some data public

1052
00:38:45,449 --> 00:38:48,659
that may challenge it and may not you

1053
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:50,750
know I'm not a lawyer on that but the

1054
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:52,829
Jamaican lion project we did we did that

1055
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:54,090
one we needed the type to plant the

1056
00:38:52,829 --> 00:38:55,469
sequence and two we tried to find

1057
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:58,380
something that predated the patent and

1058
00:38:55,469 --> 00:39:00,119
and build the best forensics back to

1059
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:02,340
that date this particular strain one a

1060
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:04,469
cannabis cup in San Francisco in 2011

1061
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,890
and has been known to be a type two

1062
00:39:04,469 --> 00:39:07,889
plant

1063
00:39:04,889 --> 00:39:09,929
that sometimes is is is beta-carotene

1064
00:39:07,889 --> 00:39:11,849
dominant sometimes mercy and dominant

1065
00:39:09,929 --> 00:39:15,029
and then that's one area I think at the

1066
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:16,199
USPTO I know Reggie's trying to help

1067
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:19,100
educate them and others need to educate

1068
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:22,349
them is that this concept of using

1069
00:39:19,099 --> 00:39:24,119
terpenes as a fingerprint for strain is

1070
00:39:22,349 --> 00:39:25,440
really dangerous because it's not really

1071
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:29,219
a fingerprint it's an environmental

1072
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:31,470
signature yeah and and that that means

1073
00:39:29,219 --> 00:39:32,909
you could have the same plan and put it

1074
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:33,809
somewhere else and you deter people or

1075
00:39:32,909 --> 00:39:35,789
you can have a completely different

1076
00:39:33,809 --> 00:39:37,259
plant that's genetically distinct has a

1077
00:39:35,789 --> 00:39:39,329
different cannabinoid profile but still

1078
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:41,100
gives you you can tweak it to pop mercy

1079
00:39:39,329 --> 00:39:42,360
in or pop beta care depending on how you

1080
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:45,299
you grow it so

1081
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:47,190
I don't like those as I think those are

1082
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,230
very broad and very dangerous because

1083
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:51,480
when you get something it says I have I

1084
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:54,090
own all type 2 plants that don't have

1085
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:56,610
mercy as dominant terpene you suddenly

1086
00:39:54,090 --> 00:40:00,269
own wait we wait too much property Wow

1087
00:39:56,610 --> 00:40:02,039
yeah and it's it's not clear to me I

1088
00:40:00,269 --> 00:40:03,389
know mark those great reading and great

1089
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:04,949
work and I don't doubt that that guy can

1090
00:40:03,389 --> 00:40:09,210
breed good stuff it's it's it's more

1091
00:40:04,949 --> 00:40:10,649
that the the the scope of claims there's

1092
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:12,750
there's a ratchet effect they always get

1093
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:14,550
bigger they never get smaller so a good

1094
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:16,110
lawyer is gonna take that patent and try

1095
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:19,260
and broaden it even more and brought

1096
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:21,240
anything more we've seen it get pushback

1097
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:23,820
in Canada there's a there's a there's a

1098
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:24,929
collection up there of probably LPS I

1099
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,800
don't really know who's behind it but

1100
00:40:24,929 --> 00:40:28,379
there's a group of people up there

1101
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,580
funding in opposition to the patent up

1102
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,840
there and they managed to narrow the

1103
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:33,750
claims going into Canada

1104
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:35,940
so the claim on that patent is enforced

1105
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:37,590
in Canada right now and it's smallish

1106
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:40,230
it's it's more narrow than it is here in

1107
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:42,450
the United States all right here's a

1108
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:45,750
here's another question and and also

1109
00:40:42,449 --> 00:40:48,000
just just so people know as far as as

1110
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:50,519
far as being stable you know typically

1111
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,380
in San abyss that is a rare thing IBL

1112
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:54,480
it's very hard to apply to in cannabis

1113
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:56,760
its bare there are very few strains that

1114
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:59,550
have less than three phenotypes if any

1115
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:01,050
yeah yeah it's hard

1116
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:03,570
I'm not surprised when I look at the

1117
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:05,670
variation in the genome I mean this is a

1118
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:07,170
it's a quite diverse plant it's it's

1119
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:09,690
hard to find other species that can be

1120
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:11,460
it's almost it's not quite there but

1121
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:12,889
it's pretty close one snip every ninety

1122
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:14,880
four basis is almost like having

1123
00:41:12,889 --> 00:41:16,319
chimpanzees and humans being able to

1124
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,940
cross and still have collective

1125
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:20,730
offspring it's it means that you get a

1126
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:24,840
spectrum of phenotypes in anyone's plant

1127
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:27,869
you have it's it's rare that the most

1128
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:30,570
homozygous plants we've seen came from

1129
00:41:27,869 --> 00:41:33,839
Franco and those are those were land

1130
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:35,220
races yeah yeah yeah and there may be

1131
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,630
some controversy about that we didn't

1132
00:41:35,219 --> 00:41:38,159
source them but I think he got him out

1133
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:40,490
of the Congo and there's some biopiracy

1134
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:44,339
concerns there that I'm not really

1135
00:41:40,489 --> 00:41:45,659
attuned to but he's shipped us a few

1136
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:47,100
from there and there's those things are

1137
00:41:45,659 --> 00:41:49,349
the most how homozygous things we've

1138
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:50,759
seen maybe those will be stable would

1139
00:41:49,349 --> 00:41:53,130
give you you know seeds that are all

1140
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:55,120
near clonal but I think until we get

1141
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:56,260
April mixes worked out

1142
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:58,539
gonna be we're gonna be dealing with

1143
00:41:56,260 --> 00:42:00,100
that but I think that's coming at some

1144
00:41:58,539 --> 00:42:01,690
point someone's gonna figure out how to

1145
00:42:00,099 --> 00:42:07,690
make double haploids in cannabis and the

1146
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:09,880
whole thing's gonna go seed okay here's

1147
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:11,079
one regarding defense of IP do you

1148
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:13,390
believe open-source breeding is

1149
00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:18,219
practical affordable and common standard

1150
00:42:13,389 --> 00:42:19,929
for small breeders so it depends on

1151
00:42:18,219 --> 00:42:22,389
what's affordable I think you'll you

1152
00:42:19,929 --> 00:42:23,799
might hear you know tail hunt they have

1153
00:42:22,389 --> 00:42:25,509
a different opinion on this because you

1154
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:27,910
can't file Provisionals very cheaply and

1155
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:29,620
maybe that's the right thing to do and

1156
00:42:27,909 --> 00:42:31,210
you can decide after the term of the

1157
00:42:29,619 --> 00:42:32,500
Provisionals up to say screw it I'm

1158
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:36,639
gonna go open with this I can't afford

1159
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:39,789
to go any further but it really comes

1160
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:41,529
down to whether the USPTO is gonna be

1161
00:42:39,789 --> 00:42:43,239
effective at their job looking through

1162
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:44,860
the prior art that's and that's my

1163
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:46,750
concern having been involved in the

1164
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:48,670
patent system a long time and people can

1165
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:50,170
call me Hippocrates up and I have a lot

1166
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:52,300
of patents in my name from all the stuff

1167
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:55,470
that I've done and my experience using

1168
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:58,240
the patent office is one that makes me

1169
00:42:55,469 --> 00:43:00,219
very disgruntled about it because the

1170
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:02,559
USPTO doesn't have a financial incentive

1171
00:43:00,219 --> 00:43:05,199
to do the preliminary search report

1172
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:08,170
correctly they make just as much money

1173
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:09,879
on the reexamine so they don't really

1174
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:11,559
care if the issue a broad patent the

1175
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:13,329
market is gonna sue over it later and

1176
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:15,610
then they'll get more revenue when the

1177
00:43:13,329 --> 00:43:18,130
reexamine happens so the incentives

1178
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:21,280
there aren't right for them to do very

1179
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:23,530
thorough preliminary search reports so

1180
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,000
you really have to kind of put it if

1181
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:26,920
you're gonna go and put it open you got

1182
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,230
to make sure it's open and obvious and

1183
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,940
in their face and they can't miss it put

1184
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:32,710
it you know publish the data in multiple

1185
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:35,619
places so that it's found and that you

1186
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:38,289
have a mechanism for whatever's indexing

1187
00:43:35,619 --> 00:43:39,579
the the internet to find it you know

1188
00:43:38,289 --> 00:43:41,079
that Google has to be Elysee if you're

1189
00:43:39,579 --> 00:43:43,480
putting this stuff up I like on the on

1190
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:46,059
ipfs the you know Google doesn't crawl

1191
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:47,619
that and will never find it great place

1192
00:43:46,059 --> 00:43:53,579
to store some data but if not it's not

1193
00:43:47,619 --> 00:43:58,029
gonna be found by the USPTO gotcha see

1194
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:59,139
what else do we got uh can I ask you

1195
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:01,420
what what's your experience with

1196
00:43:59,139 --> 00:44:02,679
cannabis as far as personal is this

1197
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:06,880
something you've been interested in

1198
00:44:02,679 --> 00:44:08,348
prior to the genetic aspect yeah so I

1199
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,079
got introduced to cannabis

1200
00:44:08,349 --> 00:44:13,778
seventh-grade long long time ago and

1201
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:15,970
then I took a big hiatus from it when I

1202
00:44:13,778 --> 00:44:18,429
got my first job just it was a human

1203
00:44:15,969 --> 00:44:19,808
genome project is was afraid I was gonna

1204
00:44:18,429 --> 00:44:22,899
get tested and get chucked off their

1205
00:44:19,809 --> 00:44:28,119
that so so III was probably wait for it

1206
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:29,559
until 2010 or so a bunch of friends of

1207
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:32,380
ours were getting cancer in their mid

1208
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:34,089
30s and 40s and it was everyone was like

1209
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:35,528
what the hell is this and we were we

1210
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,759
were building DNA sequences at the time

1211
00:44:35,528 --> 00:44:38,528
that could sequence the tumor and

1212
00:44:36,759 --> 00:44:40,869
sequence the patient figure out what

1213
00:44:38,528 --> 00:44:44,108
druggable mutation they actually had in

1214
00:44:40,869 --> 00:44:45,910
the tumor a problem is they they then

1215
00:44:44,108 --> 00:44:48,909
would turn to a set of tool boxes like

1216
00:44:45,909 --> 00:44:50,768
cisplatin and all this poison you'd have

1217
00:44:48,909 --> 00:44:52,328
this wonderful targeted approach of

1218
00:44:50,768 --> 00:44:53,498
nailing the tumor and achilles heel but

1219
00:44:52,329 --> 00:44:56,019
the selection of drugs you had all

1220
00:44:53,498 --> 00:44:57,939
sucked and that's when people started

1221
00:44:56,018 --> 00:44:59,139
forward me cannabinoid papers saying

1222
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:00,579
what about these these are safe these

1223
00:44:59,139 --> 00:45:06,578
are non-toxic and that's when I really

1224
00:45:00,579 --> 00:45:08,470
don't think we started getting cold feet

1225
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:09,999
about that business model someone in her

1226
00:45:08,469 --> 00:45:12,278
family would get sick that would benefit

1227
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:15,248
from it and would rearrange us into

1228
00:45:12,278 --> 00:45:17,679
doing more my father's one my father has

1229
00:45:15,248 --> 00:45:20,409
had type he's had stage four cancer for

1230
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:22,690
four years now he's been fighting and

1231
00:45:20,409 --> 00:45:24,998
it's a prostate cancer that went to the

1232
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:26,380
bones that went everywhere the only

1233
00:45:24,998 --> 00:45:29,288
thing that's dealt with his pain has

1234
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:30,548
been type 2 plants it very similar it's

1235
00:45:29,289 --> 00:45:32,680
actually what was patented and that's

1236
00:45:30,548 --> 00:45:34,588
one thing that kind of got me into the

1237
00:45:32,679 --> 00:45:36,940
Jamaican lion project is like look this

1238
00:45:34,588 --> 00:45:38,849
case is helping cancer patients really

1239
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:41,139
close to me I'm not tolerating this

1240
00:45:38,849 --> 00:45:43,778
someone owns this this is something that

1241
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:46,538
needs to be public and so fortunately -

1242
00:45:43,778 --> 00:45:49,028
funded that and they funded it in a way

1243
00:45:46,539 --> 00:45:50,349
where it it went public more or less two

1244
00:45:49,028 --> 00:45:51,759
or three days after the assembly was

1245
00:45:50,349 --> 00:45:53,559
done we didn't even have a chance to

1246
00:45:51,759 --> 00:45:55,059
really look at it we queue seed it put

1247
00:45:53,559 --> 00:45:56,200
it public and we've since been combing

1248
00:45:55,059 --> 00:45:58,749
through the data to figure out what we

1249
00:45:56,199 --> 00:46:00,909
can learn and I think that's the right

1250
00:45:58,748 --> 00:46:03,308
model is get get we need to you know

1251
00:46:00,909 --> 00:46:04,568
float all boats right now having this

1252
00:46:03,309 --> 00:46:07,960
cart alized everyone having their own

1253
00:46:04,568 --> 00:46:10,239
private cannabis genome that's fine but

1254
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:12,219
if we really want to accelerate the

1255
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:13,568
field we need good references out there

1256
00:46:12,219 --> 00:46:15,940
that everyone can utilize even our

1257
00:46:13,568 --> 00:46:17,349
competitors and I'm certain finalist has

1258
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:19,150
probably used the Jamaican lion thing

1259
00:46:17,349 --> 00:46:20,440
further making their 50k chips I mean

1260
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:21,700
the timing of that would have been

1261
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:24,970
perfect for them and

1262
00:46:21,699 --> 00:46:26,529
fine the we've seen others published off

1263
00:46:24,969 --> 00:46:30,219
it already there's a someone some groups

1264
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:31,960
done a cannabis proteome off of the

1265
00:46:30,219 --> 00:46:33,759
Jamaican line reference we put forward

1266
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:35,409
so that's in bio archive right now it's

1267
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:38,950
really interesting read

1268
00:46:35,409 --> 00:46:41,500
but yeah so my history has been on and

1269
00:46:38,949 --> 00:46:44,019
off but we've seen CBD helped

1270
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:47,380
tremendously and and arrhythmias as well

1271
00:46:44,019 --> 00:46:48,969
we have a lot of afib family and this

1272
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:50,400
actually affected my brother and there's

1273
00:46:48,969 --> 00:46:53,139
a there's actually a nice your s

1274
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:55,450
presentation I gave on this his actual

1275
00:46:53,139 --> 00:46:57,069
case was really fascinating because we

1276
00:46:55,449 --> 00:46:58,419
sequence the genomes ever in the family

1277
00:46:57,070 --> 00:47:00,130
and figured out he has two different

1278
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:01,659
calcium channel mutations one for my

1279
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:03,640
mother once for my father he's got

1280
00:47:01,659 --> 00:47:07,269
debilitating afib and the only thing

1281
00:47:03,639 --> 00:47:08,559
that nails it is CBD and so an aphids

1282
00:47:07,269 --> 00:47:10,210
big there's like six million people in

1283
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:11,769
countries afib and now I don't think it

1284
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:13,570
works on a leaf he's got a very private

1285
00:47:11,769 --> 00:47:15,550
those variants aren't known to any any

1286
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:17,980
other database but him so they're very

1287
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:20,710
rare variants ones in our way or to gene

1288
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:22,059
and and my sister is an electric

1289
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:23,530
cardiologist and she was afraid to

1290
00:47:22,059 --> 00:47:25,719
basically oblate it she's like I don't I

1291
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:27,280
can't map this arrhythmia I don't I

1292
00:47:25,719 --> 00:47:30,579
don't want to burn it you're gonna have

1293
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:32,650
to do something else and so CBD came to

1294
00:47:30,579 --> 00:47:35,500
the rescue for him so there's been this

1295
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:44,170
consistent theme in our family where

1296
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:46,150
this plant keeps pulling us back you

1297
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:49,900
know the craziest thing about my

1298
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:51,490
father's story is uh his uh I didn't

1299
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:53,769
recognize this or put the put two and

1300
00:47:51,489 --> 00:47:55,719
two together on this and so we were we

1301
00:47:53,769 --> 00:47:59,409
were flying him back into like a hospice

1302
00:47:55,719 --> 00:48:00,549
care scenario and uh all the nurses are

1303
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:01,539
constantly asking what's his birthday

1304
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:02,920
what's his birthday and I kept telling

1305
00:48:01,539 --> 00:48:04,119
I'm won't October first nineteen thirty

1306
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:06,579
seven I Tober first nineteen thirty

1307
00:48:04,119 --> 00:48:08,380
seven and I'm like I know that day what

1308
00:48:06,579 --> 00:48:09,670
the hell's that date from you know that

1309
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:11,559
that's that's the date they made

1310
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:15,159
cannabis legal Wow

1311
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:17,110
he was born on that day it's like I

1312
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:19,210
don't know it's weird cosmic [ __ ] like

1313
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:21,640
that that makes you know alright I think

1314
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:23,470
I have to keep doing this absolutely I

1315
00:48:21,639 --> 00:48:25,299
think that I think that's awesome that

1316
00:48:23,469 --> 00:48:27,039
you actually have a personal connection

1317
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:28,960
with it that's that's lacking that's

1318
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:31,420
that's seriously lacking in any kind of

1319
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:33,309
corporate world or testing or oh yeah

1320
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:35,470
well this is what motivated us to do can

1321
00:48:33,309 --> 00:48:38,500
med you know we run that

1322
00:48:35,469 --> 00:48:40,029
conference every year and it's we have

1323
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:42,000
CME credits there because our interest

1324
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:44,080
was like we need more doctors when we

1325
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,320
initially got in this field it was hard

1326
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:48,639
to find a doctor that would certify him

1327
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:50,200
and we you know we're in Massachusetts

1328
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:51,969
and we're way behind and dried and lived

1329
00:48:50,199 --> 00:48:54,969
in New Hampshire it's even you know live

1330
00:48:51,969 --> 00:48:55,989
free anti is what I call it now it's one

1331
00:48:54,969 --> 00:48:57,879
of these states where they're there

1332
00:48:55,989 --> 00:48:59,618
their cannabis regs are way behind

1333
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:01,300
everybody else and so he had to have two

1334
00:48:59,619 --> 00:49:02,410
doctors sign off and had to know them

1335
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,460
for like three to six months or

1336
00:49:02,409 --> 00:49:06,279
something like that in New Hampshire for

1337
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:07,240
EM you get cannabis in New Hampshire and

1338
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:09,940
we're like that's crazy

1339
00:49:07,239 --> 00:49:11,500
you know we figured out something where

1340
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:14,050
a Maine certificate would work in New

1341
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:15,400
Hampshire and and his big runaround for

1342
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:17,769
someone who's got stage four cancer to

1343
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:21,910
be like oh you got to wait yeah exactly

1344
00:49:17,769 --> 00:49:24,309
you know no I'm gonna wait so yeah so

1345
00:49:21,909 --> 00:49:26,889
can med hopes get more doctors certified

1346
00:49:24,309 --> 00:49:28,690
and also we try to get everyone to

1347
00:49:26,889 --> 00:49:30,309
present down there and and it's all

1348
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:31,809
science-based I mean we invite mark

1349
00:49:30,309 --> 00:49:33,099
their mark to mark lewiston's great work

1350
00:49:31,809 --> 00:49:34,840
even though we don't agree with his

1351
00:49:33,099 --> 00:49:38,200
patent we believe it does great science

1352
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:39,099
and so we welcome into present what he's

1353
00:49:38,199 --> 00:49:41,108
doing

1354
00:49:39,099 --> 00:49:43,180
I'd welcome Ryan Lee too if he has work

1355
00:49:41,108 --> 00:49:45,098
to present it's all about if you present

1356
00:49:43,179 --> 00:49:47,250
good work we try to keep the politics

1357
00:49:45,099 --> 00:49:49,240
and the business conflicts out of it

1358
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:52,269
we're running out of time

1359
00:49:49,239 --> 00:49:55,659
but that went really fast and honestly I

1360
00:49:52,269 --> 00:49:57,519
think you came like and a really odd

1361
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:59,079
time in the business where you know all

1362
00:49:57,519 --> 00:50:01,719
this just happened and snow evolved and

1363
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:03,460
it took some big nuts to come and just

1364
00:50:01,719 --> 00:50:06,549
you know take questions firing the math

1365
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:07,990
union well I get it I want to thank

1366
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:10,690
everyone online that's chipped in on

1367
00:50:07,989 --> 00:50:11,858
this because it is hard these folks do a

1368
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:14,170
lot of money and they could get

1369
00:50:11,858 --> 00:50:16,480
litigious over over you know calling

1370
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:17,680
this stuff out but you know it's it's

1371
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,690
stronger wouldn't everyone can share

1372
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:21,190
data and see what's what the truth

1373
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:23,409
really is it's it's really hard if

1374
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:25,088
you're just one voice and and you know

1375
00:50:23,409 --> 00:50:26,739
you don't you don't want to bank your

1376
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:28,269
entire reputation on it unless you see

1377
00:50:26,739 --> 00:50:29,529
other people saying you know they can

1378
00:50:28,269 --> 00:50:31,358
corroborate the data and it looks like

1379
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:32,950
other people did that they really really

1380
00:50:31,358 --> 00:50:34,299
did their homework on this and integrate

1381
00:50:32,949 --> 00:50:36,669
what was going on to a much higher

1382
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:37,089
degree that we did so that's very

1383
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:41,680
helpful

1384
00:50:37,088 --> 00:50:43,900
well I appreciate you okay yeah that's

1385
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:46,299
fine so it's got a permanent home so

1386
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:48,190
people can see this but yeah thank you

1387
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:49,359
so much and and if you have time in the

1388
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:51,519
future I'd love to have you

1389
00:50:49,358 --> 00:50:52,778
I know like this is a lot of data to

1390
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:54,278
throw at people so I know people gonna

1391
00:50:52,778 --> 00:50:55,298
be watching this room watching this and

1392
00:50:54,278 --> 00:50:57,639
have more questions later

1393
00:50:55,298 --> 00:50:59,139
so yeah yeah we get the discussion going

1394
00:50:57,639 --> 00:51:01,179
I'm still really intrigued on where this

1395
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:03,879
goes whether it goes open or closed and

1396
00:51:01,179 --> 00:51:05,288
and what what's this is all gonna turn

1397
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:07,000
into because I don't think we have clear

1398
00:51:05,289 --> 00:51:08,680
answers but we're a tool provider I

1399
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,179
don't think we necessarily need them we

1400
00:51:08,679 --> 00:51:13,269
just need to be transparent and make

1401
00:51:10,179 --> 00:51:15,190
sure people understand what we do with

1402
00:51:13,269 --> 00:51:16,630
people's data yeah I think that's the

1403
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:18,940
most important thing is transparency

1404
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:20,710
that's all people ask really yeah be

1405
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:21,309
straightforward and honest and it's not

1406
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:24,940
that hard

1407
00:51:21,309 --> 00:51:26,440
yeah no it's amazing actually it's much

1408
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:27,700
harder to actually be a liar because you

1409
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:30,608
it's too hard you trip up on yourself

1410
00:51:27,699 --> 00:51:31,629
yeah and yeah and truth truth makes it

1411
00:51:30,608 --> 00:51:39,659
really easy you don't have to remember

1412
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:42,278
anything cheers thank you thank you all

1413
00:51:39,659 --> 00:51:43,598
right guys I'm sorry if I didn't get to

1414
00:51:42,278 --> 00:51:46,389
everyone's questions I'm gonna have them

1415
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:48,700
back on if you'll come back on there was

1416
00:51:46,389 --> 00:51:50,798
a lot of data there there's a lot of

1417
00:51:48,699 --> 00:51:52,629
heavy science a lot of stuff I I'm even

1418
00:51:50,798 --> 00:51:54,068
trained to process right now you know I

1419
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:55,119
mean it was hard science so I'm gonna

1420
00:51:54,068 --> 00:51:59,500
have to go research a bunch of this

1421
00:51:55,119 --> 00:52:01,838
stuff but it does take a lot of nuts to

1422
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:04,358
come on here and be face-to-face with

1423
00:52:01,838 --> 00:52:08,170
someone like me that's gonna not pulling

1424
00:52:04,358 --> 00:52:11,528
punches per se so I appreciate him doing

1425
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:13,088
that you know you go go research go

1426
00:52:11,528 --> 00:52:15,039
research everything that he said go look

1427
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:17,108
it up if you find something incorrect

1428
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:19,510
let me know well we'll bring it to him

1429
00:52:17,108 --> 00:52:21,730
and I think the fact that he's made

1430
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:24,490
himself so available that's a big step

1431
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:27,400
it's hard to trust people then are

1432
00:52:24,489 --> 00:52:29,078
cannabis outsiders and I think it looks

1433
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:30,809
like at least it appears that his heart

1434
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:34,420
was in the right place so that's that's

1435
00:52:30,809 --> 00:52:38,319
important anyway I think I think someone

1436
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:41,289
recorded this I hope someone recorded

1437
00:52:38,318 --> 00:52:43,239
this if you did I think flap nil is

1438
00:52:41,289 --> 00:52:44,950
gonna record this send me the link

1439
00:52:43,239 --> 00:52:48,509
when you get it up and I'll put it up on

1440
00:52:44,949 --> 00:52:53,308
the YouTube as well on the youtubes and

1441
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:53,309
yep that's it Cheers

1442
00:52:55,268 --> 00:52:57,328
you

1443
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:05,880
you
