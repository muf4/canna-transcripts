11
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:59,039
you you guys were there in the early

12
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:01,839
days of the bcc scene and the bc

13
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,439
cannabis era the boom and uh we just

14
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,519
wanted to sit back and pick your brains

15
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:07,759
on on what you guys went through the

16
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,118
early upcomings and your guys's

17
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,640
adventures through

18
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,400
through your era

19
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,000
yeah well thanks for having us oh it's

20
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,040
an honor

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,478
yeah i don't even really know what to

22
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,159
say man dc

23
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:19,200
i i grew up on the east side of the

24
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,920
country

25
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,478
and i didn't meet kip until the early

26
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,159
part of like 2000s i guess really late

27
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:30,239
1990 late 1990s every part of 2000's

28
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,000
and uh so are you the canadian scene

29
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,759
it's really so different back then i

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,118
mean there was it was really segregated

31
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,879
all across the countries different

32
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:39,519
provinces

33
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:41,519
treated cannabis quite differently

34
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:43,438
you know bc kind of the left side of the

35
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:45,599
country bc being the most lenient kind

36
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,199
of equivalent to california

37
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:50,078
um but a lot of different types of

38
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,000
scenes going on the back for example

39
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:54,078
um was like really

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,519
quite controlled or at least influenced

41
00:01:54,078 --> 00:02:00,158
by the health of the biker gangs

42
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:02,078
um so it wasn't really as like open but

43
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,479
i would say the west you know at least

44
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:08,079
starting in bc it was really bc such a

45
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:09,520
massive um province yeah it's it's like

46
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,280
four times the size of germany kind of

47
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,360
thing right so it's it's really quite

48
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,120
large yeah and there's only i don't know

49
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,720
the population i guess that must have

50
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,039
been around three million it's only four

51
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:21,520
million now but you can imagine like

52
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:23,840
spaced population ratio

53
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,040
there's a lot of places you can go

54
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,039
yeah

55
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:28,318
right a lot of small a lot of small

56
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:29,919
towns

57
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,238
a lot of places to go at the end of the

58
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:36,159
road and set up a show or dig a bunch of

59
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,159
trailers underneath the ground or

60
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,318
you know people really did everything

61
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:43,039
back then it was like

62
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:45,119
it was so open um at least in british

63
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,560
columbia and anybody could get into it

64
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,319
you know i mean

65
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,080
i think probably and one of the reasons

66
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:52,958
i think it was accepted as well is that

67
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,640
like every family or every person knew

68
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,080
someone in the cannabis business whether

69
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:59,279
you were a grower

70
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,719
a you know a broker or a tremor

71
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,439
like really

72
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:03,039
the

73
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,800
just like it is in northern california

74
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:06,639
you know what i mean the cannabis

75
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,319
scene feeds the local economy it is the

76
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:11,279
local economy it drives the local

77
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:12,639
economy yeah so without the without that

78
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,120
local economy i mean you're not gonna

79
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:17,518
have gas stations you're not gonna have

80
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,519
restaurants and you know we got this

81
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,080
this town in the interior british

82
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,080
columbia called nelson bc

83
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,760
um which became a little bit known in

84
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,120
the states about 15 years ago or 10

85
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:30,639
years ago i can't remember exactly when

86
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,400
it was but they put up a statue um to

87
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,079
recognize the

88
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,599
draft dodgers that came up from the

89
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,680
states like in in the 60s and 70s oh wow

90
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:42,318
right and because these guys would show

91
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,319
up you know they they dr they dodged the

92
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:45,679
draft they come up to canada you

93
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:47,598
wouldn't have a social security or

94
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,840
social insurance number

95
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:51,280
um so you couldn't you couldn't be part

96
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,799
of the regular workforce and so these

97
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,919
people these guys would start setting up

98
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,680
growth and they're typically like

99
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,199
hippie-minded folks anyway too right in

100
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,200
the area

101
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:01,598
and it just you know growing cannabis

102
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,280
really just fit in with that whole thing

103
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:04,560
and and what it was

104
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,400
like

105
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,280
the number of car dealerships or

106
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,000
high-end restaurants in nelson is like

107
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,759
it's way way way above normal

108
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,598
your average populations because like

109
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,519
people there have money to spend like

110
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:19,519
miami during the 80s with the cocaine

111
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,959
boom yeah probably a little bit like

112
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,040
that

113
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,160
and but nelson's really like i mean it's

114
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,600
the middle of nowhere i mean you're on

115
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,120
the other side of the northern border

116
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,680
from montana

117
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,360
uh it's quite remote like in british

118
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,959
columbia i mean it's far in the interior

119
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,120
it's not like there's a big three lane

120
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:37,279
highway driving from there

121
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,759
um so it's gotta be like a less seven

122
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:42,478
hour drive from vancouver so

123
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,879
it's uh it's it's really an interesting

124
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:47,120
little place that developed this this

125
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:48,319
cannabis community and and you know like

126
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,840
i said it

127
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:51,759
you know i mean fox news got all bent

128
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:54,239
out of shape obviously when that statue

129
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,600
went up oh i bet but it's the kind of

130
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,680
it's the kind of place that would do

131
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,800
that and support well i mean

132
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,959
conscientious objectors were usually um

133
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,478
kind of social misfits as as it were so

134
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:06,959
i could definitely see that leading to a

135
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:08,399
growing community you know

136
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:09,918
yeah and there so there was another

137
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:13,038
community like that on the east side of

138
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:14,799
the country called kilalu ontario

139
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:16,719
and i don't know there's canadians that

140
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,879
are listening but we've got this pastry

141
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,639
they they make called beaver tails up

142
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:21,918
here in canada

143
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,600
and uh

144
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:25,120
anyway they're they're from kilolu and i

145
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,479
think that those guys also came from

146
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,079
that same area

147
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:30,079
uh they they had one of the beaver tails

148
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:32,319
called the killer loose sunrise but

149
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:34,240
that you know i i i was often wondering

150
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,000
if that was like the you know money

151
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,319
laundering

152
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,360
it could have been yeah excuse me if i'm

153
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:41,360
totally way off base

154
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,360
but it was just you know like those were

155
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:47,359
the two cup those two communities on the

156
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,680
west coast in the east coast

157
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,680
that really you know that really were

158
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,519
made up of mostly draft dodgers or at

159
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,759
least a significant portion of

160
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,359
draft dodgers and so they kind of became

161
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,199
these cannabis hubs

162
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,400
right to a degree

163
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,680
um

164
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:03,359
yeah so

165
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,759
i don't know it's it's been a weird

166
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,560
transition in the last like really 30

167
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,840
years to watch this whole thing develop

168
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,280
you know

169
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:13,279
what was your what was your first

170
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:14,719
entrance as far as like when you were

171
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:16,399
when you first started smoking what were

172
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,840
the strains that were around that you

173
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:20,879
were running into that kind of inspired

174
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:23,599
you even to get into cannabis genetics

175
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:25,839
so i i mean when i was originally buying

176
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,680
dope it never it didn't come with a name

177
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:30,318
yeah yeah early on

178
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,360
right mexican brick just this brick

179
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,680
red hair

180
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,759
purple hair you know yeah the first

181
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,439
thing that i i i went to the school and

182
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,520
down the road this there's

183
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,800
my my friend ended up running into this

184
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:43,599
guy who's a real

185
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,840
real skidmark he's like a real

186
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,280
he just this weirdo that was that sold

187
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,198
drugs i guess to some of the high school

188
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:51,279
students yeah and

189
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,960
you know i remember buying weed from him

190
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:54,959
and he had what was what was referred to

191
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:56,879
as bc skunk or the skunk weed or

192
00:06:54,959 --> 00:07:00,239
whatever yeah and that was

193
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,598
this had to be you know early 90s

194
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,598
and it was

195
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:04,879
you know it was just not like that

196
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:07,120
that's just that was i think it was the

197
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,478
first time i saw anything with the name

198
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,000
you know and i had this other dealer i

199
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:12,800
would typically buy from and he had all

200
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,639
these really nice import hashes and

201
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,598
different kinds of flour but it was you

202
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,598
know it would be like i'd show up and

203
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:19,598
he'd be like oh i got these purple buds

204
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:21,199
yeah you know it was like you know that

205
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:23,439
kind of stuff where i got like a red

206
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,759
cherry honey oil but and those were the

207
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:28,000
names that you'd get right it wasn't it

208
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,720
wasn't like it wasn't branded it wasn't

209
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,680
cultivar names or anything like that

210
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,440
um and i think really that that probably

211
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,560
didn't actually start i mean i think

212
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:38,079
that there was obviously people that

213
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,120
were going over holland and buying seeds

214
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:41,120
but

215
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,519
you know in canada there was no legal

216
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,959
seed sales until marker sorry there was

217
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,918
no above

218
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:49,519
the counter seed cells i'm going to say

219
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:52,399
but until marc emery started selling

220
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:54,719
seeds yeah and you know i remember

221
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:58,000
seeing the first copy of what became

222
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,000
cannabis culture magazine

223
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:07,839
and i think that was really when it was

224
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:09,439
like a kind of you know open mi not

225
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:10,719
opened my eyes but like you know i

226
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:12,800
really started to understand that there

227
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,560
was this larger world of cannabis

228
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,639
cannabis seed banks and

229
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,038
types of varieties and all of them just

230
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,160
weed because that's when you're buying

231
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:23,839
from a from a unregulated market where

232
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,160
you're just buying whatever that mueller

233
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:28,560
can get his hands on sure that's just

234
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,639
not important this name isn't important

235
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,360
right it's like do you have something or

236
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:36,158
not yeah if it yeah when [ __ ] can go dry

237
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,399
it's not a main priority you know

238
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:40,080
yeah yeah

239
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,399
what you got what was your first

240
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,759
entrance wow yeah so i grew up in

241
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,639
southwestern ontario back in the 80s and

242
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,439
you know

243
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:51,360
we didn't see grass man i mean

244
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,320
we saw a lot of hash oil

245
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,480
which would be called rso now i guess um

246
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,560
and import and that all came down from

247
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,480
the st lawrence uh from the

248
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,479
uh rocking machine and the bikers uh

249
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,440
coming down that side of that laneway so

250
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,560
i mean

251
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,080
honestly

252
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:12,639
dope to us was you know a 15 gram rso 2

253
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,639
for 25 or or import a 3d hash

254
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,080
that was it it wasn't until i you know i

255
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,399
got out to um

256
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,160
uh you know kind of dead to her uh let's

257
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,278
say lady's dead tour on the east coast

258
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,439
and

259
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:25,838
ultimately made my way to vancouver to

260
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,720
go to school at ubc uh did i actually

261
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:31,120
see flower uh to be quite frank uh i

262
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,600
know a lot of guys in my area going back

263
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,519
after i did as it were all i knew kind

264
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,440
of more about growers and that scene

265
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,879
kind of when i came back to visit from

266
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,240
bc and found out there were a lot of

267
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,838
guys that were growing in the corn

268
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,519
fields you know yeah

269
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,320
but especially the organic certification

270
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,759
that always give you um harvest dates uh

271
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,320
weeks that we're gonna be harvesting so

272
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:51,759
you'd always go in plant your your your

273
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,120
weed between the rows and then take it

274
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:55,759
out at least two or three days before

275
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,839
the guys can come get it so you let the

276
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:59,679
farmers do it themselves for you back in

277
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,160
those days but that's yeah

278
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:05,519
yeah yeah southwestern ontario in the

279
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:09,120
late 70s and 80s um but uh yeah i mean i

280
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:11,839
kind of got out to bc in uh 1991 um i

281

there

283
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:16,399
and really kind of got immersed in the

284
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,440
cannabis scene

285
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:22,078
the varieties of cannabis uh the ease of

286
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,920
it the acceptability of it i mean i came

287
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:25,759
from ontario man puffing a joint in

288

00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:29,600
looking all around waiting to get popped

290
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,440

joint where if we get you know quite

335
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,480
privileged up our ass up here and get a

336
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,120
slap

337
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,879
to go home you know yeah so

338
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,159
um if those were the kind of that was

339
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,360
kind of my first introduction into the

340
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,360
kind of the more global or north

341
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,639
american scene and and we quickly

342
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,560
realized you know

343
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,399
starting up small grows in vancouver it

344
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,078
was easy peasy i mean

345
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,000
worst thing if you got busted was you

346
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:26,958
would get told go sit out front they'd

347
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,600
chop your plants take your ballasts and

348
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:32,239
yeah this is it you start restarting

349
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,759
yeah so having three or four houses and

350
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,680
i mean reddit was cheap back in van in

351
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,519
those days too so i mean you and and

352
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:39,759
pounds were going for 32 canadian at

353
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,078
that point in the game yeah so i mean it

354
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:44,078
was well worth it an eight lighter could

355
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:45,278
put you in a new tax bracket

356
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:47,439
yeah

357
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:48,480
um and so we figured out pretty quickly

358
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,639
that you know

359
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,320
you could grow scentsy uh or you you

360
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,320
know and and that was great and

361
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,320
fantastic and get cuts from you know

362
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,959
guys you'd meet online or seeds from

363
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,399
amsterdam things like that sure or you

364
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,919
could start making your own seeds

365
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,240
because there was this huge market for

366
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:07,120
it and i mean one room of making seeds

367
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,278
was like five years of profits in canada

368
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,799
in uh scentsy right yeah that's really

369
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:14,240
true yeah so you know we kind of

370
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:16,399
started doing that you know and we

371
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,000
started creating some seed companies and

372
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,399
realizing that there were other seed

373
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,159
companies across canada so i know

374
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,799
business partner in mind started legend

375
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:27,199
seeds as a seed brokerage house and we

376
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:28,958
started carrying the dutch stuff

377
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,000
and canadian seed breeders at that point

378
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,599
in the game

379
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,440
at that point i mean i think there were

380
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,680
maybe six seed companies on the world

381
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,240
wide web oh yeah yeah

382
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:41,198
at point man yeah so and most of them

383
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,039
were dutch or mark you know yeah um

384
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:44,958
so it was uh that's kind of my first

385
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,559
that's how i kind of got into it uh you

386
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,239
know we had the amsterdam once a year

387

grab the seeds we needed to you know

388
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,278

389
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:55,439
vancouver and we sold um worldwide we

390
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:57,198

and you know really that kind of blew up

394
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:05,518
for me personally that's kind of how i

395
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:06,958
met uh chimera to be honest with you i i

396

the kid was the cannabis culture no

399
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:14,719
cannabis culture cannabis

400
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:16,719

and uh i think i was selling mila's um

403
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:22,149
isolator bags back then we had exactly

404
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:24,639
what it was

405
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:25,838
[Laughter]

406
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,360
it was actually one of those moments

407
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,440
whereas like i realized that my internet

408
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,399
security wasn't great like i had

409
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,320
i had i had made a post online about the

410
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,480
needed some bubble bags from you know

411
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,760
our friend marcus richardson and yeah i

412
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,079
guess

413
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:42,159
red had been selling them in canada

414
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:44,638
a different brand the miele

415
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:46,078
the pollinator company bags

416
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,600
i remember going into my university

417
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:49,120
email account and there was an email

418
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,480
from red

419
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,399
and i was like

420
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,959
i posted on this website and now this

421
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:57,039
guy has my email address

422
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:58,638
how the [ __ ] did that happen right well

423
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:01,039
see that was the part of the problem

424
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,440
back then i i never felt like we were

425
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:05,360
doing anything wrong so to me

426
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,720
my security especially living in bc

427
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,800
because we just didn't think that we

428
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,240
were untouchable really

429
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,559
it was just normal and i was going to

430
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,000
act like it was normal and i keep

431
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:15,838
forgetting that you know my eastern

432
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,159
brothers were still get pretty dodged

433
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,079
out like [ __ ] yeah

434
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:22,879
i mean looking back at it it was an

435
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:24,239
insane level of security it was probably

436
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,759
that's a that

437
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,440
you know i mean that's kind of just what

438
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:28,958
you learn to operate under when you're

439
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,959
when you're operating under these harsh

440
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,919
laws right i mean i i was in ottawa

441
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:34,159
which is

442
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:36,958
you know i think think north of utica or

443
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:40,480
buffalo kind of up that way right

444
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:41,758
um near new york state and um yeah i

445
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,519
mean it's the capital of the country i

446
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,680
mean that's where they decree the law

447
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,759
from right so

448
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:49,519
when when they talk about federal law in

449
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,519
canada

450
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,519
it's really enforced differently in the

451
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,759
capital than it is kind of on in the

452
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,198
west coast right on the west coast

453
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,959
you know how it is california it's kind

454
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:01,039
of like you look back at dc and be like

455
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,078
ah those groups back in dc are making

456
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:03,919
laws

457
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:05,919
you know we're gonna go go on about our

458
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:07,679
lives here on the west coast it's kind

459
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:09,278
of the same thing but they really do

460
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,039
enforce it differently back there so i

461
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:12,720
mean you're you know you're ducking and

462
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:14,799
covering while kip was feeling secure

463
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,079
and his little in his his grows out on

464
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:18,319
the west coast

465
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:21,278
you know i was panicking my ass off

466
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,199
every time it started to smell

467
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:24,000
yeah

468
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:25,599
so

469
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,839
it wasn't much different in california

470
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,079
even today there's still like i live in

471
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,600
bakersfield you know you drive six hours

472
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:33,758
north to humboldt or seven hours north

473
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,360
to humboldt it's a different world

474
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,320
like a totally different world night and

475
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,320
day yeah yeah and it was pretty it was

476
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,920
it was up until most recently to be

477
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,360
quite frank even with legalization

478
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:45,759
things haven't really changed that much

479
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,480
until the last say five years of wreck

480
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,320
legalization up here attitudes uh

481
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,920
generally i mean much more conservative

482
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,000
out in the east coast in central canada

483
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:55,919
than it is on the west coast of which i

484
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,240
mean of north america in general i could

485
00:16:55,919 --> 00:17:00,399
probably say yeah um but one of the

486
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,320
great story was that how we actually met

487
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,720

doing a grow out there at one point

543
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,679
again

544
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,079
we became very very good friends so the

545
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,160
three of us hit the road essentially and

546
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,918
we traveled all around ontario and

547
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,160
quebec and went to head shops flashing

548
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:17,600
those in that section what year was this

549
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:19,279
ryan was this like 02 a one

550
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:21,038
yeah well see you you and i had actually

551
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:22,240
met before but that yeah i don't

552
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:25,359
remember what year that must have been

553
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:28,000
twenty two and less than 2002 or 2003

554
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:29,839
yeah oh my apologies

555
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,919
happened earlier because it was it would

556
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:33,599
have been 2 000. it would have been

557
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,840
because she wrapped the beads over in

558
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:37,359
europe later on right

559
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:38,798
so we went and we were going to all

560
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:40,079
these uh head shops and we were trying

561
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:42,240
to get them to sell seeds or at least

562
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:44,399
carry our catalogs so that and we would

563
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,798
kick down all of the you know the owners

564
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,320
that they handed out our catalog

565
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:49,679
uh so we got to meet a lot of folks that

566
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:52,558
was a great trip and then one of our

567
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,960
stops was in uh ottawa with uh

568
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:57,038
with ryan that was the first time i i

569
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,400
somehow convinced him to let us sell his

570
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:00,079
seeds i believe is that how it worked

571
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,120
right in my community no no no we were

572

go over the high times cannabis cup in

603
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:12,399
amsterdam every year we had a booth

604
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:14,639
um our first booth uh was

605
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,679
was literally like a small table with a

606
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,200
bunch of t-shirts um and then the second

607
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,400
year we actually got a real booth and

608
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,080
the second year we were actually right

609
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,600
beside that bubble man we had our booze

610
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:25,519
right beside each other

611
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:27,599
and uh we did fairly well there and we

612
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:30,960
got to really connect with all the dutch

613
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:32,399
guys like ahri and the drunkers and um

614
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,159
you know all the boys over there and

615
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,240
they became kinder friends you know

616
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,240
because uh we were these you know

617
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,599
cannabis cowboys from canada and these

618
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,679
guys were the old dutch guys and they

619
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:43,439
were kind of showing us the ropes and we

620
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,120
were kind of the new upstarts they

621
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,400
really i got to be honest with you a lot

622
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:48,239
of them were really generous with their

623
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,759
time and their information and were

624
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,759
really quite friendly to us so it was

625
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:53,359
kind of fun

626
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:54,798
back then too canada was kind of like

627
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:57,519
the leading you're not canada i want to

628
00:21:54,798 --> 00:22:01,200
say bc was the leading edge right i mean

629
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:02,879
pre pre pre-prop 215 in california they

630
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,159
were still clamping down on everybody

631
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,039
right so

632
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,360
um

633
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:08,960
vancouver was this little scene where

634
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:10,879
the american growers come up get their

635
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,038
seeds for starts

636
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,039
and uh and that was really you know

637
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:17,359
vancouver was the hub so i think the

638
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:18,960
dutch folks really saw that you know

639
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:21,199
canada was kind of the leading edge of a

640
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,319
new territory and obviously they wanted

641
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,000
to have their seeds in that new

642
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:25,599
territory

643
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,839
it was their input to north america

644
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:29,119
really even to the u.s scene by by

645
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:30,879
people traveling up to canada it's much

646
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:33,439
easier to get to canada than obviously

647
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,559
amsterdam exactly and nail too you know

648
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,840
i mean there's people that are

649
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:37,200
comfortable coming up and bringing the

650
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:39,119
food back and then there's the mail

651
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,640
order guys that skip them and

652
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:42,639
yep people come back and ship them

653
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,360
themselves you know i mean

654
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,200
oh yeah like the seed scene down in on

655
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:49,199
hastings street especially at work at

656
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,240
mark's at hempyc or cannabis culture

657
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,640
like on saturdays man the yankee lineup

658
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,599
was out the door like people coming

659
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,038
buying seeds and of course back then you

660
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:00,639
know mark would owe us all these like

661
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:02,400
seat producers money and he'd give us

662
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,720
his card and on the back of the card it

663
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,080
said i owe you 500 bucks and every

664
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,558
saturday you can come down and pick it

665
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:10,480
up so of course there'd be like six seed

666
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:12,000
guys on a couch and we're all waiting

667
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,120
for the next yank to throw the money

668
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,038
down so we could get cashed out

669
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:19,519
because it was we were just totally

670
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:21,599
frightened by so it was so sketchy down

671
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:23,679
there like there was oh i bet so much

672
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:25,279
dodginess going on down there and but it

673
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:28,000
was the only way we could get paid back

674
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:30,158
in those days um so we again met a lot

675
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,119
of folks

676
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,200
down there

677
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:35,678
uh and made a lot of great connections

678
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,679
and uh yeah it was a trip being a part

679
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,840
of that whole thing honestly my favorite

680
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,278
part of that scene down there and ryan i

681
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:43,038
mean did you did you spend a lot of time

682
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:44,558
at bump brothers ryan

683
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:46,798
i did a little blunt brothers when i

684
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:48,240
moved out there for ubc i never i stayed

685
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:51,720
away from mark emery because i just

686
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,720
thought he was successful

687
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:56,640
[Laughter]

688
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:59,759
[Music]

689
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:02,080
when i first moved to vancouver i

690
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:05,119
a friend of mine flew me out from london

691
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:07,519
actually to vancouver but we had a room

692
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:08,139
in the the old crosstown traffic

693
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:09,839
building

694
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:13,840
[Laughter]

695
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:16,399
and it was sketchy as [ __ ] in there

696
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:20,000
and yeah i lived in that area for a

697
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:22,000
couple years and yeah wow crazy man well

698
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,240
you've seen some [ __ ] then

699
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,919
yeah well like i i wanted to ask you

700
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,880
guys some questions because like back

701
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:31,038
then for me this is like i would say 98

702
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,240
to like 2000 maybe

703
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:36,079
the texan time warp was pretty huge

704
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,400
i had friends on the island there that

705
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:39,678
were always hooking me up and stuff but

706
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,000
uh

707
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:45,519
uh are is that still kicking or like are

708
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,759
those people still doing stuff

709
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:50,240
i i recently in the last six years spent

710
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:52,158
two years living in giles bay on texas

711
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,079
islands okay and i spent two years in

712
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,760
powell river as well i was i was growing

713
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:58,399
on taxation actually

714
00:24:55,759 --> 00:25:00,079
um and so um i can let you know

715
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,840
unequivocally this is a true story

716
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:03,439
because i met the folks

717
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:05,199
so there was a there was a family

718
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,720
essentially in the 70s that had the

719
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:12,319
original cut 79 and that cut was pretty

720
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:15,360
much kept uh or passed down or in or

721
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:18,158
ibl'ed to be quite frank um

722
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:19,918
up until about late 80s and then you

723
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,278
know then there was other cuts that were

724
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,038
just called time warp because you could

725
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:24,319
get the money from them uh you know and

726
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:25,919
so that was really tough but the

727
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:29,678
original family still lives on the

728
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:31,440
island um third generation um

729
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,038
pop armor is still there uh they are

730
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,960
still growing it's not the original the

731
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:38,240
original has been lost for decades um

732
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,400
but it is of that line yeah um and now

733
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,798
like pine war pine berry i mean there's

734
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,840
a lot of really classic cultivars that

735
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:47,278
come out of that area um again i mean

736
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:49,439
it's funny textada it's just one of

737
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:50,640
these wacky places man that just exists

738
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,240
in the world and you really don't

739
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,919
believe it until you actually see it for

740
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,839
yourself right yeah

741
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,759
there's two cops on the island that's it

742
00:25:55,839 --> 00:26:00,639
yeah

743
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:02,879
i i lived on salt off salt spring island

744
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,919
for a summer and like they don't have

745
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,919
cops at all

746
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,679
they'll have cops show up on a tuesday

747
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,799
and they drive around the island and

748
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,159
they leave

749
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:13,759
and essentially like the mentality is if

750
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,760
you're not hurting another person we

751
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:18,000
don't give a [ __ ] so there was like a

752
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:19,919
peyote church there there was a lot of

753
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,319
[ __ ] there that's right

754
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,320
i mean it was just like complete freedom

755
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:26,879
you know on those islands gulf islands

756
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:29,359
are a unique and beautiful and amazing

757
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,960
place to be um back in those days too

758
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:32,639
right the early nineties leskidi was

759
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,640
like they were probably tons of dope off

760
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,240
of skitty yeah well they they're known

761
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,120
for having like the mighty mite the

762
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,120
lesquity mighty

763
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,320
from arthrology i don't know if you're

764
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,400
going way back now but

765
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:45,918
there was a kind of a dispensary called

766
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,759
arthrology before there were

767
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,919
dispensaries and this guy named norm

768
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:52,000
from musketeer island he was one of the

769
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,240
guys that kind of started this in fact

770
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,359
he came out and told everybody in high

771
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,200
times magazine we're about twisty and

772
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:01,918
goddamn the next season the whole thing

773
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,679
was raided by the cops

774
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,559
never saw norm back in the scene after

775
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:08,400
that

776
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:10,558
yeah

777
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,798
i actually had some but i'd heard of

778
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:15,519
leskidi way earlier i remember i had a

779
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:17,759
friend that was out working at a ski or

780
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:19,679
a hiking cottage like a helicopter and

781
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:21,919
hiking cottage kind of thing

782
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,759
in the middle of alberta and he sent me

783
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,679
some bud back that one of his buddies

784
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:27,679
from leskidi had brought out and he

785
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,440
called it lestigi sweetie

786
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,960
and it was some of the strongest herb

787
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,558
that i'd smoked when i was like one of

788
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,880
my last years of high school

789
00:27:32,558 --> 00:27:37,200
really really [ __ ] potent dope

790
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,600
it's it's man the weather patterns

791
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,200
around those two islands exceeding texas

792
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:43,278
are their own weather patterns you can

793
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,360
get away with going deep into late

794
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:48,159
september early october without the rain

795
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:49,918
melting everything yeah um and and

796
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,520
there's just quite frankly there's not

797
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,440
resources anymore for people to be

798
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:55,038
busting or back then there wasn't any

799
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,798
ways i mean they got a little crazy with

800
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:58,319
the helicopters a couple of years when

801
00:27:56,798 --> 00:28:00,639
we had some conservative governments in

802
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:02,558
but um it was just freedom man and you

803
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,360
could get good money for poundage back

804
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:08,240
in those days for outdoor though um you

805
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:09,918
know you can't give away outdoor now

806
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,079
those were american choppers back then

807
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,759
though in like the you know 94 to 96

808
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:15,839
they were like the black the black

809
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:17,440
copters right yeah that's that's right

810
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:18,639
you know he so i'm going to jump around

811
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,798
a little bit but i'm going to go back to

812
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,919
the pop block for a second when mark got

813
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:26,480
busted okay so during that time on the

814
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,240
pot block a lot of movie scenes sets

815
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,399
would set up on that pop block all the

816
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,399
time like when you see a down and dirty

817
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:34,479
back alley it's it's right behind me

818
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:36,639
he's tasting sadly near camby like

819
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,399
that's in every goddamn movie so we were

820
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,840
just used to it being shut down and i

821
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:43,918
had my seat office was about two

822
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:46,319
buildings down from from cannabis

823
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:48,080
culture and uh we had an office there

824
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:49,038
you know with administrative assistants

825
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:50,000
and that's what we shipped everything

826
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:51,359
out of

827
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,960

you don't want to be here and i'm like

844
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:22,798
this is real

845
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:24,719
this is why are there balaclava dea

846
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:26,158
agents taking away a canadian citizen i

847
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,120
don't understand that doesn't make any

848
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:31,360
sense yeah we it was ludicrous man like

849
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:34,479
the party was over after that you know

850
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:36,479
um we were so felt so free and so you

851
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,200
know wonderful about what we had done

852
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,759
and quite entitled to be quite frank uh

853
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,120
and the the fact that our government was

854
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:45,038
going to allow foreign governments

855
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:47,199
police force to come up and and arrest

856
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:49,119
the canadian national for something that

857
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:52,640
the the canadians themselves wouldn't

858
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:55,278
bust them on was abhorrent

859
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,200
insane and even if he was a [ __ ] bad

860
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:58,960
yeah even if he was a [ __ ] exactly

861
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,480
it's it's not the it's not the point

862
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,840
right but what he is personally with

863
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,599
what he was doing he shouldn't have been

864
00:30:01,839 --> 00:30:04,480
arrested for i'm sure it was about 10

865
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:07,038
000 other things he could have been

866
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,399
arrested for but not that yeah you know

867
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:10,240
and i remember

868
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:11,839
remember ryan were you part of that at

869
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,278
that point when we all got together at

870
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:16,079
john's

871
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:18,159
no i was up island with dj on that day i

872
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:19,599
remember i remember i was right at that

873
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,840
moment that you're talking about i think

874
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:23,599
he called me pretty much right away yeah

875
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:26,000
but i was sitting around with funny

876
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:27,519
enough charles scott and dj short up on

877
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,480
victory

878
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:32,798
everybody's favorite reaper man

879
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,319
yeah no it was that was a bizarre thing

880
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:36,319
we were invited to go up there so dan

881
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:38,000
and i drove up and uh and spent the

882
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:40,158
night in the teepee up there

883
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,558
but uh it just happened to be that very

884
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,559
day and i remember all three of our

885
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:46,240
phones rang within like 30 seconds of

886
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:47,678
each other and it was some one some

887
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,798
person in the community mark's getting

888
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,159
rested

889
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:51,839
you know and we were with charles and he

890
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,000
was you know selling stuff down to the

891
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:55,359
states at that point in time too so

892
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,119
you know we wanted to make a pretty

893
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:58,879
hasty retreat from there because we

894
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:00,319
thought that that place might be next

895
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,360
right yeah

896
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:03,759
well

897
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:05,678
as as mark was the largest seed seller

898
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:07,440
in north america at the time our company

899
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,759
was number two so we were genuinely

900
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,200
freaked out about that sure there was a

901
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:12,960
number of us um that were in the

902
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,919
cannabis community the owners of blunt

903
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,919
brothers karen watson myself um

904
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:20,640
another couple of key big growers in

905
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:25,278
town that all ended up at john conroy's

906
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:26,720
farm um a very famous uh cannabis lawyer

907
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:28,558
many constitutional one many

908
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,919
constitutional challenges in canada and

909
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:31,678
there's all of us sitting there and

910
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,960
john's is like doing triage we're all

911
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,200
freaked out and john's kind of trying to

912
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,640
talk us down yeah and i remember one of

913
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,240
us saying i wish they would have just

914
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,759
given us a heads up you know before they

915
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,240
did this and john looks at us all he's

916
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:46,759
like they just did [ __ ]

917
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,759
like fair enough

918
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:49,759
yeah funnily enough too that i mean

919
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:51,038
another thing that was just a weird

920
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:54,240
bizarre

921
00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:56,480
coincidence was that the um

922
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,919
jorge cervantes and the high times crew

923
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,519
had been up

924
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:03,360
um filming this bc bud video high times

925
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,919
bc bud video you know where george used

926
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:07,199
to dress up in the in the roster

927
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,159
yeah yeah

928
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,200
and so

929
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,960
um

930
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,120
another set of business friends of ours

931
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,519
had bought the bank across the street

932
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:16,319
from mark emery's shop right it was like

933
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,278
this

934
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:21,278
two-story old like you know early 1900's

935
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:23,038
built bank with a vault and they were

936
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:24,960
going to turn it into a club

937
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:26,240
and as that was like you know the

938
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,440
process was coming together and they

939
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,079
were raising money to get the club

940
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:33,440
together it was sitting empty so

941
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:35,359
george and co built a grow room

942
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,840
in this bank across the street from

943
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:39,278
[ __ ] from emery's shop just to

944
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:40,798
something we could use as a stage right

945
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:42,240
so that we could film this video it

946
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:44,079
wasn't yeah it was never going to get

947
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,159
lit up and plants but we you know we

948
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:47,678
built it so for the video you can show

949
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,120
this is how to build a grow room kind of

950
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:51,440
thing sure

951
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:53,759
little do we know the dea are all over

952
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,919
the [ __ ] block right like yeah i'm

953
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:57,839
pulling up in my in my explorer and

954
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:00,799
unloading all this grow equipment into

955
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:02,558
the [ __ ] bank

956
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:05,038
and the dea are sticking out like they

957
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:06,889
literally hit the hit the hit the store

958
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:08,158
across the street like two days later

959
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:11,440
[Music]

960
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:12,480
it was a crazy times man

961
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,480
yeah

962
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,038
it definitely kind of was an end of an

963
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,880
era to be quite frank when when when you

964
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:21,200
know mark got popped and then blunt

965
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,799
brothers burnt down like all within a

966
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,880
matter of six months of happening that

967
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:27,200
the basically the pop block scene was

968
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,720
done and no one felt safe down there

969
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,480
anymore um you know some of the um gangs

970
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,240
had kind of taken over the street level

971
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,558
uh cannabis trade

972
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,480
making it as safe as it used to be

973
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:40,398
um and yeah just quite frankly everyone

974
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,839
kind of went their own way um

975
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:43,759
you know uh

976
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:46,158
at that point ryan you've been living in

977
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:49,440
van for how long

978
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:52,559
well this must have been like 2005.

979
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:55,600
so yeah just a couple of years okay yeah

980
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:57,359
um and uh you know we my partner karen

981
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:59,199
watson was still running the sativa

982
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:01,199
sisters kind sanctuary which was a pot

983
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,840
bed and breakfast which was so much fun

984
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,480
yeah man just having yanks come up and

985
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:08,960
and letting them be so free and watching

986
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,039
the stress melt off their face when like

987
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,878
as soon as they got to the place like an

988
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:15,358
in-house dealer came in and asked them

989
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:17,279
what they wanted you know

990
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:18,639
i'd meet them for seeds and and then

991
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,560
they would have all these just hang out

992
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,960
at the beach or go down to the pot block

there was these two undercovers they

1017
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,400
would just sit there and take pictures

1018
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:16,639
of us like

1019
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,480
every day for months and

1020
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:20,400
i get followed home and you know we'll

1021
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,559
be trashing burner phones every two

1022
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,320
weeks and i looked at my partner at one

1023
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:26,159
point in the game and i was just like i

1024
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,119
i don't want to do this anymore man like

1025
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:29,279
it's just

1026
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,880
stressing me out i just kind of met the

1027
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,320
woman i'd end up marrying and having a

1028
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,680
child with and

1029
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,039
i was like you know what man i think

1030
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:37,118
that's going to tap out because the

1031
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:38,639
harper was in things were not happening

1032
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,480
on the scene in the scene anymore i was

1033
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:41,519
getting tired of getting followed home

1034
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,000
every night

1035
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:45,519
sure i sold i ended up selling legends

1036
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,519
to a bunch of kids who ran it into the

1037
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:49,920
ground within about four months

1038
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:52,719
um and then i basically took a bit of a

1039
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:55,119
break from cannabis for um

1040
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:56,078
about seven years uh in the industry

1041
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,240
anyways

1042
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:00,800
i got into the wine business uh

1043
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:02,719
and did that uh and it wasn't until my

1044
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,880
brother-in-law kind of got me back into

1045
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:07,039
it that uh about six years ago that i

1046
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,559
kind of came back in but i guess that

1047
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:11,519
one big piece i guess we're missing is

1048
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:14,078
the piece where we we worked with the dj

1049
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:15,079
um and that was kind of happening just

1050
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:18,720
the

1051
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:21,359
2002-2003 so i had met dan um

and i i've learned new [ __ ] about him

1067
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,039
all the time because he kept his cards

1068
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,800
pretty close to his chest yeah um

1069
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:01,519
and anyways you know

1070
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,280

we met when we were over in switzerland

1072
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,079
together he came out and visit us over

1073
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,760
there we developed this great

1074
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:09,440
relationship and

1075
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,800
he turned to me once said he said you

1076
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,679
know it's time for me to make some new

1077
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:16,079
seeds and uh we were really lucky enough

1078
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:18,399
for my crew and myself to be the

1079
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:20,880
recipients of that contract we ended up

1080
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,800
making his next his first batch of seeds

1081
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,640
and that have been released in like 10

1082
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,880
years 12 years

1083
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:29,358

the chocolate one coco

1086
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:35,039

1087
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:36,480
the release that happened after our

1088
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:38,320
release that was probably about six or

1089
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,079
seven years after that uh that would

1090
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,000

1096
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:56,078
high-end which was the renee uh cross

um by neville yeah

1155
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,320
back in the day yeah that was like right

1156
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,720
around the time he was starting that

1157

seed bank or he was i mean he claims he

1158
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:02,159
was going on forever but really that was

1159
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:03,759
the start of the greenhouse seed bag

1160
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:05,838

00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,160
and switch one at that point in time no

1162

1187
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:08,318
reading the book oh that's wild man oh

1188
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,000
it was so cool man it was it was

1189
00:41:08,318 --> 00:41:12,639
definitely a bucket list kind of thing

1190
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,199

1193
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:19,679
i think

1194
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:22,318
it was done in uh the 2000s at some

1195
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:24,159
point okay i haven't yet it's i gotta

1196
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:25,838
find it okay very cool it's good but

1197
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:27,118
it's nothing compared to the book no

1198
00:41:25,838 --> 00:41:29,838
nothing compared to the book believe

1199
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:32,000
that so much stuff in the book

1200
00:41:29,838 --> 00:41:33,679
yeah yeah the book's good i have a few i

1201
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,760
i think i have one written by his wife

1202
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:37,759
as well if i remember correctly yeah she

1203
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,040

1204
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,040
he wasn't too thrilled about it

1205
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:46,480
there's always another side of the story

1206
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,119
right

1207
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,318

about three uh harvests out in the

1316
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:54,159
season and we always we always be done

1317
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,480
and out before labor day before the

1318
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:58,318
helicopter started buzzing so we and

1319
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,079
plus it would be so dry back that time

1320
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:02,800
of year that back in the day when things

1321
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:04,480
got dry um that you get top dollar for

1322
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,920
your gear and you were doing these shade

1323
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,719
crops so it was kind of like greenhouse

1324
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,880
though

1325
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:11,279
and but we could pass it off as like hot

1326
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:14,559
high-end be indoor and get yeah kid

1327
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:16,319
money but man i learned so much um just

1328
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:19,759
being out in the you know up in the

1329
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:22,079
plateau at 5000 feet elevation

1330
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,440
um sun beating down on us in the middle

1331
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:26,640
of bloody nowhere

1332
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:28,480
uh bears chasing us cattle ranch walking

1333
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:31,838
over a cattle rock and walking over our

1334
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:34,318
damn pits we had a the telus blimp one

1335
00:46:31,838 --> 00:46:36,559
day flew like 50 feet over our heads and

1336
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:38,719
of course just freaking us out and

1337
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:40,799
uh just drinking beers eating good food

1338
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:42,719
telling lies

1339
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:45,599
growing dope it was just a lot of fun

1340
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:47,279
man honestly as far as that did my heart

1341
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:51,280
warm that was my favorite part because

1342
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:51,280
everything else i did was very stressful

1343
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:55,039
but i felt safe there and it was with

1344
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:57,039
good friends and

1345
00:46:55,039 --> 00:46:59,279
you know i still liked trimmers back

1346
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:00,480
then you know so it was okay to hang out

1347
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,400
with them and

1348
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:04,400
and um just learning about people's

1349
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,079
experiences with the plant how they came

1350
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,599
to be in this crazy place where we were

1351
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:09,440
trimming up the you know three two or

1352
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:11,119
three hundred pounds of dope in a season

1353
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,358
yeah and um

1354
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:15,119
that was my my one of my funnest events

1355
00:47:13,358 --> 00:47:16,719
with cannabis i mean i've had a lot of

1356
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:19,519
really unique experiences and a lot of

1357
00:47:16,719 --> 00:47:22,078
very stressful experiences

1358
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:24,079
because of the time frame that my um

1359
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:26,000
kind of life was in this in this

1360
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:28,400
industry uh but i said that that was

1361
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,760
probably my favorite what about you ryan

1362
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,358
it's kind of you got to love everything

1363
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,520
i mean i always say when people ask me

1364
00:47:31,358 --> 00:47:35,358
what's your favorite culture i mean it's

1365
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:37,119
like it's like children you know they

1366
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:38,558
become like your children

1367
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:40,000
so you kind of love them all for a

1368
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:41,519
different reason

1369
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
but yeah for me it's just always

1370
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:46,400
screening you know the screening and the

1371
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,559
and looking to see what what the crosses

1372
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,960
did and trying to understand like the

1373
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:52,720
the patterns of inheritance and

1374
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,639
you know getting to explore new traits

1375
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:56,078
that you don't like i mean

1376
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:58,239
i got this one girl going on right now

1377
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:00,960
we're doing a sour diesel sweet skunk

1378
00:47:58,239 --> 00:48:03,519
screen of like 150 seedlings

1379
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:06,960
and you know sour diesel like the ecsd

1380
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:08,800
cut is all fuel right yep and

1381
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,480
this is the first time i've i've really

1382
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,240
grown these ones out large selection and

1383
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,559
man it's just like that that nose

1384
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:16,959
profile from the sour d just got stomped

1385
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:19,440
on oh by the complete skunk yeah like

1386
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,679
you think that that fueliness was just

1387
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,599
dominant over this but and you know i've

1388
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:25,118
seen it a few times like you get the

1389
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:27,760
surprise a few times and you make it

1390
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:29,440
cross and it just comes out completely

1391
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,280
yeah unexpected to what you you'd be

1392
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,039
looking at but within that there's

1393
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:35,440
always these new interesting nose

1394
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:37,039
profiles right yeah and whether it's a

1395
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,599
combination of esters and chirps or

1396
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:41,039
whatever whatever it is you know

1397
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:42,559
there's some really interesting scents

1398
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:45,039
in there so that's that's kind of always

1399
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:46,640
been my you know favorite thing is

1400
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:48,239
is doing it that way

1401
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:50,000
you know it's a totally different

1402
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:52,000
experience having the lab to lay on top

1403
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,920
of that too right so oh yeah

1404
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,760
because then you can just the gains that

1405
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,440
you can make when you have you know

1406
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,720
chemical fingerprints both cannabinoids

1407
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,920
and terpenes

1408
00:48:58,719 --> 00:49:01,118
of the plants that you're mating

1409
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,760
together

1410
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:05,760
it's really remarkable yeah that's one

1411
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,680
step i've never taken

1412
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,880
including lab results and all that stuff

1413
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:10,480
while you're doing the breeding and

1414
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,760
going through the progeny that that is

1415
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:13,199
so valuable

1416
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,559
yeah well and you know when you do it

1417
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:15,838
you you can kind of do it when you're

1418
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:17,599
doing the females you can kind of do it

1419
00:49:15,838 --> 00:49:19,679
with your nose but when we were always

1420
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:21,680
when we were using males in the past

1421
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:23,199
you're really [ __ ] hitting blind yeah

1422
00:49:21,679 --> 00:49:24,639
you are you're waiting to see if the

1423
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:26,399
progeny carried on the traits you want

1424
00:49:24,639 --> 00:49:28,078
if not you got to start over well and

1425
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,160
often even trying to evaluate like a

1426
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:32,480
male plant the male plants don't really

1427
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:34,318
demonstrate those traits anyway right

1428
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,318
like no you're right yeah it's just

1429
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:37,599
logical and that's a guess at that too

1430
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:39,279
right yeah and we've done all sorts of

1431
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:41,119
things like trying to spray up on the

1432
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,200
plants and try to get them to produce

1433
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:45,039
female flowers and they do that but you

1434
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:48,159
know ethaphon also changes the terpene

1435
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:50,400
profile as well yes so it's you know

1436
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:51,279
it's it's a hint at what you're doing

1437
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,720
just this

1438
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,200
glimpse yeah and you don't know if it's

1439
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:56,959
going to breed true for that trait and

1440
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:58,719
that's the whole thing is that even when

1441
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,039
you do have the fingerprint

1442
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:03,519
in the lab like you know you say you've

1443
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:05,199
got one you've got three plants that all

1444
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:07,119
look the same in the

1445
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:09,199
uh or they look almost the same they

1446
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:10,880
smell all almost the same

1447
00:50:09,199 --> 00:50:12,719
and you let's call them plants one two

1448
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:15,599
and three you cross plant one to plant

1449
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:17,679
two and plant one to plant three

1450
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:19,200
you and plant two to plant three and you

1451
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:20,480
grow them all out you can actually

1452
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:21,679
realize that even though all those

1453
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,880
plants they look the same and they

1454
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:27,519
smelled the same one of them had genes

1455
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,838
from another smell and look right so one

1456
00:50:27,519 --> 00:50:31,679
one cross they don't end up looking the

1457
00:50:29,838 --> 00:50:34,318
same whereas like you know

1458
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:35,919
they cross two to one

1459
00:50:34,318 --> 00:50:38,400
they all look the same they smell the

1460
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:40,880
same right so yeah they can you know

1461
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:43,358
genotype can essentially hide behind

1462
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,280
chemotype right yeah yeah um but

1463
00:50:43,358 --> 00:50:47,838
hemotype is a good predictor but it's

1464
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:50,079
not a hundred percent that's right right

1465
00:50:47,838 --> 00:50:52,480
but it but yeah when you breed chemotype

1466
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:54,318
two chemotype

1467
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:56,719
the differences between you know

1468
00:50:54,318 --> 00:50:58,800
crossing a blind male to a chemotype is

1469
00:50:56,719 --> 00:51:00,639
just night and day

1470
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,318
right and you really can start

1471
00:51:00,639 --> 00:51:04,318
stabilizing things and making your seed

1472
00:51:02,318 --> 00:51:06,960
lots a lot more that much more uniform

1473
00:51:04,318 --> 00:51:08,239
it's [ __ ] expensive dude i bet that's

1474
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,280
the one thing that's precluded me from

1475
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:10,959
doing it

1476
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,640
yeah well i mean and even if you do it

1477
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:15,199
in-house and you can get your your

1478
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:17,199
consumables cost down to say like 25-30

1479
00:51:15,199 --> 00:51:19,039
bucks a sample yeah you know you want to

1480
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:21,759
run a thousand plants that's [ __ ] 25

1481
00:51:19,039 --> 00:51:23,119
000 yeah that's a serious project

1482
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:25,680
yeah well it's probably more than the

1483
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:28,160
weed is worth from the crop absolutely

1484
00:51:25,679 --> 00:51:30,639
yeah right so it's like it's a hard

1485
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:32,799
thing to justify to be able to do

1486
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:34,838
but when you do do it

1487
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:37,039
the the games are

1488
00:51:34,838 --> 00:51:38,639
undeniable oh yeah

1489
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:40,639
right and this is what's gonna have to

1490
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:42,639
happen moving forward in the canadian

1491
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:44,799
scene if if these companies don't start

1492
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:46,960
putting money into r d and really

1493
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:49,599
starting to look at the same five plate

1494
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:51,280
flavor profiles that like are prodigious

1495
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:53,760
wrote the entire goddamn ministry up

1496
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,280
here in canada right now then you know

1497
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,800
we're doomed and i think that the

1498
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,400
smarter companies are starting to figure

1499
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,760
that out and i really i really hope that

1500
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,920
to be true as well to be quite frank

1501
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:03,520
because i'm tired of smoking the same

1502
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,280
old [ __ ] and if i

1503
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:06,559
push this kush that cookie this cookie

1504
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,559
that yep

1505
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:09,760
man i'm done yeah and you guys you know

1506
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:11,359
i think the states has always been a

1507
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:13,280
little more advanced than canada has in

1508
00:52:11,358 --> 00:52:14,400
that um

1509
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,160
you know and i think that the real

1510
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:18,400
reason is you guys have a client base or

1511
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:20,719
a market a consumer base that's willing

1512
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,880
to spend 500 bucks a house yeah yeah

1513
00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:24,639
right some places for sure

1514
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,920
you know i mean new york used to be like

1515
00:52:24,639 --> 00:52:27,838
seven thousand dollars a pound for

1516
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,039
saturday right i mean that was a period

1517
00:52:27,838 --> 00:52:30,159
of time but

1518
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:31,599
um

1519
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:33,440
you'd never get that kind of money in

1520
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:35,519
canada right but people just couldn't

1521
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,280
afford wouldn't pay that kind of money

1522
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:39,519
um and when you when you do spend that

1523
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:41,280
kind of money it allows you to

1524
00:52:39,519 --> 00:52:43,039
put all those nice beautiful finishing

1525
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,400
touches and grow the small yielding

1526
00:52:43,039 --> 00:52:46,639
varieties with the unite with the

1527
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:49,280
exciting flavor profiles but it will be

1528
00:52:46,639 --> 00:52:52,159
interesting to see like which mistakes

1529
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:53,440
the the developing legal market follows

1530
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:55,519
like in the same way that we did in

1531
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:57,679
canada you know like the the pub

1532
00:52:55,519 --> 00:52:59,119
coefficient like this big these big

1533
00:52:57,679 --> 00:53:01,199
corporate companies coming in and trying

1534
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:03,280
to take over the industry

1535
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:05,199
they don't have the same

1536
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:07,440
view of the marketplace the way that the

1537
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:08,960
consumers don't do and so i think

1538
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,639
markets like california they're going to

1539
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:12,400
be able to maintain

1540
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:13,759
but some of these less developed markets

1541
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,838
as they come online i think that they're

1542
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,359
going to suffer a lot of the same

1543
00:53:15,838 --> 00:53:18,558
the same places because the government's

1544
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:20,000
you know they don't want to give out 100

1545
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:21,440
license they want to give it two three

1546
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,599
licenses and then you only have to

1547
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,119
monitor a few groups yeah absolutely

1548
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:26,559
well but if all those groups are like

1549
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:28,880
big corporate dudes that are just trying

1550
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:30,160
to pump out like a million square feet

1551
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,079
of flower

1552
00:53:30,159 --> 00:53:33,838
your quality is gone right because it's

1553
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:36,000
like you can't do that much bulk and

1554
00:53:33,838 --> 00:53:37,679
maintain the levels

1555
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,358
expect yeah

1556
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:41,358
and i noticed a lot of these companies

1557
00:53:39,358 --> 00:53:42,799
uh the the major corporate companies

1558
00:53:41,358 --> 00:53:44,159
they're coming into a market that they

1559
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,359
just clearly don't understand and they

1560
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:46,318
don't understand the characters in the

1561
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:48,078
market

1562
00:53:46,318 --> 00:53:50,719
and usually the first people that they

1563
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:52,079
run into are the people that have also

1564
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:54,558
no understanding of the market but they

1565
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:56,400
sell themselves as that you know premier

1566
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:58,800
master breeder grower and that's that's

1567
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,400
been a big problem in the us is that

1568
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,880
most of these big corporations hire

1569
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:05,119
whoever comes first uh with the best

1570
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,720
sales pitch and and

1571
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:08,160
anybody that they end up hiring after

1572
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:10,879
usually has to clean up the mess of the

1573
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:12,960
first one which is a double task oh man

1574
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,800
you speak in my language yeah

1575
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:17,039
i know there's no idea some of the

1576
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:18,640
messes that had to be cleaned up up here

1577
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:20,239
it's it's really

1578
00:54:18,639 --> 00:54:21,358
like you know you sure there's a lot of

1579
00:54:20,239 --> 00:54:22,558
people that have made money but there's

1580
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:25,440
a lot of people that have lost their

1581
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:27,359
shirt oh yeah you know

1582
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,400
investors going in with the wrong grower

1583
00:54:27,358 --> 00:54:29,838
or

1584
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,760
you know i remember doing a tour in

1585
00:54:29,838 --> 00:54:32,719
colorado and i went and saw this place

1586
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,839
and

1587
00:54:32,719 --> 00:54:36,000
i was toured a bunch of different

1588
00:54:33,838 --> 00:54:37,199
facilities and this this lighting

1589
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,119
company asked me to come by and see

1590
00:54:37,199 --> 00:54:41,039
theirs and they had a grower

1591
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:43,760
who who claimed to have written the book

1592
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:45,920
on led growing and he actually had a

1593
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:48,000
book how to grow marrow or cannabis with

1594
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,519
leds or something like that

1595
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,798
indeed the plants looked so [ __ ] up

1596
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:53,119
like they were they were they were

1597
00:54:50,798 --> 00:54:55,759
having serious nutrient deficiencies ph

1598
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:57,358
issues yeah and you could walk in i saw

1599
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,200
it right away i was like oh your ph is

1600
00:54:57,358 --> 00:55:01,279
way too low you're locking out magnesium

1601
00:54:59,199 --> 00:55:02,719
and calcium and you know the plants are

1602
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:05,280
crazy stressed

1603
00:55:02,719 --> 00:55:06,719
and so i i was the the boss was like hey

1604
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:08,160
can you walk through our facility and

1605
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:09,519
have a look and tell tell me what's

1606
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:11,358
going on

1607
00:55:09,519 --> 00:55:12,719
and i was like okay grow our guy like

1608
00:55:11,358 --> 00:55:15,759
what's the ph going on he's like i don't

1609
00:55:12,719 --> 00:55:15,759
know we don't have a ph meter

1610
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,880
and i was like he's like well we got one

1611
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:20,240
but it's

1612
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,599
you know on that shelf when nobody ever

1613
00:55:20,239 --> 00:55:23,199
uses it i was like go get your [ __ ]

1614
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:25,359
php to calibrate it didn't have

1615
00:55:23,199 --> 00:55:26,719
calibration so i sent him out to the

1616
00:55:25,358 --> 00:55:28,798
grow store to get like you know

1617
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:30,399
distilled water and calibration solution

1618
00:55:28,798 --> 00:55:32,079
for his feet

1619
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,358
and he came back and we ran this test

1620
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:35,920
but it was like

1621
00:55:33,358 --> 00:55:38,480
you know he he was he had been spinning

1622
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:40,639
this tale of lies to the investors

1623
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:42,000
about what was going wrong and the truth

1624
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:44,318
was that he was completely [ __ ]

1625
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,239
incompetent as a grower way over his

1626
00:55:44,318 --> 00:55:49,119
head in like a facilities like you know

1627
00:55:46,239 --> 00:55:51,358
50 60 000 watt facility and just had no

1628
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:52,798
clue what he was doing at all right and

1629
00:55:51,358 --> 00:55:54,078
and started the story and i pulled the

1630
00:55:52,798 --> 00:55:55,599
owners inside and i said it was the

1631
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:57,680
first time i've ever done it i felt

1632
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:59,680
really bad but i was like you guys need

1633
00:55:57,679 --> 00:56:01,440
to fire this dude

1634
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:02,960
and get rid of this grower

1635
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:05,519
because he's [ __ ] up your show he's

1636
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:07,519
[ __ ] up your investment right

1637
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:09,358
and but it's you see it i mean and it's

1638
00:56:07,519 --> 00:56:11,519
not just in the grow side it's in the

1639
00:56:09,358 --> 00:56:14,000
sales side it's in the processing side

1640
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:15,519
it's in the marketing sound

1641
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,440
it's again because because again you get

1642
00:56:15,519 --> 00:56:19,920
these peoples that come from you know

1643
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:21,280
consumer packaged goods from cpg

1644
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,880
and they're used to running these big

1645
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:25,280
companies just treating like whatever

1646
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:26,960
product it is like a widget and applying

1647
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:28,240
the same you know

1648
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:30,480
supply chain

1649
00:56:28,239 --> 00:56:32,558
procedures to that and you can't do that

1650
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:34,000
with cannabis right cannabis is like

1651
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:35,599
shipping fresh strawberries it's not

1652
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,000
like shipping like

1653
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:40,640
widgets from china exactly

1654
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,838
right um and the whole supply chain

1655
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:44,000
needs to respect that like the

1656
00:56:41,838 --> 00:56:46,318
distributors and everybody otherwise

1657
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,318
your beautiful fresh strawberries they

1658
00:56:46,318 --> 00:56:49,920
end up [ __ ] squashed and molding by

1659
00:56:48,318 --> 00:56:52,000
the time you know they're they're in

1660
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:54,400
front of the consumer and

1661
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,079
you know developing these supply chains

1662
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,559
and essentially you're building a whole

1663
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:00,318
industry from scratch it's like there's

1664
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:01,760
all these iterations that have to go on

1665
00:57:00,318 --> 00:57:03,519
right yeah

1666
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:05,839
well on top of everything then we have

1667
00:57:03,519 --> 00:57:08,719
uh provincial and federal oversight here

1668
00:57:05,838 --> 00:57:10,880
in canada which is stifling innovation

1669
00:57:08,719 --> 00:57:12,719
uh stifling um

1670
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:15,039
moving the the needle on the industry

1671
00:57:12,719 --> 00:57:17,199
forward and in fact in some respects

1672
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:19,039
it's it's pushing it backwards the fact

1673
00:57:17,199 --> 00:57:21,679
that we as in a province have to sell to

1674
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:23,759
a provincial board is [ __ ] insane

1675
00:57:21,679 --> 00:57:26,558
that is insane

1676
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:28,640
like so this 25 25 year old girl who got

1677
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:30,400
a government job and is in charge of

1678
00:57:28,639 --> 00:57:32,798
saying yes or no to the skews that i

1679
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:34,318
bring to to to the province to be able

1680
00:57:32,798 --> 00:57:35,679
to sell for my small cannabis grower

1681
00:57:34,318 --> 00:57:36,639
she's going to tell me what she thinks

1682
00:57:35,679 --> 00:57:37,759
she's going to what they're going to

1683
00:57:36,639 --> 00:57:39,358
sell

1684
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:41,599
because her last job is at best buy i

1685
00:57:39,358 --> 00:57:43,519
mean yeah give me a break yeah like it's

1686
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:45,280
insane and it's it's it's downright

1687
00:57:43,519 --> 00:57:47,759
criminal people have invested their

1688
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:49,519
lives millions and millions of dollars

1689
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:51,200
and then they grow a crop and they bring

1690
00:57:49,519 --> 00:57:52,880
it to a provincial board the board says

1691
00:57:51,199 --> 00:57:54,239
no we've already got three three other

1692
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:56,480
scentsy stars we don't want your fourth

1693
00:57:54,239 --> 00:57:57,679
one sorry you're just like well but why

1694
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,760
why can't i just go right to the store

1695
00:57:57,679 --> 00:58:01,440
and sell it to them then yeah there's so

1696
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:04,400
much more that needs to be done up here

1697
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:05,838
um wow but it's canada man like we love

1698
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,599
government

1699
00:58:05,838 --> 00:58:09,599
yeah yeah that's the thing with with

1700
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:12,160
oversight like that it does stifle

1701
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:14,960
progression in all industry

1702
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:15,759
too much oversight yeah absolutely

1703
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,519
yeah

1704
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:19,920
i think you will be remiss if i don't

1705
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:20,838
ask red about ortega in your experience

1706
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,119
with your

1707
00:58:20,838 --> 00:58:24,558
ortega my experience will tell you what

1708
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:26,960
when i was over in switzerland was the

1709
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:29,200
first time i'd heard about ortega um

1710
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:31,599
we uh i was with a business partner over

1711
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:33,919
there in a project and another one of

1712
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:36,480
our potential business partners flew

1713
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,519
over from california with a couple cuts

1714
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,358
um

1715
00:58:37,519 --> 00:58:41,440
right into right into zurich and then

1716
00:58:39,358 --> 00:58:43,679
they met us down mcconnell

1717
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,480
you could say you could see what it was

1718
00:58:43,679 --> 00:58:45,279
it was

1719
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,559
all

1720
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:48,720
okay

1721
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:49,440
sorry yeah fair enough i mean geez poor

1722
00:58:48,719 --> 00:58:51,519
head

1723
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,960
anyways um i think i like yeah and

1724
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:55,440
literally i think it was like in a

1725
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:57,760
backpack it was hilarious so the two

1726
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:59,440
cuts that he brought over were ortega

1727
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:02,240
and what ended up being grapefruit which

1728
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:04,400
was crazy because yeah right of cultivar

1729
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:06,558
we were very familiar with

1730
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:08,880
um and it was a pure ortega cut so

1731
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:11,599
ortega also there was ortega one two and

1732
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:13,440
three put out by neville um well they

1733
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:15,280
were neville's last batches that he

1734
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:17,679
collected in california for c bank

1735
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:19,680
originals which was one of legends first

1736
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:21,519
companies that we ended up carrying um i

1737
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:23,199
carried egg seeds and southern tier and

1738
00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:25,440
then neville seeds the seed bank

1739
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:27,439
originals that were in ed's care and

1740
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,480
one two and three which was a hash plant

1741
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,240
cross

1742
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:32,318
okay ryan help me out here i can't

1743
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:33,598
remember which was northern lights hash

1744
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:35,358
plants

1745
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:37,039
i can't remember the other one and now

1746
00:59:35,358 --> 00:59:38,558
hash plant was the one that he told me

1747
00:59:37,039 --> 00:59:40,558
personally he's like that is the most

1748
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:41,920
potent thing i ever bred well i got to

1749
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:44,798
be honest with you

1750
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:45,920
the only from how much uh time i spent

1751
00:59:44,798 --> 00:59:49,039
with the plant was with the original

1752
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:52,880
ortega mother cut okay and that one

1753
00:59:49,039 --> 00:59:54,639
made to this day the best hash that ever

1754
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:56,079
came out of one of those little hash

1755
00:59:54,639 --> 00:59:56,879
shakers you remember those goofy little

1756
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:58,318
things

1757
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:01,519
you put the buds in a little screen you

1758
00:59:58,318 --> 01:00:01,519
ship it yeah

1759
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:08,159
you know we would always be clamoring to

1760
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:11,439
get the ortega bud into this because it

1761
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:13,920
made that black sticky gooey like almost

1762
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:14,960
import style yeah i love so much and it

1763
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:17,838
was a

1764
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:19,440
hammer of um of a plan

1765
01:00:17,838 --> 01:00:21,279
obviously we didn't have labs and things

1766
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:22,639
uh that we had access to back then but

1767
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,240
my best guess is going to be heavily

1768
01:00:22,639 --> 01:00:26,239
mirrored scene dominant because it made

1769
01:00:24,239 --> 01:00:28,318
me sleepy as a [ __ ]

1770
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:29,919
um but i mean and the size of the resin

1771
01:00:28,318 --> 01:00:32,079
heads were massive you look underneath

1772
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:33,920
the microscope they were huge compared

1773
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:36,079
to the other cultivars that we were

1774
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:40,000
growing and that um we ended up uh

1775
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:42,079
crossing the ortega mother with the um

1776
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,798
sweet tooth number three at the time and

1777
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:48,240
that that became the yeah yeah

1778
01:00:44,798 --> 01:00:50,239
sorry it was the bx 2p1 same thing

1779
01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:52,318
sorry my apology this is why ryan's here

1780
01:00:50,239 --> 01:00:54,959
if he's in a way better memory than i do

1781
01:00:52,318 --> 01:00:56,719
um and uh we we created the legends

1782
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:58,798
ultimate indigo i remember that i still

1783
01:00:56,719 --> 01:01:01,279
have seeds of it too luckily that's very

1784
01:00:58,798 --> 01:01:03,358
cool those tiny little pinheads

1785
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:05,519
um the lily was a really really popular

1786
01:01:03,358 --> 01:01:08,639
strain for our company for years uh and

1787
01:01:05,519 --> 01:01:10,559
the cuts we we had a clone house and van

1788
01:01:08,639 --> 01:01:12,318
we pumped out thousands and thousands of

1789
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:13,440
cuts a month out of that it got to the

1790
01:01:12,318 --> 01:01:14,960
point that i think we killed our own

1791
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:17,440
market within a year no one wanted it

1792
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,440
anymore

1793
01:01:20,318 --> 01:01:24,639
because it was a heavy yielder

1794
01:01:22,639 --> 01:01:27,039
it was light green check out the boxes

1795
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:28,719
as far as fires yeah you'd cut the tops

1796
01:01:27,039 --> 01:01:32,079
in six weeks right

1797
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:35,118
you'd have to cut the tops

1798
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:36,640
wow right it was so big and uh that was

1799
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:39,119
just the selected female that you guys

1800
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:41,759
had from the there was the bulky female

1801
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:43,760
yeah but my guess is that and i know i

1802
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:45,440
was bashing kush earlier but my guess is

1803
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:48,000
that the ortega is probably some form of

1804
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:50,559
kush from way back when because just the

1805
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,400
potency alone uh and the structure

1806
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:54,798
itself they were buttons it was like a

1807
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:56,720
little bushy buttons there was no cola

1808
01:01:54,798 --> 01:01:58,559
structure to them really uh just a pile

1809
01:01:56,719 --> 01:02:00,399
of buttons we grew it outdoors we grew

1810
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:02,000
it indoors i became very familiar with

1811
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:03,920
the plant uh

1812
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,838
you know a small part of me would love

1813
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:07,760
to see that out and about again but as i

1814
01:02:05,838 --> 01:02:09,440
get older it'll be quite frank my flavor

1815
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:10,799
profiles tend more towards the

1816
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:13,119
equatorials and more towards the

1817
01:02:10,798 --> 01:02:15,280
lemonade the pioneers and my favorite

1818
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:17,200
one right now is cedarine that that is

1819
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:20,240
crazy we're seeing it starting to come

1820
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:20,239
in piles of steel

1821
01:02:20,639 --> 01:02:24,400
that's popping out in cannabis like what

1822
01:02:22,159 --> 01:02:26,719
kind of strains out the cedarine uh

1823
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:28,480
mother of all berries oh yeah yeah i

1824
01:02:26,719 --> 01:02:30,318
have that cut yeah yeah mother of all

1825
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:34,079
berries and what's the other one not

1826
01:02:30,318 --> 01:02:36,159
granddaddy perps um

1827
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:37,599
of the grapes and mother mother of

1828
01:02:36,159 --> 01:02:39,519
berries those are the two that i've seen

1829
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:41,760
the cedaring uh very

1830
01:02:39,519 --> 01:02:43,358
dominant actually in the coast and man

1831
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:45,680
can you ever taste it and this is an

1832
01:02:43,358 --> 01:02:46,960
exciting kind of new flavor profile that

1833
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:48,480
is becoming more dominant that i've

1834
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:49,679
really gotten excited about because it's

1835
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:51,440
just again something different it's

1836
01:02:49,679 --> 01:02:53,279
something something new and unique yeah

1837
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:56,000
yeah it's not just smack you over the

1838
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:58,400
head with nursing and pedicure yeah yeah

1839
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,798
right and the same old same old which is

1840
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:03,280
80 percent of the [ __ ] i see every day

1841
01:03:00,798 --> 01:03:04,719
but again and that goes to equatorials

1842
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:06,160
you don't make money on if you're a

1843
01:03:04,719 --> 01:03:08,719
commercial grower

1844
01:03:06,159 --> 01:03:10,399
time wise yield wise i would keep i keep

1845
01:03:08,719 --> 01:03:11,679
threatening ryan i say you know i'm

1846
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:13,039
gonna get out of this goddamn business

1847
01:03:11,679 --> 01:03:15,118
i'm gonna open up a micro and just call

1848
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:17,760
it the house of hayes have two drops a

1849
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:20,960
year it'd be like 16 weekers and that's

1850
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:22,720
it man call it a day just you know um

1851
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:25,280
the seed markets actually

1852
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:27,439
slowly and i and i i credit a lot to

1853
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:29,280
chimera and bodhi both of them from

1854
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,720
doing work with equatorial sativas over

1855
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:32,798
the years i think that people are

1856
01:03:30,719 --> 01:03:34,798
finally starting to like realize there

1857
01:03:32,798 --> 01:03:36,239
is unique highs that you can never reach

1858
01:03:34,798 --> 01:03:37,599
in an eight week plan or a nine week

1859
01:03:36,239 --> 01:03:40,159
plant that you can get with these

1860
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:42,000
equatorial sativas and there's slowly a

1861
01:03:40,159 --> 01:03:44,318
niche market forming which is really

1862
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,519
awesome i agree i i mean i'm starting to

1863
01:03:44,318 --> 01:03:47,838
see you know when you're talking about

1864
01:03:45,519 --> 01:03:50,000
more equatorial uh leading uh cultivars

1865
01:03:47,838 --> 01:03:52,078
things like um you know that are

1866
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,760
penaline dominant you know like oh to me

1867
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:56,240
like i'm a penalty junkie it's like

1868
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:56,960
doing a line of herbal coke you know

1869
01:03:56,239 --> 01:03:59,038

um

1872
01:04:00,719 --> 01:04:04,480
you're seeing that our customers and our

1873
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:05,440
patients in the scene up here in canada

1874
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:07,199
they're starting to be a bit of a

1875
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:08,400
segment to start and understand and be

1876
01:04:07,199 --> 01:04:10,078
able to differentiate these flavor

1877
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:11,119
profiles and say hey you know what i

1878
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:12,720
don't want something that's just going

1879
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:13,680
to couch lock me on goddamn day i want

1880
01:04:12,719 --> 01:04:16,239
something that's going to be a little

1881
01:04:13,679 --> 01:04:19,199
zippier a little more fruit forward um

1882
01:04:16,239 --> 01:04:21,759
or floral in that sense yeah and um yeah

1883
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:22,879
if you ever get a chance uh you know to

1884
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,319
look at that flavor profile with the

1885
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:25,680
scenery and get all over it man because

1886
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:27,358
it's oh yeah

1887
01:04:25,679 --> 01:04:28,639
i just did some work with with mother of

1888
01:04:27,358 --> 01:04:30,719
all berries too so i'm going to check

1889
01:04:28,639 --> 01:04:32,480
that out yeah nice very cool

1890
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:33,919
yeah so you guys want to go into the

1891
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:36,079
blues

1892
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:38,880
your experience with blues

1893
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:41,039
yeah sure it's um i mean when we did the

1894
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:44,480
um the seeds for dj back in the early

1895
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:46,480
2000's i was floored at the variation i

1896
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:48,000
mean it was nuts i mean

1897
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:49,920
it felt like every plant was some

1898
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,318
different new cultivar it wasn't coming

1899
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:54,960
out of the same seed

1900
01:04:52,318 --> 01:04:55,838
the variegation the leaf variegation was

1901
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:58,240
like

1902
01:04:55,838 --> 01:04:59,920
riddled throughout um there is

1903
01:04:58,239 --> 01:05:02,239
you know uh

1904
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:04,240
you would see stuff that was super affy

1905
01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:05,439
and then you would see stuff that really

1906
01:05:04,239 --> 01:05:07,358
kind of probably lean towards that

1907
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:10,400
equatorial oaxacan

1908
01:05:07,358 --> 01:05:12,400
size that chocolate thai even i mean you

1909
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:14,559
you really believe

1910
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:16,960
dan's you know historical background on

1911
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:19,200
how he came to get these cultivars

1912
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:21,039
together because you saw them in in the

1913
01:05:19,199 --> 01:05:23,038
progeny yeah you can see a lot of the

1914
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:25,839
variations for sure

1915
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:27,440
it was disease the seeds that we got i

1916
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:29,440
don't know how they arrived in canada

1917
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:30,960
but my understanding was that they were

1918
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:34,000
these are the seeds that actually came

1919
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:36,000
back from hank at dutch passion

1920
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,239
so dj had essentially reclaimed these

1921
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,559
seeds went after their deal was it catch

1922
01:05:38,239 --> 01:05:42,639
pack no it was sega martial

1923
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:44,720
is it tony he works with both it was

1924
01:05:42,639 --> 01:05:46,558
hank it was hank brother no no it was

1925
01:05:44,719 --> 01:05:49,358
sega martha it was tony because he he

1926
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:50,720
first he did a deal with remember

1927
01:05:49,358 --> 01:05:52,960
martha was selling the blueberry at

1928
01:05:50,719 --> 01:05:54,719
first yeah and then

1929
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,318
and then hank took it over yeah okay

1930
01:05:54,719 --> 01:06:00,159
yeah okay okay

1931
01:05:56,318 --> 01:06:01,679
and so those seats have come right back

1932
01:06:00,159 --> 01:06:03,038
those seats had come back to canada and

1933
01:06:01,679 --> 01:06:05,679
in this little i think it was actually

1934
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:07,200
like a 12 or a 15 lighter

1935
01:06:05,679 --> 01:06:08,960
they grew like

1936
01:06:07,199 --> 01:06:11,038
i don't know it must have been like 350

1937
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:13,440
or 400 plants or something like that

1938
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:15,280
you talking about over at g funks

1939
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:17,519
yeah yeah yeah yeah there was there was

1940
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:20,319
350 seats um

1941
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:23,199
and uh we we had to pick males and and

1942
01:06:20,318 --> 01:06:24,960
all the different lines um picking males

1943
01:06:23,199 --> 01:06:27,279
uh man i mean that rubber smell remember

1944
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:28,960
that bloody rubber smell yeah well that

1945
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:30,559
to me that the whole line was filled

1946
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:32,480
with the rubber spence and the chocolate

1947
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:34,400
as well are you talking about the nails

1948
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:36,240
yeah specifically yeah also in the

1949
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:38,000
females though as well but i mean when

1950
01:06:36,239 --> 01:06:41,118
you rub the stalks of the males it just

1951
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:45,039
smelled like burnt rubber yeah

1952
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:46,720
i'm always rubbing milk milking yes

1953
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:47,920
but uh i mean there was there was some

1954
01:06:46,719 --> 01:06:49,838
really unique stuff i mean we were

1955
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:51,680
looking for early bars because we were

1956
01:06:49,838 --> 01:06:53,358
growing for um

1957
01:06:51,679 --> 01:06:55,038
for growers back yeah it's not a breed

1958
01:06:53,358 --> 01:06:56,558
for growers back then not for customers

1959
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:59,119
which is a whole different headset right

1960
01:06:56,559 --> 01:07:00,319
sure is um i remember

1961
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:02,798
jesus

1962
01:07:00,318 --> 01:07:04,960
uh ryan we must have had about 60 males

1963
01:07:02,798 --> 01:07:06,798
that we got down to and we were trying

1964
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:08,639
to select from those and i mean we were

1965
01:07:06,798 --> 01:07:10,559
taking shots in the dark guys of course

1966
01:07:08,639 --> 01:07:12,400
yeah with males you you are especially

1967
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:14,480
you gotta remember too that the dj was

1968
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:16,798
also still down in oregon at the time so

1969
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:18,880
he'd try to come up but you know over an

1970
01:07:16,798 --> 01:07:20,880
eight week ten-week crop it's not it's

1971
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:22,640
it's he's not you're not there enough

1972
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:25,280
now right i got a quick question to

1973
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:28,000
interject so with dj in his book he is

1974
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:30,240
quoted as saying he would take two

1975
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,159
opposite plants so constantly making an

1976
01:07:30,239 --> 01:07:33,759
f1 type but doing that in each

1977
01:07:32,159 --> 01:07:35,358
successive generation is that do you

1978
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:37,599
think that's what kept up kept up the

1979
01:07:35,358 --> 01:07:40,639
variability while also inbreeding in odd

1980
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:42,798
ways yeah i mean to me i look at it like

1981
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:46,000
i look at his whole

1982
01:07:42,798 --> 01:07:49,038
log as a family yeah right and then the

1983
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:51,599
individual lines are really like

1984
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:54,079
it's all this it's it's all intermixed

1985
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:55,200
right except the variation so high while

1986
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:57,599
inbreeding

1987
01:07:55,199 --> 01:07:58,480
yeah but it did inbreeding i mean it did

1988
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:00,400
it

1989
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:02,079
it fixed some traits but it didn't fix a

1990
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:03,599
lot of traits yeah yeah sure you know

1991
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:06,400
there's definitely a downside to doing

1992
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:07,760
it that way sure

1993
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:10,160
um

1994
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:11,440
but it's a very art based method of seed

1995
01:08:10,159 --> 01:08:13,759
production what did that was it was a

1996
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:16,399
very unique take on on breeding for sure

1997
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:17,920
yeah but at the time it was that was

1998
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:19,679
cutting edge at least he was doing it

1999
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:21,199
somebody was doing it

2000
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:23,440
he was doing it on his own

2001
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:25,519
that's that's the i think to me the most

2002
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:27,919
important thing about dj's work is that

2003
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:29,199
he like made his top crosses he created

2004
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:30,319
his family

2005
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:32,798
and then

2006
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:35,039
never added jeans from the outside yeah

2007
01:08:32,798 --> 01:08:36,640
that was so interesting it's fascinating

2008
01:08:35,039 --> 01:08:39,439
right and that's really where the to me

2009
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:42,239
the value lies because

2010
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:44,479
that to me those that family is is in

2011
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:46,399
bread yeah but when you cry when you out

2012
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:48,079
cross it that's where it shines yeah

2013
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:50,238
that's what i found and

2014
01:08:48,079 --> 01:08:50,960
it made me obsessed with the blue line

2015
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:53,198
and

2016
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:55,439
understandably so i mean all the crosses

2017
01:08:53,198 --> 01:08:57,678
we did and other seed banks did with

2018
01:08:55,439 --> 01:09:00,639
with dan's stuff all became like these

2019
01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:02,319
really incredible and uh famous bars

2020
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:04,079
that went down the line i mean yeah

2021
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:05,600
jesus uh

2022
01:09:04,079 --> 01:09:07,838
god i mean how many mean this has been

2023
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:09,279
obviously sweet tooth but uh i mean all

2024
01:09:07,838 --> 01:09:11,679
of the stuff we did with legends with

2025
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:13,520
that b133 male they were all bangers and

2026
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:14,880
i mean i loved i never got a chance to

2027
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:17,520
recreate any of them that was kind of a

2028
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:19,119
one-off yeah but i mean still always

2029
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:21,440
chasing that grape crush remember that

2030
01:09:19,119 --> 01:09:23,119
grape crush ryan that b25 was a

2031
01:09:21,439 --> 01:09:24,960
beautiful yeah yeah what was that what

2032
01:09:23,119 --> 01:09:26,798
was that mom like

2033
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:29,119
literally from 10 feet away it smelled

2034
01:09:26,798 --> 01:09:31,920
like someone just cracked open us a can

2035
01:09:29,119 --> 01:09:34,079
of grape crush and it was so sweet

2036
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:35,759
it was so strong and it was the bud

2037
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:37,600
structure was incredible it was a decent

2038
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:40,079
yielder it didn't have that funky

2039
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:41,359
variegation it wasn't and it doesn't

2040
01:09:40,079 --> 01:09:43,439
have that mutation to it it was

2041
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:45,120
literally like the shining star in the

2042
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:47,119
right hand corner

2043
01:09:45,119 --> 01:09:49,439
yeah it had this really neat flower

2044
01:09:47,119 --> 01:09:50,798
morphology too like the round was kind

2045
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:53,278
of like

2046
01:09:50,798 --> 01:09:54,719
it's kind of odd to say but it's like it

2047
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:57,920
kind of looked like the top is kind of

2048
01:09:54,719 --> 01:10:00,399
like smooth like the bezos uh rocket

2049
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:00,399
yeah yeah

2050
01:10:01,039 --> 01:10:04,319
but even like the leaves that were

2051
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:06,000
coming off like the subtending leaflets

2052
01:10:04,319 --> 01:10:08,559
like they weren't triangular they were

2053
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:11,119
more like ovoid

2054
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:13,199
yeah right and um

2055
01:10:11,119 --> 01:10:15,279
yeah and they had this like purple ring

2056
01:10:13,198 --> 01:10:17,279
kind of around the edge of the leaflet

2057
01:10:15,279 --> 01:10:19,439
and it was like a nice kind of lavender

2058
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:21,039
purple color it's so pretty like almost

2059
01:10:19,439 --> 01:10:22,799
almost into the blue it was it was one

2060
01:10:21,039 --> 01:10:24,319
of the rare ones that were almost in the

2061
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,920
blue rather than the purple you know

2062
01:10:24,319 --> 01:10:28,000
what it means yeah that's that's hard to

2063
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:29,760
find in the blues the blue colors

2064
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,760
and this the sweet blue was probably the

2065
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:34,480
most variated plant that came out of

2066
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:36,159
that room going down i mean no two no

2067
01:10:34,479 --> 01:10:37,359
two plants were the same

2068
01:10:36,158 --> 01:10:39,679
that's um

2069
01:10:37,359 --> 01:10:41,279
out of those seeds uh and to this day i

2070
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:43,600
still see people online growing the

2071
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:45,599
sweet blue and there's so much variation

2072
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:47,679
i think i still have some of those now

2073
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:50,239
that's the sweet skunk blue yeah the

2074
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:52,480
sweet i mean the sweet skunk itself is

2075
01:10:50,238 --> 01:10:54,799
all over the map yeah imagine adding

2076
01:10:52,479 --> 01:10:57,119
danny's danny's mail to it you're just

2077
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:58,880
gonna get nothing but a complete whack

2078
01:10:57,119 --> 01:11:00,319
of individuals but obviously some

2079
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:01,920
massive winners and there's some massive

2080
01:11:00,319 --> 01:11:03,279
losers too like where you get those

2081
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:05,600
plants that's just bracket on top of

2082
01:11:03,279 --> 01:11:05,599
bracket

2083
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:09,199
make great hash and i'm glad you had

2084
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:10,399
that nice one joint from that whole

2085
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:12,319
plant

2086
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:16,319
and one of you guys actually did s ones

2087
01:11:12,319 --> 01:11:17,920
of the b130 male right i did yeah oh

2088
01:11:16,319 --> 01:11:20,799
that's good to keep that's called the

2089
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:22,239
key yeah i still got those in there and

2090
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:24,880
they were and that would show up regular

2091
01:11:22,238 --> 01:11:26,879
sets using uh reverse mail

2092
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:27,679
both yeah

2093
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:29,600
yeah

2094
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:31,039
both males and females yeah yeah that

2095
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:33,120
makes sense

2096
01:11:31,039 --> 01:11:34,960
no i mean i'm excited to get into ryan's

2097
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:37,039
uh red the rest of ryan's bank once he

2098
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:38,960
gets set up in in one spot and to really

2099
01:11:37,039 --> 01:11:40,719
get a crack at what's in there because

2100
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:42,239
it's like opening up a history book and

2101
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:44,079
not only that but that you're creating

2102
01:11:42,238 --> 01:11:45,759
new history by doing it as well i can't

2103
01:11:44,079 --> 01:11:46,880
even imagine i was just going through

2104
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:48,480
the list the other day actually

2105
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:50,159
yesterday and it's like there's some

2106
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:52,319
[ __ ] that i just totally forgot that was

2107
01:11:50,158 --> 01:11:53,839
in there well this is the thing though

2108
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:56,479
because i i really believe this to be

2109
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:59,440
true is that we back in the day we bred

2110
01:11:56,479 --> 01:12:01,678
for flavor okay so and that was what was

2111
01:11:59,439 --> 01:12:04,238
our whole mantra bread for flavor

2112
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:06,319
what people breed for now is for for coa

2113
01:12:04,238 --> 01:12:08,559
numbers

2114
01:12:06,319 --> 01:12:09,920
28's the 31s so basically i take

2115
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:11,520
pictures

2116
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:12,960
right and ignite pictures you're

2117
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:14,400
absolutely right there's no flavor it's

2118
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:16,880
about how high

2119
01:12:14,399 --> 01:12:19,839
perceived how high can i get from this

2120
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:20,800
29 chc plant and it's driving me nuts

2121
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:22,800
because you're talking you're drawing

2122
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:24,800
from one small population and it's it's

2123
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:26,239
kush based it's cookies based probably

2124
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:28,400
um if they're all the same flavor

2125
01:12:26,238 --> 01:12:30,479
profiling i see these coas come across

2126
01:12:28,399 --> 01:12:33,198
my desk all day that's all i do is look

2127
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:34,639
at weed uh coas and i can tell because

2128
01:12:33,198 --> 01:12:36,559
brian's taught me to be quite frank how

2129
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:38,960
to read these things properly you can

2130
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:40,560
see the family lines and and it's all

2131
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:42,239
the same they have 20 different names

2132
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:44,480
but it's all the same damn plan yeah

2133
01:12:42,238 --> 01:12:46,319
because they're breeding for that number

2134
01:12:44,479 --> 01:12:48,000
i want to see and go back to breeding

2135
01:12:46,319 --> 01:12:49,359
for flavor and bring for flavor

2136
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,039
profiling because

2137
01:12:49,359 --> 01:12:53,599
that's what to me it makes cannabis

2138
01:12:51,039 --> 01:12:54,960
unique and interesting and and

2139
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:56,640
then you can go from there and then have

2140
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:58,319
all these different flavored hashes and

2141
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:59,679
live resident live verizon that we

2142
01:12:58,319 --> 01:13:02,000
didn't have back in the day that people

2143
01:12:59,679 --> 01:13:04,640
could actually breed for specific end

2144
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:07,359
use products right but it's not going to

2145
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:09,679
happen until r d becomes a main focus of

2146
01:13:07,359 --> 01:13:12,158
these companies um and people are going

2147
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:14,239
to be growing the same old tired ship

2148
01:13:12,158 --> 01:13:15,920
all the time yeah it's it's the same way

2149
01:13:14,238 --> 01:13:17,919
in the cut flower industry i mean if

2150
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:19,840
you're a grower that grows cut flowers

2151
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:22,319
you don't breed plants right it's a

2152
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:24,319
specific it's a specific model and i

2153
01:13:22,319 --> 01:13:26,399
mean even down in salinas when i was i

2154
01:13:24,319 --> 01:13:29,119
was down there a few years ago working

2155
01:13:26,399 --> 01:13:31,839
there was a grower that was growing the

2156
01:13:29,119 --> 01:13:33,519
phalaenopsis thaliana the the orchid

2157
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:35,039
yeah yeah orchid that you see everywhere

2158
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:36,640
with the nice pretty leaves and all the

2159
01:13:35,039 --> 01:13:38,880
different patterns on it

2160
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:41,440
and and they're actually the only orchid

2161
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:42,640
producer in north america

2162
01:13:41,439 --> 01:13:44,639
might even be the world but it was

2163
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:46,960
definitely in north america it grows

2164
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:48,320
orchids from seed yeah that's a hard

2165
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:49,840
thing to do i used to be an orchid

2166
01:13:48,319 --> 01:13:52,479
collector and growing orchids from seed

2167
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:54,319
is not [ __ ] easy yeah so what they do

2168
01:13:52,479 --> 01:13:56,559
is they grow everything from seed and

2169
01:13:54,319 --> 01:13:57,920
then they sort it by color and they

2170
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:59,760
submit it that way and then anything

2171
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:01,279
that's new and special

2172
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:03,360
they send in the tissue culture and they

2173
01:14:01,279 --> 01:14:05,119
get you know they get cut they put it

2174
01:14:03,359 --> 01:14:06,079
into the tc process they can get

2175
01:14:05,119 --> 01:14:07,599
millions

2176
01:14:06,079 --> 01:14:09,760
once you find that unique flower but

2177
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:11,520
yeah they're that's their process this

2178
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:13,520
is they just grow everything from seed

2179
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:15,440
rather than clone and it's cool that

2180
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:17,120
there's somebody doing that but yeah if

2181
01:14:15,439 --> 01:14:18,960
they weren't doing that everybody else

2182
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:20,399
is grown from tissue culture right so

2183
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:22,239
it's like as you know once you're grown

2184
01:14:20,399 --> 01:14:23,519
from tissue culture it's great for for

2185
01:14:22,238 --> 01:14:25,359
producing

2186
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:26,880
you know armies of the same plant and

2187
01:14:25,359 --> 01:14:29,359
that are sterile

2188
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:30,719
but you can't get anything new from

2189
01:14:29,359 --> 01:14:33,198
right the only way to get anything new

2190
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:35,520
is to be growing from seed yeah

2191
01:14:33,198 --> 01:14:37,119
so you i to me i really see that as a

2192
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:39,040
unique business model

2193
01:14:37,119 --> 01:14:41,119
yeah that's pretty cool too no knowing

2194
01:14:39,039 --> 01:14:43,519
the orchid i collected orchids for so

2195
01:14:41,119 --> 01:14:44,960
many years and and knowing knowing how

2196
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:46,880
hard that is to do that's a really

2197
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:48,719
interesting unique business model yeah i

2198
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:50,239
can't remember the name of the the

2199
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:51,920
grower but you should if you're down in

2200
01:14:50,238 --> 01:14:53,519
like the salinas or monterey area you

2201
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:54,800
should go and check out their grow yeah

2202
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:56,800
i need to go up there soon that's pretty

2203
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:59,760
cool so i got a question for you my

2204
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:02,000
friend so down in california i mean how

2205
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:04,159
oft like how much time does a cultivar

2206
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,319
get down there before it's out of favor

2207
01:15:04,158 --> 01:15:08,238
like what's the average timeline

2208
01:15:06,319 --> 01:15:10,399
dude okay so i i want to say there's at

2209
01:15:08,238 --> 01:15:13,599
least a eight to nine year

2210
01:15:10,399 --> 01:15:16,079
run that we've been seeing on

2211
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:17,360
the most popular stuff so like

2212
01:15:16,079 --> 01:15:18,880
i think it's getting a lot slower

2213
01:15:17,359 --> 01:15:20,719
whereas you know like

2214
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:22,640
uh it gets popular in california you'll

2215
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:25,198
see it kind of chase up to the other

2216
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:26,480
states four or five years used to be

2217
01:15:25,198 --> 01:15:27,759
eight to nine years before i started

2218
01:15:26,479 --> 01:15:29,439
hitting all the states hitting the high

2219
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:32,320
times magazine stuff that we favor down

2220
01:15:29,439 --> 01:15:34,238
here but now it's it's getting faster uh

2221
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:37,039
i mean the og kush i'm i'm shocked that

2222
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:38,639
og kush is still in so demand uh it ha

2223
01:15:37,039 --> 01:15:40,399
it's had the longest run i think out of

2224
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:42,960
any of the the clones down here before

2225
01:15:40,399 --> 01:15:44,879
that it was like hogs breath p91

2226
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:46,560
um stuff like that you know that was

2227
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:48,640
real popular in southern california but

2228
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:50,560
now you couldn't even find most of that

2229
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:52,880
stuff if you wanted to except in seed

2230
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:54,880
form now you know but og kush has stood

2231
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:56,560
the test of time cookies

2232
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:58,319
uh i think

2233
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:59,840
i don't know is that the new og it's

2234
01:15:58,319 --> 01:16:01,198
gonna be around forever and everybody's

2235
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:02,560
just gonna not be able to get high after

2236
01:16:01,198 --> 01:16:04,479
their first hit

2237
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:06,159
well this is that's not why i asked

2238
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:08,158
because in canada you got nine months

2239
01:16:06,158 --> 01:16:09,359
with a cultivar before it you no one

2240
01:16:08,158 --> 01:16:11,599
wants it anymore

2241
01:16:09,359 --> 01:16:11,599
wow

2242
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:14,960
yeah

2243
01:16:13,039 --> 01:16:16,560
partially liquor distribution branches

2244
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:19,840
but it's i mean it is a [ __ ] up

2245
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:21,600
situation like i think what happened is

2246
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:25,279
in the past it was the opposite way

2247
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:27,199
there was more variation and more um

2248
01:16:25,279 --> 01:16:28,559
more different types of branded cannabis

2249
01:16:27,198 --> 01:16:30,960
on the dispensary shelf just because i

2250
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:32,560
mean california your your dispensary

2251
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:35,039
market was like

2252
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:36,800
way more into a professional

2253
01:16:35,039 --> 01:16:38,399
cpg type system where you had real

2254
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:40,000
products like you had like potato chips

2255
01:16:38,399 --> 01:16:42,158
and soda pops

2256
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,079
and everything right

2257
01:16:42,158 --> 01:16:46,879
great vape shatter rosin i mean you got

2258
01:16:44,079 --> 01:16:48,479
it all yeah and our our

2259
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:51,600
rollout of dispensaries was a hell of a

2260
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:53,198
lot less professional more flower based

2261
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:55,840
no real like

2262
01:16:53,198 --> 01:16:57,439
i would say finished products like that

2263
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:59,440
um and i think that now that we've got

2264
01:16:57,439 --> 01:17:00,960
legalization and that brought in the

2265
01:16:59,439 --> 01:17:03,359
advent of all these different types of

2266
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:04,960
products and so i think it's kind of

2267
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:07,599
it's almost as if like the canadian

2268
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:10,239
buyer or at least the distributor

2269
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:12,000
the liquor distribution buyers

2270
01:17:10,238 --> 01:17:14,479
are like a lot more fickle

2271
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,960
yeah you know it's like if it's not new

2272
01:17:14,479 --> 01:17:18,959
they don't want it if it's if you know

2273
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:20,560
and it's like kip said earlier it's like

2274
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:22,880
you know our liquor distribution brands

2275
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:24,080
how many types of merlot or pinot noir

2276
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:26,000
do you think that they keep on their

2277
01:17:24,079 --> 01:17:28,238
shelves right right

2278
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,319
hundreds of different producers yeah

2279
01:17:28,238 --> 01:17:31,359
right whereas in the cannabis business

2280
01:17:30,319 --> 01:17:34,319
it's like if you already got two

2281
01:17:31,359 --> 01:17:36,799
producers growing a named variety

2282
01:17:34,319 --> 01:17:38,799
they don't want that name variety

2283
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:40,159
anymore and does that lead to lots of

2284
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:42,000
name changing or is that even possible

2285
01:17:40,158 --> 01:17:43,198
in the country all the

2286
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,560
time yeah

2287
01:17:43,198 --> 01:17:46,079
it's huge here

2288
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:48,080
it's ridiculous

2289
01:17:46,079 --> 01:17:50,960
but what's weird here is that they'll

2290
01:17:48,079 --> 01:17:52,880
change an og name to another og name and

2291
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:55,279
then you have 90 kinds of og and this is

2292
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:57,119
for reals any any any dispensary in

2293
01:17:55,279 --> 01:17:58,880
california you go in you'll have half

2294
01:17:57,119 --> 01:18:00,479
the menu if not three quarters of the

2295
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:02,480
menu og kush

2296
01:18:00,479 --> 01:18:03,759
different kinds you know yeah and how do

2297
01:18:02,479 --> 01:18:05,039
you how do you sort through that as a

2298
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:07,199
consumer

2299
01:18:05,039 --> 01:18:08,719
[ __ ] i have no questions usually it's

2300
01:18:07,198 --> 01:18:11,039
all the same anyways that's well i'll

2301
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:12,880
tell you how they do it they buy price i

2302
01:18:11,039 --> 01:18:14,640
look at you i like a point of sale data

2303
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:17,600
every monday morning for every province

2304
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:19,440
in this country and

2305
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:21,920
what were people buying my answer the

2306
01:18:19,439 --> 01:18:24,238
cheapest [ __ ] they can yeah yeah there's

2307
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:25,920
only about eight to twelve percent of us

2308
01:18:24,238 --> 01:18:27,839
that are buying the expensive stuff

2309
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:29,840
everybody else is buying the cheapest

2310
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:30,800
[ __ ] and they they frankly don't care

2311
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:32,560
what it is

2312
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:34,239
yeah and that's it's a funny thing about

2313
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:35,280
this industry is that like you hear

2314
01:18:34,238 --> 01:18:36,879
everybody

2315
01:18:35,279 --> 01:18:39,198
at least all these industry people talk

2316
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:41,600
about how everybody only wants the top

2317
01:18:39,198 --> 01:18:43,039
end and the cream of the crop

2318
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:45,280
but the truth is it's like they're

2319
01:18:43,039 --> 01:18:46,640
allowed five percent

2320
01:18:45,279 --> 01:18:47,840
right like those guys everybody that's

2321
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:49,199
talking about that yeah that might be

2322
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:52,960
true for your

2323
01:18:49,198 --> 01:18:54,238
your small mortgage or market right but

2324
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:56,079
the truth is when you look at the

2325
01:18:54,238 --> 01:18:58,479
aggregate market data

2326
01:18:56,079 --> 01:19:01,039
people want budweiser yeah they will

2327
01:18:58,479 --> 01:19:02,959
still sell brickweed in our dispensaries

2328
01:19:01,039 --> 01:19:05,600
here in my city

2329
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:09,640
compressed brickweed is available would

2330
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:09,640
that be considered an import

2331
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:14,960
i mean really it's crazy like i look

2332
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:16,399
down and i see literal compressed brick

2333
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:18,640
every single collective i've ever been

2334
01:19:16,399 --> 01:19:20,639
into in bakersfield it's crazy

2335
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:22,880
from thrown across

2336
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:24,480
it at least to this fake you know that

2337
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:27,199
whole og thing just to go back there for

2338
01:19:24,479 --> 01:19:28,559
a second at least this really fake

2339
01:19:27,198 --> 01:19:30,079
um

2340
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:32,320
situation where it's like the appearance

2341
01:19:30,079 --> 01:19:34,399
of diversity right it's like you you

2342
01:19:32,319 --> 01:19:35,759
have the appearance of choice but like

2343
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:36,879
yeah there's all these different names

2344
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:38,719
but it's all the same

2345
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:40,960
yeah sure

2346
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:42,880
and then really like you know

2347
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:45,600
they might even exclude like the best

2348
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:46,880
version of the og right it's like the

2349
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:48,640
distribution board says now we already

2350
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:50,560
got three of those we don't want to

2351
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:52,719
stock it anymore and they're probably

2352
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:54,320
turning away the best one right they're

2353
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:55,439
simply not qualified to judge what

2354
01:19:54,319 --> 01:19:56,880
cannabis should be on the shelves and

2355
01:19:55,439 --> 01:19:59,359
what shouldn't it's it's it's a

2356
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:00,719
completely flawed system um and it's not

2357
01:19:59,359 --> 01:20:02,319
going to change until the provinces get

2358
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:04,480
out of the way and when's the last time

2359
01:20:02,319 --> 01:20:06,719
a province wanted to give away a cash

2360
01:20:04,479 --> 01:20:08,479
cow that they've got right now exactly

2361
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:10,158
and unfortunately they're quite simply

2362
01:20:08,479 --> 01:20:12,879
put um the only time these kinds of

2363
01:20:10,158 --> 01:20:14,960
things are taken away or or given back

2364
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:16,800
into private some

2365
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:19,279
private hands is when conservative

2366
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:20,880
governments take control and so yeah

2367
01:20:19,279 --> 01:20:23,359
so they're good

2368
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:23,359
yeah right

2369
01:20:24,479 --> 01:20:27,839
so but you know what my point was is

2370
01:20:26,399 --> 01:20:30,079
that here in canada so you have nine

2371
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:31,600
month run with one var before it just

2372
01:20:30,079 --> 01:20:33,279
stops selling right because people are

2373
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:36,320
done with it they want the new next

2374
01:20:33,279 --> 01:20:38,639
thing so how do you support a breeding

2375
01:20:36,319 --> 01:20:40,880
program when it takes you a year and a

2376
01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:42,719
half to come up with a cut and it's done

2377
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:45,119
in nine months yeah there's no there's

2378
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:47,520
no return on investment

2379
01:20:45,119 --> 01:20:49,119
it's all everything me and me and a lot

2380
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:51,120
of the other guys that produce big seeds

2381
01:20:49,119 --> 01:20:52,800
here in in the united states a lot of us

2382
01:20:51,119 --> 01:20:54,559
all kind of

2383
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:56,000
it's all shot in the dark right now

2384
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:58,880
everything is a shot in the dark and

2385
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:01,520
hoping and a lot of sucking hyping [ __ ]

2386
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:03,199
like i suck at that like i feel like a

2387
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:05,199
used car salesman so i don't like doing

2388
01:21:03,198 --> 01:21:07,198
it i don't want to do it and if you

2389
01:21:05,198 --> 01:21:08,479
don't do that you don't wear the jewels

2390
01:21:07,198 --> 01:21:09,919
in front like you're rich you're not

2391
01:21:08,479 --> 01:21:11,519
going anywhere and you're not hyping

2392
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:14,399
anything and you're not starting a hike

2393
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:16,400
you know yeah how ridiculous is that hey

2394
01:21:14,399 --> 01:21:18,638
[ __ ] this is the thing that i've hated

2395
01:21:16,399 --> 01:21:20,399
about the seed market since for so long

2396
01:21:18,639 --> 01:21:23,119
yeah it's just like it's all based on

2397
01:21:20,399 --> 01:21:26,079
[ __ ] yeah based on ego ryan like it

2398
01:21:23,119 --> 01:21:28,559
always was it's it's it's ego it's

2399
01:21:26,079 --> 01:21:30,399
entitlement it's it's it's the loudest

2400
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:32,400
guy in the bloody room like let's let's

2401
01:21:30,399 --> 01:21:33,759
be honest about that even back in our

2402
01:21:32,399 --> 01:21:35,198
day who was the guy that sold the most

2403
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:38,000
seeds the guy that screamed the most in

2404
01:21:35,198 --> 01:21:39,198
the soapbox yeah you're charles and you

2405
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,359
could go down the road you know what i

2406
01:21:39,198 --> 01:21:43,439
mean that's that's what it was like um

2407
01:21:41,359 --> 01:21:45,920
the people that uh really that do the

2408
01:21:43,439 --> 01:21:47,359
quiet work you know and and just kind of

2409
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:48,560
put their head down you don't never hear

2410
01:21:47,359 --> 01:21:51,279
about those guys you've got to be a

2411
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:53,600
self-promoter um because no one else is

2412
01:21:51,279 --> 01:21:55,198
going to do it for you unfortunately and

2413
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:56,480
that's why when we were you know both

2414
01:21:55,198 --> 01:21:58,399
ryan and i when we were working those

2415
01:21:56,479 --> 01:22:00,319
boards back in the day we gave away

2416
01:21:58,399 --> 01:22:01,679
hundreds of free seats because

2417
01:22:00,319 --> 01:22:03,359
that was your best way to get

2418
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:05,199
advertising was have a grower grow your

2419
01:22:03,359 --> 01:22:07,599
seats and go man this shit's the bomb

2420
01:22:05,198 --> 01:22:09,279
right like yeah um and you but you can't

2421
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:12,159
do any of that in this legal market

2422
01:22:09,279 --> 01:22:14,158
right now you know it's it's it's all so

2423
01:22:12,158 --> 01:22:16,638
so much oversight and so much [ __ ]

2424
01:22:14,158 --> 01:22:18,638
laws are surrounded um it's gonna be

2425
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:20,000
tough but i gotta tell you i'm waiting

2426
01:22:18,639 --> 01:22:21,840
for someone to come out and beat the

2427
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:23,920
cookies brand because i'm already tired

2428
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:26,480
of seeing that [ __ ] i mean that whole

2429
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:29,119
branding and marketing to me is childish

2430
01:22:26,479 --> 01:22:31,839
and beneath most cannabis customers yeah

2431
01:22:29,119 --> 01:22:34,319
absolutely they just hired a breeder who

2432
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:36,000
has never made seeds and

2433
01:22:34,319 --> 01:22:37,599
like i know the guy personally he's

2434
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:40,800
never made seeds he's a marketing guy

2435
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:43,840
but he's now their new breeder

2436
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:45,119
yeah pretty on brand for cookies

2437
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:46,719
how it goes

2438
01:22:45,119 --> 01:22:48,319
that's really sad

2439
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:49,439
but yeah until things change and get

2440
01:22:48,319 --> 01:22:51,279
taken out of some of the governmental

2441
01:22:49,439 --> 01:22:52,799
hands up here it's gonna be the same old

2442
01:22:51,279 --> 01:22:54,880
same old um

2443
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:56,719
i just hope that uh you know ryan and

2444
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:59,279
breeders like himself can find alternate

2445
01:22:56,719 --> 01:23:00,880
ways to get their wares into the market

2446
01:22:59,279 --> 01:23:02,880
that are still desperately needed it's

2447
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:05,119
so desperately needed new flavors

2448
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:07,119
yeah the cove covet also took a lot of

2449
01:23:05,119 --> 01:23:08,800
us out um i don't know why i don't know

2450
01:23:07,119 --> 01:23:10,238
the correlation i don't even know if

2451
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:12,320
it's causation versus quarterly i don't

2452
01:23:10,238 --> 01:23:14,319
know but when covet hit a lot of us kind

2453
01:23:12,319 --> 01:23:15,920
of started slowing down quite a bit as

2454
01:23:14,319 --> 01:23:17,198
far as being able to sell seeds how much

2455
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:18,960
seed was moving how many people were

2456
01:23:17,198 --> 01:23:20,960
buying seeds so that's been an

2457
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:23,279
interesting thing to recover from too it

2458
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:24,800
was the unknown man yeah i think you

2459
01:23:23,279 --> 01:23:26,719
guys are experiencing what the rest of

2460
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:28,400
the world has gone through i mean

2461
01:23:26,719 --> 01:23:31,520
you know amsterdam was the only place in

2462
01:23:28,399 --> 01:23:33,439
the world and then when bc became online

2463
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:36,080
it was kind of the leading hot spot for

2464
01:23:33,439 --> 01:23:37,678
genetics and then yeah now i mean that

2465
01:23:36,079 --> 01:23:41,198
was when you know i mean talked about

2466
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:42,960
like 1995 to call 2010 yeah but since

2467
01:23:41,198 --> 01:23:44,960
since 2010 i mean you guys have we have

2468
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:47,520
a whole bunch of heat banks popping up

2469
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:49,760
in the states now right yeah a lot of so

2470
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:51,840
many americans are ordering from

2471
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:53,440
american banks why would you risk the

2472
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:55,039
border when you can order from within

2473
01:23:53,439 --> 01:23:56,158
within the borders right

2474
01:23:55,039 --> 01:23:57,840
and that's what

2475
01:23:56,158 --> 01:24:00,399
it's from the script right it's put the

2476
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:02,000
script now all you see i mean are up

2477
01:24:00,399 --> 01:24:04,319

2484
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:20,319
it's it's it's and you know there's 10

2485
01:24:18,158 --> 01:24:22,559
new licenses given out every friday like

2486
01:24:20,319 --> 01:24:24,079
there's only so much you know cannabis

2487
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:25,679
we have so many cannabis buyers here in

2488
01:24:24,079 --> 01:24:27,760
canada there's only so much weed that

2489
01:24:25,679 --> 01:24:29,279
they're going to buy and yeah it's it's

2490
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:30,960
the same 20 things because they

2491
01:24:29,279 --> 01:24:32,238
everyone's running to that side of the

2492
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:33,359
boat and you know then they'll run to

2493
01:24:32,238 --> 01:24:34,638
the other side of the boat when the next

2494
01:24:33,359 --> 01:24:36,479
new thing comes up but it's all coming

2495
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:38,480
out of cali right now i don't know of

2496
01:24:36,479 --> 01:24:41,439
any canadian breeders that are doing any

2497
01:24:38,479 --> 01:24:44,638
significant work um at any level right

2498
01:24:41,439 --> 01:24:46,479
now to be frank it's really it's sad but

2499
01:24:44,639 --> 01:24:47,760
frankly there's more american breeders

2500
01:24:46,479 --> 01:24:49,519
up here doing

2501
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:50,560
work that are getting like you know like

2502
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:52,159
there's a few

2503
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:53,600
big american banks that are working with

2504
01:24:52,158 --> 01:24:55,439
cultivators up here just because that's

2505
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:56,639
who the cultivators knew they what they

2506
01:24:55,439 --> 01:24:58,319
they thought that the you know the

2507
01:24:56,639 --> 01:24:59,520
canadian or the the american guys were

2508
01:24:58,319 --> 01:25:01,198
the hype so they went down and made

2509
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:03,040
deals with them yeah and now you got

2510
01:25:01,198 --> 01:25:04,960
like american breeders here and canadian

2511
01:25:03,039 --> 01:25:05,920
breeders can't even get [ __ ] workers

2512
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:07,679
yes

2513
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:10,239
it would be nice it would be nice to be

2514
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:12,158
able to to mobilize the old guard guys

2515
01:25:10,238 --> 01:25:14,000
they've been around for a long time to

2516
01:25:12,158 --> 01:25:16,238
kind of bond together and figure this

2517
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:19,119
puzzle out you know because it only

2518
01:25:16,238 --> 01:25:21,279
benefits the consumer it's people

2519
01:25:19,119 --> 01:25:24,079
it's like chip said i mean there's so

2520
01:25:21,279 --> 01:25:25,679
many [ __ ] big egos involved

2521
01:25:24,079 --> 01:25:28,158
like to try to get everybody under the

2522
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:29,199
same tent and and paddling in the same

2523
01:25:28,158 --> 01:25:31,039
direction

2524
01:25:29,198 --> 01:25:33,519
good [ __ ] luck

2525
01:25:31,039 --> 01:25:35,359
yeah oh yeah this makes me laugh when i

2526
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:37,440
hear about these potential processor

2527
01:25:35,359 --> 01:25:39,359
co-ops and things like that i'm like man

2528
01:25:37,439 --> 01:25:40,879
you can't get two growers in a room to

2529
01:25:39,359 --> 01:25:42,639
look at a black wall and decide what

2530
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:43,840
color it is

2531
01:25:42,639 --> 01:25:46,480
good luck trying to think about

2532
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:48,880
packaging processing distro marketing

2533
01:25:46,479 --> 01:25:51,599
like good luck

2534
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:53,679
and seed makers all consider themselves

2535
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:56,719
at some point some type of artist you

2536
01:25:53,679 --> 01:25:59,520
know what i mean as opposed to just a a

2537
01:25:56,719 --> 01:26:01,600
bunk farmer that knows one prop

2538
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:02,880
so yeah it's hard to get the egos

2539
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:04,480
rounded up

2540
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:05,920
you know you guys gotta find that one

2541
01:26:04,479 --> 01:26:07,519
sugar daddy that likes to smoke enough

2542
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:10,880
weeds got more money than brains and

2543
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:10,880
then let us all have adam

2544
01:26:11,359 --> 01:26:14,880
let me show you the way seth rogen

2545
01:26:16,479 --> 01:26:21,198
that's true

2546
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:23,198
somebody needs to yeah that's right

2547
01:26:21,198 --> 01:26:24,799
that's right listen we're still young at

2548
01:26:23,198 --> 01:26:26,479
this we're still doing this guys that

2549
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:28,480
mean truly let's be honest i mean the

2550
01:26:26,479 --> 01:26:30,959
legal the legality of all of this is

2551
01:26:28,479 --> 01:26:34,000
what will be five five six years deep

2552

decides she wants to get in this

2555
01:26:37,279 --> 01:26:40,479
industry and in 10 years she's going to

2556
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:41,600
look at this bunch of [ __ ] dinosaurs

2557
01:26:40,479 --> 01:26:43,759
compared to what's going to go on in 10
