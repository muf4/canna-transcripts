i'm not sure what the source is on this

33
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,318
um i remember shrumi's diesel being

34
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,639
listed as original diesel but shrumi's

35
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:05,679
diesel is different

36
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:07,119
oh

37
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,680
thank you dear

38
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,680

39
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,280
um

40
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,400
so i started i started digging around

41
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,120
and what

42
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,280
i found was [ __ ] crazy

43
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,878
and i realized you know what like people

44
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,239
that don't

45
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:24,000
really have a

46
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,560
a long experience in this when they

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,280
actually go try to look up something

48
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,640
they need to know who is who

49
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,560
how to really

50
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,318
sift through the [ __ ] so i decided i

51
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,318
would go uh

52
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:38,399
i would go do that

53
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:40,958
yes the image is good let's see do you

54
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,640
think mr nice super silver haze uh is

56
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:48,158
in the scentsy silver haze

57
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,519

00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,599
anything anyways let's see

92
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:20,319

where do i start with the stupidity

97
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:41,519
where do i start with the stupidity

98
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:44,079
now that would be the diesel stuff

99
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:44,079
yeah yeah

100
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:53,319
um anyways so this is uh where we start

101
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:56,879
boom

102
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,519
and unfortunately i can't shrink this so

103
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:59,519
i'm going to have to

104
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,600
let's see i'll bring some stuff up on um

105
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,199
my computer because this is obviously

106
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,720
not going to work great if i can't

107
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,400
[ __ ] shrink it

108
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,039
but so you guys can get an idea of what

109
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:12,159
i'm looking for

110
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:15,599
so

111
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,600
the the first thing i type in

112
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,720
would be about original diesel okay

113
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:22,478
let's see uh go to google and type in

114
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,880
original

115
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:27,519
diesel

116
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:29,918
strain right that that would be

117
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:31,519
what most people would uh

118
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:32,399
would do it

119
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:35,359
so

120
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:38,478
some of the first stuff i'm seeing

121
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:41,120
is that dr underground is the breeder

122
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:42,478
and original breeder of

123
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,360
diesel

124
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:46,879
well that's [ __ ] weird right like dr

125
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,520
underground from what i know about dr

126
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:51,598
underground he's a he's a british dude

127
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:53,120
he's a [ __ ] british dude

128
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:55,918
yeah i don't think he was the one who

129
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,800
bred original diesel so now this is seed

130
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:58,560
finder

131
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,879
um that'll that'll give you your answer

132
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,839
on whether this is a good source or not

133
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:06,719
um no it's not

134
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:06,719
second thing i see

135
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:11,758
original sour diesel comes up

136
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:13,279
and that's not original sour diesel

137
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,680
that's not what sour diesel looks like

138
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:18,000
either and that's from swerve

139
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,560

most common and

208
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,080

the chem 101 thread by my friend heian

240
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,759
lonesome so he did what i think is

241
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,320
probably the best

242
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:11,838
compendium of answers uh that could be

243
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,879
given at that time and then someone

244
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,240
quoted him in this and and mad props to

245
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:18,559
high and lonesome for trying to dig

246

through all that [ __ ] and put

247
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:22,958
the most common consensus answers out

248
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,078
there during those years now he he gives

249
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:25,518
him uh

250
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:26,958
he gives himself a real hard time

251
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,320
because he knows that you know a lot of

252
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:31,439
things have changed over the years and

253
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,040
stuff but for the time it still is still

254
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,399
pretty magical that someone could put

255
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:37,039
all that into a

256
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:39,679

dude

282
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:36,399
there's a fake headband going around the

283
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,560
club scene aka

284
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,720
707 headband and this is this is correct

285
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,799
it's a sour diesel og cross by all

286
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,399
accounts not the same lindy lineage as

287
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:46,399
the indie posted above

288
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:52,480
bryn is obsessing over this

289
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,200
all right

290
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,360
look for aj's cut on oh god don't i i

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,399
looked for aj's got a thc farmer that is

292
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,879
not worth

293
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:04,879
that is not worth navigating through um

294
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:07,039
let's see as far as i know the real

295
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:09,439
headband underdog is closely held and

296
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:11,199
not in the club scene currently and that

297
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,680
is correct to start days

298
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,800
inject some uh

299
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:16,799
inject some nice info

300
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:22,399
okay and then we have my buddy true grit

301
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,759

302
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,360

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,120
is the original chem 91 it's got the

340
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:43,039
best provenance out of everyone

341
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,679
see that was a guy named reaper then

342
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:47,439
someone's showing no off their booth

343
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:48,638
and then someone's showing hid band

344
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,600
headband

345
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,440
um

346
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,399
but basically it all takes this weird

347
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,839
curve into the headband realm right

348
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,958
okay let's see

349
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:01,279
let's see one second here

350
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:02,559
and then we go to chem dog's original

351
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:04,320
diesel

352
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:06,638
so we're gonna go to a different thread

353
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,160
because this one is is already done

354
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,278
that's that's all the info you're gonna

355
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:14,159
get there let's see chem dogs

356
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:14,159
original

357
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,959
diesel

358
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,159
headband

359
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:23,198
that should take me straight to the

360
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:25,278
thread and see yeah here it is so this

361
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:26,958
is the one that i i went through the

362
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:28,958
most and i thought it was worth showing

363
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:31,198
the most let me see what we got the

364
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:33,039
blind leading the deaf is exactly right

365
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:36,240
if ja hoover's profile is still in there

366
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:39,679
i think he did a thread of aj jaw hoover

367
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,919
is and and ojd i'll go through this i

368
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:43,758
actually kept pictures because neither

369
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:45,759
of those guys deserve to be mentioned on

370
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:49,120
anything about anything they're [ __ ]

371
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:51,360
retards all right here we go

372
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,799
i i gave ojd a lot more credit than i

373
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,159
should have because he's just been

374
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:57,519
around a long time i figured he wouldn't

375
00:15:54,159 --> 00:16:00,559
be a [ __ ] [ __ ] by now right but

376
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,560
i i digress

377
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:04,320
and then someone says original diesel

378
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:06,240
gives the same quote also known as

379
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,399
diesel 1 headband daywrecker underdog

380
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,159
came from a cross of 91 chem dog mass

381
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,759
super scentsy northern lights done by a

382
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:13,600
guy known as weasel

383
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,199
now what they

384
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,600
didn't know back then is that weasel

385
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:19,039
would eventually come out and talk

386
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,839
um

387
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:24,559
he speaks

388
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:25,759
um and he's around he's on instagram

389
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:27,278
it's uh

390
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,560
not looking so good for all weasel

391
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,439
weasel can't keep his story straight

392
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:31,599
twice

393
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,199
um and a lot of this

394
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,120
uh

395
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:36,559
i don't know it's

396
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,919
there's been there's been quite a few

397
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:39,838
different quotes from him since then

398
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:42,399
anyways and i don't know if it's it's a

399
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,000
matter of um

400
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,799
i'm gonna block y'all jeffy because he's

401
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,198
[ __ ] getting on my nerves let's see

402
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:50,198
there we go

403
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:54,399
no

404
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:56,639
weasel has made several different quotes

405
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,799
i don't know if it's attributed to age

406
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,600
whether um

407
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:01,599
whether it's

408
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:07,439
it's being stoned i don't know but you

409
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:10,558
can't get the same story right twice so

410
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,558
that's a problem right

411
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,919
all right so let's go ahead and go

412
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:18,038
through the farm and we're gonna see

413
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,038
more about this original diesel

414
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:23,438
here we go venom eight one eight

415
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,519
i've seen many dispensaries but i'm not

416
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:29,360
sure it's a chem dog cut did progressive

417
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:31,359
options say where they sourced it

418
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:35,439
the original d and this is here's here's

419
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:35,439
our buddy swerve here's our buddy swerve

420
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:39,918
the original diesel cut going around to

421
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:42,000
socal is shroomie's original diesel it's

422
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,080
good but not the real cut

423
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,359
so we have swerve chiming in with some

424
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:47,199
info there

425
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:50,000
thank you swerve

426
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,360
and then uh venom 818 responds thanks

427
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,200
for the input swerve do you know where i

428
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,240
can get some seeds or a cut in pure form

429
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,120
so

430
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,720
swerve has now put himself as a uh an

431
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:02,000
expert in this area and people are

432
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:04,720
asking him for cuts and

433
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,038
info on seeds why not

434
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,480
and then we have winter who says top dog

435
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:10,079
siege just had a couple packs of

436
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,000
underdog number one on the bay a week

437
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:13,439
ago i quickly got a pack because i was

438
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,200
searching like you might do now this is

439
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,519
in 2010.

440
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,519
um

441
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:22,240
i'm not sure when the original diesel

442
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,360
day wrecker cut

443
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,359
aka

444
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:30,079
if it is the same cut as underdog

445
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:32,319
was that around in 2010

446
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:34,399
i don't know

447
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:37,200
then someone named eco comes in and

448
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,120
probably one of the smartest things

449
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,080
that the original diesel story seems

450
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:45,038
super complicated with info

451
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:48,558
as to which ones are out or by who found

452
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:49,599
this on a chem thread it's interesting

453
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:50,879
here we go

454
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:52,558
now this was

455
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,360
this post that's up there in the right

456
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:57,918
corner right now

457
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,359
this one right here

458
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,200
the weird thing that shroomy's original

459
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:03,199
d clone is not the same as chem dog's

460
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,919
headband well that would be weird right

461
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,319
if shroomies d if swerve was right that

462
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,400
shroomy's original diesel

463
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:11,599
is the one going around and it's the

464
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,600
same thing as headband but it's not the

465
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:14,879
same thing as chem dog's headband

466
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:16,399
well

467
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,080
kem dog himself

468
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,519
has said to me multiple times that he

469
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:21,359
never had a headband never grew a

470
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:22,879
headband so that throws a little wrench

471
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:24,798
in the uh

472
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,880
in the in the problem

473
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:28,558
it says chem doug smoked out swerve and

474
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,640
a friend of mine located in santa

475
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:32,960
barbara california with a batch of

476
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,280
headband and bo said it was basically

477
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,360
straight up og kush completely different

478
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:38,798
than the original diesel cut i am very

479
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:41,119
confused by the whole headband day

480
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:42,879
record stuff because i've been seeing

481
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:44,879
more and more of the og cush-esque

482
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,960
headband flooding santa barbara norcal

483
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,480
growers in fact kim dog even told my

484
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,279
buddy in santa barbara something along

485
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,000
the lines that this is og bro yet this

486
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:56,000
is head yet this headband is another

487
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
headband than the cut that's been going

488
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,599
around the boards for a while now

489
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,359
jj new york wrote a description of the

490
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:03,279
original headband day wrecker underdog

491
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:05,359
and it sounded a bit like or a lot like

492
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:09,519
the original d-clone he said it smelled

493
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:10,879
spicy skunky diesely taste jj also said

494
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:12,879
i don't think chem dog ever had an

495
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,280
underdog headband cut

496
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,280
so what the hell is this og-ish

497
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:19,038
headband cut that cam has that's

498
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:22,240
flooding the socal medical scene right

499
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:24,480
now so overall like um

500
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,000
what what you can illustrate here is

501
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,480
when anybody asks about the original

502
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,119
diesel so far what keeps happening is

503
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,839
that it gets moved on to day record yep

504
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:35,918
uh

505
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:38,720
bye-bye it gets moved on to day wrecker

506
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:40,480
uh unless and unless you know guys like

507
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,519
my buddy el jefe there have something to

508
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,960
add instead of just being a [ __ ] then

509
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:47,359
they get booted because i'm trying to

510
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,480
stay focused here anyway

511
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:52,158
it always gets uh shoved off man like

512
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,960
you try to go for original diesel you'll

513
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:57,039
get info on headband headband headband

514
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,400
um and there's no there's nothing but

515
00:20:57,038 --> 00:20:59,919
the can of bible stating that they're

516
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,240
all the same

517
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,759
it gets convoluted real quick and i can

518
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,200
see why it's hard for a lot of people to

519
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:06,960
go research a lot of this stuff that

520
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,120
weren't around during all this

521
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,919
um

522
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:13,918
someone asked joe brand your outdoor cut

523
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,400
or your original diesel cut is the same

524
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,400
as the shroomie got passed around this

525
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,840
is actually true juan's original diesel

526
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,480
is the same exact cut streaming source

527
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:24,079
from pennsylvania which i've heard is

528
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,759
different than diesel 1d record and

529
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:26,879
underdog cuts so just more confusion

530
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:29,200
with uh

531
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:32,960
with that

532
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,640
um now venom1818 says good read bro now

533
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,880
i'm more confused

534
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,240
right like who wouldn't be

535
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,799
um

536
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,000
and then some and then sway says i've

537
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:43,599
noticed that pretty much every cut from

538
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,839
progressive options has been fake now

539
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:47,759
progressive options was an old uh clone

540
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:48,798
only collective in

541
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:50,960
l.a

542
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:52,079
um not even that old wasn't even that

543
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,640
long ago that they were still in

544
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:56,639
operation but a lot of people uh went

545
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,038
and got cuts from there and bred with

546
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,360
them snow hi

547
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:03,599
and uh several other people went down

548
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:05,199
there and got cuts because that was

549
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:07,599
easier obviously than sourcing them

550
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,038
correctly and a lot of them were fake

551
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:12,158
um

552
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:15,759
and then we have dusty bowls aka danimal

553
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:18,400
aka backyard farmer aka

554
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:21,279
however many mean however many names he

555
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,720
needs to try to stay in

556
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:25,440
in this business because he's [ __ ] so

557
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:28,798
many people over i hooked up juan kenobi

558
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:31,759
with the with the s420 original diesel

559
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:33,679
the shroomie 420. now shroomy i wish i

560
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:36,319
would i should have kept this i have a

561
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,720
picture of him um

562
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:41,439
he's a sex predator

563
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,279
pop for [ __ ] little kids so

564
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,120
shroomies not the most reliable source

565
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:47,759
but i mean just because you [ __ ] little

566
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:50,158
kids doesn't mean that you [ __ ]

567
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:52,798
backdoor farmer it doesn't mean that you

568
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,880
know you can't be trusted on clones but

569
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:58,079
i don't like kid [ __ ] so [ __ ] ruby

570
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:02,400
right all right last year this is a

571
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:02,399
shapeshifter january 19 2010.

584
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:33,918

[ __ ] turd

592
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,480
uh let's see where we at here

593
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,520
shapeshifter there's the cush corner

594
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,839
quote

595
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:51,119
uh

596
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:54,240
huh that guy was a fraud it's worth

597
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:54,239
calling someone else a fraud

598
00:23:55,519 --> 00:24:00,720
don't be lost come back

599
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:04,640
you'll be okay moda militia

600
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:07,120
spelled terribly lumpa's headband is the

601
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,520
is it the same there's a question

602
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:12,719
so now we go back to the moda militia

603
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:14,319
lumpus headband now if if

604
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,640
we conclude and there's no reason to

605
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:18,639
conclude this other than jason king that

606
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,960
diesel number one is the same as

607
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:24,960
original diesel as the same as day

608
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:27,278
wrecker is the same as headband

609
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:30,798
etc

610
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:30,798
where does lumpa's headband fit in

611
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,640
um i'll go back to the jj response so

612
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:35,599
basically he just repeats what someone

613
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,000
else said

614
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:38,000
um

615
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:45,119
no lumpa's headband

616
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,759
was not sourced and it it was not

617
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:48,798
sourced in a way that can be

618
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:50,879
proven

619
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:52,798
um loompas said a few different things

620
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,360
he said that it was stolen from a place

621
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:56,720
in new york smuggled in someone's pocket

622
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:58,319
to him

623
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,400
right um

624
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:01,839
he puts it back

625
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,919
i forgot what yuri said but it was

626
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:05,519
something he said it was the very first

627
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,278
og kush to show up on the boards which

628
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:08,319
is very incorrect

629
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:10,960
um

630
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:12,639
it is an og kush it's it's got some sour

631
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,960
traits to it but it's definitely an og

632
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,919
kush it is nothing related to the old

633
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,919
original diesel

634
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,559
yes uh yeah inspector used the lumpa's

635
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,600
headband which is the correct term for

636
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:26,000
it

637
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:28,639
only because it's not headband it's not

638
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,159
the original headband um but

639
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,320
yeah that's actually one of the best

640
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:35,200
lines that i've run um of the lumpa's

641
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:38,079
headband crosses is the oracle underdog

642
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,080
that shit's bomb

643
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:43,918
and then they move this over

644
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:46,240
it jumps over to um what is this it's a

645
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,440
a double underdog

646
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,359
why anybody's talking about double

647
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,519
underdog other than the fact that it has

648
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:54,319
underdog in the name i'm not sure

649
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:56,879
it's obviously not original diesel

650
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:58,480
it is a seed line and then there's a

651
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,760
person named dub wobble let me let me

652
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,599
find this one

653
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:03,839
dub wobble let's get to the dub wobble

654
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:03,839
part

655
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,120
there's the double underdog swerve

656
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:11,759
double underdog where's dub wobble

657
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:12,558
should be right about here

658
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:14,000
yeah

659
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:15,839
i don't think there's any seeds of pure

660
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,278
headband at least i've never seen them

661
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:18,639
i've had a cut of headband for five

662
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:20,798
years now

663
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,480
it is it is not og

664
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:24,879
it is not chem dog d

665
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,960
it is not sour diesel it is way closer

666
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,480
to sour diesel than og and

667
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,720
characteristics

668
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,159
i have been i have seen the so-called og

669
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,000
phenotype i believe that someone got

670
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,400
their cuts mislabeled and are actually

671
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,400
growing og the structure just isn't the

672
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,000
same as the diesel type headband

673
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,600
so that's again

674
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,960
a little bit more clarity from someone

675
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:44,480
that kind of knows what they're talking

676
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,558
about that has had the original diesel

677
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,480
cut but

678
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:52,480
it's really hard to figure out

679
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,480
and real headband is not og again not og

680
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,720
um different different area of the

681
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,880
country wasn't called headband at the

682
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,759
time it's not og

683
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,080
and then dub wobble says the 707 is not

684
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:06,319
headband at least not what harborside or

685
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:08,558
blue sky passes out by the way for every

686
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:11,359
everyone that pm's about trading i'm not

687
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:13,599
able to pbm back blah blah blah

688
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:16,639
and then we have venom coming back in

689
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:19,519
yes the 70k 707 cuts definitely bomb but

690
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,278
i don't consider it real headband

691
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:24,879
and then we go back to joe schmoe's

692
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:24,880
double underdog cut for a while

693
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:30,960
gotta keep scrolling down because people

694
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,960
are still talking about that

695
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,919
and then someone bringing up underdog

696
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,960
number one and then green thumb danny

697
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,720
now green dumb green dumb fanny

698
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,319
is a better name for him

699
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,319
he does consider himself quite an

700
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:46,398
authority and a lot of people consider

701
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:49,359
him quite an authority on this site for

702
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:50,239
some reason i'm not sure why

703
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:52,319
um

704
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,880
and then it's it's him talking about

705
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:56,558
again double underdog and joe's cut

706
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,159
throwing balls and then he calls someone

707
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:00,480
porch monkey but i think that was their

708
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,360
name um

709
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,360

710
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:05,038

711
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:06,479
takes it back to the hey wait a minute

750
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:37,359
this research that go on that have these

751
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:39,038
questions that need these answers and

752
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:40,879
they don't know who these character our

753
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:42,879
characters are and how well they can be

754
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,760
trusted and um

755
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,679
this is a shining example of uh being

756
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:48,319
able to go through this thread navigate

757
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,080
it

758
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:52,000

759
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:55,759
and see if you can find the answers and

760
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,119
by the end of it we have power og

761
00:29:55,759 --> 00:30:00,240

765
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,720
ends

766
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,840

808
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:55,359
there's some more shots whoa look at

809
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,558
that sour

810
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:57,519
sour

anyway

812
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,720
oddly enough everybody blasts him on the

813
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:02,319
thread and he never says another thing

814
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,480
again it's one of the few times where

815
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:06,720
i'm like wow everybody didn't just buy

816
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:10,960
into it and go [ __ ] that's dank that's

817

[ __ ] awesome so let's move on to uh

818
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,079
let's move uh

819
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:16,158
this is this is actually a really good

820
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:17,839
guess if that plant is a clone only my

821
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,200
guess would be f gooey i wouldn't say

822
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:22,079
blue dream that doesn't look like blue

823
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:25,519
dream to me um afgooey is even a stretch

824
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:27,599
but it's it's a better guess than sour

825
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:28,880
all right and here's here's pictures of

826

anyway so let's move it over to ic mag

830
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,120

831
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:44,480

832

pictures of original diesel that you use

837
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:56,319
is it the same as underdog day wrecker

838
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:57,679
etc now these guys are over in in

839
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:58,960
england and and what a lot of people

840
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,120
don't know and they take for granted i

841
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,798
think is the fact that these guys it's

842
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:04,000
really hard to get clones over the pond

843
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:06,079
even still

844
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,599
um it's still really hard to get clones

845
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:09,759
over the pond so a lot of times they're

846
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:12,240
only using seed lines

847
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:14,879
and and so nowhere know where things are

848
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,038
being made know who is making them

849
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:20,720
and uh you'll have a better idea of

850
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:21,839
whether it's legit or not just uh

851
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,759
it's it's

852
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:24,879
it helps you break down the process of

853
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:27,359
whether these guys are going to have

854
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,000
legit [ __ ] or not so

855
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:32,000
going and sourcing american clones over

856
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,919
from british breeders probably isn't

857
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,599
going to be your best bet

858
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,000
anyway so this guy's asking him hey is

859
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:39,359
this is this the same as the american

860
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,200
original diesel i mean it should be

861
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:42,398
you're calling it original diesel right

862
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,000
you're calling it underdog and day

863
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:45,678
wrecker right

864
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,679
all right so

865
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:49,919
next let's see where was i

866
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:51,840
boom oh jd hi bro

867
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,519
i don't think it's exact same cut as you

868
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:54,959
posted i don't have any pictures handy

869
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,440
but i'll try to dig one up later and

870
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,440
post it

871
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,519
yeah well

872
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,960
here's the pictures jah hoover chimes in

873
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,919
here are some shots of the original

874
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:08,320
diesel ojd uses this was sourced by dna

875
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,320
genetics and was passed out to our

876
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,359
friends this kind of verified to be the

877
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:16,480
real deal original diesel

878
00:34:13,358 --> 00:34:19,358
by the big dogs in the game

879
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:22,079
dna being the big dogs here you go

880
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:22,078
here's some uh

881
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:28,000
shots

882
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,000
not sure what it is

883
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:34,639
but they put up plenty shots of

884
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:37,039
something i'm guessing it's uh some res

885
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,559
work it looks like a super sour silver

886
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:40,159
diesel haze

887
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:41,918
to me

888
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:44,000
that's what i would assume it is

889
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:45,679
not sure i mean granted they grow

890
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,199
shittily so it's hard to tell but it's

891
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,519
definitely not

892
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:51,918
it

893
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:54,320
and here's just the the typical picture

894
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:57,118
results when you look up original diesel

895
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:59,440
right none of none of which are it

896
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,039
closest one is that middle one that

897
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,760
looks a little similar to it but it's a

898
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:06,239
little more bulky in structure looks a

899
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,920
lot more like uh

900
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:11,118
it looks a lot more like jesus let me

901
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,119
show you a picture of jesus

902
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,559
let's see

903
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,280
just for illustration purposes

904
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:21,358
uh what's a good dee geezel picture like

905
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,599
that there you go

906
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:26,000
that's like a uh diesel i think it's a

907
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:28,079
glass one but here's a diesel picture

908
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,559
that's that's much more uh what you

909
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,960
would expect and it's more mimics the

910
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:35,679
original diesel look um

911
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,760
so yeah overall

912
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:39,039
this is what happens when you you search

913
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,480
this [ __ ] out

914
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:43,199
and as you see there were many people

915
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:46,559
that chimed in that have respect in our

916
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:50,000
community that are raiders that um are

917
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:51,519
his cannabis historians uh and and and

918
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,280
putting their input on it and you see

919
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:54,960
and granted you know what a lot of info

920
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,320
has come out in the past

921
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:01,280
10 years about these these lines uh what

922
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,559
they are what they aren't and uh so so

923
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,160
you can't hold it against them they're

924
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:05,519
trying to use what info they had at that

925
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:07,920
point but you can hold it against swerve

926
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:09,280
because he's a [ __ ] [ __ ] um you can

927
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,480
hold it against green thumb danny

928
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,200
because he's a [ __ ] [ __ ] and

929
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,880
they're speaking in in facts and and

930
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:16,399
like this is definitely this this is

931
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,680
definitely that

932
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,119
uh

933
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:21,039
um

934
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,039
doesn't gage green work with the day

935
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:25,519
wrecker cut who [ __ ] knows what he's

936
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:28,239
working with he probably sourced it from

937
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:32,079
dusty bowles would be my guess backyard

938
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:33,439
backdoor farmer danimal that dude

939
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:35,039
i'll try to leave it up for viewing i

940
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,880
don't i have a hard time saving these

941
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:38,639
after i do them so they need to be

942
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,800
uploaded to youtube and stuff so if one

943
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:42,559
of you wants to do that and

944
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,960
and pass me the file i'll be happy to

945
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:47,358
put it up

946
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,199
weasel story i know weasel crossed

947
00:36:47,358 --> 00:36:51,440
scentsy northern lights to a diesel chem

948
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:53,679
91 this became the underdog aj then

949
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,838
renamed underdog to headband well we

950
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:58,159
have some issues with that too we have

951
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:59,599
some issues with that too because jj new

952
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:01,279
york has also said that he named a

953
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:03,359
headband

954
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:06,079
we don't know who named it headband

955
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:07,358
aj and jj are very good friends

956
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:09,519
i'm not calling either one of them a

957
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:10,480
liar one of them probably did maybe

958
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:12,480
maybe

959
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:15,599
but uh we're not sure which because they

960
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,599
both take the claim to it

961
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,920
all right let me see what i miss now

962
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:23,759
the exodus cheese cut camera skunk one

963
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,599
seed pack in eighties that is correct

964
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,000
germinator two did i miss something

965
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,000
earlier

966
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,480
it didn't come from a collective in

967
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,800
luton and milo

968
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,960
didn't put it out in the racing not

969
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,280
facts at all

970
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,599
yeah it came from skunk one

971
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,599
um

972
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,400
selected director i talked to jj years

973
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:50,399
back said he lost it way back never gave

974
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,800
a clone out neither said it was extinct

975
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,639
that's what i've heard too you know but

976
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,400
um

977
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:58,159
pretty much everybody says everything's

978
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,000
extinct that they no longer have access

979
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:02,639
to in that little circle so it's hard to

980
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,400
say you know

981
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:05,838
i've seen cam dog refer to headband and

982
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,720
his own stuff and then i've heard i've

983
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:10,320
seen kem dog also say that he's never

984
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:12,078
run headband but it's usually other

985
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,838
people referring to chem dog having

986
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:16,240
headband as opposed to kim saying he ran

987
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:17,119
headband so that's a hard one

988
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:18,799
um

989
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,039
what else was there

990
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,720
the extinct mass super skunk i found a

991
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:23,759
picture of it last night

992
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:25,439
um

993
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,800
supposedly it's supposed to be the best

994
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,280
the diesel is supposed to be the best

995
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,640
representation of mass skunk but i saw

996
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,640
some pictures last night and i was like

997
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:35,759
wow that doesn't really look like

998
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:38,159
anything that i remember seeing

999
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,320
anything close

1000
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:41,920
yeah i i'm not sure why headband and day

1001
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,920
record got stuck together other than the

1002
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,519
can of bible and people [ __ ]

1003
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,039
read that book and they stick to it

1004
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:49,358
religiously

1005
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:52,559
religiously anything said in the can of

1006
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:53,920
bibles got to be true um and it's just

1007
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:56,639
so many things have been proven to be

1008
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,320
incorrect in that in that book and again

1009
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:00,078
it was a long time before there was a

1010
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,320
lot of info out there and a lot of these

1011
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:04,320
guys were talking so they're pro

1012
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,079
probably trying to make best

1013
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,000
do with what they could but jason king

1014
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:11,039
had some good access to people

1015
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,039
so he you

1016
00:39:12,838 --> 00:39:20,320
know yeah gran supposedly ran the diesel

1017
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:22,160
now the one thing when researching um

1018
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,599
when researching

1019
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:25,440
diesel

1020
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:28,160
the one thing after talking to all the

1021
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,240
dudes involved is that no one on the

1022
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:34,000
diesel side from the new york side says

1023
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:35,919
that they for sure had the chem 91

1024
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,480
what it turned out to look like was that

1025
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:41,680
they have chem 91 bag seed

1026
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:43,519
and that was what was used to then

1027
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:47,039
call diesel so it would have been a

1028
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:47,039
little bit different than chem 91

1029
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,599
beard ed i don't yeah i don't know

1030
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:57,838
that's what the that's what the source

1031
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,838
says up there about old dr underground

1032
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:02,159
let's see

1033
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:04,239
i don't know that he claimed it but he's

1034
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:07,598
uh the first person that comes up for

1035
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:07,598
having created it so

1036
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:13,920
someone say diesel

1037
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:16,318
hold on i'm trying to find some

1038
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,159
this masked skunk picture now this the

1039
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:19,838
picture i'm looking for was taken from

1040
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:22,639
chem dog's

1041
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:23,838
room and was shown in high times of it

1042
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:25,679
god damn

1043
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:27,920
too many [ __ ] pictures of [ __ ] on

1044
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:27,919
here

1045
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:35,039
but yeah that's the best we could tell

1046
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:37,440
it's either it's either a backseat of

1047
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:38,400
chem 91 or chem 91 that was called

1048
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,599
diesel

1049
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,358
uh i i would believe the bag seed story

1050
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:46,960
that's more likely to have happened as

1051
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:46,960
opposed to the cut just being passed

1052
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:51,279
but yeah

1053
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:53,358
it's hard to say um so

1054
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,440
overall what the answer ends up being is

1055
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:56,480
who [ __ ] knows

1056
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,440
i got

1057
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,920
nothing i got no answers going through

1058
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:04,000
all that [ __ ] not a single answer

1059
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,159
worth going over there's the mask skunk

1060
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,920
that's supposed to be the mass super aka

1061
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:08,879
the virginia super skunk

1062
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,318
um

1063
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,160
it's gunfield does that look like the

1064
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:13,759
the virginia super skunk

1065
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:15,679
i know it's kind of a shitty picture let

1066
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,359
me try to swap it

1067
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:21,480
there we go you can kind of see it up in

1068
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:21,480
the corner hopefully it's not too small

1069
00:41:32,318 --> 00:41:36,000
there it is up in that corner it's

1070
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,159
really airy i don't know if it's just

1071
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,119
that yeah it's not the best grow of it

1072
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:42,879
so it's really hard to say

1073
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:45,599
it has similar leaves to the diesel but

1074
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:48,720
god damn it's it's pretty airy so yeah

1075
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:50,559
it's hard to say this is uh

1076
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:53,759
this is from uh

1077
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:53,759
greg's room i believe

1078
00:41:56,159 --> 00:42:01,598
mystery seed from the kmd

1079
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:03,599
i wonder what that was

1080
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:05,440
it does look like it was hating life

1081
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:08,960
doesn't it

1082
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,960
these are all the other pictures

1083
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:14,159
i don't know who's ringing my doorbell

1084

1089
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:36,078
wanted to run through um

1090
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:38,559

1175

1176
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:12,640

1177
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:15,440

1178
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:18,318

1179
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,679
no don't go don't go be impolite in

1180
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:21,599
asking this don't

1181
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:23,199
expect stuff but you know be respectful

1182
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,480
when you're asking and that and that's

1183
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:25,519
the whole thing

1184
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,358
um

1185
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:29,599
there's no answer to the original diesel

1186
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:31,759
what what this cut is where it came from

1187
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:33,680
is it the day wrecker is it the original

1188
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,200
diesel number one i don't think it is

1189
00:46:33,679 --> 00:46:36,799
because i remember everybody saying that

1190
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:39,118
the original diesel number one including

1191
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:41,280
vondo said this that it died very early

1192
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:42,800
on

1193
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,119
um

1194
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,400
is it headband probably not headband

1195
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:47,920
seems to be a different cut than the

1196
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,519
original diesel

1197
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,440
um

1198
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:53,519
i just i'm guessing that it's not the

1199
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,318
same thing and it's not the same cut

1200
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:57,199
that

1201
00:46:54,318 --> 00:46:59,440
i see collective and the elite crew have

1202
00:46:57,199 --> 00:47:01,358
his headband so

1203
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,838
uh i wanted to break that down if

1204
00:47:01,358 --> 00:47:05,440
there's any other uh

1205
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:07,279
any other strains you guys want me to

1206
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,400
research and do this on i'll do that in

1207
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,800
the future

1208
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,240
um but we could do this once i don't

1209
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,160
know this is

1210
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:15,118
a pain in the ass but you know every few

1211
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:17,838
weeks

1212
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:20,720
i love you duker i love you skunk

1213
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:22,558
um yeah it's

1214
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:24,879
it's confusing and it and it is

1215
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:26,559
absolutely confusing being in the middle

1216
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,760
of it back then and just shaking your

1217
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:29,599
head like god these guys don't know

1218
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,920
[ __ ] [ __ ] why people keep asking them

1219
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:34,640
[ __ ] and in the end yeah it goes to show

1220
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,980
they don't know [ __ ] what's that cartel

1221
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:39,199
what

1222
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:41,280
[Laughter]

1223
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:42,960
oh my god i would have [ __ ] killed

1224
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,040
you let me see it i'll show it

1225
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:47,599
so i just got this we just got this i

1226
00:47:45,039 --> 00:47:50,318
think there's two of them in here

1227
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:51,760
they're acid blotter papers

1228
00:47:50,318 --> 00:47:55,119
you can see it's actually real acid

1229
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:56,400
blotter paper too uh from luke chu i

1230
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:57,280
believe is how you pronounce it the

1231
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:00,079
artist

1232
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:02,079
no it's actually pronounced chew

1233
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:04,079
uh but yeah these are these are pretty

1234
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:05,519
[ __ ] cool and the cartel just got

1235
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:07,839
delivered them instead of our [ __ ]

1236
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:09,358
house again

1237
00:48:07,838 --> 00:48:11,279

00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:17,880
uh cannabis carnivore they're over on

1241
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,880
skunktech.com

see see it's even got a certificate of

1243
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:25,760
authenticity a little luke signature but

1244
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:26,880
yeah i think it's [ __ ] rad when an

1245
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,640
artist

1246
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:31,119
goes out of the way to make acid blotter

1247
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:33,199
[ __ ] art that's [ __ ] cool

1248
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:35,280
i'm really stoked about those as you can

1249
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:37,358
see on the back it is really meant to be

1250
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,880
used for that but i don't know if i can

1251
00:48:37,358 --> 00:48:39,838
these are a little expensive to be using

1252
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,119
for that

1253
00:48:39,838 --> 00:48:41,920
anyway

1254
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,519
yeah

1255
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,119

1257
