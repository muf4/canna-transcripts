1
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:06,000
second verse same as the first see if it

2
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:08,480
works this time

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,480
i don't know

4
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:18,640
don't know what the [ __ ] happened it

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,960
just shut down my live feed all of a

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,439
sudden so we'll see we'll try it again

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,719
and uh see if when natsu joins us and we

8
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,719
might have to switch to the other

9
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,719
account i don't know what's going on

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,439
let's see

11
00:00:30,879 --> 00:00:34,879
hey it worked we got the boot

12
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:36,718
yeah i got the boot it was real [ __ ]

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,399
weird so we'll see if it happens again i

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,520
don't know what happened

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,120
i don't know i'm just too pretty for

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,440
this [ __ ] sometimes i think it's

17
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:44,399
probably what's happening indeed

18
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,479
yeah

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,759
indeed so i'm gonna do a giveaway at

20
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:49,919
some point tonight and we'll have to

21
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,519
figure out how to run it

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,359
but i'll probably leave that up to you

23
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,039
because it's much easier to put it off

24
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,079
on you to figure out how to do the

25
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,640
giveaway

26
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,039
figure it out indeed yeah

27
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,239
all right we already got 114 116

28
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,840
something like that so whenever you want

29
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:05,359
to kick it off we can i mean the

30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,439
funniest thing is because i have to do

31
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:08,478
that because i do this [ __ ] on my phone

32
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:10,319
yeah

33
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:11,438
like if i sit back

34
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:12,478
this far

35
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:14,559
right yeah

36
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,079
i can't see any of the comments

37
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,400
you also could potentially be getting a

38
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,158
[ __ ] off-camera it could happen i

39
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,000
suppose but then they

40
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,000
you know they did but so then if i want

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,040
to see what people are saying then i

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,040
have to make my head like take

43
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,159
the the full frame

44
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,079
you know

45
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,920
it is what it is on it it is what it is

46
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:39,679
so yes we have blue bonnet available

47
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,118
uncle brizzy it's on uh rightseepco.com

48
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,159
so yeah i guess we are getting we are

49
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:47,118
getting up there yep or whatever

50
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,280
um so

51
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:50,799
do you know actually i

52
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,159
i don't even know why this stuck in my

53
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,680
head but i can't remember what it's

54
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,520
called because it's russian and i have

55
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,439
terrible pronunciation

56
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:59,759
yeah but they used to do they used to do

57
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:01,438
this gambling thing where like there's a

58
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,439
bunch of dudes sitting around like a

59
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:05,839
huge table right

60
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:07,679
and there's like one chick underneath

61
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,920
giving head to someone

62
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,840
and you have to figure out who it is and

63
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,079
if they can tell you're getting it you

64
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,920
lose a bunch of money

65
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,599
so there's all these dudes with their

66
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,598
pants off and they have to sit there

67
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:21,039
like all stoic

68
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:24,238
yeah i know i think that's bad i'm the

69
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:25,919
one under the table oh my god down there

70

it's a trust situation yeah you know i i

73
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,280
often speaking of russian i often refer

74
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:36,479
to

75
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,560
when you

76
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,318

night um we have kind of like a

97
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,840
uh

98
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,080
a little collection of stuff we were

99
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,680
going to talk about tonight um it came

100
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,959
up on our on our uh our discord this

101
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,120
week uh like some breeding expectations

102
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,039
and just seeing what people commented

103
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,759
about breeders today versus breeders

104
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:36,560
yesterday or of yesteryear

105
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:40,158
uh we figured like we could chat a bit

106
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,479
about like even what people expected

107
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:44,000
yeah like what expectations were and how

108
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:45,919
expectations

109
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,680
like have always sort of shaped what

110
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:49,598
breeders do

111
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,439
yeah even from the beginning right

112
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:52,719
and then we had a comment come in that i

113
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:55,039
thought was kind of interesting that

114
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:56,959
like could sort of tie into that which

115
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:58,560
is like people wanted us to talk about

116
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,920
uh beasters

117
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,560
oh really

118
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,839
indeed which we actually have some uh we

119
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,519
actually have some good friends that

120
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,158
could talk a lot more eloquently

121
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,920
probably than we could on but

122
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:11,840
what i thought was what would could be

123
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,598
interesting is we could talk from a bit

124
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,160
about um

125
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:18,719
like how it affected america

126
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,359
yeah like how to change things here how

127
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,199
it changed the homegrown scene here how

128
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,560
it you know just certain aspects of it

129
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,319
right so

130
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,120
um

131
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:31,120
i don't know we uh we could start uh we

132
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,800
could start any any which way because i

133
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,199
guess i guess maybe two beasters would

134
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,759
be sort of like the

135
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,960
the first like commercialization of kind

136
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,840
but yeah

137
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:40,799
yeah

138
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:42,319
right

139
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,160
yeah because everybody else was getting

140
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:46,560
it usually from some there wasn't really

141
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,439
commercial scenes then

142
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,399
sure no and and you couldn't really call

143
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:54,000
mexican brick beasters necessarily no

144
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:55,599
there was a commercial mexican obviously

145
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,478
that had been commercialized for a long

146
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,080
time yeah but like there was a situation

147
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:02,159
in most parts of the country even on the

148
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:03,519
west coast where there wasn't enough

149
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,360
good kind bud

150
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:07,918
yeah i never even

151
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,319
got a a whiff of bc

152
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:11,680
beasters ever in my life never saw them

153
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:13,839
they didn't make it down all the way

154
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,400
down to bakersfield or san diego so i

155
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:18,638
never saw any of that stuff

156
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:20,879
i mean it it permeated all over the

157
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,519
place especially the east coast yeah i

158
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:25,839
bet i know and it had it had different

159
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:28,000
effects strangely enough in different

160
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,918
places i guess we'll start talking about

161
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,160
this because we're already into it but

162
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:34,079
like so you take bisters in somewhere

163
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,960
like the southeast

164
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:39,839
right uh or certain like that that might

165
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,638
be the only non-mexican bud you could

166
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,799
get

167
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,400
yeah like it might have been all and

168
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,720
like what people don't get is like in

169
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,679
the 90s and stuff like that

170
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,639
you know

171
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,439
um

172
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,879
it was still super prohibited right

173
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:54,319
and they

174
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:56,240
you know so it kept it really small

175
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,000
there was way more demand

176
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,519
than there was supply

177
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,279
right and that's kind of what made

178
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:03,918
everything easy to sell because you

179
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:05,758
could always always sell whatever

180
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:07,120
because

181
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,879
sell i mean

182
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,199
for example in a place we have here

183
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:12,639
called cottonwood

184
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,120
a type of

185
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,840
weed was going around called nade that

186
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,478
was

187
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:21,359
old commercial not i mean but mexican

188
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:23,599
brick uh sprayed with raid and they'd

189
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,759
call it nade and that was a thing and

190
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,840
they could sell that and move that

191
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,919
you know anything could be people i just

192
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,758
had some guy all upset like he's like

193
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:33,680
[ __ ] beasters we got fire here on the

194
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,520
southeast i mean the era that we're

195
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,879
talking about is the 90s

196
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,680
and so there wasn't enough fire anywhere

197
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:41,600
yeah

198
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,160
like fire was hard to get

199
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,319
and you know and people had it

200
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,160
but and fire's relative

201
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,520
fire is relative and for like part of

202
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,919
the reason why and people when someone

203
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:53,680
even asks i'm 22 what are beesters

204
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:54,560
beasters literally

205
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,598
is

206
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,879
indoor

207
00:06:55,598 --> 00:07:00,959
indoor weed grown in canada

208
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:03,038
and shipped to america

209
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:05,439
yeah at scale

210
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:08,800
right that was in the 90s and into the

211
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:10,800
into the early 2000s right and so

212
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,879
people think people laugh at it now but

213
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,478
the reason why it was so successful

214
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,719
was because

215
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:18,719
for most people i mean you know your

216
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,000
access was like green mexican brown

217
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,919
mexican

218
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,759
oh you know or like you had a buddy who

219
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:25,038
had a buddy who had a buddy who maybe

220
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,520
every once in a while could get you a

221
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:30,079
quarter of a kind bud yeah

222
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:31,680
and so beesters filled that void you

223
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:33,598
know and now

224
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,598
it's like you say the word beasters and

225
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:37,439
people have all kinds of comments

226
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:38,639
they're making right now but in the

227
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:40,160
beginning

228
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,439
none of that was known

229
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,160
yeah

230
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:46,079
right like it was like so in a lot of

231
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,840
parts of the country it was the only it

232
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:49,839
was the only kind bud regularly

233
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:52,638
available

234
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:55,598
right and even in california

235
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:58,319
california it [ __ ] us up

236
00:07:55,598 --> 00:08:00,959
right because and it has in in a way i

237
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,280
actually feel like it it sort of started

238
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,638
the purple wave in california

239
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,359
i don't know

240
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,840
i almost yeah i almost i i i think it

241
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,680
had a big play a big part of it

242
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:16,079
um how so what happened is is that back

243
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,240
then you know most indoor or most

244
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:19,758
outdoor or whatever even outdoor and

245
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,680
stuff there wasn't a tons of depths

246
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,680
there wasn't tons of outdoor and stuff

247
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,598
like that most people were growing we're

248
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,840
growing pounds in the in the dozens of

249
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:30,079
pounds not the hundreds of pounds yeah

250
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,359
outside and then most indoors were like

251
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:33,519
you know four to twelve lights or

252
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,399
something right yeah and so

253
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,560
um

254
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,200
you know there was an aspect where

255
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:41,838
all that stuff was expensive

256
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,919
yeah okay and so people

257
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,600
so you know what brokers are like right

258
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:46,879
yeah so you have this choice where you

259
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,000
can come to mendo and you can get a

260
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:51,679
bunch of fireweed for like 42.

261
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,639
yeah right

262
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:54,799
or

263
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:56,639
you can talk to these canadians

264
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:58,000
and you can get a bunch of bee stirs for

265
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:59,360
23.

266
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,080
yeah

267
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,240
right so what are the brokers gonna do

268
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,759
yeah nine times out of ten pick cheap

269
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,680
so nine times out of ten they're gonna

270
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:09,600
pick cheap right and so and they're

271
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:12,479
going to make a hell of a margin you

272
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,800
know and so what happened is is that

273
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,120
there was a in california there was good

274
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:18,479
weed to be smoked but what the brokers

275
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,879
tried to do which is what they tried to

276
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,399
do forever is like

277
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:24,320
it's no different than like can i make

278
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,320
these depths look like ends

279
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,480
yeah are these outs good enough to look

280
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,480
like depths are they good enough to look

281
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,159
like something better than they are

282
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,600
because then i can make the profit

283
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,519
difference

284
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:39,360
between like what those sell for and

285
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:41,039
what these sell for yeah so in like you

286
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,360
know in you know a lot of parts of the

287
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:45,039
country beasters was all there was so it

288
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,879
was like [ __ ] you take it

289
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:48,719
yeah i mean if one dude was the only

290
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:50,720
plug in town and he decides to take

291
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,240
beasters over some kind bud then you're

292
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,839
just going to get smoked beasters and

293
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,159
that's that yeah or you're going to buy

294
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,880
mexican yeah exactly those are your

295
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:01,360
issues right so but then in california

296
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:03,120
they had to pass it off a lot of times

297
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,600
as homegrown

298
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,278
yeah because other california people

299
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,159
were edu the west coast and oregon and

300
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:11,679
stuff in washington they knew enough

301
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:13,919
that like they weren't going to pay that

302
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:15,679
kind of pricing for it yeah because they

303
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:18,159
they had other options they could find

304
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:20,719
somebody that had homegrown yeah so then

305
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:22,319
the middlemen tried to make beasters

306
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,480
look like homegrown

307
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,800
sure right and it worked for a time

308
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,120
because everybody's commenting right now

309
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:30,958
and and i see all of you right and now

310
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,720
it's pretty well known that a lot of

311
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:36,799
beesters were grown like too much salts

312
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,040
they were harvested a little early they

313
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:41,439
weren't cured as as nicely as they

314
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:43,919
should have been they were packaged in

315
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,600
and seal a mealed airtight containers

316
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:47,120
and zipped close

317
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,480
yeah and then by the time that they got

318
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,560
to where they were going they had

319
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,480
suffered a quality issue

320
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:54,719
yeah it wasn't as nice as it was where

321
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,639
it began

322
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,399
right like sometimes it could smell like

323
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,480
hay sometimes it could smell a little a

324
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,360
little a little weird a little off a

325
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,440
little yeah people saying pgrs but at

326
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,680
the time people didn't know most of that

327
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,040
it was like you could either get mexican

328
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:10,239
or this

329
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:12,000
yeah

330
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,680
that was or like you had you had you

331
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,200
were a lucky enough person that you grew

332
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:16,159
or you knew someone close to you that

333
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,000
grew

334
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:20,000
right yeah um that you could get some

335
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,600
eighths or some quarters or a zip every

336
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,159
two or three months

337
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,079
and you know there's also mexicans that

338
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:27,278
would come up that were like almost like

339
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:29,199
a red hue

340
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:30,399
and that that was obviously a lot of

341
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,440
people used to work for tentacle we

342
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,679
didn't really use that because we didn't

343
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,839
get the bc beasters but our pretendica

344
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,199
was the uncompressed mexican that would

345
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,320
come down

346
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,120
do you know what

347
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,879
uh chicago for tentaca was

348
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,200
no

349
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:46,720
so chicago pretendica

350
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,640
was

351
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,440
in the midwest there's a ton of ditch

352
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:51,600
wheat

353
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,880
yeah right and ditchweed is basically

354
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,519
like leftover wild hemp from the world

355
00:11:54,879 --> 00:12:00,159
war ii hempford victory thing right yes

356
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,399
well some of that can look beautiful

357
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:05,838
so sometimes entrepreneurs would go out

358
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:07,839
there and and get a bunch of pounds of

359
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,639
gorgeous looking hemp

360
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,920
yeah and dry it nice and they'd sell 300

361
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,639
ounces

362
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:16,240
of weed that looked incredible

363
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,720
but you couldn't get high off it and i

364
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,278
didn't even know what cbd was back then

365
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,040
you know yeah however i had no i never

366
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:25,919
it just didn't i i just was shocked

367
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:27,519
because my green mexican got me higher

368
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:30,639
yeah i always thought that was weird

369
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,560
because the uh uncompressed brick almost

370
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,560
always you'd get higher off the [ __ ]

371
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:36,319
shittier high compressed brick

372
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:38,479
so almost always so there was a weird

373
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,079
thing so what happened what i mean and

374
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,320
this is a roundabout way of saying and

375
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:45,599
so sorry for everybody but what i think

376
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,360
happened in california is that

377
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,560
you had this thing where

378
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,200
um

379
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:53,199
like they were flooding the west coast

380
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,200
with all this indoor

381
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,000
yeah right and so all these brokers are

382
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,160
moving this indoor from from canada and

383
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,519
they're taking the margin convincing

384
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:03,519
people it's

385
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,959
it's california or it's oregonian or

386
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,799
whatever you know it's washington it's

387
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:08,399
homegirl and then eventually people

388
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:10,319
started noticing the differences they

389
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,399
started looking for the rock hard pgr

390
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,600
buds they started looking for certain

391
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,759
noses

392
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,839
um sometimes they started looking even

393
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:20,000
for like the way it was seal a mealed

394
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,440
you know like people would get it and

395
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,958
they would cut open all the ceiling

396
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,920
meals and they would put it into turkey

397
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:26,239
bags

398
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:28,078
oh yeah yeah in order to like make it

399
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,000
seem like it wasn't from where it was

400
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:32,958
from you know yeah

401
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,958
and and you know and so what happened is

402
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:36,799
is that you've got all these brokers

403
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:39,198
trying to pass off weed that they bought

404
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:40,078
for 22 2300 bucks

405
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:41,759
yeah

406
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:43,759
into the force

407
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:47,600
and you're trying to actually find some

408
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:50,559
of that actual cap cali in homegrown

409
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,040
yeah right and so when the irk and the

410
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:54,799
and the mendo p and the granddaddy and

411
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:56,159
all that started selling in the bay and

412
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:58,799
going for it

413
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:01,039
there wasn't a bunch of canadian weed

414
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:02,799
that looked purple

415
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,278
yeah no that no now i get what you're

416
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:07,120
saying so you could see it right they

417
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:08,958
would see it they they would send up all

418
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,440
these people to humboldt and mendo and

419
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:13,359
all different spots and grab as much

420
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,760
purp as they could

421
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,440
because it was an easier hustle for them

422
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:19,600
because everyone they gave it to they

423
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,680
knew they weren't getting bunked

424
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,000
with some fake beasters

425
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:26,239
yeah and then once

426
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,639
once that toehold took place

427
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,399
in at least in norcal once that toe hold

428
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,639
took place then it was just like a

429
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,198
self-sustaining thing

430
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,320
yeah right and all the brokers couldn't

431
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:38,078
pass off

432
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,600
beast as

433
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:41,278
homegrown

434
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,278
yeah because everybody wanted like one

435
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:46,078
of these half a dozen purple strains and

436
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:48,240
you could sell endless amounts of those

437
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:49,919
i remember um growing some of the

438
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,320
canadian purples and there yeah there's

439
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:53,919
no way they could be passed off as uh

440
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,040
indoor anything i remember they most of

441
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:56,399
them had to be grown outdoor in the

442
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:57,439
first place and they were just very

443
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,440
loose

444
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,760
purple sometimes bud

445
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,199
not very not very grand i just think it

446
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:05,360
was one of those things that it just it

447
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:06,879
just like made it distinctive i mean

448
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,639
there was a time too where like with the

449
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:10,159
early dispensaries and stuff like that

450
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,879
part of the reason why the dispensaries

451
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:14,958
could move endless amounts of perps

452
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:17,519
was because all their customers knew

453
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:18,479
that the dispensary wasn't buying cheap

454
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,720
beast

455
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,320
and flipping it for the high

456
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,079
they were just buying

457
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,720
[ __ ] mendo perps and flipping it

458
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:27,679
because it won't get you high well yeah

459
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,360
i mean

460
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:30,879
it's not so much that dude it's like

461
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,839
because you know everybody's affected

462
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:36,078
differently but sure the canadian weed

463
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,360
because it wasn't dried as nicely as we

464
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:39,519
like to do it

465
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,039
oh yeah i'm sure and then it was it was

466
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,159
it was you know and then once you seal

467
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:46,240
something up for a few weeks wet

468
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:48,078
what you know it's going to firm it yeah

469
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,799
that's nice and then it's going to be

470
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:52,879
compressed lightly so like because any

471
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:54,958
kind of smuggling is all about shipping

472
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:57,679
it's all about volume and space right

473
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:59,039
sure so you get this weed that like is

474
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:00,479
like it probably if it would have stayed

475
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:01,679
where it was going to stay and got dried

476
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,639
really nicely it probably would have

477
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:04,719
been better

478
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,440
yeah you know but then you you harvest

479
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,278
it a little early you don't flush it you

480
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,959
package it a little too moist you put it

481
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:12,639
into an airtight thing and you scrunch

482
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,078
it down on itself

483
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,680
um

484
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:18,239
you know uh

485
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:20,319
you know they uh and so that and so then

486
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,000
there was occasionally some really nice

487
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,600
beasters

488
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,360
you know there was there was some really

489
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,800
good weed that came out of there but

490
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,039
just the over

491
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:31,039
the overall flood

492
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:33,360
was pretty low-brow

493
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:36,000
yeah the overall flood was pretty low

494
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,680
about but for a lot of places people

495
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,919
think of now right where it's like the

496
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:42,000
west coast is just sending

497
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:43,759
you know people joke on ig for years

498
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,440
about how the west coast just sends all

499
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,278
their bunk east

500
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,000
yeah right and it's like a running joke

501
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:51,679
because of how much work that gets grown

502
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
in on the west coast of

503
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:55,120
america would get sent to other parts of

504

507
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:03,278

514
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,240
strains that that have everything

515
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,319

517
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:21,759
breeds really well it does all this this

518
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,520
cool stuff

519
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:26,798
but because it's so old it's low thc

520
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:29,359
yeah

521
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:31,440
you know uh it is and so

522
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:33,599

524
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:38,798
crosses of it is to the the bubba

525
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,640
yeah right and there's obamacush or

526
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:43,519
whatnot you know because the bubba adds

527
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:46,080
frost and density and some potency

528
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:48,639
and the mendo adds color and terps and

529
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:50,399
[ __ ] you know yeah

530
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,799
and so you know and then different

531
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,400
people like i i actually like if i smoke

532
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:56,160
mendo p in the morning

533
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,080
like it actually makes me creative

534
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,840
rather than couch lock

535
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:01,759
yeah that's a good though if i like wake

536
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:03,599
up and drink some coffee and eat some

537
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:05,279
food and i smoke some mendo pee and i

538
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:06,879
start writing down my list of [ __ ] i

539
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:09,200
want to accomplish

540
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,559
yeah like i my brain works at a pretty

541
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,000
good level

542
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:14,558
yeah i think i was sour dub in the

543
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,919
morning and then i usually am asleep um

544
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:16,960
right after writing that little note of

545
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,320
things to do

546
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,798
enough thank goodness this morning i

547
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:23,519
mean it's there for the future at least

548
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:26,000
yeah it is it's there for tonight but

549
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,200
so like for so basically like beasters

550
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,119
too it's like we're not gonna do a whole

551
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,400
show on it but beasters affected

552
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:31,918
different parts of the country in

553
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,160
different ways

554
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,400
yeah right in california it really did

555
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,000
kind of spark the purple wave

556
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,759
uh because people didn't want to get

557
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,200
stuck with beesters

558
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:43,279
but in other parts of the country there

559
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,960
wasn't that much choice like my buddies

560
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:47,359
and this is what this is what's crazy is

561
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,840
that so my friends in chicago that

562
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:51,678
stayed there obviously when i moved west

563
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:53,918
okay yeah you know how for a lot of

564
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,679
people uh beesters dropped the price of

565
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,679
what they were able to get

566
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,280
to some degree it affected price points

567
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,840
in california right

568
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:03,279
well in chicago it made their prices go

569
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:05,519
up

570
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:10,440
yeah because they were like well if this

571
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:10,440
if this goes for four then my shit's six

572
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,919
you know

573
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:15,918
yeah and they actually flipped it and

574
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,679
they did better because of it

575
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,720
because their homegrown was their home

576
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,559
their super nice indoor homegrown was so

577
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,319
much danker

578
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:26,160
yeah they were like well if this is what

579
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:27,119
you can get this for then ours has to be

580
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,038
that

581
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:30,719
yeah so it literally like their stuff

582
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:32,240
before beaster went for about what

583
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,480
beester did

584
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,480
yeah and then when it came in it like

585
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,880
created another grade of kind bud that

586
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,640
their bud was obviously better

587
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,160
smart marketing

588
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,160
you know and so it went up but in

589
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,919
california it hurt us

590
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,160
yeah because it was like the first flood

591
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,759
of cheap [ __ ] indoor

592
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,240
it's it's crazy that it didn't affect

593
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:54,960
socal very much at all like it just

594
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,720
didn't hit down here like that

595
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,720
i mean it up north

596
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,160
yeah well there's parts of it i don't

597
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,600
even know if i should say but because

598
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,120
there's like

599
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:04,879
there is because like you know i was

600
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:06,798
talking about like the

601
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,280
just like the weed impact of it but

602
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:12,240
there was obviously like some big groups

603
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:13,599
involved and a lot of money at stake and

604
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,679
a lot of smug and you know there were

605
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:18,000
there's aspects to it that

606
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,360
um you know and it got really honestly

607
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,558
the other thing that we should say is

608
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:26,319
that uh you know um in the 90s and 2000

609
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:27,359
and 2001

610
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:30,158
um

611
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:32,639
you know america did not spend very much

612
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,080
energy worrying about the canadians

613
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,559
yeah

614
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:38,240
our border with the canadians especially

615
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:39,918
was super porous

616
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,599
yeah right and there was a lot of

617
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,320
independence there was a lot of guys

618
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:46,959
like with friends on snowmobiles

619
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:48,798
with you know with duffel duffel bags

620
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,440
and there was all kinds of crazy [ __ ]

621
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:53,839
going on in terms of

622
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,400
getting stuff from canada to here

623
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:57,199
did you ever see that movie kid cannabis

624
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,880
yeah

625
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,159
yeah that kid was one of those dudes

626
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,240
i've talked to one of the dudes that was

627
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,159
involved in it before so you know it was

628
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,960
coming over in truckloads it was coming

629
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,480
over

630
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,400
you know but in a lot of places you

631
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,839
could just go to the border and meet up

632
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,519
with an american on the other side of

633
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:13,519
the border yeah right there was all

634
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:14,839
kinds of [ __ ] like that going on right

635
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:18,079
yeah and then

636
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:19,199
uh the [ __ ] al qaeda crashed the

637
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:21,119
planes

638
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,279
into new york

639
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:25,199
and flying became a lot rougher and they

640
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:26,960
started paying a lot more attention and

641
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,200
heat sensors and all that to the board

642
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,880
and the northern canadian border

643
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,120
not because they were worried about

644
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,960
canucks selling weed in america

645
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:38,479
uh but mostly because they were worried

646
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,079
about um you know terrorists sneaking in

647
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,759
through canada

648
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:44,079
so they tell you

649
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:45,679
yeah but it just i mean i get it you

650
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:48,158
know it's like so they tighten the [ __ ]

651
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:51,440
up yeah and then a lot of the ways that

652
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:53,200
and so in late 2001 a lot of the ways

653
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,120
that people used to move it across the

654
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,519
border whether it was snowmobiles or

655
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:59,519
mountain bikes or you know just driving

656
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:01,119
close and hiking it over and dropping it

657
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:03,519
in the woods and having the americans

658
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:05,439
come get it you know all that yeah

659
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:06,879
all of a sudden you know because we put

660
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,640
all of our money for the most part we

661
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,720
put the vast majority of our money into

662
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,799
policing the southern border

663
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,279
yeah because there was just a [ __ ] ton

664
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:17,599
of heroin and cocaine and weed and

665
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:19,359
issues and you know all that and so the

666
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:21,119
canadians we just weren't too

667
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:22,000
we just weren't too intense on that and

668
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:24,558
so

669
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,839
um you know the the and they didn't even

670
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:27,359
know that there was that much weed

671
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:30,319
happening either

672
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:32,479
yeah so there's an invisibility factor

673
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:33,759
to something for a minute

674
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,839
right

675
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:37,519
and and so

676
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:39,678
then they locked all that [ __ ] down and

677
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:42,319
they made it a lot harder

678
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:44,080
yeah they did they made it a lot harder

679
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:46,240
for like independents to get it across

680
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:47,359
the border so then it moved to like

681
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,400
trucking

682
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:51,918
and various aspects and smuggling and

683
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,480
then what kind of groups does that bring

684
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,880
in yeah of course a lot bigger groups

685
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,400
than just some like independent dudes

686
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,720
wanting to work or whatever then that

687
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,559
brings in organized groups organized

688
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,079
groups of various kinds traditional

689
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:06,158
organized groups various kinds of

690
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:07,678
organized groups that existed up there

691
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,520
which is easy to go and read about if

692
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,080
you if you so choose

693
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:13,679
um and then like the independents all

694
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:15,519
felt squeezed

695
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,280
yeah because they were all hiding from

696
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:19,599
like these other groups that wanted to

697
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:21,038
control everything right

698
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:23,199
yep and

699
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:24,079
you know and then it really

700
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,840
um

701
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:28,798
and the reason why that all worked was

702
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:31,759
because there wasn't there wasn't enough

703
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:33,279
like people people you know downgrade

704
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:35,519
you know california or oregon or

705
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:37,678
whatever sends all their booth east

706
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:39,038
but like there wasn't

707
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,640
you know i had friends that would drive

708
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:42,640
a bunch of work back east back in the

709
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,759
day you know and like there wasn't any

710
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,960
there was almost nobody on the road

711
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:46,798
doing it

712
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,400
yeah it was rare

713
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:50,720
there wasn't

714
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,640
there wasn't that much excess

715
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,558
yeah especially in the 90s with all the

716
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,759
helicopters and all that and how much

717
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,798
you could get away with doing or

718
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:58,798
whatever

719
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:01,359
it was like we could you know california

720
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:02,158
kind of served california in the west

721
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:04,798
yeah

722
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,320
and it really wasn't until 215 and a

723
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:08,720
bunch of other groups got in and things

724
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:11,119
started expanding on a large level

725
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,159
that those waves just started going

726
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:13,119
everywhere

727
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,400
yeah

728
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:18,639
and that ended up basically

729
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,440
doing two things that like

730
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,440
it

731
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,400
it changed the margins for both the

732
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,720
canadians and the mexicans yeah

733
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,038
because that that convergence of all

734
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,558
that weed getting sent in

735
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:34,158
you know they talk about it now it's

736
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:36,240
like uh mexicans send like 70 80 percent

737
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,159
less weed into america than they used to

738
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,839
oh i bet yeah

739
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:43,520
right and then that's [ __ ] up for us

740
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:46,000
too okay because those guys are uh you

741
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:47,519
know they're criminals uh you know

742
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,480
trying to make money

743
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:52,240
yeah so then they've got to replicate

744
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,400
that lost revenue

745
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,400
oh yeah and all the things that they've

746
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,240
decided to like replicate that lost

747
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,440
revenue with are all way worse than

748
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,880
brown weed

749
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,919
oh yeah i know

750
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,880
that's the big one well math fentanyl

751
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,440
you know

752
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:10,159
kidnappings yeah all traffic like

753
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,360
coyotes moving human trafficking like

754
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,600
yeah you know i mean they used a lot of

755
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:15,519
those cartels they would make 60 70 of

756
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:16,558
their income off of wheat

757
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:19,119
yeah

758
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:21,678
so then it's way different now yeah so

759
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:23,199
then two-thirds of that slows down

760
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:26,080
that's a lot of loot

761
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,360
yep you know it really is and then you

762
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:29,519
know same thing with the canadians the

763
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,558
canadians were sending a ton of that

764
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:32,079
down

765
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:34,158
and the mexicans were sending a ton of

766
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:36,399
it north to like the voracious appetite

767
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,480
of america to smoke weed

768
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,240
and then the west coast of america

769
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,519
started supplying americans with

770
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,000
american wheat

771
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:46,158
yeah and it sort of like shaved off the

772
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,319
top and the bottom and made it a lot

773
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,278
less likely

774
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:51,759
you know

775
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:54,319
yeah people are asking uh and this is a

776
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:55,919
good one and i think it's easy um

777
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:57,678
what were some of the strains that were

778
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:59,600
being labeled as beesters coming over

779
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:02,159
the border i think that probably you

780
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:04,319
know the funny part is is that i wonder

781
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,960
how much accuracy there was between the

782
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:09,359
grower the broker

783
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,919
you know uh i would think that a lot

784
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:13,918
would be different and um but come over

785
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,880
with similar names because i think

786
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,919
because that would be whatever's in

787
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,360
demand

788
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,360
you know this would actually be i don't

789
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:20,959
know if our buddy is on here tonight but

790
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:22,879
but a list of strain names he could

791
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,558
probably pump out or i see kootenay on

792
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,480
here

793
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:28,240
and people were actually commenting too

794
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,200
about how many good strains there was in

795
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,359
canada

796
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,840
there was a bunch of amazing strains in

797
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:36,158
canada it's not to diss canada it's just

798
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:39,199
that the choices that got made to be

799
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,960
grown for commercial consumption in

800
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,519
america

801
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,919
wasn't necessarily the creme de la creme

802
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:46,960
of the choices of canadian wheat

803
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,120
yeah

804
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,278
it was grown for export

805
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:53,038
yeah i remember a lot of hash plant

806
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:54,400
being talked about coming down the m39

807
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:58,000
the grapefruit yeah all the stuff that

808
00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:00,400
they're naming specifically m39 a lot of

809
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,798
bc big buds things that things that got

810
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:04,798
them a bunch of shish kabari things that

811
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:06,960
got them a bunch of weight

812
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:09,278
yeah and didn't take that long

813
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,798
you know and a lot of times to me i

814
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:13,200
don't know about i don't know about if

815
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:16,480
if other people saw names

816
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,840
but uh mine was most most of the time

817
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:23,200
that we saw it had letter

818
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:25,119
grades they had like letter grades

819
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,399
like you know you hear triple a

820
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:27,759
oh double a

821
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:29,599
a b

822
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:31,519
you know b minus they would literally

823
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:33,599
have it would literally a lot of them

824
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:34,398
would literally have just letters on

825
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:36,319
them

826
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:38,558
okay i mean of course everyone tried to

827
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:40,319
claim their [ __ ] was triple or quadruple

828
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:41,839
a or whatever yeah i doubt many were

829
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:44,158
saying yeah i got some see [ __ ] wanna

830
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:45,678
try it yeah you know but sometimes i

831
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,440
mean sometimes it wasn't good enough to

832
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,919
like try to play the game

833
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,759
yeah like i'm going to give you some b

834
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,840
and i'll say this too this is this has

835
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:55,359
nothing to do with my world but

836
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:57,119
one of the reasons why

837
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:59,439
they were able to [ __ ] with us so much

838
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:00,639
as far as like the price rate is that

839
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,880
back then

840
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,960
one american dollar got you about a

841
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,840
dollar 60 in canadian

842
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,480
yeah

843
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:10,240
so the exchange rate was amazing

844
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,000
yeah you know what i'm saying so imagine

845
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,399
you could sell your weed

846
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,679
and you know and and for every you know

847
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:20,239
for a for in it's like they got such an

848
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:22,240
exchange rate

849
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,200
right yeah i mean you sell you weed for

850
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,759
you know

851
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,480
i mean it it's so so they were flipping

852
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:30,558
it and for us it seemed low but for them

853
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,679
they were getting a killer price

854
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:33,519
sure

855
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,880
you know because

856
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:36,398
and that's and that's and that's the way

857
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,720
it worked and it came

858
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:39,918
you know and so it took a while but

859
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,360
eventually

860
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,759
just like when i lived in when i lived

861
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:46,079
in chicago uh i never even heard the

862
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:47,759
word tweaker

863
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:49,119
you never heard the word tweet never

864
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:52,000
heard the word tweaker there wasn't

865
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:55,678
tweak in my high school it didn't exist

866
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,919
it did not it did not now eventually it

867
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,278
it [ __ ] it permeated and it was all

868
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:00,640
over the midwest

869
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:02,079
but i straight up tell you in the early

870
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,759
90s when i was in high school like it

871
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:06,158
didn't exist so if someone would have

872
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:08,000
said tweaker to me then

873
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,240
right uh yeah it wouldn't have meant

874
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,679
much now it has like an enormous amount

875
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,679
of meaning because you just know so much

876
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,278
about it right so you talk about what i

877
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,880
what i mean by that is you talk about

878
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:18,798
beasters today

879
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,919
and it has an enormous amount of meaning

880
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:21,599
to people

881
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,080
yeah but you have to realize when

882
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:25,519
bisters first started hitting america we

883
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:27,759
didn't have all this pre-loaded

884
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:28,879
knowledge about what it was like

885
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:32,398
yeah

886
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,520
it was just not weed that wasn't mexican

887
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:34,879
yeah

888
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:35,839
right

889
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,240
you know

890
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:40,639
and uh yeah there was a dude didn't come

891
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,558
to the first week i ever saw in chicago

892
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,679
it was ravers from san francisco who

893
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:45,678
brought it

894
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,519
yeah it was on the west coast but in the

895
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,960
mid in the early and mid 90s it was not

896
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:50,480
in the midwest

897
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,000
yeah and everyone pardoned me for

898
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,519
getting [ __ ] up before the show the

899
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,480
last few weeks have been

900
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:58,240
past my move [ __ ] so i'm not not too

901
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,919
terribly brilliant or quick with it my

902
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,440
apologies

903
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:03,200
so everybody's like [ __ ] he looks high

904
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,880
for once so people said people are still

905
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,558
asking what's what's a beast or beaster

906
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,760
is canadian indoor

907
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:11,599
yeah grown for america and usually it's

908
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:13,440
um it's usually it's harvested a little

909
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:15,759
too soon it's not flushed or dried the

910
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,080
right way and then they put it into

911
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:20,558
airtight ceiling meal bags

912
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:21,918
lightly lightly to somewhat compressed

913
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:23,678
and figured out how to get it into

914
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,360
america because there was such a demand

915
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,600
for weed

916
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:29,759
yeah

917
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:32,480
they could sell endless amounts of it

918
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:34,558
yeah and so there was a huge i mean the

919
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,759
new england was flooded with it

920
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:39,759
new york was flooded with it you know uh

921
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:41,759
the upper midwest you know the west

922
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:43,839
coast and all that and then you know it

923
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:44,798
depends like it got basically knocked

924
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:45,839
off

925
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:48,639
in

926
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:50,639
in the west coast reasonably fast uh

927
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,038
because of 911 and then because of the

928
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,600
burgeoning 215 movement right

929
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:58,879
but it persisted for years

930
00:30:55,599 --> 00:31:01,119
uh in other parts of the country

931
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,360
i'm sure it didn't it

932
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:04,558
is it still persists now do you think i

933
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:06,319
don't know

934
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:07,278
yeah i don't know either i don't know i

935
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:09,678
mean

936
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:11,919
you know it uh i i couldn't tell you i

937
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,919
mean i bet i bet it does i bet there's

938
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:15,759
markets for it

939
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:19,000
maybe somewhere up in the north um i

940
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:19,000
can't say

941
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:22,000
you know who knows could be it could go

942
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,080
it could go all places in this it could

943
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,640
be gone i don't know

944
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:28,639
yeah i mean it's gone in california

945
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,799
i don't see brickweed as much anymore in

946
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,480
california rarely if ever and it was

947
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:35,038
that was like all that was here during

948
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,679
my teenage years i mean i live in mendoz

949
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:39,278
and and i'm not [ __ ] 15. so

950
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,640
i don't uh

951
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:42,398
you know i don't i haven't seen

952
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,519
brickweed in forever

953
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:46,558
yeah

954
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:48,960
yeah no england like even the past maybe

955
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:50,558
10 years it's still 99 percent of what

956
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,720
you'd see people smoking in bakersfield

957
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:54,319
blunts and blunts and blunts of [ __ ]

958
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,159
right

959
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:58,720
yeah so people are talking cali outdoor

960
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,480
is the new beasters in cali and stuff

961
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,640
you know and like there's i live in

962
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,558
california right and there's a lot of

963
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,880
there's a lot of weed that sucks

964
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:08,879
yeah you know there's never there's

965
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,480
never been an era where everyone just

966
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,799
grew the [ __ ] white hot fire and

967
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,399
that's all there was yeah i know i mean

968
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:15,839
how many people really grow out of

969
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:18,000
everybody that's in this chat how many

970
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:19,678
people really grow like the banging you

971
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,038
know i mean realistically if you compare

972
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,360
it all it's not all going to be the same

973
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:25,278
level and then you know on top of that

974
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:27,199
it's it's like sometimes that shitty

975
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:28,880
weed is still the best that you can get

976
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,720
like so that what sucks is that the

977
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,159
places with the least choice

978
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,839
probably gets stuck with the shittiest

979
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:36,559
weed the longest

980
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:39,119
yeah because it gets dislodged in places

981
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:40,158
with choice

982
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:42,959
you know

983
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:44,559
um and you know and so

984
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,319
you know and there's an aspect too where

985
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:47,599
it's like there's there's probably a

986
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:48,798
story there we've been talking about it

987
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:50,959
for a while actually but there's

988
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:53,759
probably a story there of how like

989
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,558
of where america gets its weed

990
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:56,558
yeah

991
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:58,240
and how that's shifted because in the

992
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:00,079
because there was an error there for a

993
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,720
long time where

994
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:04,079
you know all of a sudden uh a lot of

995
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,159
people were getting weed and you can you

996
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:07,759
can laugh at cali weed but like there

997
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:11,039
was a lot of people getting reasonably

998
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:12,720
good quality weed from from out here

999
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:14,158
that was grown with a reasonable amount

1000
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,640
of love too

1001
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,080
yeah you know and now there's an aspect

1002
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,000
too where people are complaining about

1003
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:22,079
where things have gone legal and the

1004
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,319
black market is just exploded between

1005
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:27,038
the asians and the eastern europeans and

1006
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:30,158
the cartels and all that and southern

1007
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:33,038
oregon and the deserts out by you

1008
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:34,799
yeah you know and uh and all that and

1009
00:33:33,038 --> 00:33:36,640
like now there's a [ __ ] ton of weed

1010
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:37,759
being grown by people that don't care at

1011
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,600
all

1012
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:41,359
and people yeah

1013
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:42,879
we might have a resurgence too because

1014
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:44,398
of all these people buying [ __ ] skunk

1015
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,960
one seeds we might have a whole [ __ ]

1016
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:48,558
beast of resurgence can't wait

1017
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,880
and so you know there's there's an

1018
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:55,359
aspect to where it's like a lot of the

1019
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:57,039
best california weed is getting cut off

1020
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:58,558
you know people think you know because

1021
00:33:57,038 --> 00:34:00,000
that's another aspect right where it's

1022
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:01,599
all the it's all the brokers and the

1023
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,480
people that make it go from here to

1024
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:04,959
there

1025
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,120
yeah they choose what what goes from

1026
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,878
here to there yeah and they're looking

1027
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:10,719
at it from their perspective of what's

1028
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:13,759
profitable sure and just like with the

1029
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:16,158
beesters if they can send some some

1030
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,079
shittier stuff that way that they had a

1031
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:20,079
much bigger margin on

1032
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,440
and that and that that run makes them a

1033
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,599
lot more money that's probably what

1034
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,838
they'll do

1035
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,760
you know so it's like everyone you can

1036
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:30,000
all all y'all

1037
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,760
on southeast or east or wherever you are

1038
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,878
that like is bitching about california

1039
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,879
weed it's probably your [ __ ] broker

1040
00:34:34,878 --> 00:34:38,960
the person that brought it there right

1041
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:40,799
yeah they chose

1042
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,838
there was fireweed that they probably

1043
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,039
tried to

1044
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:46,719
try to [ __ ] you know tried to lowball

1045
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:50,239
or turn down because it didn't make them

1046
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:52,878
as much of a margin sure right margins

1047
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:54,319
everything's margins you know and so you

1048
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:56,639
know if you knew somebody that like

1049
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,880
their their whole gig was quality and

1050
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:01,280
and fire and that's what they wanted to

1051
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,480
work with fine yeah if you knew people

1052
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,160
that were like well they're not going to

1053
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,920
have much choice in this part so we're

1054
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:08,159
just going to shift them with this

1055
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,760
then you're probably [ __ ]

1056
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:11,519
yeah you know

1057
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,960
then you're probably [ __ ]

1058
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:15,119
and uh

1059
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,519
you know and so i'm sure you know

1060
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,838
there's i'm sure there's still beast

1061
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:23,519
you know even if it's greatly reduced

1062
00:35:19,838 --> 00:35:25,599
you know uh i mean right now it you know

1063
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:28,079
most people were getting a lot of weed

1064
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:29,599
from mendo and humboldt and trinity and

1065
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,440
a lot of smaller scenes that would all

1066
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:33,119
get aggregated together

1067
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,119
yeah and now

1068
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:37,838
all that all that is the asians and the

1069
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:40,240
bulgarians and the and the freaking uh

1070
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:43,039
and the cartels and all that growing

1071
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:45,279
massive plots

1072
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:46,320
yeah and you know why would a broker go

1073
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,000
and and

1074
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,599
you know and and so you're getting

1075
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,239
shittier weed

1076
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:54,079
yeah you're getting shitty or weed

1077
00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:56,078
you know lots of people in california

1078
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,680
have the fire that doesn't mean that

1079
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:59,200
like every person in the chain between

1080
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:01,519
you and california is going to ensure

1081
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:03,679
that that fire makes it to you

1082
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:05,599
most of it's in one second most of it's

1083
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:06,799
in the bathroom right over there there's

1084
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:09,838
none in here

1085
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,440
you must be at my journey

1086
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:12,400
so people are yeah and you know people

1087
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,639
are

1088
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,240
people delta eight is the new beast you

1089
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:19,440
know how many things when when hemp

1090
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:21,759
became legal people started growing hemp

1091
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,599
and then spraying it with distillate

1092
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:26,000
oh lord yeah

1093
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,680
you know and literally and then and then

1094
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,760
moving that somewhere

1095
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:31,919
right if there's a if there's a

1096
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,079
arbitrage opportunity where people can

1097
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,079
make a big ass [ __ ] margin

1098
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:38,240
yeah by buying something shittier and

1099
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:39,440
passing it off as something way better

1100
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:41,118
they're going to and they're going to do

1101
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,720
that with hash there was a whole thing

1102
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,240
hash isn't my thing

1103
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:46,319
but do you know how much you know you

1104
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:48,319
guys know how much like crc cheap

1105
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,000
extracted hash got passed off as

1106
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:51,680
something nicer

1107
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,280
you know

1108
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:55,759
it's always been that way the most

1109
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,079
common way in mendo was i mentioned it

1110
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,680
before but these depths are so beautiful

1111
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:01,039
i can sell them as indoor and i'll get a

1112
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:04,000
better price point

1113
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:06,079
yeah this outdoor is so fire it looks

1114
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
like it like it's a well-preserved depth

1115
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:09,920
and i can get you more money i think

1116
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,199
that's why lumpa liked the uh west coast

1117
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,680
dog because he could sell it off as

1118
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:15,519
indoor pretty sure i mean people people

1119
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:16,799
are and then and then there's everyone

1120
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:18,320
and then and then even if you're

1121
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,480
honorable all it takes is one

1122
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,280
non-honorable person in the chain

1123
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,039
yeah

1124
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,960
it doesn't take much it doesn't take

1125
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:26,880
much you know and so

1126
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,559
yeah people are talking the old og is

1127
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,320
around a bunch there's tons of people

1128
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:32,239
that have nice ogs

1129
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,160
yeah it's just a matter of is it getting

1130
00:37:32,239 --> 00:37:36,319
grown in bulk to come to wherever you

1131
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:37,920
are probably not is it getting grown

1132
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:41,119
with the same recipe they were using

1133
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,000
back then uh probably not probably not

1134
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:44,160
you know

1135
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,599
and uh you know and so there's an aspect

1136
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:47,199
where yeah hemp sprayed with distillate

1137
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,880
there's any time there's a way where

1138
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:51,199
they can find some cheap ass [ __ ] and

1139
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,320
convince you that it's nicer [ __ ]

1140
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:54,319
there's someone in the middle that's

1141
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,079
making a bunch of money off that so yeah

1142
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,280
they would go up there and they would

1143
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,960
[ __ ] buy

1144
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,320
you know 200

1145
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,760
uh you know hemp pounds an organ

1146
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,119
and then they would take a paint sprayer

1147
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:07,599
and they would spray it with distillate

1148
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:10,960
so it would get you high

1149
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:13,359
and then they'd sell it as real outdoor

1150
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,280
one way to do it

1151
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:17,358
i mean that's kind of that's kind of

1152
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,280
someone just said athena og

1153
00:38:17,358 --> 00:38:21,199
there is a bunch of i don't know what

1154
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,800
the [ __ ] is going on but there's a bunch

1155
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:24,799
of legal scenes and there's a bunch of

1156
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,880
their followers and stuff like that that

1157
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,720
have decided that the cheapest salts on

1158
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:32,320
earth are of cour like automated

1159
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:35,039
delivery is the way to grow weed

1160
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:37,119
and their weed isn't as nice

1161
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:38,719
yeah you know their weed isn't as nice

1162
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:39,920
and so

1163
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:41,598
you know there's there's going to be all

1164
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,639
kinds of that with hash

1165
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:44,800
there's going to be all kinds of that

1166
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:47,759
with weed and

1167
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,599
you know it it uh because if there's a

1168
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,960
if there's an education difference i

1169
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,720
mean you know how many times i used to

1170
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,079
hear up here people would look at

1171
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:56,000
something and they would be like oh this

1172
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:59,440
is fire but can they break down some of

1173
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,440
these bigger buds a little bit more

1174
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:04,559
why right huh why

1175
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:05,358
because indoor doesn't have big buds oh

1176
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:06,320
my god

1177
00:39:05,358 --> 00:39:08,078
i guess that makes sense and they're

1178
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,440
trying to pass it off so it's like i

1179
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:12,240
don't need anything like this bro you

1180
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,920
need to make it smaller yeah you know

1181
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:15,919
because they're in their mind they're

1182
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,400
gonna they're gonna they're gonna pass

1183
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:20,079
it off at some bull as some [ __ ]

1184
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,960
yeah they're gonna say they're you know

1185
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,880
they don't and they don't want the

1186
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,480
customer to be like oh these look like

1187
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,640
sun grown nuts

1188
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,159
yeah because then they just shaved off x

1189
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:29,440
off their percentage they were planning

1190
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:31,679
on making

1191
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,838
so you know people california and the

1192
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:35,598
west coast can get a bad rap and there's

1193
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:36,559
plenty of bad weed here but it's also

1194
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,400
like

1195
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:40,239
you know it's it's it's also a bunch of

1196
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,559
choices in between

1197
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:44,479
yeah you know and i think i i don't know

1198
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:45,838
i think athena is just like [ __ ] luxe

1199
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:47,760
lighting i think athena is probably

1200
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:48,960
owned by jungle boys

1201
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,800
and they sure

1202
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,320
and they and they promote the [ __ ] out

1203
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,320
of it saying that they've tested it

1204
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,000
against all kinds of different other

1205
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,640
other nutrients and it's come out the

1206
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,719
best and they grow the fire and then

1207
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:03,679
they build up a bunch of sales for

1208
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:05,919
athena and it's cheap and then they're

1209
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:09,039
gonna offer and they're gonna off the

1210
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,880
company and make a [ __ ] ton of money

1211
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:12,719
possible yeah when if you want to use

1212
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,880
something like athena you can go buy

1213
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:16,399
some real cheap salts that doesn't have

1214
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,960
the athena makeup that's probably the

1215
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,639
exact same thing just in a different bag

1216
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,318
that's how a lot of nutrient companies

1217
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:24,799
are done i mean you know there's one

1218
00:40:22,318 --> 00:40:26,318
supplier and they ask for certain mixes

1219
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,119
and ranges but it's all based out of the

1220
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:31,279
same [ __ ] you know that happens a lot

1221
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:32,318
yeah you know it happens a lot you know

1222
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,440
and so

1223
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:35,039
um

1224
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,639
there's there's an aspect where it's

1225
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:38,639
like i don't dis on all salts they're

1226
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:40,000
salts i like quite a bit actually for

1227
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:42,239
the application

1228
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,480
i'm a housing garden sucker in canada

1229
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:46,078
but mostly i like canna i like canna i

1230
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,920
like cutting edge

1231
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,960
shout out to my buddy john

1232
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,480
um

1233
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,318
you know there's there's good salts out

1234
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,679
there used properly that'll do fine for

1235
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:55,599
you you know there's

1236
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:57,118
even even stuff like jacks the main

1237
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:59,280
issue with some of the cheaper stuff is

1238
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:01,680
now they do a bunch of testing a lot of

1239
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,519
it has high heavy metal content or other

1240
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:04,399
additives that aren't the jam

1241
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:05,920
yeah

1242
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,079
you know i like i like the empty

1243
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,880
someone's asking for like a good dry

1244
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:12,400
salt i like the npk brand um where you

1245
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,880
can buy each

1246
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:17,680
individual element separately so you can

1247
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,680
run it exactly as you want i like that a

1248
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:22,078
lot if someone's going to use something

1249
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:24,719
old and basic i would i would almost

1250
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:26,480
just say use jacks

1251
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:27,679
jacks321

1252
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,960
you know there you go it's like a

1253
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:30,879
classic

1254
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,519
you know wasn't that in the og recipe

1255
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,039
jacks is that a poppy yeah and you know

1256
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:37,358
i said cutting edge you know full

1257
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:40,239
disclosure like my buddy john owns

1258
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:42,239
cutting edge he started it in 0-1

1259
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:45,118
he's been a grower he was grower up here

1260
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:46,799
from the 70s on and so hum and mendo

1261
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:49,119
uh he knows he it's like one of the

1262
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,640
first nutrients formulated for growers

1263
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:52,079
by an old grower

1264
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:53,759
uh yeah and he's real he's real smart

1265
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,519
and he's a real nice guy and it's

1266
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,119
supporting one of us

1267
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:58,719
um you know

1268
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:00,079
and uh

1269
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:02,639
people ask me how do i feel about the

1270
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:04,560
new line i use the new line uh their

1271
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:06,719
louder powder they call it i use that on

1272
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:07,759
like a big farm down south for a year

1273
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:09,598
and a half

1274
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,359
uh before i left

1275
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,559
um so

1276
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:14,639
you know but

1277
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:16,799
um there's an aspect there where it's

1278
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:19,519
like they uh

1279
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,039
you know beasters was sort of our first

1280
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:24,079
beasters was sort of like the first

1281
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:25,838
commercial weed that came to america

1282
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:27,680
that wasn't mexican that was in the

1283
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:29,199
first indoor commercial

1284
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:30,719
yeah right because americans weren't

1285
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:33,039
really able to pull off hundreds and

1286
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:35,279
hundreds and hundreds of lights

1287
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:36,880
like the way the bc crews were doing at

1288
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,680
the time and the canadian crews were

1289
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,760
doing

1290
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:41,759
you know so it's kind of like

1291
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,520
beast to me like some of that stuff

1292
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,599
isn't that different than like a lot of

1293
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:48,079
these like big rockwool farms you see

1294
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:50,079
right now in [ __ ] legal scenes

1295
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:51,119
it's almost like we've come full circle

1296
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:54,160
yeah

1297
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:56,000
it's just dried nicer

1298
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:58,799
you know but it's still that cardboard

1299
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,358
lead yeah you know sure

1300
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,400
and all that you know so

1301
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:04,480
um

1302
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,480
people talk about cutting edge talking i

1303
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,679
mean nutrients its own whole thing or

1304
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,440
whatever but

1305
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:11,919
um there's uh

1306
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:14,318
you know nutrients pretty misunderstood

1307
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,760
but you know there's an aspect where

1308
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:17,199
um

1309
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,720
you know you could get people that are

1310
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:20,239
trying to grow the best weed they can

1311
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:21,118
and trying to get a really nice number

1312
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:23,759
for it

1313
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:25,599
or you can get people that are just in a

1314
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,280
in a larger group that are just trying

1315
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:30,480
to grow the cheapest weed they can and

1316
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:33,440
still get the best price they can get it

1317
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,960
yeah you know um and so

1318
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,480
you know there's uh

1319
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,920
you know there's an aspect where it's

1320
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,039
like

1321
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,880
i don't know

1322
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:42,400
um

1323
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,000
i almost think that probably all that

1324
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,000
stuff that they like people dis on

1325
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,119
california for going east was probably

1326
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,960
better

1327
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:50,559
than their alternatives

1328
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,159
i would think so i would have better

1329
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:53,759
than it was better than b it was

1330
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:55,838
probably better grown than beester and

1331
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,640
it was certainly nicer than mexico

1332
00:43:55,838 --> 00:43:58,480

1333
00:43:56,639 --> 00:44:00,639

people diss it now

1335
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:03,920
but why did it get that successful

1336
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,079
because it was better

1337

interesting cat you know i i'll say that

1386
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:38,480
um

1387
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:40,239
you know uh

1388
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,318
the old timers like him the guys in

1389
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:44,159
their 60s and their 70s

1390
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:46,719
a lot of times the stories they tell

1391
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:48,799
they don't come with a lot of like uh

1392
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:50,879
corroboration from others

1393
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,200
so it's like how much do you how much do

1394
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:55,760
you take at face value

1395
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:58,719
and not just him neville sam you know

1396
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:00,240
sam skunk man mel

1397
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:01,919
you can name tons of different folks

1398
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:04,239
right and

1399
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,599
you know and and and so

1400
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:08,000
you know he

1401
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:11,200
he was obviously a collector

1402
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,119
um and you know he the last five or ten

1403
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:14,799
years or so probably he started he

1404
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:17,358
started spreading his seeds out to lots

1405
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,880
of different people

1406
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:20,880
you would say right he wanted a lot of

1407
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,920
different people to try his stuff yes

1408
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,240
yes

1409
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:26,079
you know and he was pretty free with

1410
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:29,598
sharing seeds with people or sending

1411
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:31,200
them things you know um i would say so

1412
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:33,599
that's good in the sense that if you

1413
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:35,838
want to keep his his work alive a lot of

1414
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:38,160
people have it uh it'll be interesting

1415
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:40,719
to see if uh you know i'm sure it's

1416
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:42,399
already happening who starts to exploit

1417
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:44,078
uh the fact that he's gone

1418
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,318
yeah you know

1419
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:48,079
um but you know he

1420
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:50,639

1422
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:55,039
the original dj short according to

1423
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:57,679

1424
00:46:55,039 --> 00:47:00,880
massive role in blueberry yeah and that

1425
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:02,960
yeah and that he was the real dj short

1426
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,880
you know uh he was the guy that was

1427
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:07,599
actually responsible for creating

1428
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:10,800
blueberry yeah typing and he said his

1429

1435
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,639

yeah

1451
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:56,800

coming out and saying uh [ __ ] this sam

1453

his mouth is [ __ ] he used to work

1457
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,079
for me yeah

1458
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,920
but you've got like this massive amount

1459
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:11,119
of history of

1460
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:14,079
assumption

1461
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:16,480
yes which is that dj did it so trying to

1462
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:18,640
trying to shift all that is a major

1463
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,000
that's a big shift that's a big shift it

1464
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:22,078
is a big shift that's a big but he

1465
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,838
wasn't quiet about it no you know he

1466
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:24,880
just said it like matter of fact so it's

1467
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:26,719
like how the

1468
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,000
how am i supposed to know yeah but then

1469
00:48:26,719 --> 00:48:30,799
there's also this thing too where i

1470
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,559
think blueberry is a common enough name

1471
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:35,800
you know um

1472
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:35,800
that but

1473
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,800
i mean dj short's not a common enough

1474
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:43,200
name and especially

1475
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,480
blueberry it kind of means that one of

1476
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:46,159
them is not telling the truth and it's

1477
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,199
just up to you guys to figure out who

1478
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:49,519
you believe

1479
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:51,358
yeah i mean he was i mean it's like i

1480
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:53,519
don't know if he's i haven't listened to

1481

1482
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:56,480
yeah so i don't know if he i don't know

1483
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:58,000
if he wanted to do that i don't know if

1484
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:00,240
he went into depth on it or anything

1485
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,000
like that you know but

1486
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:03,519

00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:19,039
them which you know means declare them

1553

you forget about all the other stuff i i

1555
00:51:21,838 --> 00:51:25,358
have a really bad personality where i

1556
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,640
keep the same energy that i had when

1557

00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,318
to lose anyone and i know i had a lot of

1561
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:37,119
friends in the community and i hope they

1562
00:51:34,318 --> 00:51:38,558
all you know pull together and and and

1563
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:40,880

00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:42,800
yeah and you know hopefully people find

1565
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,318
things that they like amongst his beings

1566
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:46,079

1567
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:47,679
and if you do keep them alive keep them

1568
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:50,318
going

1569
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:51,679
you know and uh and and and figure and

1570
00:51:50,318 --> 00:51:53,519
figure all that out you know i mean i

1571
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:55,598
have the same issue too like you know

1572
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:57,440
with telling certain stories you know

1573
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:58,960
it's always hard with weed because

1574
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,318
there's certain people that don't really

1575
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,480
want to be mentioned

1576
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:03,838
yeah and don't want their stories told

1577
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,800
all that much

1578
00:52:03,838 --> 00:52:09,039
um and uh and but then maybe they played

1579
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:10,480
an important role in history yeah

1580
00:52:09,039 --> 00:52:12,000
there's one person just for people

1581
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,920
asking there is one person that we know

1582
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,440
for sure in the us that worked directly

1583
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:17,039
with neville at any level and it was at

1584
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:19,599
a very small level and that was clyde

1585
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:22,079
stevens so anybody else making that

1586
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:24,318
claim it cannot be corroborated at all

1587
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:27,200
or even a little bit yeah clyde

1588
00:52:24,318 --> 00:52:28,239
and clyde was neville's photographer yep

1589
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:30,879
and it's

1590
00:52:28,239 --> 00:52:32,558
it's verified that clyde neville went to

1591
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,400
afghanistan together

1592
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:36,160
and also on operation green merchant

1593
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,760
they were both kind of a part of it so

1594
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:39,118
they were both kind of a part of it yeah

1595
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,720
there's a bunch of pictures there's a

1596
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:42,318
lot of he was a photographer so there's

1597
00:52:40,719 --> 00:52:44,879
a lot of photographic

1598
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:47,440
evidence of all that you know

1599
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:50,000
um but you know what's what matt and i

1600
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:51,920
always laugh about uh whenever we hear

1601
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,880
whether it's from hawaii or alaska or

1602
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:55,119
wherever

1603
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:57,200
that of course you would pick

1604
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:58,880
someone to back up your stuff that lives

1605
00:52:57,199 --> 00:53:00,799
on another continent

1606
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,640
in a country where the dea is trying to

1607
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,720
put you away for life in prison for

1608
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:06,239
decades on end yeah that is the most

1609
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:08,719
convenient place that you would try to

1610
00:53:06,239 --> 00:53:10,558
back up all of your stuff and do and do

1611
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:13,039
pheno hunting and testing and

1612
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:14,319
conversations and be involved

1613
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:16,318
you know yep

1614
00:53:14,318 --> 00:53:18,719
uh rather than somebody down the street

1615
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:21,119
in holland or somebody in in the

1616
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:22,639
netherlands somewhere or europeans in

1617
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:23,760
general

1618
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:26,078
you know

1619
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:27,520
um but then it was just i mean

1620
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:28,880
so there's aspects where there's certain

1621
00:53:27,519 --> 00:53:30,480
stories that matt and i know are

1622
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,400
provably false

1623
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,838
yeah and then there's ones that like

1624
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,358
they have some parts where you really

1625
00:53:33,838 --> 00:53:36,558
wonder could they be you know if they're

1626
00:53:35,358 --> 00:53:39,039
true or not

1627
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:42,319
but you don't have any proof

1628
00:53:39,039 --> 00:53:43,358
one way or the other it's just the story

1629
00:53:42,318 --> 00:53:45,440
yeah

1630
00:53:43,358 --> 00:53:47,119
and um and in the interview i mean we

1631
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:49,358
can kind of bring this up now so we

1632
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:50,960
posted an interview on patreon for our

1633
00:53:49,358 --> 00:53:53,598
patreon subscribers that was an

1634
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:55,599
interview with uh a man named kevin

1635
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:57,440
bjornsen and he was a major part of the

1636
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:59,838

1637
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:02,159
operation green merchant um i don't know

1638
00:53:59,838 --> 00:54:04,078
if the story really is that he was green

1639
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:05,679
merchant per se but i know he believes

1640
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:08,000
that story very deeply that he is the

1641
00:54:05,679 --> 00:54:09,759
reason for the season on it um but we

00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:26,879
plate numbers from people he says they

1651
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:30,318
weren't real but that was a part of the

1652
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,318
operation green merchant bust

1653
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:35,119
what the the the basic story of green

1654
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:37,440
merchant so people that don't know is in

1655
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:38,798
1989

1656
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:42,159
growth store

1657
00:54:38,798 --> 00:54:45,280
got busted for being tied into weed

1658
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:48,639
and when they rated it supposedly they

1659
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:51,280
found a series of neville's catalogs

1660
00:54:48,639 --> 00:54:53,838
with written out orders and money and

1661
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:56,480
names and whatnot yeah and then they

1662
00:54:53,838 --> 00:54:59,759
realized okay that neville was selling

1663
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:00,480
millions of dollars in seed

1664
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:03,760
to

1665
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,639
all these people all over america

1666
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:08,240
right

1667
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:10,798
and uh they freaked out okay because

1668
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:12,959
they had no idea this was going on

1669
00:55:10,798 --> 00:55:14,480
and supposedly even more so than that

1670
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,240
and this is that

1671
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:18,639
neville actually did this thing where he

1672
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:20,479
sent guys with suitcases full of wheat

1673
00:55:18,639 --> 00:55:22,239
full of seeds to america

1674
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:25,280
and supposedly most of the seeds that he

1675
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:27,838
did were mailed from america the money

1676
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:30,400
went to the money went to holland yeah i

1677
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:31,519
mean allegedly played allegedly and then

1678
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,838
i mean he's dead what are you gonna do

1679
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:36,239
he's dead now but no he's not oh neville

1680
00:55:33,838 --> 00:55:38,159
yeah neville never yeah and you know

1681
00:55:36,239 --> 00:55:40,558
neville had there was so neville was

1682
00:55:38,159 --> 00:55:42,879
mailing seeds from within the us with a

1683
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:44,079
compatriot and then getting the money in

1684
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:46,000
holland

1685
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:47,599
and no one had any idea he was doing

1686
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,199
this because he was the first seed bank

1687
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:51,280
so nobody really realized that there was

1688
00:55:49,199 --> 00:55:52,960
anything going on and when green

1689
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,640
merchant when they realized that people

1690
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:57,039
in gross stores were like buying and

1691
00:55:54,639 --> 00:55:58,719
selling seeds yeah and some of these

1692
00:55:57,039 --> 00:56:00,639
stores were like buying a bunch of seeds

1693
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:02,719
and then selling them to their customers

1694
00:56:00,639 --> 00:56:05,440
with the lights they did this thing

1695
00:56:02,719 --> 00:56:06,480
called operation green merchant where

1696
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,798
they

1697
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:11,838
raided every single hydroponic store in

1698
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:14,159
the country yeah all at once all at once

1699
00:56:11,838 --> 00:56:15,759
boom same day same time everything same

1700
00:56:14,159 --> 00:56:18,480
day same time

1701
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:21,040
nationwide nationwide raid

1702
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:22,240
and the gentleman uh that we did the

1703
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:23,279
interview with

1704
00:56:22,239 --> 00:56:24,879
um

1705
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:27,359
you know he was part of that he owned a

1706
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:30,880
grocery store he was tied into the whole

1707
00:56:27,358 --> 00:56:32,719
northern lights pacific northwest crew

1708
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,480
right and had one of the only grow

1709
00:56:32,719 --> 00:56:36,318
stores in that area one of the first so

1710
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:39,358
he was one of the biggest targets at the

1711
00:56:36,318 --> 00:56:43,119
time and so that is sort of the

1712
00:56:39,358 --> 00:56:44,639
the the domino that when um when matt

1713
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:47,760
interviewed greg

1714
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:50,078
all the northern lights crew got busted

1715
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:51,839
yeah like it was rolling bust they got

1716
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:53,920
customer lists they got all kinds of

1717
00:56:51,838 --> 00:56:56,480
things different people snitched

1718
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:58,559
different people ratted on each other uh

1719
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:01,280
somebody at 1989.

1720
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:03,359
yeah 1989 operation green merchant

1721
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:05,280
happened every single hydroponic store

1722
00:57:03,358 --> 00:57:07,039
in the country was rated same day same

1723
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,480
time and then they took a bunch of

1724
00:57:07,039 --> 00:57:10,159
evidence that they got from that and

1725
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,838
they took a bunch of people that's what

1726
00:57:10,159 --> 00:57:14,639
matt was saying was that they after they

1727
00:57:11,838 --> 00:57:17,199
raided him they made uh jordanson write

1728
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:19,279
down a bunch of license plate numbers

1729
00:57:17,199 --> 00:57:21,679
and it's debatable on whether he gave

1730
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:23,519
them real ones or not he claims that he

1731
00:57:21,679 --> 00:57:25,598
wrote down fake ones that were not

1732
00:57:23,519 --> 00:57:27,599
related to the gross store but they that

1733
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:29,440
was when people used to get scared like

1734
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:31,359
when i first started growing we would

1735
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:33,280
always go to the grocery store in a

1736
00:57:31,358 --> 00:57:34,159
vehicle that a friend that lived a clean

1737
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,000
life

1738
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:37,519
yeah and i would pay him

1739
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,440
because we were always worried about our

1740
00:57:37,519 --> 00:57:41,039
license plate getting written down or a

1741
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:43,358
picture of the vehicle getting taken

1742
00:57:41,039 --> 00:57:45,358
with the license plate you know because

1743
00:57:43,358 --> 00:57:47,838
this had just happened

1744
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:49,679
and they used to um

1745
00:57:47,838 --> 00:57:51,119
you know and because weed was totally

1746
00:57:49,679 --> 00:57:52,960
illegal everywhere

1747
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:54,720
yeah and that's what got that's what got

1748
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,639
neville thrown into

1749
00:57:54,719 --> 00:57:58,798
prison for a year

1750
00:57:56,639 --> 00:58:00,960
yep um and he was fighting extradition

1751
00:57:58,798 --> 00:58:03,440
to the united states and that's when he

1752
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:05,838
lost his uh his seed company because he

1753
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:07,440
had to sell it to the drunkards for them

1754
00:58:05,838 --> 00:58:11,759
to pay for him to get out of jail and

1755
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:13,519
get back to holland yeah um and uh

1756
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:15,200
you know and you know we we thought

1757
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:17,280
about for a long time we didn't we did

1758
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:20,480
that interview quite a long time ago

1759
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:23,359
uh and uh we decided not to release it

1760
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:25,119
mostly because our our general theme

1761
00:58:23,358 --> 00:58:27,279
here has sort of been like history and

1762
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:30,798
weed education and and lead people

1763
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:33,440
bullshitting yeah uh and most people

1764
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:36,079
don't know but i was a i tried to be an

1765
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:38,240
active participant in that interview uh

1766
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:39,359
i just couldn't get a word in

1767
00:58:38,239 --> 00:58:41,039
he couldn't

1768
00:58:39,358 --> 00:58:42,880
he was so offended that's the first time

1769
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:45,119
he's ever been quiet

1770
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:47,039
yeah and then i think matt got a couple

1771
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:49,358
of words in a few sentences here and

1772
00:58:47,039 --> 00:58:51,920
there yeah um but it was basically like

1773
00:58:49,358 --> 00:58:54,558
a mass monologue from the dude

1774
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:56,720
and while he has an immense amount of

1775
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:58,798
weed knowledge in his head and an

1776
00:58:56,719 --> 00:59:00,558
immense amount of stories he could tell

1777
00:58:58,798 --> 00:59:02,719
from that time frame

1778
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:04,880
he was much more interested in telling

1779
00:59:02,719 --> 00:59:06,399
stories of his wild youth

1780
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,079
and politics i think he thought the

1781
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:10,000
interview was more about his life as

1782
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:11,599
opposed to what we talk about

1783
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,199
yeah we were hoping to sort of get a

1784
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:15,760
weed centric

1785
00:59:13,199 --> 00:59:18,558
one thing that we did get was that he

1786
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:20,160
did say didn't he say that the old g13

1787
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:21,359
and the uw

1788
00:59:20,159 --> 00:59:24,078
was sort of

1789
00:59:21,358 --> 00:59:25,759
was one in the same yeah and i forgot a

1790
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:27,039
few times in a few other places so when

1791
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:28,240
i heard that i was like wait what what

1792
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:30,880
what

1793
00:59:28,239 --> 00:59:32,479
what yeah no i mean he he i mean he was

1794
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:35,480
and the the reason why we interviewed

1795
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:38,159
him was because greg seattle greg of

1796
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:40,000
nlfame was like this guy was there he

1797
00:59:38,159 --> 00:59:42,159
was around he was connected to all of us

1798
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,519
he's the one that you need to talk to

1799
00:59:42,159 --> 00:59:44,960
he's the one that's gonna tell you

1800
00:59:43,519 --> 00:59:47,280
everything he's the one that you need to

1801
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:50,480
know he has so much stuffed up in that

1802
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:53,040
head yeah uh and then

1803
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:55,039
uh you know it was about 45 seconds of

1804
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:56,639
actual weed info

1805
00:59:55,039 --> 00:59:59,119
and then a bunch of you know crazy

1806
00:59:56,639 --> 01:00:00,879
politics and hookers and and this and

1807
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:02,559
that but there was some interesting

1808
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:04,000
green merchant stuff yeah the green

1809
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:06,000
merchant stuff i thought was interesting

1810
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,760
because he was really wrapped up in that

1811
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,280
he was one of the store owners that was

1812
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:11,040
raided by the feds

1813
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:12,880
and he basically admitted that he had to

1814
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:15,358
cooperate with them

1815
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,960
to not go to prison for a long time yes

1816
01:00:15,358 --> 01:00:18,719
but that he tried to fake all the

1817
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:20,400
information they got so no one else got

1818
01:00:18,719 --> 01:00:22,639
in trouble

1819
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,639
yeah

1820
01:00:22,798 --> 01:00:25,358
you know

1821
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,599
um

1822
01:00:25,358 --> 01:00:30,159
and uh

1823
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:32,720
you know so uh

1824
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:34,480
people are out like who knows dude uh

1825
01:00:32,719 --> 01:00:37,039
yeah right

1826
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:39,119
but yeah but you know uw being g13 and

1827
01:00:37,039 --> 01:00:41,679
adding to that story and like you know

1828
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:43,760
he set up tons of growers he grew a

1829
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:45,440
bunch of different strains back then and

1830
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:48,000
he probably could have chatted for an

1831
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:49,760
hour and a half about just that yeah

1832
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,760
but that really wasn't what interested

1833
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:53,200
him so he just started

1834
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:54,640
wrapping it was a very politically

1835
01:00:53,199 --> 01:00:56,558
charged time too it was like i think

1836
01:00:54,639 --> 01:00:57,519
it's right before the election so it

1837
01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:00,240
yeah

1838
01:00:57,519 --> 01:01:01,759
yeah it was probably fresh in his mind

1839
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:03,358
and he's like

1840
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,880
he's an older dead

1841
01:01:03,358 --> 01:01:06,239
in a retirement home i think or

1842
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:08,000
something like that and so just to be

1843
01:01:06,239 --> 01:01:10,078
able to talk to people

1844
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,358
you know there was a lot there was a lot

1845
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:12,160
of stories

1846
01:01:11,358 --> 01:01:14,159
yeah

1847
01:01:12,159 --> 01:01:15,920
you know there was a lot of stories um

1848
01:01:14,159 --> 01:01:17,920
and so we didn't release it for a long

1849
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:20,559
time because

1850
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:21,920
um it was pretty light on wheat

1851
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:24,400
yeah

1852
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:25,680
you know uh it was it was certainly

1853
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:28,160
colorful

1854
01:01:25,679 --> 01:01:29,519
sure yeah that was it was funny as hell

1855
01:01:28,159 --> 01:01:31,519
it was certainly colorful i mean there

1856
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:34,159
was an aspect to people like where

1857
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:35,440
he said he he uh he tested positive for

1858
01:01:34,159 --> 01:01:37,598
cocaine

1859
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:39,760
yeah uh to his probation officer but it

1860
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:41,599
was only because he was eating out a

1861
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:42,880
hooker and he blew something like i mean

1862
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:44,559
he had some pretty

1863
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:47,838
it was uh

1864
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:49,839
it was it was uh yeah it was um

1865
01:01:47,838 --> 01:01:53,599
he had some pretty crazy stories

1866
01:01:49,838 --> 01:01:55,599
you know yeah uh and um

1867
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:56,880
you know and so but that's but with that

1868
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:58,480
what that is is that's a really good

1869
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,960
indication of

1870
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:02,960
a lot of these old old-time guys that

1871
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:04,720
you want to talk to you want them to

1872
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:08,318
just like dish out an immense amount of

1873
01:02:04,719 --> 01:02:09,759
lineage and specific history yeah and a

1874
01:02:08,318 --> 01:02:11,119
lot of them it's really hard to get it

1875
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:13,680
out of that

1876
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:15,358
yeah for sure it is it's not it's it's

1877
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:17,279
they either don't remember

1878
01:02:15,358 --> 01:02:20,400
or they didn't write it down

1879
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:22,319
or you know dj short was like that

1880
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,519
you know greg was certainly like that

1881
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:26,558
when you start asking a bunch of

1882
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:28,480
specifics about the various nl numbers

1883
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:30,319
that was hard um if if you go back and

1884
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:32,400
listen to that that first interview with

1885
01:02:30,318 --> 01:02:35,119
uh greg it was me and my friend kanza at

1886
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,798
the time uh doing the interview and he

1887
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:38,318
was not so much as interested in talking

1888
01:02:36,798 --> 01:02:40,639
about the past more talking about the

1889
01:02:38,318 --> 01:02:43,358
future and i think that that's a lot you

1890
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:44,400
know i mean that's how a lot are

1891
01:02:43,358 --> 01:02:46,159
you know it's like you don't want to

1892
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,680
diss who they are now

1893
01:02:46,159 --> 01:02:49,759
yeah but

1894
01:02:47,679 --> 01:02:51,919
what you're really after is like you

1895
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:54,160
know you're lucky if you play any kind

1896
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:55,358
of cool moment in history once

1897
01:02:54,159 --> 01:02:58,000
yeah

1898
01:02:55,358 --> 01:03:00,000
much less repeatedly you know so you

1899
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,159
talk to some of these guys and it's like

1900
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,119
they you know like you know the amount

1901
01:03:02,159 --> 01:03:04,879
of

1902
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:06,880
knowledge and and

1903
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,760
information that ben and alan drunkers

1904
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:11,119
have

1905
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:12,960
oh i'm sure but they're terrible

1906
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:15,200
and everyone's told me you can't get

1907
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:16,798
jack [ __ ] out of them and they just toe

1908
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:18,798
the line that their business is the

1909
01:03:16,798 --> 01:03:21,358
exact same it's that like they don't

1910
01:03:18,798 --> 01:03:23,759
they won't tell it just doesn't matter

1911
01:03:21,358 --> 01:03:25,519
i think i think also like just because

1912
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,319
they were there it doesn't mean that

1913
01:03:25,519 --> 01:03:29,119
they

1914
01:03:26,318 --> 01:03:30,798
paid any attention at all to what was

1915
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:32,160
going on or

1916
01:03:30,798 --> 01:03:34,000
cared enough to memorize anything

1917
01:03:32,159 --> 01:03:36,399
they're business dudes you know yeah

1918
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,559
they just it just wasn't it wasn't what

1919
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:41,039
they were into you know i mean you would

1920
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:43,680
think that like you know that steve that

1921
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:45,280
uh that's greg would remember a bunch of

1922
01:03:43,679 --> 01:03:46,719
stuff but he was basically just like oh

1923
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,920
the one and the two you know he knew a

1924
01:03:46,719 --> 01:03:49,279
couple things

1925
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:51,680
yeah and then he was like the rest was

1926
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:53,920
just a wild orgy of sativas and

1927
01:03:51,679 --> 01:03:56,000
different things we were trying and

1928
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:58,318
notes got you in trouble so

1929
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,239
yeah you know and nl9 never made it out

1930
01:03:58,318 --> 01:04:01,599
like that just for people to know that's

1931
01:04:00,239 --> 01:04:02,639
just never happened

1932
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:05,519
um

1933
01:04:02,639 --> 01:04:07,440
yeah nl9 got popular i will say that nl9

1934
01:04:05,519 --> 01:04:09,920
was a legend and

1935
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:11,599
neville sold it for like maybe one year

1936
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:14,720
as a hybrid to some other [ __ ] like

1937
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:16,480
maybe nl9 by skunk one or something yeah

1938
01:04:14,719 --> 01:04:19,038
and then it disappeared and nobody saw

1939
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:21,760
it for 10 or 15 years yeah but what i'm

1940
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:23,680
referring to is the nl9 from um

1941
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:25,680
greg that wasn't one that was passed

1942
01:04:23,679 --> 01:04:28,480
yeah no and then and then all of a

1943
01:04:25,679 --> 01:04:31,279
sudden that the name nl9 started showing

1944
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:34,000
up in canadian seed banks sure yeah

1945
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:36,559
after like not not being around for a

1946
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:38,239
long time yeah it was one of those ones

1947
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:40,798
that like re-popped

1948
01:04:38,239 --> 01:04:44,239
yeah you know um

1949
01:04:40,798 --> 01:04:45,679
and uh yeah and so you know there's

1950
01:04:44,239 --> 01:04:49,679
there's parts of that where it's like

1951
01:04:45,679 --> 01:04:51,358
people uh you know um

1952
01:04:49,679 --> 01:04:53,440

we and a lot of times we are quirky and

1957
01:05:01,519 --> 01:05:05,519

01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:42,559
in arizona

1976
01:05:39,199 --> 01:05:44,558
oh really you know um it did exist you

1977
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:46,559
know um yeah it did

1978
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:48,319
it did exist you know and it was it was

1979
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:50,000
a little it was taken in a little

1980
01:05:48,318 --> 01:05:51,279
different direction than skunk one but

1981
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,039
it just

1982
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:55,839
i don't know um

1983
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:57,599
it seemed like uh

1984
01:05:55,838 --> 01:05:59,920
that's another one of those

1985
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:02,000
skunk six and leadville somebody talked

1986
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:02,880
about that that is a totally different

1987
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,239
thing

1988
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:09,200
that's a specific cut yeah right and

1989
01:06:06,239 --> 01:06:10,879
that cut uh and the ms and the original

1990
01:06:09,199 --> 01:06:14,399
mss

1991
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:17,838
uh that my buddy um got back east and

1992
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:21,920
brought west is the exact same cut yes

1993
01:06:17,838 --> 01:06:23,599
um i i believe it's lost and and as best

1994
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:26,079
we know it was supposed to be what a

1995
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:28,480
super skunk hybrid of some sort

1996
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:30,318
yeah i mean what uh we we chatted with

1997
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:33,280
the guy who made it um

1998
01:06:30,318 --> 01:06:35,358
uh skunk va's mentor or whatever too and

1999
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:37,280
he was a little light on details like a

2000
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:40,159
lot of these old guys he's kind of a you

2001
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:43,359
know a rainbow cat or whatever but um he

2002
01:06:40,159 --> 01:06:45,759
talked about he got skunks from neville

2003
01:06:43,358 --> 01:06:47,038
and from super sativa seed club for two

2004
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:49,200
or three years

2005
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:51,680
yeah and bred them together and called

2006
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:53,919
it his skunky skunk

2007
01:06:51,679 --> 01:06:56,318
right and then he took that

2008
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:59,200
and he crossed it to super skunk when

2009
01:06:56,318 --> 01:07:02,159
super skunk first came out and then the

2010
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:04,879
the skunk six or the super skunk that

2011
01:07:02,159 --> 01:07:08,879
that went to chemdawg and matt in mass

2012
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:10,880
from my buddy uh who brought it west um

2013
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:12,480
that's all the same pheno

2014
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:13,358
of that dude's work

2015
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:16,079
yes

2016
01:07:13,358 --> 01:07:17,759
you know uh and then

2017
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:19,039
um

2018
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:20,480
you know and then there's a whole story

2019
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:22,400
behind that that guy had to go on the

2020
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:23,920
run for some grateful dead related [ __ ]

2021
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:25,760
for a long time

2022
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:28,639
and it seemed like a bunch of people in

2023
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:30,240
colorado called it the skunk six and our

2024
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:31,759
little crew in california just referred

2025
01:07:30,239 --> 01:07:32,798
to it as super skunk

2026
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:35,200
yes

2027
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:36,159
uh both appear to be gone

2028
01:07:35,199 --> 01:07:37,838
yes

2029
01:07:36,159 --> 01:07:39,199
me you know i mean me

2030
01:07:37,838 --> 01:07:40,798
i mean there's there's there's a lot of

2031
01:07:39,199 --> 01:07:42,719
rumor what it seems like what happened

2032
01:07:40,798 --> 01:07:44,239
is that there's some later stuff that's

2033
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:46,318
way more afghan

2034
01:07:44,239 --> 01:07:48,639
that's called mss that floats around

2035
01:07:46,318 --> 01:07:51,279
massachusetts and that was pictured in

2036
01:07:48,639 --> 01:07:53,598
the high times later on uh this is very

2037
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:54,640
different looking than the original one

2038
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:57,119
uh it's

2039
01:07:54,639 --> 01:07:58,639
squatter more afghan thicker

2040
01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:00,559
um

2041
01:07:58,639 --> 01:08:02,400
all that and uh

2042
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:04,000
um and so there's a lot of people i

2043
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:06,639
think that have it but don't have the

2044
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,719
first one yeah i know um there was a

2045
01:08:06,639 --> 01:08:11,759
selection blaze it panda did

2046
01:08:08,719 --> 01:08:13,919
from a uh what was it was sour dub cross

2047
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:16,159
to reverse diesel that i had done

2048
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:19,279
and he selected a pheno from it that was

2049
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:22,238
dead on identical looking to the the

2050
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:24,719
mass super skunk shown in the high times

2051
01:08:22,238 --> 01:08:28,238
kem dog issue and that that has made the

2052
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:30,079
rounds as mass super itself and we've

2053
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:31,198
tried to tell people that's not it but

2054
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:32,798
it don't matter

2055
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:35,039
i mean there's an aspect too where it's

2056
01:08:32,798 --> 01:08:37,519
like eventually because it's just a

2057
01:08:35,039 --> 01:08:39,519
legend to almost everyone right because

2058
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:40,400
the percentage of people out there that

2059
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:43,120
actually

2060
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:44,960
legitimately grew the cut is quite small

2061
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:46,880
actually right so

2062
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:49,520
um anything that has those terps or

2063
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:52,400
anything that could be plausibly claimed

2064
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:55,359
we've already seen five or six years of

2065
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:57,759
uh claims made without any proof

2066
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:59,039
that people don't find anything right

2067
01:08:57,759 --> 01:09:00,640
yeah there's a whole era there where

2068
01:08:59,039 --> 01:09:03,359
there's there's there's companies that

2069
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:06,159
put skunk on their logo real big on

2070
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:07,279
their logo and they don't have any skunk

2071
01:09:06,158 --> 01:09:09,679
you know there's people that have

2072
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:11,679
ancient skunk and old skunk and my skunk

2073
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:13,520
is the rare skunk that before the skunk

2074
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:15,520
got taken out of the skunk

2075
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:17,759
and i don't have any wheat of it but

2076
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:19,839
this is the skunky skunk or oh i got

2077
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:21,119
this real mss i'm going to cross it to a

2078
01:09:19,838 --> 01:09:22,640
bunch of stuff

2079
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:24,798
now we're going to sell all these seeds

2080
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:25,679
you'll find the skunk in there for sure

2081
01:09:24,798 --> 01:09:26,798
yeah

2082
01:09:25,679 --> 01:09:29,920
and

2083
01:09:26,798 --> 01:09:32,238
you know and and it's like that that uh

2084
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:33,920
you know but i mean anybody that came up

2085
01:09:32,238 --> 01:09:35,278
with anything smelling skunky would be

2086
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,960
like that's kind of the goal that's what

2087
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:38,480
people are missing

2088
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:42,319
i don't i don't think it's so much the

2089
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:43,759
actual cut i think it's the lost terp

2090
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:45,600
yeah for the most part there's might be

2091
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:46,640
some bragging rights to the old cut or

2092
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,798
whatever

2093
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:51,440
but it's it's basically more like like

2094
01:09:48,798 --> 01:09:54,158
skunk doesn't smell like skunk and the

2095
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:56,158
closest thing we have is real diesel

2096
01:09:54,158 --> 01:09:58,158
the most most often when i see people

2097
01:09:56,158 --> 01:10:00,000
pop up and say man that [ __ ] smells

2098
01:09:58,158 --> 01:10:02,719
skunky is after someone has burned and

2099
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,399
exhaled a bowl of really loud weed of

2100
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:06,399
any type of smell

2101
01:10:04,399 --> 01:10:08,639
i see a lot of people uh pop up and say

2102
01:10:06,399 --> 01:10:10,879
that smells skunky after that

2103
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:13,199
i kind of feel like certain old sours

2104
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:15,600
you get that weird nose crinkle sure and

2105
01:10:13,198 --> 01:10:17,599
it's not a pure super skunk knows but

2106
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,480
it's kind of on that same

2107
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:20,320
path

2108
01:10:18,479 --> 01:10:22,479
yeah you know it's like an analog of it

2109
01:10:20,319 --> 01:10:24,960
or something like that it's a derivative

2110
01:10:22,479 --> 01:10:27,039
no yes you know it's a yeah it is it's a

2111
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:29,198
feel and it's and they're and they're

2112
01:10:27,039 --> 01:10:31,198
volatile too you know so

2113
01:10:29,198 --> 01:10:32,719
um so there's hints out there of it and

2114
01:10:31,198 --> 01:10:35,279
stuff like that but

2115
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:36,560
um i got i just got totally distracted

2116
01:10:35,279 --> 01:10:38,079
by

2117
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:40,000
homie's comment

2118
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:42,000
um you know but

2119
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,800
uh we have talked about neville talked

2120
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,800
about like crossing some of his or

2121
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:48,239
shanti's old work together that had

2122
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,520
skunk in it

2123
01:10:48,238 --> 01:10:51,919
and trying to see if you'd get

2124
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:54,480
recessives to pop up

2125
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:56,719
yeah and i think that's probably the way

2126
01:10:54,479 --> 01:10:58,639
to get skunk is to get

2127
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:59,840
cuts of things that you think have skunk

2128
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:01,920
in it

2129
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:04,400
and throw them on one another

2130
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:06,239
and hopefully you know you get some

2131
01:11:04,399 --> 01:11:08,000
recessives that pop out because that's

2132
01:11:06,238 --> 01:11:08,879
probably what happened with our homies

2133
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,760
cut

2134
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:14,239
the sour dub by the reverse diesel yeah

2135
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:17,440
and it crybaby seen it i've seen it if

2136
01:11:14,238 --> 01:11:19,919
you cross two of two

2137
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:21,759
different phenos of or expressions of

2138
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:23,440
super skunk that are like you could

2139
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:25,760
cross the lanky

2140
01:11:23,439 --> 01:11:28,960
longer flowering sour type with one of

2141
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:31,440
the short stocky uh more mass super

2142
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:32,800
mass super v2 i should say types then

2143
01:11:31,439 --> 01:11:34,319
usually you're going to get something in

2144
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:36,719
there that's popping up that's pretty

2145
01:11:34,319 --> 01:11:38,079
skunky or candy push skunky

2146
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:38,960
it does seem

2147
01:11:38,079 --> 01:11:41,600
like

2148
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:43,840
using outcrosses to find it is a better

2149
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:45,920
way than s1

2150
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:47,520
you know yeah like it's got both of it

2151
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:49,359
in there and then you're just hoping for

2152
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:51,520
that thing to combine

2153
01:11:49,359 --> 01:11:53,599
yeah you know because it should combine

2154
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:55,679
it's just a matter of uh

2155
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:57,360
um it's just a matter of doing large

2156
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:58,719
enough populations

2157
01:11:57,359 --> 01:12:00,559
sure

2158
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:02,719
you know and you could do a thing if you

2159
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:04,159
could do traditional breeding uh you

2160
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:05,840
could do something where you got large

2161
01:12:04,158 --> 01:12:08,799
enough populations

2162
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:11,199
where you could probably make make the

2163
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:13,279
the quantity of skunk go up

2164
01:12:11,198 --> 01:12:16,158
yeah yeah so it's really hard to do on a

2165
01:12:13,279 --> 01:12:17,279
garage sized scene yeah

2166
01:12:16,158 --> 01:12:18,319
very

2167
01:12:17,279 --> 01:12:21,599
you know

2168
01:12:18,319 --> 01:12:23,198
um i agree with homie uh four-way is

2169
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:25,039
dudded

2170
01:12:23,198 --> 01:12:27,359
the old-school four-way is duded it's a

2171
01:12:25,039 --> 01:12:29,119
shadow of its former self yeah um

2172
01:12:27,359 --> 01:12:31,679
there's some liars out there that think

2173
01:12:29,119 --> 01:12:32,719
they're knf and their various organic

2174
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:34,000
treatments

2175
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:35,920
heal things

2176
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:38,640
yeah and while there's no doubt that you

2177
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:41,199
can make a plant happier or unhappier

2178
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:43,280
based on your treatment of it um that

2179
01:12:41,198 --> 01:12:44,639
doesn't mean it's gonna cure it of aids

2180
01:12:43,279 --> 01:12:46,559
yeah yeah

2181
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:49,280
uh people asked i i do think it could

2182
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:51,600
pop up in the la kush by chemdi

2183
01:12:49,279 --> 01:12:53,359
and i do think that a lot of people a

2184
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:55,520
lot of people are finding potency in it

2185
01:12:53,359 --> 01:12:58,158
but i would not be surprised

2186
01:12:55,520 --> 01:13:00,960
um i wouldn't be surprised because the

2187
01:12:58,158 --> 01:13:02,719
the la is very diesel type and i do

2188
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:04,719
believe they're super skunk and chem d

2189
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:07,198
although that's controversial

2190
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:09,359
um yeah you know but i'd also think

2191
01:13:07,198 --> 01:13:13,439
crossing different sours to each other

2192
01:13:09,359 --> 01:13:16,000
uh d by sour uh headbands at least the

2193
01:13:13,439 --> 01:13:17,919
the diesel headbands you know

2194
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,760
um yeah we don't know if someone's

2195
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:23,199
asking we don't know if uh

2196
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:24,880
if if uh if tc works

2197
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:27,359
there's some evidence that it does but

2198
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:28,960
there's also some there's i mean it's

2199
01:13:27,359 --> 01:13:30,238
it's i don't know if there's a lot of

2200
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:32,079
there's a lot of rumor that floats

2201
01:13:30,238 --> 01:13:34,718
around

2202
01:13:32,079 --> 01:13:36,640
and it gets mixed with fact

2203
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:38,480
a lot yes there is

2204
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:39,520
you know so it's not that easy to figure

2205
01:13:38,479 --> 01:13:41,678
i don't even know that we know the

2206
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:43,760
definitive answer to all this stuff

2207
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:44,640
it probably needs more testing

2208
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:45,920
yeah

2209
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:47,679
you know trying to find something for

2210
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:49,279
the giveaway so start thinking of how

2211
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:51,600
we're going to give this away

2212
01:13:49,279 --> 01:13:53,039
or a good competition or something i've

2213
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:54,159
got to find something worth giving away

2214
01:13:53,039 --> 01:13:55,600
though

2215
01:13:54,158 --> 01:13:57,599
that sounds like something we probably

2216
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:59,760
could have done off off camera but we'll

2217
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:01,520
wing it i suppose nah off camera's no

2218
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:03,199
fun come on now

2219
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,000
and then tissue culture just so people

2220
01:14:03,198 --> 01:14:05,279
know

2221
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,039
um

2222
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:08,800
tissue culture

2223
01:14:07,039 --> 01:14:11,119
is just a method of doing something it

2224
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:13,039
doesn't cure jack [ __ ] uh

2225
01:14:11,119 --> 01:14:14,399
tissue culture you can you can tissue

2226
01:14:13,039 --> 01:14:17,198
culture and all you're doing is

2227
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:20,000
cultivating a bunch of small plantlets

2228
01:14:17,198 --> 01:14:22,000
yeah right um the tissue culture that

2229
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:24,479
people are talking about to that

2230
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:26,960
actually might clean things up uh or

2231
01:14:24,479 --> 01:14:29,279
like remove say like uh

2232
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:30,640
you know remnants of various chemicals

2233
01:14:29,279 --> 01:14:32,960
that you don't want

2234
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:34,960
is actually called meristem

2235
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:36,880
tissue culture and it's where you take

2236
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:39,198
cells from the meristem

2237
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:43,840
and you regrow the whole plant

2238
01:14:39,198 --> 01:14:45,919
and uh it it um it took uh

2239
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:47,039
you know it can take up to a year to get

2240
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:49,840
that back

2241
01:14:47,039 --> 01:14:52,158
and the hormones are all nuts and out of

2242
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:55,520
whack for a while too and we're not even

2243
01:14:52,158 --> 01:14:56,879
sure that it's the exact same plant

2244
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:59,440
um

2245
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:01,199
so there's a lot of aspects to marathon

2246
01:14:59,439 --> 01:15:02,879
culture that are and it's expensive too

2247
01:15:01,198 --> 01:15:05,198
it's like four to six thousand bucks per

2248
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:07,039
plant super expensive and

2249
01:15:05,198 --> 01:15:09,119
barely anybody can do it correctly but a

2250
01:15:07,039 --> 01:15:10,479
lot of people will tell you they can so

2251
01:15:09,119 --> 01:15:12,399
there's people like there's people like

2252
01:15:10,479 --> 01:15:13,359
dark heart that spread the dud all over

2253
01:15:12,399 --> 01:15:15,679
the place

2254
01:15:13,359 --> 01:15:18,000
that then offer tissue culture and heat

2255
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:19,920
treatment that they claim kills the dud

2256
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,600
then you hear from other nurseries and

2257
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:24,158
friends that you trust that it doesn't

2258
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:26,079
really kill the dud on a perfect level

2259
01:15:24,158 --> 01:15:27,679
but they're gonna charge you for it

2260
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:29,039
um

2261
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:30,960
you know so

2262
01:15:29,039 --> 01:15:32,719
there's uh you know there's a lot of

2263
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,600
there's a lot of issues with it on that

2264
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:35,679
level

2265
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:38,800
um and you know the disease is getting

2266
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:41,119
very prevalent uh and there's a lot of

2267
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:43,679
old strains that suffer from it

2268
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:45,920
there's even rumor um that i don't know

2269
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:47,760
that's proven that a certain percentage

2270
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:49,679
of seeds made from dutted stuff the

2271
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:51,360
virus carries into the children into the

2272
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:52,960
beans

2273
01:15:51,359 --> 01:15:55,359
yeah and i don't think that's proven

2274
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:57,039
i've heard as high as 50 and as low as

2275
01:15:55,359 --> 01:15:59,279
two or three percent

2276
01:15:57,039 --> 01:16:01,279
yeah then i've heard uh various friends

2277
01:15:59,279 --> 01:16:02,719
of mine including csi and others tell me

2278
01:16:01,279 --> 01:16:04,399
that they've grown out testers and

2279
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:06,399
everything looked fine

2280
01:16:04,399 --> 01:16:08,158
yeah um so i think it's really hard to

2281
01:16:06,399 --> 01:16:09,519
say

2282
01:16:08,158 --> 01:16:11,679
you know i mean you could you could

2283
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:14,080
still have a virus inside of you that

2284
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:18,000
you wouldn't have it wouldn't have a

2285
01:16:14,079 --> 01:16:18,000
a physically visible level

2286
01:16:18,079 --> 01:16:21,198
that's very true you know

2287
01:16:19,679 --> 01:16:22,239
so

2288
01:16:21,198 --> 01:16:24,319
um

2289
01:16:22,238 --> 01:16:26,879
you know so tc is thrown around pretty

2290
01:16:24,319 --> 01:16:30,639
loosely uh the only pc that cleans

2291
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:32,640
anything up to my knowledge is marathon

2292
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:35,119
that's how i understand it

2293
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:37,199
you know and meristem basically like get

2294
01:16:35,119 --> 01:16:39,279
mostly what it does really well is it

2295
01:16:37,198 --> 01:16:41,759
will clean your plant up if it was if

2296
01:16:39,279 --> 01:16:43,519
imma chloroplate or avid or a bunch of

2297
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:45,280
funk was used on it

2298
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:48,239
because those cells are taken from the

2299
01:16:45,279 --> 01:16:50,639
meristem not from the vascular system

2300
01:16:48,238 --> 01:16:52,639
yeah and so it's sort of like avoid the

2301
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:54,320
area of the plant that's contaminated

2302
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:56,000
and you can grow it back

2303
01:16:54,319 --> 01:16:57,439
um

2304
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,679
but uh

2305
01:16:57,439 --> 01:17:02,559
you know um

2306
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:04,800
the the dudding or the you know the the

2307
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:05,760
uh you know the virus the viroid or

2308
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:06,560
whatever

2309
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:08,400
um

2310
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:10,080
it basically spread everywhere because

2311
01:17:08,399 --> 01:17:11,198
when everyone started getting clones

2312
01:17:10,079 --> 01:17:12,640
from

2313
01:17:11,198 --> 01:17:14,399
dispensaries and everyone started

2314
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:16,239
getting clones from certain nurseries

2315
01:17:14,399 --> 01:17:18,238
and nurseries sort of became a clearing

2316
01:17:16,238 --> 01:17:19,599
house for a bunch of plants

2317
01:17:18,238 --> 01:17:22,158
they spread it to thousands and

2318
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:23,360
thousands and thousands of dollars of

2319
01:17:22,158 --> 01:17:25,198
gardens i mean

2320
01:17:23,359 --> 01:17:26,799
yeah you know and then once that

2321
01:17:25,198 --> 01:17:28,399
happened those gardens started spreading

2322
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:31,360
it to their friends

2323
01:17:28,399 --> 01:17:32,960
you know and a lot of times

2324
01:17:31,359 --> 01:17:37,359
you know back in the day you'd use a

2325
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:38,158
razor taking clones until it got dull

2326
01:17:37,359 --> 01:17:40,158
yeah

2327
01:17:38,158 --> 01:17:42,079
you know and now you need to per plant

2328
01:17:40,158 --> 01:17:43,279
you need to take a lot of different

2329
01:17:42,079 --> 01:17:44,479
you need to take a lot of different

2330
01:17:43,279 --> 01:17:46,479
things into account

2331
01:17:44,479 --> 01:17:49,359
and and that that one

2332
01:17:46,479 --> 01:17:50,879
vira viroid that causes dutting isn't

2333
01:17:49,359 --> 01:17:52,158
the only dutting

2334
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:54,079
issue

2335
01:17:52,158 --> 01:17:56,719
there's other diseases

2336
01:17:54,079 --> 01:17:58,880
um you know uh tmv is the most famous

2337
01:17:56,719 --> 01:18:00,480
one that everything anything wrong with

2338
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:02,560
weed for a long time people would be

2339
01:18:00,479 --> 01:18:04,799
like oh you got the tmv oh yeah for sure

2340
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:07,760
and people used to think that like the

2341
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:09,679
the uh mosaic or the variegation that

2342
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:14,320
used to happen in chem strains and other

2343
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:17,119
afghans was a sure sign of of uh tmv

2344
01:18:14,319 --> 01:18:20,639
yeah you know but i will say

2345
01:18:17,119 --> 01:18:24,559
that if you talk to tobacco people right

2346
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:27,520
um they do treat tmv extremely seriously

2347
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:29,440
and they do they don't allow harvester

2348
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:30,880
you know people uh doing transplanting

2349
01:18:29,439 --> 01:18:32,960
and working on their stuff you can't

2350
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:34,800
have a smoker in the home

2351
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:36,480
yeah and you have to take off all your

2352
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:38,880
clothes and get and go through a process

2353
01:18:36,479 --> 01:18:40,479
to get in there so it does spread

2354
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:42,159
and you can definitely get it on your

2355
01:18:40,479 --> 01:18:43,599
hands from smoking cigarettes and you

2356
01:18:42,158 --> 01:18:44,479
can pass it

2357
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,159
um

2358
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:49,279
you know but

2359
01:18:46,158 --> 01:18:51,439
but there's there's pithium and fusarium

2360
01:18:49,279 --> 01:18:55,439
that are there's molds there's viruses

2361
01:18:51,439 --> 01:18:57,678
there's thyroids there's diseases and uh

2362
01:18:55,439 --> 01:19:01,119
they mostly were were

2363
01:18:57,679 --> 01:19:02,880
minimal in the illegal 215 era sure and

2364
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:05,439
now they're all over the place

2365
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:07,119
yeah um you know

2366
01:19:05,439 --> 01:19:09,359
so

2367
01:19:07,119 --> 01:19:11,599
you know um

2368
01:19:09,359 --> 01:19:13,359
yeah i mean yeah someone just said tmv

2369
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:16,079
can wipe out a whole tobacco prop they

2370
01:19:13,359 --> 01:19:17,439
do they take a bunch of precautions

2371
01:19:16,079 --> 01:19:18,559
even by touch

2372
01:19:17,439 --> 01:19:19,439
yeah you know

2373
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:23,039
uh

2374
01:19:19,439 --> 01:19:25,039
and um someone said that you know uh

2375
01:19:23,039 --> 01:19:27,119
someone said that russets don't dud a

2376
01:19:25,039 --> 01:19:29,119
plant out dudding is what we call

2377
01:19:27,119 --> 01:19:29,920
russets can i suppose

2378
01:19:29,119 --> 01:19:32,880

2383
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:42,158
there i am did i freeze

2384
01:19:40,319 --> 01:19:44,799
yep i froze i don't know what the hell

2385
01:19:42,158 --> 01:19:46,960
happened but anyway there's there's a

2386
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:48,560
lot of there's a lot of uh

2387
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:49,840
um there's a lot of disease there's a

2388
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:51,120
lot of there's a lot of stuff out there

2389
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:52,000
that people didn't have to worry about

2390
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:53,599
before

2391
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,760
and as things have gotten commercialized

2392
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:56,719
and as things have gotten spread around

2393
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:58,239
um

2394
01:19:56,719 --> 01:19:59,600
you know it's become it's become a way

2395
01:19:58,238 --> 01:20:02,238
bigger issue

2396
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:05,840
uh and it would be easier if it would be

2397
01:20:02,238 --> 01:20:05,839
easier if it didn't transfer to seat

2398
01:20:06,319 --> 01:20:10,799
not so froze am i back now can you

2399
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:12,880
everyone hear me in real time

2400
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:14,000
yeah you're back

2401
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:16,079
i think

2402
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,840
i can hear you you think

2403
01:20:16,079 --> 01:20:19,519
i can hear you in real time yeah bad

2404
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:20,639
russet infestation can look like a

2405
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:22,239
viroid

2406
01:20:20,639 --> 01:20:23,840
um

2407
01:20:22,238 --> 01:20:26,399
you know and there's then there's rumors

2408
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:28,319
too that thrips and other and other uh

2409
01:20:26,399 --> 01:20:30,238
insects can spread

2410
01:20:28,319 --> 01:20:32,399
viroids or spread diseases like

2411
01:20:30,238 --> 01:20:34,559
mosquitoes can spread um you know

2412
01:20:32,399 --> 01:20:36,158
malaria and [ __ ] like that

2413
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:40,239
yeah so

2414
01:20:36,158 --> 01:20:40,238
uh there's a lot of risks out there

2415
01:20:40,479 --> 01:20:43,039
there's a lot of risk out there they

2416
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:45,199
didn't do before in the 90s i didn't

2417
01:20:43,039 --> 01:20:47,119
worry about anything

2418
01:20:45,198 --> 01:20:48,879
i've never seen pm

2419
01:20:47,119 --> 01:20:49,679
and an occasional bug every now and

2420
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:52,239
again

2421
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:53,760
no viruses no diseases no worries but

2422
01:20:52,238 --> 01:20:56,079
we've had friends that have taken out

2423
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:58,079
their whole garden

2424
01:20:56,079 --> 01:21:01,679
yeah lost irreplaceable

2425
01:20:58,079 --> 01:21:03,039
and lost irreplaceable [ __ ]

2426
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:04,319
you know

2427
01:21:03,039 --> 01:21:06,639
so

2428
01:21:04,319 --> 01:21:08,960
matt's over here in in real time going

2429
01:21:06,639 --> 01:21:12,800
through a seed collection and grunting

2430
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:14,800
to himself and all that so

2431
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:16,800
i'm really giving it his full attention

2432
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:18,719
right now oh yeah you know

2433
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:22,159
found some [ __ ] i didn't remember i had

2434
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:23,520
some old afghanis and [ __ ] here

2435
01:21:22,158 --> 01:21:25,519
but it's interesting people are talking

2436
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:26,880
about condoms or stds and stuff like

2437
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:28,560
that like

2438
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:30,480
you know it's it's it's it's they're

2439
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:32,560
obviously plants so they're not human

2440
01:21:30,479 --> 01:21:34,718
beings but there is some correlation

2441
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:35,920
between the various things that got

2442
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:38,319
spread around

2443
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:40,000
and the hiv aids crisis

2444
01:21:38,319 --> 01:21:42,238
yeah and that there was something

2445
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,760
spreading that was harming and people

2446
01:21:42,238 --> 01:21:45,119
didn't know what it was and they didn't

2447
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:47,440
know what to test for it and they didn't

2448
01:21:45,119 --> 01:21:50,158
know how to take precautions about it

2449
01:21:47,439 --> 01:21:53,678
um and so it spread like wildfire you

2450
01:21:50,158 --> 01:21:55,920
know yeah leaf hoppers normally uh they

2451
01:21:53,679 --> 01:21:57,359
they pass this curly top beat virus

2452
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:59,279
thing

2453
01:21:57,359 --> 01:22:00,880
um so there's a bunch of there's a bunch

2454
01:21:59,279 --> 01:22:03,359
of diseases and some of them probably

2455
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:04,880
existed for a while and like people just

2456
01:22:03,359 --> 01:22:06,238
weren't getting the proper testing

2457
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:07,119
because why would you help why would you

2458
01:22:06,238 --> 01:22:08,479
do that

2459
01:22:07,119 --> 01:22:10,880
yeah you know because you're you're

2460
01:22:08,479 --> 01:22:11,919
you're in the in the shadows or whatever

2461
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:13,600
um

2462
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:15,119
and uh

2463
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:17,440
you know and

2464
01:22:15,119 --> 01:22:20,079
you know they uh

2465
01:22:17,439 --> 01:22:20,079
oh man

2466
01:22:20,319 --> 01:22:23,279
i just got totally distracted by

2467
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:25,920
somebody's comment i'm not gonna repeat

2468
01:22:23,279 --> 01:22:28,158
it but but they uh

2469
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:29,440
but yeah they you know and and most of

2470
01:22:28,158 --> 01:22:30,638
the time when people were trading

2471
01:22:29,439 --> 01:22:34,238
cuttings

2472
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:35,679
uh or uh or you know or or selling their

2473
01:22:34,238 --> 01:22:36,959
friends cuttings it was all within

2474
01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:39,760
little circles

2475
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:42,000
yeah you know and it wasn't until the

2476
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:43,360
215 era and these big centralized

2477
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,119
nurseries

2478
01:22:43,359 --> 01:22:46,399
that things started getting spread all

2479
01:22:45,119 --> 01:22:47,279
over

2480
01:22:46,399 --> 01:22:49,039
yeah

2481
01:22:47,279 --> 01:22:50,719
you know and then once it reaches a

2482
01:22:49,039 --> 01:22:52,238
certain point it becomes really easy to

2483
01:22:50,719 --> 01:22:53,520
spread and then you're spreading it to

2484
01:22:52,238 --> 01:22:54,879
your friends and you don't know what

2485
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:57,040
have and then

2486
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:59,119
you know a lot of people would uh a lot

2487
01:22:57,039 --> 01:23:00,719
of people would give up on creating

2488
01:22:59,119 --> 01:23:03,439
their own mothers

2489
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:04,880
um and and making their own clones and

2490
01:23:03,439 --> 01:23:07,678
they'd just be like [ __ ] the veg i'm

2491
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:09,279
just gonna go to wherever and buy 200

2492
01:23:07,679 --> 01:23:10,639
cuts when it's time

2493
01:23:09,279 --> 01:23:13,920
yeah

2494
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:15,679
you know um and uh

2495
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:17,279
yeah weird comment of the united that's

2496
01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:19,600
what that's what gets me into trouble is

2497
01:23:17,279 --> 01:23:22,238
it's hard to [ __ ] and read comments

2498
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:23,360
in real time when you read that

2499
01:23:22,238 --> 01:23:25,039
the other

2500
01:23:23,359 --> 01:23:28,238
yeah if you read a comment out loud it's

2501
01:23:25,039 --> 01:23:30,158
super offensive yeah

2502
01:23:28,238 --> 01:23:32,238
yeah so you can get it's you know you

2503
01:23:30,158 --> 01:23:34,638
can get thrown off the game

2504
01:23:32,238 --> 01:23:36,559
and so we made it we made it like an

2505
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:37,600
hour and a half without actually talking

2506
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:40,320
about

2507
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:42,480
one of the things that uh

2508
01:23:40,319 --> 01:23:44,960
uh i don't think does pip have the

2509
01:23:42,479 --> 01:23:46,158
shoreline i don't i i don't know i don't

2510
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:48,319
think he does we have some good friends

2511
01:23:46,158 --> 01:23:50,319
of ours that do and pip's a good friend

2512
01:23:48,319 --> 01:23:52,158
of ours but i don't think he does

2513
01:23:50,319 --> 01:23:53,519
um i don't think but we have we have

2514
01:23:52,158 --> 01:23:55,519
some really close friends of ours that

2515
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:56,400
have had it for quite some time

2516
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:57,520
um

2517
01:23:56,399 --> 01:23:59,599
and uh

2518
01:23:57,520 --> 01:24:01,679
it's fire i like it

2519
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:05,039
i wouldn't consider uh people tell me

2520
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:07,119
it's not it's people ask if it's rks

2521
01:24:05,039 --> 01:24:08,719
i would say it's skunky is from what

2522
01:24:07,119 --> 01:24:10,559
everyone tells me and it's got it's got

2523
01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:11,520
rankness to it but i wouldn't say that

2524
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:13,679
it's uh

2525
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:15,520
i'd say it's not sweet and then a lot of

2526
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:17,840
people confuse not sweet for roadkill

2527
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:17,840
skunk

2528
01:24:18,238 --> 01:24:22,079
yeah

2529
01:24:19,198 --> 01:24:23,919
if i was being a hundred

2530
01:24:22,079 --> 01:24:26,399
if you're being a hundred percent

2531
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:28,158
yeah you know yeah uh kim was selling

2532
01:24:26,399 --> 01:24:29,519
chem four clones the other day at his

2533
01:24:28,158 --> 01:24:31,198
dyspo and

2534
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:33,840
and massachusetts i mean you know kim

2535
01:24:31,198 --> 01:24:35,359
four is kim four is the uh

2536
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:36,800
kim four is probably the most widely

2537
01:24:35,359 --> 01:24:39,439
spread chem

2538
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:41,279
yeah you know it's that one being spread

2539
01:24:39,439 --> 01:24:42,479
out the largest it throws really nice

2540
01:24:41,279 --> 01:24:44,559
bats

2541
01:24:42,479 --> 01:24:45,439
um it's probably the least hoarded of

2542
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:47,280
the one

2543
01:24:45,439 --> 01:24:50,559
of all of it you know it's still one of

2544
01:24:47,279 --> 01:24:51,840
my faves too out of the um

2545
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:54,960
out of the cam

2546
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:56,319
491 or de i prefer cam 4 for for what i

2547
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:58,399
like

2548
01:24:56,319 --> 01:25:00,559
yeah i mean the most most people's

2549
01:24:58,399 --> 01:25:01,599
issues with chem 4 is that it's like 12

2550
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:04,960
weeks

2551
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:06,400
yeah uh and you can pull it at 10.

2552
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:07,520
so there's a lot of people that pull it

2553
01:25:06,399 --> 01:25:09,039
at 10.

2554
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:10,320
yeah that makes sense

2555
01:25:09,039 --> 01:25:12,399
uh

2556
01:25:10,319 --> 01:25:14,079
104 is not very close to the d in my

2557
01:25:12,399 --> 01:25:16,000
opinion no

2558
01:25:14,079 --> 01:25:19,519
no chem four is a big

2559
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:22,238
lanky long running buds kind of hazy

2560
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:23,760
uh type of not hazy in in like when

2561
01:25:22,238 --> 01:25:25,678
people think terpentally and i just mean

2562
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:28,719
like

2563
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:29,679
and it has kind of a racy buzz to it

2564
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:32,239
um

2565
01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:33,840
and uh

2566
01:25:32,238 --> 01:25:36,718
do i think the cannabis community is

2567
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:38,159
being infiltrated to destroy homegrowns

2568
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:40,399
i think it's always i think that's

2569
01:25:38,158 --> 01:25:41,920
always been happening uh i don't i don't

2570
01:25:40,399 --> 01:25:43,439
know that uh i don't know that's never

2571
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:46,000
not happened i think it's ebbed and

2572
01:25:43,439 --> 01:25:47,759
flowed how intense it's been

2573
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,639
um but i think home grows have always

2574
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:50,560
had

2575
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:52,319
uh some issues

2576
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:53,679
um and the main issue i used to have

2577
01:25:52,319 --> 01:25:56,158
with chem four

2578
01:25:53,679 --> 01:25:58,319
is that in california

2579
01:25:56,158 --> 01:26:00,479
you can everyone wants you to flush your

2580
01:25:58,319 --> 01:26:02,960
weed immensely right but nobody wants a

2581
01:26:00,479 --> 01:26:04,319
hint of yellow on anything yeah because

2582
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:06,399
then they think you [ __ ] it up and

2583
01:26:04,319 --> 01:26:08,960
then they want less right

2584
01:26:06,399 --> 01:26:12,719
and chem 4 a lot of times

2585
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:15,359
dries a slight light golden brown yeah

2586
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:17,359
the golden the golden a little golden

2587
01:26:15,359 --> 01:26:18,719
color and that golden color

2588
01:26:17,359 --> 01:26:19,759
is um

2589
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:21,679
uh

2590
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:23,840
you know is bad people don't like the

2591
01:26:21,679 --> 01:26:26,158
golden color it can be fresh weed it can

2592
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:28,239
be sticky it can be cured amazing it can

2593
01:26:26,158 --> 01:26:29,439
be fantastical and they'll get a little

2594
01:26:28,238 --> 01:26:31,919
hint they'll be like looking at the

2595
01:26:29,439 --> 01:26:33,519
calyxes and be like ah

2596
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:36,480
you know it's got a little hint of brown

2597
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:39,520
it makes me uncomfortable

2598
01:26:36,479 --> 01:26:42,000
you know um and

2599
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:43,280
you think of anything for a giveaway

2600
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,800
i haven't actually been thinking about a

2601
01:26:43,279 --> 01:26:48,840
giveaway dude i've been [ __ ] talking

2602
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:51,739
[ __ ] well yeah i know you look

2603
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:54,159
down it's called flow dawg

2604
01:26:51,739 --> 01:26:55,679
[Laughter]

2605
01:26:54,158 --> 01:26:58,319
and i don't think i don't think so chem

2606
01:26:55,679 --> 01:27:01,920
4 is a big tall rangy plant

2607
01:26:58,319 --> 01:27:05,599
uh chem d is a much squatter afghan

2608
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:08,079
it's it's it's uh lighter green in a lot

2609
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:10,239
of ways um it's just this whole

2610
01:27:08,079 --> 01:27:12,319
structure is different i don't think

2611
01:27:10,238 --> 01:27:13,919
chem 4 and chem d are very similar at

2612
01:27:12,319 --> 01:27:15,920
all

2613
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:17,600
you know i agree uh

2614
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:19,520
and uh it doesn't it definitely doesn't

2615
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:20,800
take 84 days

2616
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:22,239
you know

2617
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:24,719
and what's interesting is we had our

2618
01:27:22,238 --> 01:27:27,678
buddy pip actually take an 84 day piece

2619
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:29,119
of chem 4 and lay it on top of a picture

2620
01:27:27,679 --> 01:27:32,800
of neville's

2621
01:27:29,119 --> 01:27:35,279
uh 89 nl5 haze bud

2622
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:36,400
and you could barely tell the difference

2623
01:27:35,279 --> 01:27:37,679
sure

2624
01:27:36,399 --> 01:27:39,920
you know

2625
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:42,319
uh i do think there's haze in chem 4.

2626
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:44,079
yeah i think that i think that i think

2627
01:27:42,319 --> 01:27:47,759
that it could be

2628
01:27:44,079 --> 01:27:49,760
91 by nl5 hayes maybe

2629
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:51,280
i don't know

2630
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:53,039
uh they're trying let's get back to

2631
01:27:51,279 --> 01:27:55,439
skunk tons of people are working on

2632
01:27:53,039 --> 01:27:57,760
skunk lines dude it's just that they're

2633
01:27:55,439 --> 01:28:00,319
mostly not skunk

2634
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:02,400
yeah and i i always have to preface this

2635
01:28:00,319 --> 01:28:04,158
because people every time i have to

2636
01:28:02,399 --> 01:28:05,759
restart it and say it

2637
01:28:04,158 --> 01:28:07,759
when we say skunk we do not mean

2638
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:10,560
necessarily skunk one what we're

2639
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:12,400
referring to is the smell of a skunk

2640
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:14,560
when we say it's skunky we're not saying

2641
01:28:12,399 --> 01:28:17,119
oh it's like skunk one we're saying it's

2642
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:19,039
skunky so just just to preface that so

2643
01:28:17,119 --> 01:28:20,479
people don't confuse us saying skunk one

2644
01:28:19,039 --> 01:28:23,679
for skunk they are two different things

2645
01:28:20,479 --> 01:28:27,039
in my opinion yeah skunk one is floral

2646
01:28:23,679 --> 01:28:29,199
or citrus or maybe a little cheese

2647
01:28:27,039 --> 01:28:31,039
uh maybe some grapes

2648
01:28:29,198 --> 01:28:33,359
um you know

2649
01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:34,479
anything like that it doesn't have any

2650
01:28:33,359 --> 01:28:37,359
you know what people are talking about

2651
01:28:34,479 --> 01:28:40,559
is arc they want that rank nose curdling

2652
01:28:37,359 --> 01:28:42,479
pure skunk spray type of smell yeah you

2653
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:44,080
know and there's a lot of people

2654
01:28:42,479 --> 01:28:46,238
you know uh we were supposed to talk

2655
01:28:44,079 --> 01:28:48,079
about about uh

2656
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:49,919
uh breeding techniques and stuff like

2657
01:28:48,079 --> 01:28:51,760
that we never really got there

2658
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:54,000
uh people ask are they working there's

2659
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:56,560
not really very many lines being worked

2660
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:58,719
right now by very many people

2661
01:28:56,560 --> 01:29:01,360
you know most people are most people are

2662
01:28:58,719 --> 01:29:04,079
doing one-offs of things they hope are

2663
01:29:01,359 --> 01:29:04,960
skunky and hoping you'll find skunk in

2664
01:29:04,079 --> 01:29:06,880
them

2665
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:10,158
or just straight frauds because there's

2666
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:11,760
now there's so many people that want it

2667
01:29:10,158 --> 01:29:14,000
there's a bunch of people jumping in

2668
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:15,039
claiming to have it

2669
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:17,039
you know

2670
01:29:15,039 --> 01:29:18,719
yeah and they know that you can't they

2671
01:29:17,039 --> 01:29:20,960
know that you can't tell them they don't

2672
01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:23,279
have it until x amount of months and

2673
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:24,639
most people will sit on them so yeah you

2674
01:29:23,279 --> 01:29:25,920
know i mean

2675
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:27,920
you can go through there's you know

2676
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:30,639
there's people like you know blue or sky

2677
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:32,239
vienna that [ __ ] has their own story

2678
01:29:30,639 --> 01:29:33,760
and they they have the skunkiest skunk

2679
01:29:32,238 --> 01:29:35,519
that's ever skunked but nobody finds

2680
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:36,960
skunk in their beans

2681
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:39,600
and you know there's a bunch of people

2682
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:41,679
doing it that you know there there's not

2683
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:43,760
there's something that's not there

2684
01:29:41,679 --> 01:29:45,920
and there's a market demand for it and

2685
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:48,239
people are jumping in and saying you're

2686
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:49,359
going to get skunked from me any day

2687
01:29:48,238 --> 01:29:50,959
yep you're going to find this is

2688
01:29:49,359 --> 01:29:53,119
unbelievably skunky you're going to find

2689
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:54,560
skunk in it and then they sell a bunch

2690
01:29:53,119 --> 01:29:56,158
of what you know what do you people call

2691
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:58,159
it hopium

2692
01:29:56,158 --> 01:30:00,559
hope you know opium hope you sell a

2693
01:29:58,158 --> 01:30:01,519
bunch of sell a bunch of addictive opium

2694
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:03,360
you know

2695
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:05,440
um

2696
01:30:03,359 --> 01:30:08,559
me and bodie were working on

2697
01:30:05,439 --> 01:30:12,158
just specifically finding

2698
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:14,639
that type of thigh or smell in in old

2699
01:30:12,158 --> 01:30:16,319
lines and he went one direction i think

2700
01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:18,000
he went and looked in some afghani stew

2701
01:30:16,319 --> 01:30:19,039
and i popped a bunch of afghanis looking

2702
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,840
for it

2703
01:30:19,039 --> 01:30:24,719
and i got very lucky and found something

2704
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:26,639
early on it's not the easiest thing to

2705
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:27,920
reproduce but i found ways to to

2706
01:30:26,639 --> 01:30:30,400
reproduce it

2707
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:32,639
but by that point literally everyone had

2708
01:30:30,399 --> 01:30:34,719
jumped on the train selling skunk one of

2709
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:36,639
everything or hybrids of skunk won

2710
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:38,880
everything and saying it's gunky

2711
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:40,079
um you had the blue skies vienna people

2712
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:42,159
pick in and nobody wants to be

2713
01:30:40,079 --> 01:30:44,880
associated with that [ __ ] so some of us

2714
01:30:42,158 --> 01:30:47,359
just said [ __ ] it and walked away walked

2715
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:49,679
away from it for good just because it's

2716
01:30:47,359 --> 01:30:51,198
i think it's easy to find now and i

2717
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:53,440
think if you look in the right places

2718
01:30:51,198 --> 01:30:55,839
it's very easy to come across

2719
01:30:53,439 --> 01:30:58,719
and i think it's out there for people if

2720
01:30:55,840 --> 01:31:00,480
they really really want it you know

2721
01:30:58,719 --> 01:31:03,679
yeah somebody's just skunk lines over

2722
01:31:00,479 --> 01:31:05,119
9000 skunk clones zero yeah you know

2723
01:31:03,679 --> 01:31:06,480
i don't know you'd be a millionaire or

2724
01:31:05,119 --> 01:31:08,559
whatever else because it's like you

2725
01:31:06,479 --> 01:31:09,839
could have a cutting that did it but

2726
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:11,440
it's like you

2727
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:13,520
i mean maybe you may make a bunch of

2728
01:31:11,439 --> 01:31:15,599
money i mean one of the things like

2729
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:18,159
pandas cutting does it to a tee

2730
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:20,880
especially if you follow what uh csi

2731
01:31:18,158 --> 01:31:23,119
said pretty pretty openly about the best

2732
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:24,480
way to get uh skunky line to express

2733
01:31:23,119 --> 01:31:26,639
skunky

2734
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:28,399
but it's not conducive to

2735
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:30,000
having skunky bud that you can carry

2736
01:31:28,399 --> 01:31:32,000
around for a month and sell it's just

2737
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:35,760
not going to happen it's it's it's very

2738
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:37,760
very um volatile compounds

2739
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:40,000
you know and and i think it's obviously

2740
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:41,679
got a recessive trait

2741
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,880
and it's one of those things like people

2742
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:44,399
talk about

2743
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:46,400
people don't know this about genetics or

2744
01:31:44,399 --> 01:31:48,238
whatever but like i was talking about it

2745
01:31:46,399 --> 01:31:50,559
the other night where blond hair and

2746
01:31:48,238 --> 01:31:52,158
blue eyes is only like 11 000 years old

2747
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:54,400
in humanity

2748
01:31:52,158 --> 01:31:56,559
yeah it's a mutation right and it's a

2749
01:31:54,399 --> 01:31:58,158
recessive so if you don't if both

2750
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:59,440
parents don't have the recessive you

2751
01:31:58,158 --> 01:32:01,198
can't have it

2752
01:31:59,439 --> 01:32:02,479
so you go to like nordic countries or

2753
01:32:01,198 --> 01:32:03,678
something like that and there's a bunch

2754
01:32:02,479 --> 01:32:06,399
of it

2755
01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:08,560
but they say eventually as people mix

2756
01:32:06,399 --> 01:32:10,000
it's going to get lost and it's almost

2757
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:11,920
never going to pop up because there's

2758
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:13,920
going to the dominance are going to be

2759
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:16,480
all over the place yeah and i think

2760
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:18,158
that's what happened is in the 90s

2761
01:32:16,479 --> 01:32:20,238
there was more there was more plants

2762
01:32:18,158 --> 01:32:22,638
that both had the recessive

2763
01:32:20,238 --> 01:32:24,959
and so it could pop and be and be you

2764
01:32:22,639 --> 01:32:26,719
know an expressive trait in those things

2765
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:28,239
and then as it got bred out and people

2766
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:30,319
lost it and it got bred with other

2767
01:32:28,238 --> 01:32:31,678
things it kind of became a recessive

2768
01:32:30,319 --> 01:32:33,198
terp

2769
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:34,079
and then you're trying to look for it to

2770
01:32:33,198 --> 01:32:35,119
pop

2771
01:32:34,079 --> 01:32:36,719
right

2772
01:32:35,119 --> 01:32:39,519
and there's certain terpenes there's

2773
01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:42,560
certain smells that are very dominant

2774
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:44,239
penalty yeah yeah sure you know citrus

2775
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:45,679
you know

2776
01:32:44,238 --> 01:32:47,279
you know a lot of times you can cross

2777
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:49,199
something and something like 70 or 80

2778
01:32:47,279 --> 01:32:50,960
percent of its progeny will have had to

2779
01:32:49,198 --> 01:32:52,960
have that aroma strong

2780
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:54,319
sure and then other times there's stuff

2781
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:57,359
where it's only going to pop up in a

2782
01:32:54,319 --> 01:32:59,359
limited population

2783
01:32:57,359 --> 01:33:01,359
you know so for instance to use the

2784
01:32:59,359 --> 01:33:03,359
human example if you've got a bunch of

2785
01:33:01,359 --> 01:33:05,599
nordic people mating

2786
01:33:03,359 --> 01:33:07,039
right like a bunch of swedes or finnish

2787
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:08,960
or whatever you get a bunch of blonde

2788
01:33:07,039 --> 01:33:10,719
hair blue-eyed kids

2789
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:12,800
yeah but if every generation they

2790
01:33:10,719 --> 01:33:15,039
started like marrying africans or

2791
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:16,719
mexicans or chinese or something

2792
01:33:15,039 --> 01:33:18,238
within a certain number of generations

2793
01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:21,119
the blue eyes and blonde hair would go

2794
01:33:18,238 --> 01:33:23,198
away or be a super rare thing to catch

2795
01:33:21,119 --> 01:33:25,599
up yeah

2796
01:33:23,198 --> 01:33:28,158
you know and we haven't really studied

2797
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:30,719
which traits in cannabis are recessive

2798
01:33:28,158 --> 01:33:32,000
and dominant all we know

2799
01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:35,119
we have no idea we just have

2800
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:37,119
observational data yeah exactly

2801
01:33:35,119 --> 01:33:39,119
shared amongst friends we don't have any

2802
01:33:37,119 --> 01:33:41,279
scientific basis

2803
01:33:39,119 --> 01:33:43,119
we just have observations

2804
01:33:41,279 --> 01:33:44,158
um but if it was dominant it'd be easy

2805
01:33:43,119 --> 01:33:46,559
to find

2806
01:33:44,158 --> 01:33:47,920
yeah i mean nothing and literally every

2807
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:50,400
single person

2808
01:33:47,920 --> 01:33:53,440
that has claimed that they were six or

2809
01:33:50,399 --> 01:33:55,119
nine or 12 months away from releasing

2810
01:33:53,439 --> 01:33:56,719
perfect skunk to the community that was

2811
01:33:55,119 --> 01:33:59,439
gonna change the game

2812
01:33:56,719 --> 01:34:01,439
none of it has ever happened not yet

2813
01:33:59,439 --> 01:34:02,879
no i mean that was that was what that

2814
01:34:01,439 --> 01:34:05,039
was duke's claim to fame right when

2815
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:07,600
dominion first came out he had a huge

2816
01:34:05,039 --> 01:34:09,439
skunk on the on all his shirts and he

2817
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:10,880
was you know he was six months away from

2818
01:34:09,439 --> 01:34:12,799
walking in

2819
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:13,840
skunk terps permanently from ancient

2820
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:15,440
skunk

2821
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:17,039
blue or sky vienna all these different

2822
01:34:15,439 --> 01:34:18,319
folks but then people don't find it in

2823
01:34:17,039 --> 01:34:19,840
the beans

2824
01:34:18,319 --> 01:34:21,920
no it's hard and

2825
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:23,360
and the the best advice i'll even i'll

2826
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:25,199
even repeat it for people that don't

2827
01:34:23,359 --> 01:34:26,319
understand and don't know

2828
01:34:25,198 --> 01:34:27,919
a lot of the reason you're not going to

2829
01:34:26,319 --> 01:34:29,759
see it is because we grow weeds so much

2830
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:32,079
differently we cure differently we dry

2831
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:33,760
differently how quickly wet weed moves

2832
01:34:32,079 --> 01:34:35,359
doesn't happen anymore you know like

2833
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:36,560
people don't you're not buying wet weed

2834
01:34:35,359 --> 01:34:38,639
anymore

2835
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:40,960
there's a lot a lot different going on

2836
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:42,719
than was back then and if people kind of

2837
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:45,520
applied some of those techniques to it

2838
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:48,000
you'd see it pop up very fast i also

2839
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:48,800
think too that all these techniques that

2840
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:51,359
that

2841
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:53,679
um he's talking about you can coax skunk

2842
01:34:51,359 --> 01:34:55,519
out but i do believe that there was

2843
01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:56,800
strains once upon a time because people

2844
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:58,239
are talking about well maybe we were

2845
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:59,039
just confused

2846
01:34:58,238 --> 01:35:01,678
no

2847
01:34:59,039 --> 01:35:03,840
no it's just something that went away

2848
01:35:01,679 --> 01:35:05,520
yeah through prohibition

2849
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:06,480
and people getting rid of it and

2850
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:08,719
changing

2851
01:35:06,479 --> 01:35:09,759
changing eras

2852
01:35:08,719 --> 01:35:11,359
you know

2853
01:35:09,760 --> 01:35:13,360
i mean imagine

2854
01:35:11,359 --> 01:35:14,479
20 years ago

2855
01:35:13,359 --> 01:35:16,559
you're [ __ ]

2856
01:35:14,479 --> 01:35:18,319
growing a bunch of skunk weed and it

2857
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:20,239
smells rank skunk and you're having a

2858
01:35:18,319 --> 01:35:21,840
problem selling it and then your broker

2859
01:35:20,238 --> 01:35:25,118
buddy is like dude if you just grow this

2860
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:27,279
urkel you can sell every gram

2861
01:35:25,118 --> 01:35:29,118
so you stop selling skunk

2862
01:35:27,279 --> 01:35:30,880
yeah and you get rid of the skunk and

2863
01:35:29,118 --> 01:35:32,079
you lose the skunk

2864
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:34,079
because you're growing urkel and then

2865
01:35:32,079 --> 01:35:36,000
you move on from urkel to

2866
01:35:34,079 --> 01:35:37,600
freaking kush and then you move on from

2867
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:39,679
kush to sour and then you move on to

2868
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:41,920
skittles and then somewhere 10 years

2869
01:35:39,679 --> 01:35:44,079
later somebody's like you know oh man i

2870
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:46,480
wish we had some skunk

2871
01:35:44,079 --> 01:35:47,439
but you got rid of that [ __ ] no one

2872
01:35:46,479 --> 01:35:48,959
yeah

2873
01:35:47,439 --> 01:35:50,799
never looked back

2874
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:52,639
and then it was like not popular for

2875
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:53,920
long enough that when the time when

2876
01:35:52,639 --> 01:35:57,279
everyone looked around and was like

2877
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:58,960
where'd it go it was gone

2878
01:35:57,279 --> 01:36:01,279
yeah people were asking

2879
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:02,960
when it showed up and i think i think

2880
01:36:01,279 --> 01:36:04,319
most people agree that whenever the

2881
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:05,920
afghanis started showing up in

2882
01:36:04,319 --> 01:36:08,238
california is when the skunk started

2883
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:09,600
popping up if you want to believe sam

2884
01:36:08,238 --> 01:36:12,319
skunk man

2885
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:15,199
he'll say that in the start of skunk one

2886
01:36:12,319 --> 01:36:16,639
um i post you know that it popped up in

2887
01:36:15,198 --> 01:36:18,079
most phenos

2888
01:36:16,639 --> 01:36:19,600
that it was dominant that you didn't

2889
01:36:18,079 --> 01:36:20,559
have to look for it it didn't matter if

2890
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:23,280
it was

2891
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:25,199
who it was grown by where it was grown

2892
01:36:23,279 --> 01:36:26,319
what nutrients you use they came out

2893
01:36:25,198 --> 01:36:28,319
skunky

2894
01:36:26,319 --> 01:36:31,599
and it does seem when we interviewed

2895
01:36:28,319 --> 01:36:33,519
corel uh from super sativa seed club he

2896
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:36,719
said the first skunk seeds that he got

2897
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:39,119
from sam were much much much skunkier

2898
01:36:36,719 --> 01:36:40,319
than what came later yeah

2899
01:36:39,118 --> 01:36:42,559
and neville

2900
01:36:40,319 --> 01:36:43,359
got those same seats

2901
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:44,639
and

2902
01:36:43,359 --> 01:36:46,559
you know i think the reason why the

2903
01:36:44,639 --> 01:36:49,600
super skunk got lost

2904
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:52,960
is because they lost the breeding male

2905
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:55,119
that through those skunk terps you know

2906
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:57,439
and you know he they used that skunk

2907
01:36:55,118 --> 01:36:59,359
mail and all kinds of stuff and so i

2908
01:36:57,439 --> 01:37:00,960
think it was prevalent in the 90s with a

2909
01:36:59,359 --> 01:37:02,799
lot of those hybrids

2910
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:05,039
and then times changed

2911
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:07,520
and it was i mean i grew that old school

2912
01:37:05,039 --> 01:37:08,319
super skunk right

2913
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:10,159
and

2914
01:37:08,319 --> 01:37:11,759
you know some people call the skunk six

2915
01:37:10,158 --> 01:37:13,198
and it really was

2916
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:15,760
scary

2917
01:37:13,198 --> 01:37:18,000
yeah you know it made around your house

2918
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:19,520
smell ridiculous for the last two weeks

2919
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:22,800
before harvest

2920
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:24,960
it was even before you really had um

2921
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:26,960
carbon filters were really sold

2922
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:30,560
yeah right so you'd have like the old

2923
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:32,239
like uh juvenile like ozone generators

2924
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:34,400
yeah and you'd run it you'd run the

2925
01:37:32,238 --> 01:37:36,000
ozone through like 30 40 feet of pipe

2926
01:37:34,399 --> 01:37:37,039
and a coil and then you'd blow it out

2927
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,118
your house

2928
01:37:37,039 --> 01:37:40,880
but i used to pull up in summer and it

2929
01:37:39,118 --> 01:37:42,639
smelled like dead skunks all around my

2930
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:44,400
house yeah

2931
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:45,840
it was scary where you by your neighbors

2932
01:37:44,399 --> 01:37:47,118
you worry about getting in trouble you

2933
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:50,079
know people talk about it going through

2934
01:37:47,118 --> 01:37:52,238
the bag yeah right well what if it reeks

2935
01:37:50,079 --> 01:37:54,238
like a dead skunk for 50 yards in every

2936
01:37:52,238 --> 01:37:55,759
direction for your house for two weeks

2937
01:37:54,238 --> 01:37:57,759
out of every eight

2938
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:59,760
yeah that's sketchy

2939
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:02,079
um people keep asking about shoreline we

2940
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:03,600
mentioned a little bit ago i got to try

2941
01:38:02,079 --> 01:38:04,960
outdoor shoreline

2942
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:06,480
and i thought it was pretty well grown

2943
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:08,480
the person who gave it to me said it

2944
01:38:06,479 --> 01:38:10,799
wasn't but he's very humble and then i

2945
01:38:08,479 --> 01:38:13,919
got to try some indoor from bitter that

2946
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:17,039
he had grown and i got i

2947
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:19,359
i think it smells like hot garbage um

2948
01:38:17,039 --> 01:38:21,439
indoor and then outdoors smelled a lot

2949
01:38:19,359 --> 01:38:24,880
like real cat piss not terpenoline but

2950
01:38:21,439 --> 01:38:26,719
real cat piss ammonia um hot garbage so

2951
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:28,880
it's i mean it just depends on what your

2952
01:38:26,719 --> 01:38:30,719
definition of skunk is and my nose i put

2953
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:32,239
a lot of stuff up it when i was young so

2954
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:33,520
i don't smell things certain smells i

2955
01:38:32,238 --> 01:38:35,198
can't smell lemon and a lot of stuff

2956
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:37,040
that other people can so

2957
01:38:35,198 --> 01:38:39,599
it's hard to say it's hard to say yeah i

2958
01:38:37,039 --> 01:38:42,960
mean most of my most of my friends one

2959
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:44,560
of the reasons why we we lost it was

2960
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:45,520
i couldn't get anybody to help me back

2961
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:47,679
it up

2962
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:49,280
yeah i believe it yeah you know because

2963
01:38:47,679 --> 01:38:51,118
people didn't want to grow it out it was

2964
01:38:49,279 --> 01:38:53,198
risky and they were making good money

2965
01:38:51,118 --> 01:38:54,559
and growing other things yeah

2966
01:38:53,198 --> 01:38:56,319
and that's how a lot of stuff will get

2967
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:58,239
lost is like they'll be like oh well you

2968
01:38:56,319 --> 01:38:59,840
know you can hold on to it yeah it's a

2969
01:38:58,238 --> 01:39:01,839
lot of extra risk for not a lot of extra

2970
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:03,279
bucks and then and then you're in the

2971
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:05,840
and then you're in the spot where it's

2972
01:39:03,279 --> 01:39:08,479
like then it's one bust or one fire or

2973
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:10,560
one mistake or one mishap away from

2974
01:39:08,479 --> 01:39:11,919
losing it

2975
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:13,600
and then you start trying to hunt it

2976
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:15,600
down you know

2977
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:17,840
somebody said that l.a cushion chem d is

2978
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:19,520
pretty skunky um that's good that you

2979
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:21,199
found that i would not be surprised

2980
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:23,040
because i think both of those strains

2981
01:39:21,198 --> 01:39:25,198
have super skunk in them

2982
01:39:23,039 --> 01:39:27,279
yeah i would not be surprised on some

2983
01:39:25,198 --> 01:39:29,678
level to see

2984
01:39:27,279 --> 01:39:30,719
somewhere in there those those genes

2985
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:33,279
combine

2986
01:39:30,719 --> 01:39:35,279
yeah and that kind of stuff to

2987
01:39:33,279 --> 01:39:37,359
to to come back up but you know it's

2988
01:39:35,279 --> 01:39:40,079
it's a numbers game

2989
01:39:37,359 --> 01:39:41,839
you know it's a numbers game uh so hob's

2990
01:39:40,079 --> 01:39:44,399
breath um someone asked about the

2991
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:46,079
hogsworth lineage it it expresses very

2992
01:39:44,399 --> 01:39:48,000
afghani probably has some skunk one in

2993
01:39:46,079 --> 01:39:49,279
it i mean it has like a depending on how

2994
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,719
you grow it slightly cheesy just

2995
01:39:49,279 --> 01:39:53,279
slightly sweet smell

2996
01:39:50,719 --> 01:39:54,560
um foot funk is probably my best

2997
01:39:53,279 --> 01:39:57,198
description of it though other people

2998
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:59,199
smell different things in it um

2999
01:39:57,198 --> 01:40:01,039
it was said to be williams wonder to

3000
01:39:59,198 --> 01:40:02,158
northern lights uh to a northern lights

3001
01:40:01,039 --> 01:40:04,079
back cross there was all kinds of

3002
01:40:02,158 --> 01:40:06,479
different things people said but

3003
01:40:04,079 --> 01:40:09,519
probably if i had to guess

3004
01:40:06,479 --> 01:40:11,839
some sort of skunk one nl5 maybe

3005
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:13,440
something williams wonder maybe i don't

3006
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:16,480
know it's hard to say afghani

3007
01:40:13,439 --> 01:40:18,719
afghanistan of some sort

3008
01:40:16,479 --> 01:40:20,879
yeah so i mean it i think

3009
01:40:18,719 --> 01:40:23,520
i think people there's a lot better

3010
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:26,319
chance for people to find it and some

3011
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:28,880
random cuts like our buddies uh you know

3012
01:40:26,319 --> 01:40:30,639
uh panda that we were talking about yeah

3013
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:33,520
pop up it'd be another thing if that

3014
01:40:30,639 --> 01:40:35,359
person could actually take it that cut

3015
01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:37,600
and then turn that into a line that

3016
01:40:35,359 --> 01:40:39,519
people would you know with at least with

3017
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:40,880
a reasonable level of certainty find

3018
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:42,800
some skunk in

3019
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:44,319
yeah because that's that's where it all

3020
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:45,760
falls apart is to be like oh you're

3021
01:40:44,319 --> 01:40:48,840
gonna get some skunk soon and then all

3022
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:51,199
the beans they sell people don't find it

3023
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:52,239
yeah you know

3024
01:40:51,198 --> 01:40:55,439
um

3025
01:40:52,238 --> 01:40:57,279
and uh you know so

3026
01:40:55,439 --> 01:40:58,879
you know they um you know there's all

3027
01:40:57,279 --> 01:41:00,880
kinds of people saying oh i've got this

3028
01:40:58,880 --> 01:41:03,920
oh i've got that oh i've got amazing

3029
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:07,359
things and it'd be great if people did

3030
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:09,118
but um nobody's really popped up with it

3031
01:41:07,359 --> 01:41:10,719
i mean we even had that that that

3032
01:41:09,118 --> 01:41:12,880
[ __ ] joint breath or whatever he

3033
01:41:10,719 --> 01:41:15,359
[ __ ] went to he went to like one of

3034
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:16,800
those colorado uh one of those colorado

3035
01:41:15,359 --> 01:41:19,439
cannabis shows

3036
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:21,440
and he got skunk spray from uh

3037
01:41:19,439 --> 01:41:23,118
that was [ __ ] that was emerald cup he

3038
01:41:21,439 --> 01:41:24,879
did it

3039
01:41:23,118 --> 01:41:26,639
he did that emerald cup or whatever yeah

3040
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:28,800
and he went and got some skunk spray

3041
01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:31,279
aroma from uh

3042
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:33,440
from uh you know it's called kinks

3043
01:41:31,279 --> 01:41:35,198
yeah from from the outdoor store you

3044
01:41:33,439 --> 01:41:37,678
know hunting you know kabbalah's or

3045
01:41:35,198 --> 01:41:39,279
something and and and rubbed it all over

3046
01:41:37,679 --> 01:41:41,520
his his jar

3047
01:41:39,279 --> 01:41:43,599
yeah so that he could crack the jar and

3048
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:44,719
be like you want to buy my seeds this is

3049
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:46,239
rank

3050
01:41:44,719 --> 01:41:47,920
and then people would be like oh my god

3051
01:41:46,238 --> 01:41:49,678
this just stinks and then they'd go to

3052
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:51,039
smell the bud and they could and they

3053
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:52,319
it's like they could barely smell it

3054
01:41:51,039 --> 01:41:53,519
because only a little bit of it had

3055
01:41:52,319 --> 01:41:55,359
gotten on there

3056
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:58,159
one one of the people he let walk away

3057
01:41:55,359 --> 01:42:01,039
with some buds of it and in their bag

3058
01:41:58,158 --> 01:42:02,879
was just this orange oil all across the

3059
01:42:01,039 --> 01:42:04,800
back

3060
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:06,400
yeah i mean that was pretty sweet i got

3061
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:08,079
to give him props for actually doing

3062
01:42:06,399 --> 01:42:09,920
that a lot of people joke about doing

3063
01:42:08,079 --> 01:42:11,439
that but that one actually that was

3064
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:14,319
actually he actually went for it you

3065
01:42:11,439 --> 01:42:16,559
know yeah and um and there's an aspect

3066
01:42:14,319 --> 01:42:18,158
too where you know they uh

3067
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:19,600
um so yeah there's a bunch of people

3068
01:42:18,158 --> 01:42:21,839
that have claimed it

3069
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:24,320
uh and uh

3070
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:25,920
um i don't i like people talk about i do

3071
01:42:24,319 --> 01:42:28,799
believe that there's a way to make some

3072
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:30,719
things express skunkier than they do

3073
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:32,560
but i also believe that there was some

3074
01:42:30,719 --> 01:42:36,800
there's some plants out there

3075
01:42:32,560 --> 01:42:38,560
um that have a straight skunk nose

3076
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:41,360
i i find it hard to believe that

3077
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:42,560
anything after a full dry and after a

3078
01:42:41,359 --> 01:42:43,839
full cure it's going to smell super

3079
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:45,360
skunky i just don't think it can be

3080
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:47,920
captured like that

3081
01:42:45,359 --> 01:42:51,599
based on what it is that old cut had it

3082
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:52,560
100 percent yeah even even like super

3083
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:54,079
far

3084
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:57,199
right yeah i mean it would only last

3085
01:42:54,079 --> 01:43:00,319
them i'll give you it would only last

3086
01:42:57,198 --> 01:43:02,719
you know uh a month yeah i mean anything

3087
01:43:00,319 --> 01:43:05,198
and then eventually

3088
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:08,000
but certainly like the first two three

3089
01:43:05,198 --> 01:43:11,439
four weeks you had dry wheat of it yeah

3090
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:14,479
it reeked unbelievably yeah 100 it

3091
01:43:11,439 --> 01:43:16,879
didn't go away um and so

3092
01:43:14,479 --> 01:43:18,638
you know i uh

3093
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:20,639
you know they um

3094
01:43:18,639 --> 01:43:23,118
i think it's out there but i think that

3095
01:43:20,639 --> 01:43:26,800
the level of breeding required to lock

3096
01:43:23,118 --> 01:43:30,079
it in is not profitable enough

3097
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:32,320
to get people to actually do the work

3098
01:43:30,079 --> 01:43:33,679
to make it all happen

3099
01:43:32,319 --> 01:43:36,319
yeah

3100
01:43:33,679 --> 01:43:38,158
and have everybody grow the same way so

3101
01:43:36,319 --> 01:43:40,238
it expresses the same way most because

3102
01:43:38,158 --> 01:43:42,158
most breeding you know there's some we

3103
01:43:40,238 --> 01:43:45,359
have some friends like you know archive

3104
01:43:42,158 --> 01:43:47,599
or kayla uh csi or you know there's matt

3105
01:43:45,359 --> 01:43:50,880
you know we have some good friends that

3106
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:53,119
that that do multi-stage breeding

3107
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:55,039
but the vast majority of breeding today

3108
01:43:53,118 --> 01:43:58,079
is is one-offs and they move on to

3109
01:43:55,039 --> 01:43:59,840
something else yeah it's not super

3110
01:43:58,079 --> 01:44:01,760
there's not they don't take something

3111
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:03,039
and and like they're like oh i'm gonna

3112
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:05,280
make this thing and then i'm gonna grow

3113
01:44:03,039 --> 01:44:09,039
out a thousand of them or 500 of them or

3114
01:44:05,279 --> 01:44:10,800
200 of them and select and re-breed and

3115
01:44:09,039 --> 01:44:11,840
it's almost all

3116
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:12,719
uh

3117
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:14,079
you know

3118
01:44:12,719 --> 01:44:16,239
um

3119
01:44:14,079 --> 01:44:18,800
it's almost all one-offs

3120
01:44:16,238 --> 01:44:20,638
st you know reversals and one-ups right

3121
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:22,880
yeah i mean how many people do you see

3122
01:44:20,639 --> 01:44:25,359
finding stuff within their own work and

3123
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:28,000
then using that in further work

3124
01:44:25,359 --> 01:44:29,839
yeah it's it's minimal and it's most

3125
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:31,920
most common for someone to be like i

3126
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:34,800
reverse this plant onto these plants

3127
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:36,719
here's the names here's the packaging

3128
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:38,639
my next drop will be this other plant

3129
01:44:36,719 --> 01:44:41,439
reversed onto these other plants and

3130
01:44:38,639 --> 01:44:42,239
yeah you know and so on and so forth

3131
01:44:41,439 --> 01:44:44,158
so

3132
01:44:42,238 --> 01:44:45,759
you know i mean rc archive on here

3133
01:44:44,158 --> 01:44:47,519
archive is one of the few people that is

3134
01:44:45,760 --> 01:44:49,920
like oh i got these phenos that i made

3135
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:51,600
from my own stuff yeah and i'm gonna

3136
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:54,480
work with it matt's done that you can

3137
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:56,000
watch csi do it on his page

3138
01:44:54,479 --> 01:44:58,799
there's people that do it

3139
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:00,560
uh it's not as profitable

3140
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:02,239
and so trying to find someone that's

3141
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:03,920
really gonna take all the failure

3142
01:45:02,238 --> 01:45:06,479
involved to

3143
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:08,560
actually find rks

3144
01:45:06,479 --> 01:45:10,879
uh is probably rare

3145
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:10,880
yeah

3146
01:45:11,039 --> 01:45:13,920
man

3147
01:45:12,319 --> 01:45:15,359
indeed

3148
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:16,960
indeed

3149
01:45:15,359 --> 01:45:18,399
okay let's do let's get this giveaway

3150
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:20,560
ready so

3151
01:45:18,399 --> 01:45:22,799
i'm just i literally picked just like

3152
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:25,199
four random things one's a blue bonnet

3153
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:27,679
mix so this is a mixture of different

3154
01:45:25,198 --> 01:45:30,319
whatever like females in a mixture

3155
01:45:27,679 --> 01:45:31,760
there's like 20 seeds in there or more

3156
01:45:30,319 --> 01:45:33,920
uh one's a

3157
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:35,039
a durbin yeti fuel hybrid that i've

3158
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:37,039
released is something called project

3159
01:45:35,039 --> 01:45:38,639
fruit was just fruity and i'm not big on

3160
01:45:37,039 --> 01:45:39,679
fruity but it was decent it had good

3161
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:41,600
yield

3162
01:45:39,679 --> 01:45:44,000
one is uh

3163
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:45,600
the narrow leaf bubba what i don't know

3164
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:47,198
if it was really an s1 or if it was

3165
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:50,320
[ __ ] paul and katan probably bonkin

3166
01:45:47,198 --> 01:45:52,799
down crossing the heirloom afghani mill

3167
01:45:50,319 --> 01:45:54,880
and then the old calio cut across to the

3168
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:56,560
z cube skittles bx3 so we got to give

3169
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:59,440
this away to someone i don't know how

3170
01:45:56,560 --> 01:46:01,600
we're going to do it yet um

3171
01:45:59,439 --> 01:46:05,919
so what matt doesn't realize is i i save

3172
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:05,920
my botox for there so it's actually

3173
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:11,440
it's it's uh uh it's probably the best

3174
01:46:09,279 --> 01:46:14,719
looking part of me really so i think i

3175
01:46:11,439 --> 01:46:17,519
have an idea i have an idea so whoever

3176
01:46:14,719 --> 01:46:19,359
gives whoever not so selects as the

3177
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:20,880
funniest response

3178
01:46:19,359 --> 01:46:23,439
to the

3179
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:26,319
to the given genetics for the strain

3180
01:46:23,439 --> 01:46:28,000
called natso's old balls so not those

3181
01:46:26,319 --> 01:46:29,920
old balls what are the genetics in it

3182
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:31,760
whoever has the the funniest or best

3183
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:33,118
answer you'll you'll get these four

3184
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:35,360
people and it has to be it has to be

3185
01:46:33,118 --> 01:46:36,880
someone in the usa that's important

3186
01:46:35,359 --> 01:46:38,399
i'm not paying [ __ ] 20 bucks to send

3187
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:40,480
you seats it's not gonna happen the

3188
01:46:38,399 --> 01:46:42,238
dumpster still exists

3189
01:46:40,479 --> 01:46:46,000
yeah you know yeah it's gotta be a

3190
01:46:42,238 --> 01:46:46,879
hybrid the dumpster still exists yeah um

3191
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:50,399
you know

3192
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:53,520
cali o is probably cali oh by skunk one

3193
01:46:50,399 --> 01:46:55,920
yes uh that's that's probably what uh

3194
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:58,080
what what's what realistic is realistic

3195
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:59,760
you know yes growth that's actually

3196
01:46:58,079 --> 01:47:02,800
plant-based should win i mean he just

3197
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:02,800
said scrotox

3198
01:47:04,158 --> 01:47:09,679
um which yeah i don't know that might be

3199
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:12,000
that might be the winner yeah um scrotux

3200
01:47:09,679 --> 01:47:13,520
is going to be hard to beat scrotox is

3201
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,880
really uh

3202
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:17,760
um

3203
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:19,279
yeah boy you know but yeah that's that's

3204
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:21,440
that that's that's how they look so

3205
01:47:19,279 --> 01:47:23,439
smooth and young

3206
01:47:21,439 --> 01:47:24,879
most people wasted most people wasted on

3207
01:47:23,439 --> 01:47:26,319
their face you know and on their

3208
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:28,480
forehead and they try to work on these

3209
01:47:26,319 --> 01:47:30,479
lines and stuff like that but yeah you

3210
01:47:28,479 --> 01:47:32,799
know that's that's that's that's wasted

3211
01:47:30,479 --> 01:47:34,799
there that is that's a total waste

3212
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:37,119
that's wasted you know

3213
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:38,960
so uh

3214
01:47:37,118 --> 01:47:40,639
indeed

3215
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:42,239
indeed so

3216
01:47:40,639 --> 01:47:43,920
they uh god the names that are gonna

3217
01:47:42,238 --> 01:47:47,359
come in and you [ __ ] me

3218
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:50,000
yeah oh yeah this is a good one i i i

3219
01:47:47,359 --> 01:47:52,559
think um joe cool said scrow talks first

3220
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:53,439
so joe cool i think you're in the u.s so

3221
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:55,440
yeah

3222
01:47:53,439 --> 01:47:57,359
joe cool is

3223
01:47:55,439 --> 01:47:59,519
joe cool hit me up after i'll make sure

3224
01:47:57,359 --> 01:48:02,079
these go to you

3225
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:04,159
um and then maybe we're getting close

3226
01:48:02,079 --> 01:48:05,600
we're getting close to the end but maybe

3227
01:48:04,158 --> 01:48:06,638
i'll do a rant

3228
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:09,280
oh yeah

3229
01:48:06,639 --> 01:48:11,118
um sure so we were we almost got to it

3230
01:48:09,279 --> 01:48:11,920
earlier and then we got sidetracked and

3231
01:48:11,118 --> 01:48:14,960
uh

3232
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:15,760
and thrown not so firm is pretty good

3233
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:18,239
uh

3234
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:19,760
not so firm it's also pretty good yeah

3235
01:48:18,238 --> 01:48:21,759
but we were talking about like people

3236
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:23,920
were asking a bunch of questions

3237
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:25,760
and um

3238
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:28,239
you know and uh

3239
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:29,840
i think maybe just a brief like sort of

3240
01:48:28,238 --> 01:48:32,319
like what

3241
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:33,360
what people get with seeds has changed a

3242
01:48:32,319 --> 01:48:36,000
lot

3243
01:48:33,359 --> 01:48:38,719
yeah so i was just talking now where

3244
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:40,560
it's like really um what it boils down

3245
01:48:38,719 --> 01:48:42,960
to is right now what you get is you get

3246
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:45,679
a lot of like one-off hybrids

3247
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:47,359
that are sold and they exist until the

3248
01:48:45,679 --> 01:48:48,079
guy runs out of stock and then they're

3249
01:48:47,359 --> 01:48:50,559
gone

3250
01:48:48,079 --> 01:48:52,000
yep that's that's that's most of the

3251
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:54,639
industry right now

3252
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:57,198
is one offs but you go back 25 30 years

3253
01:48:54,639 --> 01:49:00,560
or something and that was not how things

3254
01:48:57,198 --> 01:49:02,879
were most seed companies sold lines yeah

3255
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:04,960
okay and there's a concept called

3256
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:06,560
um you know what's your floor what's

3257
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:10,079
your ceiling

3258
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:12,080
right and what what that is is that it's

3259
01:49:10,079 --> 01:49:14,000
like is your seed line does it have a

3260
01:49:12,079 --> 01:49:16,238
high floor which where most of them are

3261
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:18,479
pretty decent but a low ceiling where

3262
01:49:16,238 --> 01:49:20,799
you're not going to find any elites

3263
01:49:18,479 --> 01:49:22,559
yeah or does it have like a low floor

3264
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:23,840
where you could get some true junk and a

3265
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:26,000
bunch of mids

3266
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:27,760
but it actually has a high ceiling where

3267
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,800
you could get some true elites mixed in

3268
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:31,039
there

3269
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:32,800
and people have this idea that in the

3270
01:49:31,039 --> 01:49:34,560
90s and all that in amsterdam like there

3271
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:36,480
was all this magical weed

3272
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:38,400
that's the weed that survived

3273
01:49:36,479 --> 01:49:40,718
yeah there was a lot of junk and there

3274
01:49:38,399 --> 01:49:43,598
was a lot of mids

3275
01:49:40,719 --> 01:49:45,679
right um and back then it was better

3276
01:49:43,599 --> 01:49:47,119
than mexican

3277
01:49:45,679 --> 01:49:49,920
so we

3278
01:49:47,118 --> 01:49:52,000
people were a lot more forgiving oh just

3279
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:53,760
random kind bud because all random kind

3280
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:55,439
buds still sold because it wasn't so

3281
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:58,400
clone-centric or anything like that

3282
01:49:55,439 --> 01:49:59,678
right so you had a situation where

3283
01:49:58,399 --> 01:50:00,879
i don't know i don't know how i don't

3284
01:49:59,679 --> 01:50:04,079
know how to say it i probably have

3285
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:05,039
bought 10 or 15 packs of scentsy and l5

3286
01:50:04,079 --> 01:50:06,559
haze

3287
01:50:05,039 --> 01:50:09,599
in the mid 90s so that's probably i

3288
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:12,080
don't know it's over 100 seeds yeah i

3289
01:50:09,599 --> 01:50:15,199
didn't find an amazing keeper

3290
01:50:12,079 --> 01:50:17,679
yeah but yet there's pif and cuban

3291
01:50:15,198 --> 01:50:19,439
there's all these different named phenos

3292
01:50:17,679 --> 01:50:20,880
yeah from those exact same seeds that

3293
01:50:19,439 --> 01:50:22,399
are still around 30 years later and

3294
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:23,920
they're the [ __ ] bomb and they're

3295
01:50:22,399 --> 01:50:25,439
still like competing with today's

3296
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:27,118
strains and they're still still like

3297
01:50:25,439 --> 01:50:29,759
today's strains yeah and there's certain

3298
01:50:27,118 --> 01:50:30,719
old strains you know that stand the test

3299
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:32,639
of time

3300
01:50:30,719 --> 01:50:35,439
and you know you might run through five

3301
01:50:32,639 --> 01:50:38,719
or six well today as matt will tell you

3302
01:50:35,439 --> 01:50:40,000
if you bought three or four packs of

3303
01:50:38,719 --> 01:50:41,920
matt's work

3304
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:44,158
and all you found was junk and not a

3305
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:45,920
single keeper you would be [ __ ]

3306
01:50:44,158 --> 01:50:47,439
typing on your keyboard and making his

3307
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:48,319
life miserable because you'd be [ __ ]

3308
01:50:47,439 --> 01:50:51,359
pissed

3309
01:50:48,319 --> 01:50:54,319
so yes there's a lot of pressure today

3310
01:50:51,359 --> 01:50:56,960
to have a high floor with your breeding

3311
01:50:54,319 --> 01:50:59,759
so people will get stuff that is decent

3312
01:50:56,960 --> 01:51:02,079
enough that they won't [ __ ] yeah

3313
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:03,599
and even back in the day 30 years ago

3314
01:51:02,079 --> 01:51:06,238
neville used to

3315
01:51:03,599 --> 01:51:08,319
neville used to complain that he had

3316
01:51:06,238 --> 01:51:09,919
these like you know afghan by afghan

3317
01:51:08,319 --> 01:51:12,479
amazing hybrids

3318
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:14,480
right like that he wanted to release but

3319
01:51:12,479 --> 01:51:16,158
if people got 10 or 20 percent less

3320
01:51:14,479 --> 01:51:19,039
yield than the out crosses they'd [ __ ]

3321
01:51:16,158 --> 01:51:20,638
up a storm yeah so breeders are always

3322
01:51:19,039 --> 01:51:22,880
thinking about

3323
01:51:20,639 --> 01:51:26,560
what will sell

3324
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:28,079
what's feasible you have to right and so

3325
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:30,000
there's a lot of great weed that someone

3326
01:51:28,079 --> 01:51:33,118
would be like this is amazing weed

3327
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:35,118
but it herms yeah so i can't sell it

3328
01:51:33,118 --> 01:51:37,359
because it'll be just endless

3329
01:51:35,118 --> 01:51:40,000
memes about me if you i mean all it

3330
01:51:37,359 --> 01:51:42,880
takes is one customer posting one good

3331
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:44,479
picture of one single plant herming even

3332
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:46,159
if it's in like you can tell the plants

3333
01:51:44,479 --> 01:51:47,919
all burnt up and it doesn't matter even

3334
01:51:46,158 --> 01:51:50,319
if they could show that one time it can

3335
01:51:47,920 --> 01:51:52,399
ruin a line for good that's just how it

3336
01:51:50,319 --> 01:51:53,519
goes you know so there's a bunch of so

3337
01:51:52,399 --> 01:51:55,279
there's a bunch of [ __ ] where if it

3338
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:56,880
herms it won't get released

3339
01:51:55,279 --> 01:51:58,479
if it's too leafy if it's too low

3340
01:51:56,880 --> 01:52:00,719
yielding if it's to this if it's too

3341
01:51:58,479 --> 01:52:02,718
that it won't get released yeah right at

3342
01:52:00,719 --> 01:52:03,840
least back in the day and so there was a

3343
01:52:02,719 --> 01:52:05,920
lot of

3344
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:07,760
there was a lot of uh there was a lot of

3345
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:10,560
strains that never got released that

3346
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:12,000
they thought were killer weed

3347
01:52:10,560 --> 01:52:14,960
but they didn't meet commercial

3348
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:17,039
standards yeah right and now

3349
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:18,880
weed has to be [ __ ] pretty

3350
01:52:17,039 --> 01:52:20,639
yeah cookies on all these different

3351
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:22,560
hybrids have made ugly weed a really

3352
01:52:20,639 --> 01:52:24,639
hard sell

3353
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:26,560
so what happens what happens if you have

3354
01:52:24,639 --> 01:52:28,800
some amazing tasting

3355
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:32,159
amazing effect

3356
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:33,840
kind of ugly weed that herms a little

3357
01:52:32,158 --> 01:52:34,638
that weed is [ __ ]

3358
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:36,400
yeah

3359
01:52:34,639 --> 01:52:37,599
you know like and they probably won't

3360
01:52:36,399 --> 01:52:40,719
get released

3361
01:52:37,599 --> 01:52:44,079
um but it's amazing

3362
01:52:40,719 --> 01:52:46,239
but some pretty some pretty mids

3363
01:52:44,079 --> 01:52:48,960
that will get released every time

3364
01:52:46,238 --> 01:52:50,238
yeah you know the you know and and all

3365
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:51,520
that and so

3366
01:52:50,238 --> 01:52:52,959
um

3367
01:52:51,520 --> 01:52:54,000
you know there's an aspect where it's

3368
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:56,239
like

3369
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:57,679
you know because more weed was accepted

3370
01:52:56,238 --> 01:53:00,479
in the 90s because it was better than

3371
01:52:57,679 --> 01:53:03,440
mexican it allowed a wide variety of

3372
01:53:00,479 --> 01:53:05,759
kinds of weed to flourish yeah it did it

3373
01:53:03,439 --> 01:53:08,158
really allowed and this whole naming of

3374
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:10,320
clone thing has led to the same same

3375
01:53:08,158 --> 01:53:12,559
getting grown by everybody

3376
01:53:10,319 --> 01:53:13,920
and then that same weed gets crossed to

3377
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:15,440
everything

3378
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:18,639
and then everything's a blend of

3379
01:53:15,439 --> 01:53:20,960
cushmans and and kush and cookie and

3380
01:53:18,639 --> 01:53:22,960
this and that and skittles and da da da

3381
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:24,719
da and you know and people talk about

3382
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:27,039
purple punch purple punch has everything

3383
01:53:24,719 --> 01:53:29,520
but hot

3384
01:53:27,039 --> 01:53:31,118
i don't like that plant goddamn yeah but

3385
01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:32,159
there's so many mids and now that

3386
01:53:31,118 --> 01:53:33,679
there's now that there's modern

3387
01:53:32,158 --> 01:53:36,399
marketing and everybody has to have

3388
01:53:33,679 --> 01:53:38,399
white hot fire yeah there's there's all

3389
01:53:36,399 --> 01:53:39,679
these things that i call minzy elites

3390
01:53:38,399 --> 01:53:40,638
and then there's this thing where it's

3391
01:53:39,679 --> 01:53:43,440
like

3392
01:53:40,639 --> 01:53:45,679
if it's not an elite and it's not junk

3393
01:53:43,439 --> 01:53:47,279
and it's not mids what is it

3394
01:53:45,679 --> 01:53:49,840
we don't even have a name for better

3395
01:53:47,279 --> 01:53:53,359
than mids but not quite elite yeah no we

3396
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:54,960
don't it's like junk mids elite

3397
01:53:53,359 --> 01:53:56,799
three-step process but there's things

3398
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:58,639
that fall on that spectrum that don't

3399
01:53:56,800 --> 01:54:01,440
have like i have weed that i really love

3400
01:53:58,639 --> 01:54:03,039
and i'd be super bummed if i lost it

3401
01:54:01,439 --> 01:54:04,960
but i wouldn't consider it like in my

3402
01:54:03,039 --> 01:54:07,519
top 10 or 15 cuts

3403
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:10,319
yeah as far as like effect

3404
01:54:07,520 --> 01:54:11,599
but i'd be super bummed if i lost it

3405
01:54:10,319 --> 01:54:13,519
you know which one are you thinking of

3406
01:54:11,599 --> 01:54:16,079
specifically right this second like the

3407
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:17,840
maui i knew it i knew it i knew it okay

3408
01:54:16,079 --> 01:54:20,158
just because just because of like if you

3409
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:22,800
were gonna compare the maui's high

3410
01:54:20,158 --> 01:54:26,000
yeah to say like my favorite highs out

3411
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:29,199
there like an amazing nl5 haze vino or

3412
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:32,158
chem 91 or chem d or the headband it's

3413
01:54:29,198 --> 01:54:34,158
not as good yeah but is it frosty and

3414
01:54:32,158 --> 01:54:36,719
has amazing flavor and like you know

3415
01:54:34,158 --> 01:54:39,839
throws nice purple chunks and is a great

3416
01:54:36,719 --> 01:54:40,639
yielder and like it has amazing features

3417
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:42,480
yeah

3418
01:54:40,639 --> 01:54:44,639
but it's it's it doesn't have any elite

3419
01:54:42,479 --> 01:54:46,399
high you know

3420
01:54:44,639 --> 01:54:49,840
huh but you know it's an interesting

3421
01:54:46,399 --> 01:54:53,118
anomaly um among maybe instagram weed

3422
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:55,360
today that i've noticed is the chem 91

3423
01:54:53,118 --> 01:54:56,880
because it's not exceptionally pretty it

3424
01:54:55,359 --> 01:54:58,799
is actually if you ask me it's

3425
01:54:56,880 --> 01:55:00,000
exceptionally ugly most of the time it's

3426
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:01,520
very ugly

3427
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:05,118
it's very hard to take good pictures of

3428
01:55:01,520 --> 01:55:07,920
it and most of its value is in the high

3429
01:55:05,118 --> 01:55:09,279
yeah and it's rare potency and it's rare

3430
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:11,520
potency which is something you can't

3431
01:55:09,279 --> 01:55:14,000
convey in pictures yet still today it's

3432
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:15,360
it sticks around and there's enough

3433
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:17,760
people that say it's some of the best

3434
01:55:15,359 --> 01:55:20,000
weed of all time yeah that there's group

3435
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:23,039
think there and people want to try some

3436
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:24,079
of the best weed of all time yeah fomo

3437
01:55:23,039 --> 01:55:26,238
for sure

3438
01:55:24,079 --> 01:55:28,079
you know but and a lot of times the when

3439
01:55:26,238 --> 01:55:29,839
it looks the prettiest

3440
01:55:28,079 --> 01:55:32,800
is the people that cut it way too early

3441
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:35,360
in my opinion like 53 or 55 days

3442
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:37,760
yeah if you take it the full 70 plus or

3443
01:55:35,359 --> 01:55:40,158
something it looks more ugly yeah but it

3444
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:42,560
works really good skunk va makes it look

3445
01:55:40,158 --> 01:55:44,479
beautiful when he grows it and i i never

3446
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:46,480
got it to look like that it was always

3447
01:55:44,479 --> 01:55:48,399
just even when i tried to shut it down

3448
01:55:46,479 --> 01:55:49,678
on light hours like lower light hours

3449
01:55:48,399 --> 01:55:51,839
anything i would do would be endless

3450
01:55:49,679 --> 01:55:53,520
white pistols burn up ass [ __ ] leaves

3451
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:54,960
it would just look hideous well you know

3452
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:57,040
one of the things i'll say and maybe

3453
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:59,039
i'll bring up like uh some totally

3454
01:55:57,039 --> 01:56:00,479
random [ __ ] like crockett and dna for a

3455
01:55:59,039 --> 01:56:01,679
second yeah

3456
01:56:00,479 --> 01:56:03,118
one of the things they did that was

3457
01:56:01,679 --> 01:56:04,560
really smart

3458
01:56:03,118 --> 01:56:06,639
when they started selling all their

3459
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:09,039
strawberry banana and all those hybrids

3460
01:56:06,639 --> 01:56:11,359
and they were blowing up the emerald cup

3461
01:56:09,039 --> 01:56:12,479
is they grew out greenhouses of that

3462
01:56:11,359 --> 01:56:13,839
weed

3463
01:56:12,479 --> 01:56:16,000
and then they got professional

3464
01:56:13,840 --> 01:56:17,920
photographers with really good equipment

3465
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:21,118
that understood lighting and understood

3466
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:24,239
all that and color to come out and take

3467
01:56:21,118 --> 01:56:26,319
jaw-droppingly beautiful shots

3468
01:56:24,238 --> 01:56:27,519
and so that makes a difference too like

3469
01:56:26,319 --> 01:56:30,479
you might be sitting there and be like

3470
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:32,080
man i can't get a good picture of this

3471
01:56:30,479 --> 01:56:33,678
right because you're not and i do the

3472
01:56:32,079 --> 01:56:35,198
same thing i'll be i'll take pictures of

3473
01:56:33,679 --> 01:56:36,079
weed and i'll be like i'm not that happy

3474
01:56:35,198 --> 01:56:38,238
with it

3475
01:56:36,079 --> 01:56:40,079
yeah you know but you get a professional

3476
01:56:38,238 --> 01:56:42,079
in there and they're like working on

3477
01:56:40,079 --> 01:56:43,679
shutter speed and aperture and they know

3478
01:56:42,079 --> 01:56:44,880
the lighting and they have this they

3479
01:56:43,679 --> 01:56:47,359
have the that and they'll make it look

3480
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:49,520
like a million bucks

3481
01:56:47,359 --> 01:56:51,839
you know and so they were smart to like

3482
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:54,239
pay for professional marketing

3483
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:56,159
yeah by getting professional photos

3484
01:56:54,238 --> 01:56:57,919
subcool was a master at that and

3485
01:56:56,158 --> 01:56:59,679
absolutely he had some of the prettiest

3486
01:56:57,920 --> 01:57:00,960
[ __ ] pictures back in the day it

3487
01:56:59,679 --> 01:57:02,639
