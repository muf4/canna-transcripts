[Music]

7
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,859
I think I got that right kind of it was

8
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:55,558
kind of kind of a smooth transition but

9
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:58,799
not so smooth but it worked

10
00:00:55,558 --> 00:01:00,238
so we are live we are live okay thank

11
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:01,619
you everyone for showing up today this

12
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:02,939
is the breeder Syndicate I need to

13
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:05,280
remove the background from everything

14
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:08,399
I'll eventually figure all this out this

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,739
is my co-host not so dog

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,659
there he is

17
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:15,658
and this week we're doing a show on

18
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:17,520
feminization and uh can I try to go

19
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,159
through feminized seeds A to Z what they

20
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:22,560
are why they are some of the the

21
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,439
mechanics of how it works as far as the

22
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,060
the biosynthesis and

23
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:28,739
um how to make them

24
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,240
so yeah

25
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:32,819
um where should we start

26
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:34,019
should I bring in my presentation I mean

27
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:35,758
I don't know if we should start with the

28
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:38,099
presentation do we get to see how many

29
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,379
normally we we uh we chat I was almost

30
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:41,879
gonna break your rule there for a second

31
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:44,219
normally we chat for a second until

32
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:47,219
people join can you see how many people

33
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:48,298
join yeah it's the live the live on the

34
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:49,319
YouTube is going to be way different

35
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:51,180
than

36
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:53,578
the live at Instagram going to be

37
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,618
drastically different in numbers so okay

38
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:58,679
so

39
00:01:55,618 --> 00:02:01,200
um yeah anyway uh I don't know if the I

40
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,939
don't know if the presentation is uh is

41
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,420
the gig or whatever maybe we could just

42
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:07,579
start by the first femini seeds that I

43
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,640
ever knew of

44
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:15,120
uh were just Herms yes and there was a

45
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:17,399
lot of false information

46
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,140
um you know uh we used to think of Herms

47
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,780
as like an accident before we really

48
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:23,098
understood like the the reasoning behind

49
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,780
it

50
00:02:23,098 --> 00:02:27,119
um and we used to think that if you used

51
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:30,120
Herm seeds you could permeate the line

52
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,759
yes with future Herms

53
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,520
but uh that was pretty much I think the

54
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:39,439
first feminized breeding uh that most

55
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:42,180
people ever did was accidental yeah

56
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,800
and figured out that if stress or if

57
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,300
they let their plants run long that they

58
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,939
would make seeds and when they pop them

59
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:50,040
they tended to be female yeah very much

60
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:52,439
so you know and but I don't think people

61
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:55,139
realized at that time I didn't certainly

62
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:57,598
that those were actually feminized seats

63
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:59,579
oh yeah I'm sure I'm sure that was just

64
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:01,500
like a an afterthought or something they

65
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,000
might have noticed after the fact after

66
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,159
planting them several times when it

67
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,680
happens and especially if you only get a

68
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:10,079
handful maybe you just think that like

69
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,900
you just didn't get a boy yeah

70
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,080
life is on your side for once and you

71
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:19,439
know well we also call that bag seed and

72
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:23,099
uh bag seed is sort of the backbone of

73
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:25,378
the elite Cuts history yeah in a lot of

74
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:27,959
ways well a lot of backseat too is from

75
00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:30,179
leftover males you know so it's not all

76
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,819
feminized not all back seat is feminized

77
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:35,099
bags correct very much so very much so

78
00:03:32,818 --> 00:03:37,079
in fact like in you would say that like

79
00:03:35,098 --> 00:03:37,818
in Imports and stuff like that

80
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,739
um

81
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:43,259
uh you know a lot of them get pollinated

82
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:45,239
by straight males all the time yeah

83
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:49,318
absolutely

84
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:52,140
and uh so yeah but that was that was uh

85
00:03:49,318 --> 00:03:53,878
um that's sort of the start and then for

86
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:57,000
a long time most of my breeding career

87
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:59,039
really it was what we call regular seeds

88
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,439
that was the only way that people did

89
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:04,500
things for the most part uh I don't

90
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,840
recall reading about or knowing anyone

91
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,959
except for some very weird experiments

92
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,580
trying to make femini seed uh sometimes

93
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,819
people would just

94
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:17,220
stress out a plant and try to get it to

95
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:19,379
make pollen yeah

96
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,880
that was I think that was probably like

97
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:23,639
one of the most common things that was

98
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,899
tried in like feminized seed infancy

99
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,800
right

100
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:28,198
yeah

101
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,800
um Mohan RAM and his partner did some

102
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:33,300
work in 1982 with uh feminized sex

103
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,478
reversals and the first paper was

104
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,280
written in 1982 on the um the feminized

105
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:39,899
sex reversals using silver nitrate and

106
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:41,399
sodium thiosulfate and they tried a

107
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:44,638
bunch of different things but they found

108
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:46,799
that in a certain concentration that the

109
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,500
best results came from using a

110
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,660
combination of silver nitrate and sodium

111
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,639
thiosulfate they would use the silver

112
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,320
nitrate to get the action the ethylene

113
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:58,280
blocking action and the sodium

114
00:04:55,319 --> 00:05:00,240
thiosulfate to keep it from being as

115
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:04,138
phototoxic but I never did it right

116
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:07,620
phototoxic yeah yeah damaging so this is

117
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:10,439
the man we kind of oh oh our uh our

118
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:13,139
whole feminized Heritage too as far as

119
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:15,360
you know developing the process trying

120
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:19,259
it out figuring out what works best and

121
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,819
it goes as far back as 1982. but we

122
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:23,100
didn't quite see that start coming into

123
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:25,439
the Cannabis World until if I remember

124
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,360
correctly Dutch Passion was the one who

125
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:29,699
started pushing it real big they did

126
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,520
they started defining the term feminized

127
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:33,780
and instead of saying that they were all

128
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:36,478
female seeds they would call it

129
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:38,579
feminized just in case you got a male or

130
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:40,379
two popping up they wanted to denote

131
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:43,258
that it wasn't always going to be female

132
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:46,740
as it were and maybe people should know

133
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:50,400
too that um when when that first started

134
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:52,199
happening being Dutch uh they kept what

135
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,978
they were doing very close to the vest

136
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:58,439
oh sure uh there was Zero explanation

137
00:05:54,978 --> 00:06:01,860
given or way of how they were achieving

138
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:05,219
it so for a lot of aspiring breeders and

139
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:07,199
and things like that there wasn't uh you

140
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:10,800
know there wasn't an easy reference of

141
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:13,620
anywhere to go uh on how to what what to

142
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:17,160
use how to do it a process you know

143
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:19,560
mixing instructions any of that yeah

144
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,780
um and uh it was held pretty tightly

145
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,819
yeah they they tended to hold things

146
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:26,219
much tighter than uh a lot of other

147
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:27,479
communities and and notably so I mean

148
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,580
every time that they seem to share

149
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:31,139
clones like every single Dutch Seed

150
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:33,180
Company would have it the next year and

151
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:34,978
be competing with it in the cup so there

152
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:38,280
was kind of a reason that they did it

153
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:39,719
but it carried on into other avenues and

154
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:41,818
areas even when it came to like

155
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,220
breakthroughs in in different technology

156
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:48,360
for cannabis seeds

157
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:50,460
and I also think too that you know for a

158
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,340
long time as well the technology was

159
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:56,519
unknown and it was also sort of looked

160
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:58,638
down upon as cheating yes uh and

161
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:01,198
cannabis enthusiasts for the most part

162
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:04,199
did not look at it as a particularly

163
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,639
viable method yeah they thought the male

164
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:09,000
and female method was everything

165
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:11,038
everyone needed uh and but you know in

166
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,199
other forms of breeding and certainly in

167
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:16,019
other uh in other Industries in

168
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:20,400
agriculture and stuff uh reversals

169
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:22,620
feminized seed at s1s you know all that

170
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,659
kind of stuff have a long history yeah

171
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,519
it's the agricultural standard to breed

172
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,740
using selfing techniques because the

173
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:30,120
fastest way to achieve uniformity which

174
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,280
is really what they're trying to achieve

175
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,699
in agricultural breeding they're trying

176
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:37,918
to yeah consistency uniformity

177
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:39,478
dependability all all aspects of the

178
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:41,939
same thing they're trying to lock in

179
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:44,038
certain traits and have those be

180
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:46,079
Dependable yeah I mean Farmers need to

181
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:47,519
know what they're growing each year they

182
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:49,560
need to make sure that each one's going

183
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:51,538
to stand up to whatever's coming being

184
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,459
thrown at it they can't have a bunch of

185
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:54,839
diversity you know and that's that's a

186
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:57,779
lot of money this is a commercial

187
00:07:54,839 --> 00:08:00,000
operation so yeah and and so I think

188
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:03,119
what happened is is there was a cultural

189
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,879
shift in that in the 70s and 80s and

190
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,639
certainly a decent chunk of the 90s for

191
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:11,159
a lot of people it was a seed culture

192
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,780
right and you would just buy seeds and

193
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,460
you would grow seeds and you would kill

194
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:16,679
the males or remove them and you would

195
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:18,659
grow the females and sometimes you'd

196
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:22,560
make seed but you were growing from seed

197
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:24,800
and then clones started becoming more

198
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:29,280
popular as people found certain

199
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:31,699
specimens yeah and what that led to is

200
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:34,439
you know the first wave of so on Elites

201
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:36,778
right yeah and then that led to breeding

202
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,039
with those Elites yeah and we covered a

203
00:08:36,778 --> 00:08:40,080
lot of those Elites in a previous

204
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:42,360
episode I think we called it the can of

205
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,979
Bible clone list so uh do a YouTube

206
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,379
search for that you can you can find

207
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:48,300
that episode so people started well what

208
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:49,980
happened if I take my mail lines and I

209
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:51,299
start breeding them to these Elites that

210
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,100
have all these qualities that people

211
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:54,539
like

212
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,300
um and then on what happened I think

213
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:58,980
with Dutch Passion too is as in Holland

214
00:08:57,299 --> 00:09:01,859
and Amsterdam as they started to lose

215
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:06,600
actual lines but still had clones

216
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:09,419
remaining I think they went feminized

217
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,580
as a way to like you know maybe they

218
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:13,620
don't have a line of it anymore but they

219
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,899
still have a few Select Cuts oh yeah

220
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,700
yeah and I think they also they did look

221
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:19,379
at it as a way of

222
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,240
um keeping other breeders from breeding

223
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:22,740
with their line I know that was big with

224
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,778
the white widow like feminizing the

225
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,919
White Widow the reason behind that was

226
00:09:24,778 --> 00:09:27,360
because they wanted to make sure that

227
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,039
people couldn't use their white widow

228
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,419
cut they wanted to make it theirs you

229
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:31,919
couldn't make it like theirs and if it's

230
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:34,019
only female you won't have a male to

231
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:36,299
make your seeds with when in fact we all

232
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:38,879
know that you can take a plant from a

233
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:41,879
feminized seed reverse it use that

234
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:45,600
pollen just as well as any clone so yeah

235
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:47,820
I will say back then now that is as the

236
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,080
industry has shifted now that's very

237
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,720
wide knowledge

238
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:54,060
but before I think it was not wide

239
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,500
knowledge yeah so it probably for some

240
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:57,778
years

241
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,299
um protected them just because I mean I

242
00:09:57,778 --> 00:10:02,278
can't remember was it icmag I can't

243
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:06,179
remember what year it was where people

244
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:07,559
started posting an actual recipe

245
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:09,599
oh I don't know

246
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:12,778
um I believe CSI said it was originally

247
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,540
on Old Canada world or cannabis world or

248
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:17,100
um or ever grow I always attributed it

249
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:18,838
to fet because that's where I first saw

250
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,959
it was when phet would pass it around

251
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:23,279
Okay Ice brothers but it goes back much

252
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:25,559
further and there's there's someone who

253
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:28,259
actually that that actually I forgot was

254
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:29,879
like five to two point five it was what

255
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:32,458
we call it the the recipe where it's

256
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:35,700
five uh milligrams silver nitrate to 2.5

257
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:37,319
milligram sodium thiosulfate mix for the

258
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:40,560
stock solution and that's the old recipe

259
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,540
that someone and I I I regret it but if

260
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:44,879
I can figure out from CSI I'll update it

261
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:48,240
in the show notes there so people can

262
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:50,939
have it so yeah I mean it

263
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:55,379
it's gone it's gone from sort of being

264
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:57,720
the the uh cheating undesirable way oh

265
00:10:55,379 --> 00:11:01,379
man this breeder is feminizing he's lost

266
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:03,959
his his Mojo yeah um to being the

267
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:06,600
industry standard yeah you know where

268
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:09,179
regular seeds now are very rare compared

269
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:12,120
to feminized yeah so it's been basically

270
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:14,399
a sea change really I've talked about it

271
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:17,519
in a lot of other episodes where like

272
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,620
the first I would say even 10 years of

273
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,659
making seeds when I and I and I came off

274
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,039
the bat making femini seeds that's what

275
00:11:21,659 --> 00:11:24,719
I started with

276
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:26,159
um as far as seeds that I was selling I

277
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,079
was making Femme seeds and selling them

278
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:32,338
just off the bat and for the first 10

279
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:34,859
years I was told constantly daily emails

280
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:37,740
you're ruining the the Cannabis [ __ ]

281
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:40,320
genome that it's gonna be done you're

282
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:43,320
ruining it for good uh taking males out

283
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:46,019
is GMO you're killing it you know this

284
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,980
isn't natural it's not Nature's Way you

285
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:48,720
know there are all kinds of different

286
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,220
reasoning that people would use and it

287
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,620
was almost like this religious belief

288
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,899
that they had like God made it this way

289
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,940
yeah you're gonna Tinker with it your

290
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:58,320
way and it's gonna be Satan bad you know

291
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,899
that's the way I felt

292
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,820
yeah I mean it's funny I was thinking

293
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:03,958
about it when you were talking about the

294
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:07,440
uh

295
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:09,659
the part uh you know about like having

296
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,519
all these other seed companies steal the

297
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:13,139
work the next year because you just buy

298
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,620
regular seeds and then you have the

299
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:19,078
pollen yeah and you know uh when people

300
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:20,820
think of GMO uh I would say that

301
00:12:19,078 --> 00:12:23,219
probably the first name that comes to

302
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:26,100
mind is probably Monsanto right oh yeah

303
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:28,320
in everybody's mind and they made they

304
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:31,680
famously got around that issue by

305
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:34,200
breeding specifically for uh you know so

306
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:36,299
that their stuff was sterile

307
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,759
and then we've we've seen this in

308
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:41,159
cannabis as well talked about because

309
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:42,600
there's a there's a problem and Neville

310
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:44,639
everyone's talked about it every single

311
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:48,000
breeder has talked about it where the

312
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:50,159
attorney is known there is no um there

313
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,139
is no patents there is no way to control

314
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:54,958
your genetic work so once you've

315
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:56,879
released a line to the public it's just

316
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:59,699
out there yeah

317
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:01,860
and the only the only system that

318
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:05,060
regulates who does what with it after

319
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:08,579
that is the honor System yeah

320
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:11,939
we all know like from from theory and

321
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:14,458
practice that once you let a clone out

322
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:17,040
of your hands once it leaves the one

323
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:19,500
spot that it exists once two people hold

324
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:21,000
it everyone holds it we've all learned

325
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,620
that at the time yeah I mean it's that

326
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,299
it's that old saying right like three

327
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:27,539
people can keep a secret if two of them

328
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:30,120
are dead exactly exactly it's true it's

329
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:32,039
true you know and uh but the other part

330
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,659
that I will say to that and this is a

331
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:35,099
little bit of a tangent so I apologize

332
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:37,679
but sure

333
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:40,980
um you know using the OG for instance

334
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:42,599
which had like an enormous uh impact on

335
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:45,180
Southern California and sort of the

336
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:48,060
Cannabis Market in general if greedy

337
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:49,799
people hadn't sold it and leaked it it

338
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:51,299
probably never would have gotten as

339
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:52,919
famous as it did because there would

340
00:13:51,299 --> 00:13:55,439
only have been a tiny group of people

341
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:57,479
that had it and one of the issues that

342
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,120
we had with the chem dog back in the day

343
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:02,940
was there was like four garages in

344
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:05,220
California growing yeah so it just

345
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:07,560
wasn't very much market for it so it

346
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:09,600
never really could build because it

347
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:11,219
didn't leak out fast and get everywhere

348
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,519
and have this huge wave of everyone

349
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:17,160
having it so fast yeah it like it was

350
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:19,320
like here and there yeah like it took

351
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:21,899
Kush there's a there's a weird thing

352
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:24,180
between people don't want it to leak too

353
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:25,799
fast too far and make it worthless yeah

354
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:28,259
but if it doesn't leak enough where

355
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:30,479
there's actual available flower of it it

356
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:32,819
can't ever catch on as a as a weight

357
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,680
yeah we saw that with the Clockwork

358
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:36,240
Orange in San Diego like we tried to

359
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:37,979
keep that in the Hog's Breath super

360
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,079
tight and the only reason we ever saw

361
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:42,240
Hog's Breath Take off the way it did was

362
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:44,519
because James got had a collective

363
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,839
called unified Collective and had he not

364
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:47,759
had that Collective and had it not

365
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,019
gotten big I'm not sure that Hog's

366
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:50,399
Breath would have blown up like it was

367
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:52,919
because it wasn't in a bunch of

368
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,240
different rooms it was just not and if

369
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:56,458
and if you're if you have something

370
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,480
really special that you know kinda gets

371
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,919
out there you can get a little bit of

372
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,320
Buzz with it and people want it you

373
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:03,240
don't fulfill that with flour ever and

374
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,820
people never get to try right that just

375
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:08,759
that that is a hype that dies fast

376
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:11,040
it does you know or another level is it

377
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:14,338
becomes legendary enough now that like

378
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:16,019
people can can you know offer high

379
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:17,399
priced whatever on it because there's

380
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:18,539
not enough people out there that can

381
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:21,778
call Bull

382
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:24,719
Asian fantasy perfect example one person

383
00:15:21,778 --> 00:15:27,059
ever has had this clone never gotten rid

384
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,980
of it never let anybody have it but to

385
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:31,919
this day I still see Asian fantasy in

386
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:34,079
collectives it actually it went so far

387
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:35,939
as to make itself totally unpopular

388
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:38,698
because nobody else could really get a

389
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:40,920
hold of it then it became so rare

390
00:15:38,698 --> 00:15:42,539
that it proliferated fakes eventually

391
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:44,039
you know what's funny is way back in the

392
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:45,419
day sometimes when we would try to sell

393
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:47,819
people chem dog

394
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:49,799
uh the funny thing about Brokers and and

395
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:52,320
people like that is that they would diss

396
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:54,899
it sometimes because they were so

397
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,480
connected pretty much all the the best

398
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:59,159
weed they see yeah so if they were

399
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,079
unfamiliar with it it couldn't be that

400
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:02,578
good yeah

401
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:04,559
you know

402
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:07,019
um just so everybody knows too this this

403
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:10,078
YouTube is much better but I can't see

404
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:14,159
comments this week the way Matt can so I

405
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:16,138
apologize uh if if uh if you're asking

406
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:18,059
me things and I don't see them you know

407
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:21,839
he can't see anything

408
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:23,939
um I don't worry I'll type for him

409
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:26,220
and so yeah yeah but I mean getting

410
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:29,220
getting back to the to the sort of the

411
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,820
the focus of it is that

412
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,800
um

413
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,600
you know even before feminized seed

414
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:36,299
people started just releasing Elite

415
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,740
stuff in in hybrids only yeah because

416
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:40,379
they didn't want to give out the Pure

417
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:42,180
Line yeah they wanted to release it

418
00:16:40,379 --> 00:16:43,799
mixed and then femini started coming

419
00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:46,019
along like you said with Dutch Passion

420
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:48,359
but I don't think in America

421
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:50,339
it really started spreading to anybody

422
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,079
using it Mac can correct me he's way

423
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:55,500
more into it than I am on this one but

424
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:58,620
probably like 070809 era

425
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:01,379
yeah I think ocx070809 and a little bit

426
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:04,679
before with Hive obviously Hive was a

427
00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:06,959
big proponent of reversals and and doing

428
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:08,880
feminized seeds I know uh there were

429
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,339
people like golden eyes doing supposed

430
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,600
s1s of cuts that weren't I guess I

431
00:17:11,338 --> 00:17:15,720
should clarify

432
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:17,639
and is and say that like as feminized

433
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,558
seeds started hitting the market where

434
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,839
cannabis members you know cannabis

435
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:23,220
people could get access to them yeah I

436
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:25,139
think that there was some experiments

437
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,699
going on like and there was certain I'm

438
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,559
not going to say like before this date

439
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:29,880
no one was doing it because that would

440
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:31,859
be silly

441
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,140
um but as far as like a marketable thing

442
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:36,538
where people were you know selling

443
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:38,780
feminized seat yeah I think it was about

444
00:17:36,538 --> 00:17:41,339
that time like 06 and on but

445
00:17:38,779 --> 00:17:43,379
realistically like there was there was

446
00:17:41,339 --> 00:17:47,939
never a time up until the last few years

447
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:49,500
uh past five six seven years where you

448
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,940
weren't getting insulted to do it though

449
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,859
like you were looked at as like the

450
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:55,080
bastard child of the Cannabis industry

451
00:17:52,859 --> 00:17:58,139
for making those available oh I mean

452
00:17:55,079 --> 00:18:00,240
people would people would give uh Caleb

453
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:02,220
about a bunch of [ __ ] oh yeah good

454
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,259
friends would would [ __ ] with you or

455
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,819
with him or with whoever that you know

456
00:18:04,259 --> 00:18:08,519
that they were making feminized seed it

457
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:10,798
was cheating yeah it was just cheating

458
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:12,240
yeah it was like oh only the untalent to

459
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,519
do that that's the short that's the easy

460
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,620
shortcut anybody can do that it's

461
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:18,119
selecting the mail that that's that's

462
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:19,439
where the real breeding comes in that's

463
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:22,079
where the real so that was usually the

464
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,058
propaganda for it well it's not like

465
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:25,798
like most propaganda there's a pretty

466
00:18:24,058 --> 00:18:27,839
good amount of Truth in it

467
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:31,259
in the sense that when it comes to

468
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:35,339
selecting males it is hard oh sure uh

469
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:37,558
you know and um and but you know I don't

470
00:18:35,339 --> 00:18:39,178
think you know I used to joke with you

471
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:41,160
or whatever that like all my regular

472
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:43,740
breeding I never had a single failure

473
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:47,279
yeah because when you're using regular

474
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:49,319
males uh it's really hard to fail yeah

475
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:50,819
you know you can only you only need a

476
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:53,519
few of them and they produce a copious

477
00:18:50,819 --> 00:18:58,379
amount of pollen and you can heavily

478
00:18:53,519 --> 00:19:02,179
seed your entire room pretty easily yeah

479
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:06,000
um I've never had male failures so to me

480
00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:09,059
the the art of uh regular seed breeding

481
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,640
is like fans and a bamboo steak and

482
00:19:09,058 --> 00:19:14,519
beating the mail yeah or cutting the

483
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:17,780
mail off and shaking it above the plants

484
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:20,879
it's extremely basic and successful but

485
00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:23,279
as you know uh Matt can talk about at

486
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,799
length and some of our friends getting

487
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:30,599
the feminized process is a lot trickier

488
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:33,119
yes it's it's certainly uncertain in

489
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:35,519
terms of if it will work how many seeds

490
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:38,279
it will make how much pollen there is

491
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:40,679
there's a lot of the actual Act of

492
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:43,619
getting the for the the fertilization

493
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:45,600
happening yeah is is a lot more

494
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:47,219
difficult oh yeah and that's sort of

495
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:48,899
like the name of the game and there's a

496
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,460
lot of nuance and part of this show is

497
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:53,340
going to be Matt talking about some of

498
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:55,798
that Nuance yeah so let's talk about

499
00:19:53,339 --> 00:19:58,500
first why

500
00:19:55,798 --> 00:20:00,599
why feminize seeds why why would this be

501
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,099
a tool in any Breeder's tool belt what

502
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:03,899
what are the advantages what are the

503
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:05,519
disadvantages

504
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:09,059
um what are they

505
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:10,379
so first off a feminized seed is a seed

506
00:20:09,058 --> 00:20:13,440
made with

507
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:16,140
using only female pollen that has been

508
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,000
induced now technically you can induce

509
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:20,400
it many ways you can induce its stress

510
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,619
chemical

511
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,360
um or I mean even I guess that's it

512
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:26,159
stress or chemical because letting it

513
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:29,119
flower extra long is still the stress

514
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:31,320
kind of trait for it to throw those uh

515
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:33,058
I don't want to interrupt too much but

516
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:34,079
you could probably throw in genetic as

517
00:20:33,058 --> 00:20:36,058
well

518
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:37,980
yeah I mean there's some things like

519
00:20:36,058 --> 00:20:40,200
ties and some different strains that

520
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:42,298
seem to harm easily and often even when

521
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,160
happy oh yeah yeah that's true yeah

522
00:20:42,298 --> 00:20:47,400
intersex natural intersex plants

523
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:49,200
definitely yeah they exist yeah they

524
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,980
definitely exist in nature

525
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,679
um

526
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:54,960
and you know this trait exists in

527
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:56,759
cannabis originally because the main

528
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,360
goal of a cannabis plant isn't for us to

529
00:20:56,759 --> 00:21:02,160
smoke it like in its in its system its

530
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:05,819
main its main purpose is to make more

531
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:07,380
seeds and carry on its its genetics and

532
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:10,500
in doing so

533
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:12,660
somehow some way it has a

534
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:14,759
trait in it I don't know if that's a

535
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:17,640
correct word but it has the ability to

536
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:19,679
detect if there are males around it and

537
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,419
if not and it knows that it's going to

538
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,400
be dying soon or unable to make seeds

539
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:25,500
soon it will start making its own male

540
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,840
parts even with even if it's missing the

541
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,400
male chromosome it will use its

542
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:32,279
environment to manipulate its own

543
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:34,580
hormonal system and kick out

544
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:37,379
male parts to make

545
00:21:34,579 --> 00:21:40,259
essentially female only chromosomed

546
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:43,440
pollen so what you end up with in the

547
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:44,879
seeds is a single chromosome plant only

548
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,659
female

549
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:51,059
and that can look like two things uh

550
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:53,280
it can look like what we call you know

551
00:21:51,058 --> 00:21:55,440
our our general term for it in the

552
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:58,079
Cannabis industry is bananas

553
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:02,820
uh which are basically like little

554
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:06,538
yellow uh pollen sacs that pop out of

555
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:08,399
female bud right and they contain a

556
00:22:06,538 --> 00:22:09,960
small amount of pollen realistically

557
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,360
speaking but there can be many of them

558
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,980
and they like typical Panthers little

559
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:15,240
anthers and they just grow they just

560
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,740
grow they look like a little bit that's

561
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:20,519
why they get called bananas because

562
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:22,079
they're little yellow curved things yeah

563
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:24,058
um and that's the most common type of

564
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:26,699
hermaphrodite but there is also

565
00:22:24,058 --> 00:22:29,460
hermaphrodism where some part of the

566
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:33,240
plant or even out of a maturing female

567
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:36,360
flower you will get actual male

568
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:37,919
Parts growing yes and and when you do

569
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:39,178
reversals a lot of people don't realize

570
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,340
this until they actually perform it and

571
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:44,159
see it in person when you're spraying a

572
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:45,779
female plant when it turns when it

573
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,880
starts growing male parts it does not

574
00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:49,798
grow male parts like a male does like

575
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,659
we're used to seeing now in cannabis

576
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:54,240
when we have males we're used to seeing

577
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:56,520
the the the parts grow up in like the

578
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,220
elbows or armpits you know right there

579
00:22:56,519 --> 00:23:01,019
hang lower you know they they grow up

580
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:03,480
and hang lower that's not what happens

581
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:05,940
in a reversal it keeps the structure of

582
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,980
the female like a bud and groups the

583
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,120
flowers super tight the male part super

584
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:12,240
tight and balls so they don't

585
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:13,918
necessarily hang sometimes in a

586
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,599
successful reversal they'll kind of

587
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,400
extend and hang a little bit and droop

588
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:19,019
and so that it's very pretty you know

589
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,259
easy for it to drop pollen everywhere

590
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:23,819
but most of the time most of the time in

591
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:25,140
a reversal when you're using a chemical

592
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:28,259
reversal

593
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:29,940
it'll it'll be very hard for it to to

594
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:31,440
uncluster and a lot of times you'll need

595
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:33,058
to use tweezers and pick them out by

596
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,159
hand and shake the little pollen out in

597
00:23:33,058 --> 00:23:37,440
a baggie like it's there's a lot of

598
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:39,299
tedious uh things you have to do

599
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,120
sometimes to coax pollen out of a

600
00:23:39,298 --> 00:23:43,798
reversed uh female because of the way

601
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:46,139
the bud structure is much different than

602
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:49,019
a male

603
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:51,120
yeah I mean it uh

604
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:53,099
uh

605
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:55,619
I almost think of it like as the flowers

606
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:58,439
pack so tight that they can't open up

607
00:23:55,619 --> 00:24:01,199
yeah and drop pollen the right way they

608
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:03,179
can't mature it doesn't seems like from

609
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,000
my conversations with Matt and other

610
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:08,940
friends of ours it does seem to me like

611
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,279
over the next decades or so we probably

612
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:14,480
will continue to learn a lot more about

613
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:17,220
how to successfully reverse cannabis

614
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,480
cannabis obviously since feminized seed

615
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,100
are the most common way that people

616
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,038
breed now people have had a lot of

617
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:25,379
success with it but it is very Hit or

618
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:29,339
Miss very inconsistent failures are

619
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:31,200
common and even successful

620
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:33,359
um successful can be anything from like

621
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,179
a light dusting a pollen that you get a

622
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:37,918
few seeds to a heavily seeded room where

623
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:40,259
you're extremely happy at the number of

624
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,780
seeds that you got or anything in

625
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:44,038
between really and and the one thing to

626
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:45,839
note and a lot of people don't

627
00:24:44,038 --> 00:24:47,640
understand and I'm going to cover this a

628
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:49,379
little bit more in depth later but one

629
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,480
of the reasons why you'll see feminized

630
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:53,100
seeds tend to cost more is because even

631
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,659
when you have those like extreme

632
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:56,639
successes where it seems to get you a

633
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:58,500
lot of seeds it's always less than you

634
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,538
would get from a male always always

635
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:03,179
you'd never get as much pollen from a

636
00:25:00,538 --> 00:25:05,158
reverse plant as you would a male

637
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:06,360
so that's super important you know like

638
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:08,280
a lot of people always say why are they

639
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:10,798
more expensive I don't get it it's the

640
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:13,859
failure and it's the amount of seeds you

641
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:17,579
get yeah I mean even you know just to

642
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:20,759
use an example I think when uh when CSI

643
00:25:17,579 --> 00:25:24,178
reversed the the triangle

644
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:26,700
um he failed twice yeah and then he used

645
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:29,640
he used one specific spray and had

646
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:31,740
success but he only got about 10 or 15

647
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,080
percent of the volume of seeds that he

648
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:36,538
would normally expect on a well done

649
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:38,278
reversal yeah and we've had other

650
00:25:36,538 --> 00:25:39,538
friends of ours

651
00:25:38,278 --> 00:25:42,058
um you know our buddy pip or whatever

652
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:44,879
that reversed uh his Sour Diesel cut

653
00:25:42,058 --> 00:25:47,158
yeah um and he never even got a salable

654
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,860
amount of seed yeah exactly he would get

655
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:52,620
he got a few dozen you know 50 or you

656
00:25:49,859 --> 00:25:54,599
know or whatever you know whatever

657
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:56,519
um so sometimes it can be essentially a

658
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:59,278
failure yeah

659
00:25:56,519 --> 00:26:01,740
um you know and and then you go you go

660
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:04,798
you go hunt through a bunch of weed uh

661
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:07,140
and you find a few dozen seats yeah

662
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:10,259
and that's it so it can be pretty

663
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:13,400
frustrating in that regard uh

664
00:26:10,259 --> 00:26:16,140
where is it there we go okay so

665
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:18,659
essentially the why why would you make

666
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:21,840
femini seeds one if you want to have a

667
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:24,659
pure version of a of a specific line

668
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:26,099
let's say you have a deep chunk but you

669
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:28,020
don't have any males at the Deep chunk

670
00:26:26,099 --> 00:26:29,579
and you want to make you want to have a

671
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:31,859
pure seed line of deep chunk and all you

672
00:26:29,579 --> 00:26:34,139
have left is one deep chunk clone you

673
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:35,519
have no access to any males at that

674
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:37,740
point you could either hybridize it

675
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:40,379
bring in outside genetic material of

676
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:42,298
male and cross it and then take the

677
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:44,640
generations forward and select towards

678
00:26:42,298 --> 00:26:46,259
the Deep chunk or you could reverse

679
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,179
another deep chunk or you could take a

680
00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:50,339
clone of the same deep chunk reverse

681
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:52,380
that onto another clone of that same

682
00:26:50,339 --> 00:26:53,819
deep chunk and make seeds with that and

683
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:56,039
it would be pure deep chunk and this

684
00:26:53,819 --> 00:26:58,619
time all the work going forward has

685
00:26:56,038 --> 00:27:00,658
already been done as far as making it

686
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:01,439
purely deep chunk and look deep chunk

687
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:03,299
and

688
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,679
Etc so it's great for having a really

689
00:27:03,298 --> 00:27:07,259
pure seed line

690
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:08,880
um it's great for people who especially

691
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:10,798
when a lot of people when I see them buy

692
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,480
femini seeds they tend to be buying

693
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:14,400
feminized seeds because they have a

694
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,079
plant count in whatever state or country

695
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,640
that they're in and they can only have

696
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:20,519
so many things growing and they can't

697
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:23,340
afford to keep using pots container

698
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:25,679
space light and the money electricity on

699
00:27:23,339 --> 00:27:28,319
males they can't keep you know building

700
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,880
up a nice even canopy if they're

701
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:31,558
constantly yanking males out and having

702
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,900
to replace those with a new seedling and

703
00:27:31,558 --> 00:27:35,579
popping it hoping the same thing so in a

704
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,440
lot of cases feminized seeds do real

705
00:27:35,579 --> 00:27:39,000
well especially in Europe early on it

706
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,220
was really popular because there are a

707
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,019
lot of smaller apartment and house grows

708
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:44,038
there

709
00:27:42,019 --> 00:27:47,400
with the

710
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:50,099
open the open market of of the hemp

711
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:52,798
industry we've seen feminized seeds and

712
00:27:50,099 --> 00:27:55,019
auto flowering stuff really take hold in

713
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:56,460
that market as well I mean autoflowering

714
00:27:55,019 --> 00:27:58,139
has always kind of been looked down by

715
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:00,058
on by breeders

716
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:02,520
um mainly because there was a lot of

717
00:28:00,058 --> 00:28:04,980
problems getting good ruderalis hybrids

718
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:07,019
out there uh early on nowadays there are

719
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:08,700
companies that supposedly do a really

720
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:10,500
good job with it and I I haven't tried

721
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:13,319
any but I'm sure they do much better

722
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:15,480
than we used to back in the day but the

723
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:18,480
feminized thing is is definitely a

724
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:20,819
staple since the hemp times people are

725
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,500
are definitely I think it's becoming

726
00:28:20,819 --> 00:28:24,538
more comfortable in America ever since

727
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,099
the hemp Market opened that people are

728
00:28:24,538 --> 00:28:28,619
more comfortable talking about buying

729
00:28:26,099 --> 00:28:30,480
femini seeds and trying to get the real

730
00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:32,879
science behind it now as opposed to even

731
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,798
five six years ago

732
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,260
you know you could also say too that

733
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:39,359
like on a commercial level

734
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:41,400
um you know when you start growing Acres

735
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:44,939
of of weed of any kind

736
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:48,659
uh if you have you know you you end up

737
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:51,360
having to hunt a lot for males yeah two

738
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:53,580
you know yeah

739
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:55,979
it's really hard to get people to keep

740
00:28:53,579 --> 00:28:58,558
mail stock for you like let's say you're

741
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:59,640
moving houses or moving rooms and you

742
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:00,839
know your friends offer to keep your

743
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,059
clones for you and you want to get them

744
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:04,678
back it's really hard for for people to

745
00:29:03,058 --> 00:29:06,058
be like yeah I'll take that mail for you

746
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:07,620
no problem because nobody really wants

747
00:29:06,058 --> 00:29:09,899
males kicking in their room taking up

748
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:12,839
space possibly pollinating their their

749
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:15,360
flower so there's a lot of advantages to

750
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:17,099
having this uh this tool in your tool

751
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:19,678
belt I mean as a collector it's hard

752
00:29:17,099 --> 00:29:21,898
enough to get people to back up uh

753
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:25,019
females you love that aren't currently

754
00:29:21,898 --> 00:29:28,379
popular yeah definitely much less a male

755
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:30,480
that they're never going to bloom yeah

756
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:32,039
so that that kind of breaks down the why

757
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,538
I mean I think that kind of covers it

758
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:36,000
unless you have anything else on the why

759
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:37,740
I had a little bit of color to what you

760
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,980
said you know when Matt was talking

761
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:43,140
about selfing and s1s I would say that

762
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:46,319
the vast majority of Elites that we have

763
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:49,380
out there in the Cannabis space today

764
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:52,558
um are not lines anymore they're

765
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:55,740
specific clones yeah and so one of the

766
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:59,819
Cool Tools about it is

767
00:29:55,740 --> 00:30:02,579
um it's not perfect uh but by selfing a

768
00:29:59,819 --> 00:30:05,158
a you know clone only if you were you

769
00:30:02,579 --> 00:30:07,379
can get an idea of what else might be in

770
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:09,659
there and

771
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:12,299
that can tell you a lot about the line

772
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:16,140
yeah is it does it have a lot of

773
00:30:12,298 --> 00:30:17,879
diversity in it is it pretty narrow

774
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:20,100
um you know like what kind of traits

775
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:23,100
does it tend to pop so it's it's

776
00:30:20,099 --> 00:30:25,199
imperfect but in a lot of cases from old

777
00:30:23,099 --> 00:30:28,139
Elite cuts that have been held from the

778
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,179
90s or the 2000s it's our only way to

779
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:32,399
get a look at that line yeah because

780
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:34,620
there simply are no males in existence

781
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:37,259
that we know of there's no regular seed

782
00:30:34,619 --> 00:30:38,759
sitting out there so you only have the

783
00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:42,619
one example

784
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:45,898
of what that genetics holds yeah

785
00:30:42,619 --> 00:30:49,259
in that yeah and by outcrossing it

786
00:30:45,898 --> 00:30:52,259
you're never sure what's you know what

787
00:30:49,259 --> 00:30:54,298
the other plant influenced it yeah so it

788
00:30:52,259 --> 00:30:56,640
allow it allows you to like look within

789
00:30:54,298 --> 00:30:59,879
a line and you we draw a lot of

790
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,960
inferences now these days from what s1s

791
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,120
do

792
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,679
it tells us information about the mother

793
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:07,979
plant that we might not have otherwise

794
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:09,960
had yeah but I think it's important for

795
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:13,019
people to know uh and I think Matt would

796
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:16,319
probably agree here that consistency

797
00:31:13,019 --> 00:31:18,599
usually comes from outcrosses

798
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:20,939
um you're gonna get whack and weird [ __ ]

799
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:22,319
in most s1s yeah because it is

800
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:24,058
inbreeding

801
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:26,538
um so you can you you have a much better

802
00:31:24,058 --> 00:31:28,918
chance with s1s of looking for

803
00:31:26,538 --> 00:31:31,200
individual plants you want to keep as

804
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:33,179
new moms that might be amazing

805
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,659
but the consistency might be all over

806
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:38,460
the board yeah I mean you get high high

807
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:40,140
highs and low lows I think is the best

808
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:42,600
way to put it yeah you could get more

809
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:44,100
junk you could get more hermaphrodism

810
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:46,259
than normal

811
00:31:44,099 --> 00:31:49,798
um so out crosses using feminized seed

812
00:31:46,259 --> 00:31:51,839
or more stable but s1s give you a

813
00:31:49,798 --> 00:31:52,980
glimpse into a line that might be your

814
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:55,579
only way

815
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:58,919
and and it's important to note that like

816
00:31:55,579 --> 00:32:01,678
s1s might give you more uh the high

817
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:04,140
highs and low lows but taking the just a

818
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,759
single generation further whereas in the

819
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:07,759
F1 generation it taking it another

820
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:11,879
generation further makes it more diverse

821
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:13,500
with S2s usually it tightens a lineup if

822
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,419
you're bringing correctly it tightens a

823
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:18,720
lineup you know

824
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:21,000
um and and and so on S3 even more tight

825
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,919
even more tight it breaks true to tight

826
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,140
essentially when you're doing further

827
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:27,120
generations of selfie and then you can

828
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:28,860
also the more generations of selfing

829
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:31,079
sometimes you know they talk about

830
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:33,658
plants getting weaker or unhappier

831
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:36,119
because what happens is is there are

832
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:39,179
experiences where the more you self

833
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:41,879
something the deeper you go uh the more

834
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:46,259
undesirable recessive start popping up

835
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:48,360
yeah two yeah so it's a tool and it's a

836
00:32:46,259 --> 00:32:51,058
cool tool because for a lot most like I

837
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:53,398
said most old Elites we have one or two

838
00:32:51,058 --> 00:32:55,379
clones surviving and that's it

839
00:32:53,398 --> 00:32:57,719
yeah and it's a good way to keep those

840
00:32:55,380 --> 00:33:00,179
in a in a form that you can keep

841
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:02,159
reproducing and keep stored in a fridge

842
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:03,298
so even when you're you're down and

843
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,580
growing let's say you want to take a

844
00:33:03,298 --> 00:33:07,319
vacation you can at least re-access that

845
00:33:05,579 --> 00:33:08,699
genetic material even if it might not be

846
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:10,619
identical you can at least get that

847
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,880
genetic material again and if you pop

848
00:33:10,619 --> 00:33:13,918
enough you'll find something very

849
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:15,480
similar

850
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,038
so yeah that's pretty much the color

851
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,278
that I would add to it it's just not

852
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:23,158
right so that was the why the why femini

853
00:33:20,278 --> 00:33:25,740
seeds we went over the what they are uh

854
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:27,778
simply simply put it to breaking down or

855
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:29,579
it's a blocking of ethylene when you're

856
00:33:27,778 --> 00:33:31,380
reversing a female you want to block the

857
00:33:29,579 --> 00:33:32,879
ethylene so that the gibralin flows

858
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:34,860
through freely

859
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,140
um on the flip side when you want to

860
00:33:34,859 --> 00:33:39,719
reverse a male you wouldn't use the same

861
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:41,820
product or chemicals that you would to

862
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:44,159
reverse a female if you're reversing a

863
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:46,379
male and people do do this

864
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:49,080
um you would use something like uh you

865
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:51,120
you want to block the jabrelle and spray

866
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:53,158
ethylene you know give it a little more

867
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:55,139
ethylene which is like ethathon or

868
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:56,700
floral if people are actually looking

869
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:59,519
down that road

870
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:01,740
so what I would say when it comes to

871
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:04,200
feminizing when people first ask me what

872
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:06,298
to do I'd say step one you procure a

873
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,980
recipe earlier we talked about the the

874
00:34:06,298 --> 00:34:10,559
recipe that I referred to as vet's

875
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:14,579
recipe but someone else wrote it which

876
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:18,418
again is the five grams to two was it or

877
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:20,338
0.5 grams to 2.5 grams uh silver to

878
00:34:18,418 --> 00:34:23,039
sodium thiosulfate that's the old recipe

879
00:34:20,338 --> 00:34:25,679
and that works it may not be the most

880
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:27,358
effective recipe any longer but it will

881
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,280
work so if you're if you're short on

882
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:31,559
funds any of that

883
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,359
that works you can get those chemicals

884
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:35,759
fairly affordably

885
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:38,219
um and and remember when you do make the

886
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,379
stock solution using that recipe always

887
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:42,418
keep your stock solution and that is the

888
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:44,219
undiluted mixture in the fridge until

889
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:46,440
ready to mix and spray this ensures a

890
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:47,939
long stable shelf life also if your

891
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,559
spray has been sitting longer than two

892
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:51,659
weeks it's imperative that you shake it

893
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:53,519
like you mean it aggressively shake and

894
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:55,019
mix that silver around in some bottles

895
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:58,259
that can cling to the surface of the

896
00:34:55,019 --> 00:34:59,699
plastic this is expected expected and an

897
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,380
active amount is adjusted to account for

898
00:34:59,699 --> 00:35:03,539
the average amount lost from sitting if

899
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:04,980
you're using the the right reversal

900
00:35:03,539 --> 00:35:07,139
spray but if you're making it from your

901
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:08,460
own keep that in mind when you store it

902
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:11,039
when it sits in the stock solution

903
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:13,800
bottles silver will build up and not

904
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:15,119
come off very well off the sides even if

905
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,619
you do mix it there's there's a certain

906
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,019
amount of loss so you want to adjust for

907
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:21,240
that uh the planning session here's

908
00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:22,500
here's where it gets fun what do I want

909
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:24,479
to reverse

910
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,559
what plant do I want to receive the

911
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,539
pollen

912
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:30,119
how do we beat the odds of sterile

913
00:35:27,539 --> 00:35:32,400
reversals and is everything introduced

914
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:33,720
to the same room all at once these are

915
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,338
all things to think about when you're

916
00:35:33,719 --> 00:35:37,319
building your plan for doing your first

917
00:35:35,338 --> 00:35:39,599
reversal am I going to do it in a tent

918
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:41,160
am I going to do it in a big open field

919
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,019
is this going to be outside is it going

920
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:44,879
to be inside all these are super super

921
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:47,820
important to know

922
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:50,338
um so what plant do I want to reverse uh

923
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:53,160
let's let's pick one for example not so

924
00:35:50,338 --> 00:35:56,578
let's say we are going to reverse the LA

925
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:58,739
Kush the headband La Kush

926
00:35:56,579 --> 00:36:00,660
we want to reverse that

927
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:02,159
what plant do we want to receive the

928
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:04,618
pollen

929
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:07,858
do we want to make s1s do we want to be

930
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:10,079
hybrid I would I would say

931
00:36:07,858 --> 00:36:12,779
you know obviously it like depends on

932
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:15,300
people's personal goals sure but I would

933
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:17,760
say like most people

934
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:20,039
um want to make some amount of s1s yeah

935
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,320
to trap the Clone only in a seed line

936
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:25,858
that's not contaminated by external

937
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:29,220
external genes yeah and then

938
00:36:25,858 --> 00:36:31,980
it usually is a combination of Crossing

939
00:36:29,219 --> 00:36:34,199
it to other clones you like a lot yeah

940
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:36,838
uh or other clones that are currently

941
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:40,259
popular that you think will hit a market

942
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:43,199
I guess yeah those are probably I I saw

943
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:46,079
a question someone asked um and this is

944
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:49,319
a good question is an S is an S1 a

945
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:53,280
reversal technically yes and no

946
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:56,400
um all reversals are not all s1s

947
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,320
uh F that we refer to like if you're

948
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,480
hybridizing something let's so in this

949
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,338
example let's say you're reversing chemd

950
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,139
onto the LA Kush it's still going to be

951
00:37:02,338 --> 00:37:07,500
feminized but it's not considered a

952
00:37:04,139 --> 00:37:09,239
self-line it's considered an F1 reversal

953
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:11,460
so that's that's the way we refer to it

954
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:13,319
so I just wanted to point that out I'm

955
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:15,179
not sure if that's the the actual answer

956
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,500
to the question we had but I know that's

957
00:37:15,179 --> 00:37:19,199
one thing that a lot of people confuse

958
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:21,480
and call like f like F1 hybrids of

959
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:23,819
reversals they refer to them as s1s and

960
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:26,219
that's not quite correct it's not it is

961
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:27,838
a selfie it's a you're reversing the

962
00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:30,480
plant but it's not selfing it or

963
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:32,940
pollinating itself and just so people

964
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,380
know I can't see comments in this yet we

965
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:36,059
haven't figured that out so if you don't

966
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:39,838
get your question answered it's Matt's

967
00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:42,000
fault entirely yeah and R1 is uh R1 is

968
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:43,320
for recombinant genetics and that is

969
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,980
something that we are not even

970
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:48,900
discussing right now so no it's not R1

971
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:51,119
um see how do we beat the odds of

972
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,380
sterile reversals so this is the one

973
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,780
thing that I talk about when I talk

974
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:58,200
about reversals me and CSI probably

975
00:37:54,780 --> 00:38:00,079
spend more hours discussing uh reversals

976
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:04,439
than anything else that we talk about

977
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:07,200
trying to beat the odds of of when a

978
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:10,380
plant will reverse all plants do reverse

979
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:12,239
not all plants drop pollen and even that

980
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:15,780
said I'm speaking very generally when I

981
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:17,459
did that um 3 000 plant reversal I

982
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:19,320
remember there were two plants in a hemp

983
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,820
field that didn't even reverse they just

984
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:23,519
stayed there in normal sacks they were

985
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:25,859
they were they just were not chemically

986
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:29,039
able at that rate and it was a high rate

987
00:38:25,858 --> 00:38:31,078
to reverse so it is possible that plants

988
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:33,239
will not reverse but very very rare two

989
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:34,920
in three thousand plants if that gives

990
00:38:33,239 --> 00:38:36,539
you an idea of how rare and that was in

991
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,800
hemp as well

992
00:38:36,539 --> 00:38:40,259
um

993
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:42,599
where was I at how do we beat the odds

994
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:45,300
of sterile reversal so what we figured

995
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:47,280
out was maybe reversing one plant and

996
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:49,619
rolling all the dice on one plant one

997
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:53,460
big plant to produce a lot of pollen

998
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:56,220
isn't the idea maybe it was smaller

999
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:57,780
plants and more of them and that's how

1000
00:38:56,219 --> 00:39:00,838
we started beating the odds and getting

1001
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:03,599
reversals to to be to be more

1002
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:06,960
predictable you know instead of a a

1003
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:09,059
single plant in a five gallon pot taking

1004
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,579
up you know a whole light reversing it

1005
00:39:09,059 --> 00:39:15,480
and failing if we put

1006
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:18,119
you know 50 clones in a bunch of small

1007
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:20,699
pots in a single section under a single

1008
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:23,280
light reverse all of them the odds say

1009
00:39:20,699 --> 00:39:25,439
you're bound to get it to happen so

1010
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,960
um that's that's really how we beat the

1011
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,760
odds numbers beat the odds

1012
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:32,099
maybe I could throw in something that

1013
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,240
I've noticed and it pretty much comes

1014
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:36,240
when

1015
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:38,219
I've ever asked Matt or CSI or anybody

1016
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:41,039
else that does a bunch of reversals as

1017
00:39:38,219 --> 00:39:44,759
far as like what uh what the methods are

1018
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:47,639
and what's frustrating about it is that

1019
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:49,619
to me it seems like they can get a very

1020
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:51,960
successful reversal

1021
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:53,700
uh on a string and they can go to make

1022
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,740
those same seeds again and they can do

1023
00:39:53,699 --> 00:39:58,379
everything measured out exactly the same

1024
00:39:55,739 --> 00:40:01,259
that they did before and get a different

1025
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:02,760
result yeah um and so sometimes they'll

1026
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:05,160
have a situation where they'll have like

1027
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:07,740
10 plants that they're reversing and

1028
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:09,659
like you know they started doing more

1029
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:12,000
numbers just because a couple of them

1030
00:40:09,659 --> 00:40:13,799
will fail some of them will partially do

1031
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,838
it and then this many will actually

1032
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:18,000
successfully do it and throw off x

1033
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:19,920
amount of pollen and these are plants

1034
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,599
all within the same tiny little micro

1035
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,880
climate too if people don't understand

1036
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:26,460
this like it we really don't understand

1037
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:28,680
why like if it's the angle of light

1038
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:32,159
Changed by x amount like they're all

1039
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:34,019
getting the same amount of spray it's so

1040
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:36,539
similar everything's so similar the same

1041
00:40:34,019 --> 00:40:39,838
feed and sometimes it'll just be that

1042
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:41,358
some do and some don't so you could in a

1043
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:43,799
in a situation that I'm familiar with

1044
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:45,719
regular seed breeding I could put a

1045
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,880
couple of males of the same thing into a

1046
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:50,759
room yeah and be guaranteed that they

1047
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:54,300
would produce enough pollen to uh

1048
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:56,460
pollinate the entire room yeah but you

1049
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:58,740
know these they've developed an enormous

1050
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:00,539
amount of strategies

1051
00:40:58,739 --> 00:41:02,219
in order to get enough pollen to

1052
00:41:00,539 --> 00:41:05,039
pollinate the room so it's not a failure

1053
00:41:02,219 --> 00:41:07,379
yeah I mean every single failure is is

1054
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:09,539
very expensive and uh shout out to AJ

1055
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:11,820
Gucci our very first Super Chat ever

1056
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:13,259
since we've been monetize on YouTube so

1057
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:16,980
thanks a lot man thanks for the five

1058
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:19,680
bucks uh we really appreciate it

1059
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:21,539
all right so now the the next question

1060
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:23,219
and this is probably where it gets the

1061
00:41:21,539 --> 00:41:26,400
most complicated is everything

1062
00:41:23,219 --> 00:41:27,659
introduced all at once so here's the

1063
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:31,320
scenario

1064
00:41:27,659 --> 00:41:34,618
we've got 3 000 plants of hemp Kush that

1065
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:36,900
we're reversing onto 13 000 plants all

1066
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:39,358
right so the reason that that I would do

1067
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:40,740
choose that many is because of the

1068
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:43,019
ratios we want to make sure we have

1069
00:41:40,739 --> 00:41:44,578
enough pollen to do it and

1070
00:41:43,019 --> 00:41:46,679
um in this situation this hypothetical

1071
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:48,119
situation attempt and one thing I've

1072
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:49,679
learned with hemp which is very

1073
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:52,079
different from my experience in cannabis

1074
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:54,239
is that there's no staggering when

1075
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:57,359
you're introducing everything to be

1076
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:59,879
pollinated so in this scenario with hemp

1077
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:02,460
in this big reversal light did we

1078
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:04,500
started by reversing

1079
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:07,740
I want to say

1080
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:10,320
a thousand plants first the first week

1081
00:42:07,739 --> 00:42:13,139
and then two weeks later we started

1082
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:14,880
reversing another thousand and then a

1083
00:42:13,139 --> 00:42:17,279
half a week later we started the last

1084
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:20,220
thousand

1085
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,680
and at that at that last week that last

1086
00:42:20,219 --> 00:42:24,299
half week we introduced all the females

1087
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:26,399
because usually there's about a two and

1088
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:27,720
a half week stagger between when you

1089
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,820
start reversing the plants and

1090
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:31,980
initiating into flour the ones that are

1091
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:33,480
going to make the pollen and it's

1092
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:34,920
usually about two and a half two to two

1093
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,900
and a half weeks before you introduce

1094
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,039
the the females that are going to catch

1095
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:40,680
the pollen

1096
00:42:38,039 --> 00:42:43,139
but in the hemp reversal

1097
00:42:40,679 --> 00:42:44,460
it started going off almost immediately

1098
00:42:43,139 --> 00:42:47,159
upon

1099
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:48,659
flour which is it It reversed so fast

1100
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:51,179
usually it takes

1101
00:42:48,659 --> 00:42:56,879
three and a half to four weeks so we're

1102
00:42:51,179 --> 00:42:58,259
talking 24 to 28 days to see balls and

1103
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,119
not even not even to begin to drop

1104
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:01,859
pollen but just to see balls three and

1105
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:03,720
after four weeks however with this hemp

1106
00:43:01,858 --> 00:43:06,960
reversal in three and a half weeks they

1107
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:09,719
were dropping pollen so the answer to Is

1108
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:12,480
Everything introduced all at once is it

1109
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:16,019
depends know the plants you're working

1110
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:17,639
with I always recommend if this is a Do

1111
00:43:16,019 --> 00:43:19,619
or Die scenario

1112
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:22,039
make sure you know this plant and have

1113
00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:24,720
done test reversals and all that because

1114
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:27,380
you can lose a lot of money gambling on

1115
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:27,379
a regular service

1116
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:34,440
okay let's see uh this is me talking

1117
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:37,859
about the three to five four weeks um

1118
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:39,900
and then okay so with our spray uh

1119
00:43:37,858 --> 00:43:41,519
there's two different instructions

1120
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:44,700
um and and this is this is going to be

1121
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:46,559
with any kind of SDS base you can choose

1122
00:43:44,699 --> 00:43:48,838
to spray daily

1123
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:51,059
which is you know once a day you can

1124
00:43:48,838 --> 00:43:54,119
choose to spray once a week

1125
00:43:51,059 --> 00:43:56,338
you can choose to spray once now

1126
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:58,559
I'd never recommend spraying once on the

1127
00:43:56,338 --> 00:44:00,239
first time because it's Hit or Miss but

1128
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:01,858
the reason I I impressed that you can

1129
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:03,419
you can spray once and have a reversal

1130
00:44:01,858 --> 00:44:05,098
is because a lot of times people will

1131
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:07,079
practice this in a room and they only

1132
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:08,460
want to reverse one plant and they're

1133
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:09,960
spraying it and they're not seeing all

1134
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:11,639
the overspray going on all their other

1135
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:13,019
plants and all of a sudden they've got

1136
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:14,519
like five or six strains that they're

1137
00:44:13,019 --> 00:44:16,980
reversing and they only had overspray

1138
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:20,159
once but it only takes once to flip a

1139
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:22,139
plant sometimes but there is no set

1140
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:25,139
recommendation sometimes doing it once a

1141
00:44:22,139 --> 00:44:27,539
week works better than doing it once a

1142
00:44:25,139 --> 00:44:29,460
day sometimes once a day is too much and

1143
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:31,199
causes cluster too hard it's just too

1144
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:32,099
much of the hormone

1145
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:35,098
um

1146
00:44:32,099 --> 00:44:37,800
so it really depends it's everything is

1147
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:40,200
very very variant with this it takes a

1148
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:42,300
lot of work to find that sweet spot and

1149
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:44,338
every single clone and and every single

1150
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:46,440
time you use every single clone is a

1151
00:44:44,338 --> 00:44:48,719
different experience

1152
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,400
um and when you're spraying we're less

1153
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:52,739
concerned with covering every leaf we're

1154
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:55,559
more concerned with hitting the nodes so

1155
00:44:52,739 --> 00:44:57,419
the armpits elbows all that that's where

1156
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:59,159
we want to spray we don't necessarily

1157
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:01,260
need to spray all over the leaves that's

1158
00:44:59,159 --> 00:45:04,139
kind of a waste of the spray it mainly

1159
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:05,520
needs it in the nodes and we also

1160
00:45:04,139 --> 00:45:07,739
recommend keeping as much of the spray

1161
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:10,019
and stock solution form as you can and

1162
00:45:07,739 --> 00:45:13,439
only mixing exactly what you need uh

1163
00:45:10,019 --> 00:45:16,079
Refrigeration is everything so yeah

1164
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:18,420
um when you spray okay one thing I

1165
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:21,599
should mention uh because Matt hasn't

1166
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:24,300
yet is as far as I'm aware

1167
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:26,338
um you know the plant doesn't like the

1168
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:28,079
spray that much

1169
00:45:26,338 --> 00:45:30,599
um and so especially if you want to go

1170
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:33,660
with like a single spray or you know or

1171
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:35,579
a couple strong sprays and that's it

1172
00:45:33,659 --> 00:45:38,420
um you could definitely think that you

1173
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:38,420
hurt your plant

1174
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:43,079
um because it while you are going to you

1175
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:47,460
know hopefully your goal is to

1176
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:49,260
successfully induce uh male flowers

1177
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:52,318
um but the process to get there can be a

1178
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:53,940
little rough yeah absolutely

1179
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:56,039
um and also when you start spraying it

1180
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:57,659
it immediately stops stretch that's when

1181
00:45:56,039 --> 00:45:59,159
the thing to to consider too because a

1182
00:45:57,659 --> 00:46:01,019
lot of people are like well you know I'm

1183
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:02,759
gonna flip it now and then it'll stretch

1184
00:46:01,019 --> 00:46:04,920
x amount I'll expect it to be this big

1185
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:07,140
by the time I'm done spraying when you

1186
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:09,000
start spraying it immediately starts

1187
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:12,059
squatting making that plant stretch just

1188
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,559
gets really slow it doesn't it kills

1189
00:46:12,059 --> 00:46:16,440
stretch quite a bit so keep that in mind

1190
00:46:13,559 --> 00:46:18,119
for height for space requirement for how

1191
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:20,039
big you want the plant to be when it

1192
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:21,780
starts dropping pollen keep that in mind

1193
00:46:20,039 --> 00:46:25,039
you want it to be as big as it's going

1194
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:25,040
to be before you start spraying

1195
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:29,099
and yeah I think this is

1196
00:46:27,059 --> 00:46:31,799
um I think that's a that covers the

1197
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:33,000
presentation uh scroogeston asked does

1198
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,260
the spray you have made have to be put

1199
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,699
back in the fridge every day in between

1200
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:37,619
sprays or just make enough for each day

1201
00:46:35,699 --> 00:46:39,659
like I said in the presentation

1202
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:41,460
um stocks keeper stock Solution by

1203
00:46:39,659 --> 00:46:43,858
itself make enough for each spray always

1204
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:46,039
keep the stock solution in the fridge

1205
00:46:43,858 --> 00:46:48,598
um you don't really need to put the the

1206
00:46:46,039 --> 00:46:50,579
dilute solution in the fridge as long as

1207
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:52,740
you use it within the next few weeks but

1208
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:54,660
the stock solution can last as long as I

1209
00:46:52,739 --> 00:46:56,279
mean we've had people use keep it four

1210
00:46:54,659 --> 00:46:57,358
years and use it and it's totally fine

1211
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,940
as long as they kept it in the fridge

1212
00:46:57,358 --> 00:47:01,500
and mixed it well afterwards so it has a

1213
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:03,900
long shelf life if you if you give it

1214
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:06,780
love and there's some mystery to it too

1215
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:08,880
in the sense that um Matt's offering up

1216
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:11,040
the standard spray

1217
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:14,460
um Matt has a spray himself that he that

1218
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:15,599
he offers that's his own tweaks on it

1219
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:18,000
um there's there's a couple other

1220
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:20,940
gentlemen that do it too and strangely

1221
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,139
it seems like uh with mats and other

1222
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:25,500
people's

1223
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:27,299
um sometimes that one that one type the

1224
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:29,639
spray seems to be the winner for a

1225
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:31,380
specific reversal yeah

1226
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:32,879
um so the only time I've ever heard of

1227
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:35,338
anybody having any trouble was with

1228
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:37,980
triangle and literally what we found is

1229
00:47:35,338 --> 00:47:40,559
you have to kill it you have to kill it

1230
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:43,079
to get it to reverse like it is almost

1231
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:45,599
dead before you reverse it so one thing

1232
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:47,160
that I've learned is the one spray that

1233
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:48,960
was being used

1234
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:53,159
was very

1235
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:57,119
phototoxic right it's very phototoxic

1236
00:47:53,159 --> 00:47:59,578
that's usually a sign of of no sodium

1237
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:02,220
thiosulfate and strong silver nitrate so

1238
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:04,740
you so it might be that whatever the

1239
00:48:02,219 --> 00:48:07,139
sodium thiosulfate was doing uh was

1240
00:48:04,739 --> 00:48:08,578
inhibiting how much the the silver

1241
00:48:07,139 --> 00:48:10,139
nitrate was actually getting in the

1242
00:48:08,579 --> 00:48:12,000
plant even though it's damaging it it

1243
00:48:10,139 --> 00:48:13,679
wanted more and more and more and

1244
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,659
thicker you know but you can always

1245
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:17,159
adjust your spray ratios to to

1246
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:19,078
compensate for that and some of you

1247
00:48:17,159 --> 00:48:20,699
could play with that play with the spray

1248
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:23,099
you don't necessarily need sodium

1249
00:48:20,699 --> 00:48:25,500
thiosulfate to accomplish it I mean

1250
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:28,500
silver nitrate reverses just fine on its

1251
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:30,119
own it does really burn plants it really

1252
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,679
hurts them but sometimes that's

1253
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:33,240
necessary like the plants that we

1254
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:34,379
reverse we're not worried about how

1255
00:48:33,239 --> 00:48:35,519
pretty they are or how pretty they're

1256
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:37,140
going to look or how much resin they're

1257
00:48:35,519 --> 00:48:39,480
going to throw we're only worried about

1258
00:48:37,139 --> 00:48:41,219
pollen and a lot of times that means a

1259
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:43,199
really ugly burn-up plant to get to that

1260
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:45,059
part so keep that in mind

1261
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:46,379
that's very helpful because a lot of

1262
00:48:45,059 --> 00:48:48,779
people I think would look at it and be

1263
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:50,099
like oh what did I do yeah you know like

1264
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:53,099
it's supposed to reverse and stay

1265
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:55,619
gorgeous looking yeah

1266
00:48:53,099 --> 00:48:57,900
so the the number one question that we

1267
00:48:55,619 --> 00:48:59,039
get are feminized seeds more likely to

1268
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,240
hurt

1269
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:03,059
no

1270
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:05,818
and yes and no

1271
00:49:03,059 --> 00:49:07,380
is the answer again everything varies

1272
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:08,940
if the breeder is using a clone that

1273
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:10,980
tends to be sexually stable even in

1274
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:13,380
highly stressful situations the chance

1275
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:15,420
of intersex traits will not be increased

1276
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:16,858
with that said If a person makes seeds

1277
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:18,720
whether regular feminized with a

1278
00:49:16,858 --> 00:49:20,400
sexually unstable clone the likelihood

1279
00:49:18,719 --> 00:49:22,559
has increased that the resulting progeny

1280
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,180
will be intersex moral of the story know

1281
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:25,980
your seed maker not everyone making

1282
00:49:24,179 --> 00:49:28,318
seeds is a breeder

1283
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:31,980
and I'll just throw in my uh my

1284
00:49:28,318 --> 00:49:34,619
traditional take on Herms which is uh

1285
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:38,760
everyone complains about this one trait

1286
00:49:34,619 --> 00:49:41,099
but you know hermaphrodism uh is a very

1287
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:42,960
successful breeding method that the

1288
00:49:41,099 --> 00:49:45,359
plant has used for forever

1289
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:47,940
and we've decided to start breeding it

1290
00:49:45,358 --> 00:49:50,279
out in the last 20 or 30 years

1291
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:52,440
uh when people were growing seeded

1292
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:55,019
pounds from Colombia or Thailand or

1293
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:57,659
Panama or Mexico or wherever they didn't

1294
00:49:55,019 --> 00:49:59,639
care about hermaphrodites

1295
00:49:57,659 --> 00:50:01,440
um because their weed was seated anyway

1296
00:49:59,639 --> 00:50:03,900
yeah

1297
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:05,700
so I mean we can be thankful but at

1298
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,740
least there are companies like seed

1299
00:50:05,699 --> 00:50:09,539
flunky

1300
00:50:06,739 --> 00:50:11,639
and cookies bringing bringing Herms back

1301
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:13,619
into the gene pool with cookies so I'm

1302
00:50:11,639 --> 00:50:16,739
not saying it's desirable I'm just

1303
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:19,500
saying that it uh you know it's

1304
00:50:16,739 --> 00:50:23,059
misunderstood yeah but you can certainly

1305
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:25,739
breed towards it on accident yeah

1306
00:50:23,059 --> 00:50:27,539
I see people giving colloidal silver

1307
00:50:25,739 --> 00:50:30,179
recipes in there I don't recommend

1308
00:50:27,539 --> 00:50:31,858
colloidal silver to anyone it's been

1309
00:50:30,179 --> 00:50:34,559
scientifically proven that it's very

1310
00:50:31,858 --> 00:50:35,940
subparted to silver nitrate sodium

1311
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:38,159
thinosulfate

1312
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:39,420
um but you can try like if you can't you

1313
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:41,399
don't have access to silver nitrate

1314
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:44,039
there's a recipe it's I think it's put

1315
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:46,858
up in here 500 ppms

1316
00:50:44,039 --> 00:50:49,259
um for colloidal silver you know you can

1317
00:50:46,858 --> 00:50:51,119
try it at home I mean it silver is the

1318
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:52,619
action for for doing that there are

1319
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:54,599
other different chemicals you can use

1320
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:56,640
too there's one that we tried for a

1321
00:50:54,599 --> 00:50:58,920
little bit called retain

1322
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:00,239
um and you know there there are other

1323
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:02,039
methods of action that aren't silver

1324
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:03,419
based that are very effective but it's

1325
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:06,019
it's very complicated and super

1326
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:06,019
expensive

1327
00:51:07,318 --> 00:51:11,400
let's see

1328
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:12,660
trying to look for any uh new comments

1329
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:14,160
in here

1330
00:51:12,659 --> 00:51:16,618
um is it possible to get a male and

1331
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:19,500
feminized seeds we see that a lot

1332
00:51:16,619 --> 00:51:21,720
um for a long time I was I I admittedly

1333
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:23,818
was a big proponent of because I'd see

1334
00:51:21,719 --> 00:51:26,098
it I would see males and Femme seats pop

1335
00:51:23,818 --> 00:51:29,099
up every now and then some lines more

1336
00:51:26,099 --> 00:51:31,079
and over time

1337
00:51:29,099 --> 00:51:34,200
I I noticed that if people were having

1338
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:37,440
him tested they were coming out female

1339
00:51:34,199 --> 00:51:40,558
um so what it seems like is when you see

1340
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:43,019
a plant showing male parts from Femme

1341
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:45,240
seeds typically what you're seeing is a

1342
00:51:43,019 --> 00:51:47,338
plant that is expressing mail for

1343
00:51:45,239 --> 00:51:50,399
whatever reason

1344
00:51:47,338 --> 00:51:52,799
um it's not necessarily a male plant by

1345
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,780
chromosomal status but it is a plant

1346
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,700
showing male part so

1347
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:59,220
it's possible to see a plant show male

1348
00:51:56,699 --> 00:52:02,219
parts from feminine CTS and and only

1349
00:51:59,219 --> 00:52:02,818
showing only male and being truly you

1350
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:06,000
know

1351
00:52:02,818 --> 00:52:08,099
uh like not not very many female parts

1352
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:12,420
it is possible to see that

1353
00:52:08,099 --> 00:52:14,519
uh that's what seems like cannabis is uh

1354
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:17,880
for the most part pretty sexually fluid

1355
00:52:14,519 --> 00:52:20,159
yeah but it should be said

1356
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,940
um that there are some rare plants out

1357
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:25,259
there

1358
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:27,960
uh that will not reverse yeah

1359
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:30,599
um or they won't make pollen

1360
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:33,780
you know uh or if they do reverse and

1361
00:52:30,599 --> 00:52:36,000
make pollen their pollen is sterile

1362
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:39,300
so there's a whole Spectrum out there

1363
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:42,300
from failure just to reverse from it

1364
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:44,940
makes male flowers but not not actual

1365
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:47,760
pollen there's a whole range of like

1366
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:49,980
partial reversals we call them where

1367
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:53,099
like the physical reversal happens but

1368
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:55,019
what you're after active live pollen

1369
00:52:53,099 --> 00:52:57,119
grains that are capable of of

1370
00:52:55,019 --> 00:52:59,759
fertilizing and creating seed don't

1371
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:02,460
actually occur yeah

1372
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:05,700
and we've even had friends that you know

1373
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:07,920
in order to get 50 or 100 seeds they had

1374
00:53:05,699 --> 00:53:09,838
to take all the male flowers and grind

1375
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,760
them up through

1376
00:53:09,838 --> 00:53:14,880
um you know strainers and stuff to try

1377
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:18,619
to extract the few grains of pollen that

1378
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:18,619
actually existed yeah

1379
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:23,818
so yeah here's here's my final thoughts

1380
00:53:21,179 --> 00:53:24,838
on my little presentation I had uh I

1381
00:53:23,818 --> 00:53:27,058
wanted to make sure I covered everything

1382
00:53:24,838 --> 00:53:29,480
so I made a little presentation uh

1383
00:53:27,059 --> 00:53:32,640
apologies it's not a video I only know

1384
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:34,559
slideshows so my final thoughts are make

1385
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:37,679
sure you're using a good STS based

1386
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:39,240
project or product no one uses colloidal

1387
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:41,279
silver anymore like I said earlier that

1388
00:53:39,239 --> 00:53:43,318
doesn't I mean I could I if anybody

1389
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:46,260
needs to see it there's a paper uh by

1390
00:53:43,318 --> 00:53:49,199
Mohan Ram from 1982 comparing them all

1391
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:52,200
and they found that you know STS was the

1392
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:53,279
Supreme for reversing cannabis

1393
00:53:52,199 --> 00:53:55,259
um you want to think numbers numbers

1394
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,780
that's how you win that's how you beat

1395
00:53:55,260 --> 00:54:00,000
the the odds numbers numbers spray in

1396
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:01,619
the notes spray in the armpits watch for

1397
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,599
overspray you don't want a whole room

1398
00:54:01,619 --> 00:54:05,880
full of Herms and you don't know what

1399
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:07,200
the pollen toner is sometimes less is

1400
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:09,240
more when it comes to how often you

1401
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:10,919
spray that's very important sometimes

1402
00:54:09,239 --> 00:54:12,719
spraying once a day is too much for

1403
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:14,880
whatever plant you're doing uh move it

1404
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:15,659
down to once a week uh keep it in the

1405
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,760
fridge

1406
00:54:15,659 --> 00:54:19,679
and female reverse still have that

1407
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:21,660
female blood structure with male parts

1408
00:54:19,679 --> 00:54:25,379
they do not hang and often cluster tight

1409
00:54:21,659 --> 00:54:26,699
that that really covers the whole how to

1410
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:28,079
make them

1411
00:54:26,699 --> 00:54:29,879
um I don't know if you want to go into

1412
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:30,900
anything else in detail on feminized

1413
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:33,318
seeds or if there's anything else you

1414
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,318
want to cover

1415
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:36,659
um

1416
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:38,280
um I mean I think you did the the timing

1417
00:54:36,659 --> 00:54:40,558
thing is pretty interesting because

1418
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:42,000
maybe we could expound upon that sure

1419
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:44,579
for a second

1420
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:47,159
um perhaps you know uh what you're

1421
00:54:44,579 --> 00:54:49,440
saying basically is for most people they

1422
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:51,899
would want to reverse what they plan on

1423
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:54,179
being their male pollen sources

1424
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:55,559
three to four weeks ahead of when they

1425
00:54:54,179 --> 00:54:57,480
actually flower

1426
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:59,579
two and a half two and a half to three

1427
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:01,199
two and a half to three because yeah I

1428
00:54:59,579 --> 00:55:02,880
just wanted to mention to people you

1429
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:05,039
know in nature

1430
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:08,220
um you know Nature's worked out over a

1431
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:10,980
long time the when males drop pollen

1432
00:55:08,219 --> 00:55:12,659
versus where the females are at yeah but

1433
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:15,059
you break that when you're doing it

1434
00:55:12,659 --> 00:55:17,699
yourself and so you have to you know

1435
00:55:15,059 --> 00:55:20,400
pick the right time yeah and that's

1436
00:55:17,699 --> 00:55:23,098
another art too where

1437
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,900
um you know Matt and CSI and others have

1438
00:55:23,099 --> 00:55:26,400
told me that you have you can have a

1439
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:28,260
situation where there are some rare

1440
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,818
plants that you can spray right at the

1441
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:32,940
same time as you bloom everything else

1442
00:55:29,818 --> 00:55:34,558
because they reverse very fast most of

1443
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:37,980
them are in that two and a half to three

1444
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:39,599
week range but it can vary and there's

1445
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:41,280
definitely plenty of stories that Matt

1446
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:42,960
could talk about about you get a

1447
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:46,200
successful reversal

1448
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:49,920
but you mess up on your timing yeah yeah

1449
00:55:46,199 --> 00:55:52,739
there's a there's a state of flower for

1450
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:54,420
the females that like it's it's formed

1451
00:55:52,739 --> 00:55:55,858
enough pistols and enough Bud that

1452
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:58,440
you'll if you you actually want to

1453
00:55:55,858 --> 00:56:00,058
pollinate it yeah right and so you're

1454
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:03,659
trying to make sure you're introducing

1455
00:56:00,059 --> 00:56:05,940
pollen at the perfect time for where

1456
00:56:03,659 --> 00:56:08,098
your buds are yeah I mean there's always

1457
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:10,019
too early like if you introduce pollen

1458
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:13,318
too early let's say let's say you you

1459
00:56:10,019 --> 00:56:16,199
missed the window and it's two weeks in

1460
00:56:13,318 --> 00:56:17,880
you you just have a few white hairs and

1461
00:56:16,199 --> 00:56:18,480
they get hit

1462
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:21,000
um

1463
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:22,500
it stops it stops producing more white

1464
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,659
hairs for the most part it's like okay

1465
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:26,460
we're pollinated now our job is to

1466
00:56:24,659 --> 00:56:28,799
produce the seed and finish these seed

1467
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:30,420
and that's the plant's internal uh kind

1468
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:32,460
of memory and time clock how it flips

1469
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:34,858
and that's the seed you're going to end

1470
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:37,019
up with not very many seeds on the flip

1471
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:40,139
side you want to make sure that when you

1472
00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:42,059
pollinate you have the uh the largest

1473
00:56:40,139 --> 00:56:44,759
amount of white

1474
00:56:42,059 --> 00:56:45,839
uh stigma I think that's right I always

1475
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,640
get that one wrong I always call them

1476
00:56:45,838 --> 00:56:49,858
pistols but I think it's stigma so you

1477
00:56:47,639 --> 00:56:50,759
want to make their statement stigma

1478
00:56:49,858 --> 00:56:52,858
um you want to make sure you have the

1479
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:54,540
most uh most amount of white stigma in

1480
00:56:52,858 --> 00:56:57,299
the least amount of brown

1481
00:56:54,539 --> 00:56:59,099
um if it's brown it can't catch the

1482
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:01,079
pollen and it can't make seeds in its

1483
00:56:59,099 --> 00:57:02,280
little ovule down there so you want to

1484
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:04,500
make sure that

1485
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:06,119
maybe we should just explain science for

1486
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:07,380
a second so each one of those white

1487
00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:10,318
hairs

1488
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:12,720
catches a tiny little pollen grain

1489
00:57:10,318 --> 00:57:15,420
and there's a tube in that white hair

1490
00:57:12,719 --> 00:57:18,058
and that pollen grain then falls down

1491
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:20,579
that tube all the way until it hits

1492
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:23,640
where it's supposed to fertilize and

1493
00:57:20,579 --> 00:57:27,300
that's the core beginning of the seat

1494
00:57:23,639 --> 00:57:29,639
yeah so what he's saying is is that if

1495
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:33,300
you're if you're you know if those white

1496
00:57:29,639 --> 00:57:35,279
hairs are damaged by wind or pests or

1497
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:38,099
sprays or this or that if they're

1498
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:41,579
withered if they're you know they won't

1499
00:57:38,099 --> 00:57:44,940
have the tube to shoot the grain yeah

1500
00:57:41,579 --> 00:57:47,339
into where it needs to go yeah right so

1501
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:49,200
basically each one of those sort of each

1502
00:57:47,338 --> 00:57:52,739
one of those is sort of a slip and slide

1503
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:55,139
if you will for a pollen grain yep one

1504
00:57:52,739 --> 00:57:56,399
pollen grain a single pollen grain

1505
00:57:55,139 --> 00:57:58,259
that's all it takes

1506
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:01,619
someone said they were on mushroom so I

1507
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:04,260
turned up the lights oh so so that that

1508
00:58:01,619 --> 00:58:06,480
that's why like those those basically

1509
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:07,740
are out there just to catch a pollen

1510
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:10,679
grain in the Wind

1511
00:58:07,739 --> 00:58:13,039
yeah and then shoot it down into the

1512
00:58:10,679 --> 00:58:16,199
actual flower itself where it can meet

1513
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:17,880
and fertilize and begin to grow the seed

1514
00:58:16,199 --> 00:58:20,399
yeah

1515
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:23,220
that's how it does it and then and then

1516
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,960
the plant just focuses on on seed

1517
00:58:23,219 --> 00:58:27,539
development because at that point the

1518
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:31,920
plant knows okay I've done my job I've

1519
00:58:27,539 --> 00:58:34,318
flowered I've I've I've I've got seed in

1520
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:36,180
me this is what I do I make seeds so all

1521
00:58:34,318 --> 00:58:37,980
the energy goes to that usually less on

1522
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:41,519
uh resin production Less on anything

1523
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:43,318
else and so people should know too that

1524
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:46,139
um it tends to be not with everything

1525
00:58:43,318 --> 00:58:49,318
but it tends to be somewhere around you

1526
00:58:46,139 --> 00:58:49,980
know the two and a half to to four weeks

1527
00:58:49,318 --> 00:58:52,858
in

1528
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:55,139
of the female flowering for it to

1529
00:58:52,858 --> 00:58:57,838
develop enough white enough flower

1530
00:58:55,139 --> 00:59:00,420
formation that it has a plethora of

1531
00:58:57,838 --> 00:59:03,298
white hairs everywhere sticking out

1532
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:05,700
but it still has enough time left that

1533
00:59:03,298 --> 00:59:07,858
when you fertilize you have enough time

1534
00:59:05,699 --> 00:59:10,858
which is usually four to six weeks to

1535
00:59:07,858 --> 00:59:13,500
make ripe seeds before the plant starts

1536
00:59:10,858 --> 00:59:15,239
getting extremely overdone yeah and the

1537
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:17,760
bud starts rotting and issues start

1538
00:59:15,239 --> 00:59:19,500
happening yeah

1539
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,119
um this is a good question have you

1540
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:23,039
grown seeds for example strain one

1541
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:24,480
reversed on a strain two and strain two

1542
00:59:23,039 --> 00:59:26,338
rivers on the strain one how the results

1543
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:28,380
vary so

1544
00:59:26,338 --> 00:59:30,779
um I'm trying to think of a good example

1545
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:34,740
I I just got some um

1546
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:38,640
bubble gum by Durbin poison and Durban

1547
00:59:34,739 --> 00:59:40,078
poisoned by bubble gum uh first time

1548
00:59:38,639 --> 00:59:42,179
bubble gum was reversed second time

1549
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:44,519
Durban Poison was reversed or however it

1550
00:59:42,179 --> 00:59:47,519
was and uh we're gonna see the

1551
00:59:44,519 --> 00:59:50,099
differences in those but usually the

1552
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:52,798
mother plant tends and this isn't always

1553
00:59:50,099 --> 00:59:54,298
again it it depends but generally

1554
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:56,400
speaking the mother plant tends to

1555
00:59:54,298 --> 00:59:59,579
dominate most of the time so you're

1556
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:02,280
seeing little slight variances on the

1557
00:59:59,579 --> 01:00:04,559
mother line with

1558
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:06,180
a little input from the reverse plant

1559
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:09,480
but not always sometimes that reverse

1560
01:00:06,179 --> 01:00:11,279
plant can can dominate co-dominate uh I

1561
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:13,500
mean there's you know there's all kinds

1562
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:17,339
of different ways I think there's a lot

1563
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:19,739
of Discovery in that world and it also

1564
01:00:17,338 --> 01:00:22,880
goes a little bit to uh this current

1565
01:00:19,739 --> 01:00:25,919
state of seed making which is

1566
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:27,140
most breeders are do one-offs and then

1567
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:30,298
they move on

1568
01:00:27,139 --> 01:00:33,000
and so by definition in order to get

1569
01:00:30,298 --> 01:00:35,400
what what was just asked you would have

1570
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:38,338
to reverse the you would have to reverse

1571
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:41,039
one female to do one breeding and then

1572
01:00:38,338 --> 01:00:43,500
at a separate time reverse the other

1573
01:00:41,039 --> 01:00:46,019
side of it uh you know you'd have to do

1574
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:48,719
both so it's two separate breedings in

1575
01:00:46,019 --> 01:00:51,059
order to get the parents flipped yeah

1576
01:00:48,719 --> 01:00:53,699
yeah it's it's right it's a task because

1577
01:00:51,059 --> 01:00:55,740
not again not all not every time is a

1578
01:00:53,699 --> 01:00:59,098
success so sometimes it might be four

1579
01:00:55,739 --> 01:01:00,719
trials just to get two things just to

1580
01:00:59,099 --> 01:01:02,940
flip the parents you know but it is

1581
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:06,139
something that we we talk about fairly

1582
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:09,480
often is like does the does the parent

1583
01:01:06,139 --> 01:01:12,239
male or female make a difference yeah is

1584
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:14,460
there an influence in that regard

1585
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:17,219
um and I think it's an area of reversals

1586
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:18,720
that needs a lot more study yeah I think

1587
01:01:17,219 --> 01:01:21,419
I think it's just like everything in

1588
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:24,058
cannabis whether it's male or female

1589
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:26,220
it just depends on how how the alleles

1590
01:01:24,059 --> 01:01:27,298
line up you know like it just it's

1591
01:01:26,219 --> 01:01:29,899
always going to line up differently

1592
01:01:27,298 --> 01:01:32,699
using a mail onto another genetic line

1593
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:34,858
it or a female reverse female internet

1594
01:01:32,699 --> 01:01:36,358
the genetic line and vice versa

1595
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:38,219
switching them it'll always line up

1596
01:01:36,358 --> 01:01:39,779
differently so you'll see things similar

1597
01:01:38,219 --> 01:01:42,239
between the lines obviously there will

1598
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:43,740
be some similar Expressions but there

1599
01:01:42,239 --> 01:01:46,259
are going to be differences too you're

1600
01:01:43,739 --> 01:01:48,659
going to see some Expressions occur more

1601
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:50,280
often in one of those crosses versus the

1602
01:01:48,659 --> 01:01:52,379
other cross

1603
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:54,059
61 lights there's more people in here

1604
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:55,920
than that please like share and

1605
01:01:54,059 --> 01:01:57,059
subscribe I always forget to say that

1606
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,920
since we're on YouTube you can like

1607
01:01:57,059 --> 01:02:02,400
share and subscribe

1608
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:05,220
but yeah I mean there there is I I think

1609
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:09,180
that there's a lot of feminized breeding

1610
01:02:05,219 --> 01:02:12,419
certainly techniques and knowledge that

1611
01:02:09,179 --> 01:02:14,338
needs to be expanded upon we might we as

1612
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:17,460
far as cannabis goes we might still be

1613
01:02:14,338 --> 01:02:20,400
in the you know the child stage of our

1614
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:22,079
level of knowledge yeah um and you know

1615
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,579
there's a lot of room in there for

1616
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:25,318
science

1617
01:02:23,579 --> 01:02:28,859
um and for experiments to teach us

1618
01:02:25,318 --> 01:02:31,259
various aspects of things yeah and you

1619
01:02:28,858 --> 01:02:34,980
know and a lot of and that's why so many

1620
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:37,200
breeders uh swap stories

1621
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:40,139
because they're always extremely curious

1622
01:02:37,199 --> 01:02:41,759
how the plants respond and why do they

1623
01:02:40,139 --> 01:02:43,858
respond a certain way and why do they

1624
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:45,540
respond differently at a different time

1625
01:02:43,858 --> 01:02:48,298
but they were treated the same so

1626
01:02:45,539 --> 01:02:50,099
there's a you know there's a uh I tend

1627
01:02:48,298 --> 01:02:51,358
to think that there's probably a

1628
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:54,599
threshold

1629
01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:57,719
which varies from strain to strain on

1630
01:02:54,599 --> 01:03:00,180
how much silver is needed to get the

1631
01:02:57,719 --> 01:03:01,980
correct effect and in some cases you're

1632
01:03:00,179 --> 01:03:05,659
probably overloading the plant and in

1633
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:05,659
some cases it probably needed more

1634
01:03:07,338 --> 01:03:14,039
it's not even plant to plant it's plant

1635
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:16,200
per time per plant per time you know

1636
01:03:14,039 --> 01:03:17,639
like it's going to be because you could

1637
01:03:16,199 --> 01:03:18,899
do the same strain the same clone at the

1638
01:03:17,639 --> 01:03:20,338
same strain the next time the same

1639
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:22,318
amount it's not going to work so it's

1640
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:24,659
like per plant and it's interesting too

1641
01:03:22,318 --> 01:03:27,119
like I even think like methods of

1642
01:03:24,659 --> 01:03:29,460
reversal can be can be played with as

1643
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:32,039
well I think yeah SDS has been settled

1644
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:33,480
upon because it it works better than the

1645
01:03:32,039 --> 01:03:36,058
alternatives

1646
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:39,179
yeah but yeah you know we're still

1647
01:03:36,059 --> 01:03:40,819
experimenting and playing around with

1648
01:03:39,179 --> 01:03:43,259
um different techniques

1649
01:03:40,818 --> 01:03:45,599
especially with hard to reverse plants

1650
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:48,240
that we really are interested in making

1651
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:51,480
feminized seeds yeah you know and and

1652
01:03:48,239 --> 01:03:53,279
things that often fail with STS

1653
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:54,719
um is there a different pathway I mean

1654
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:57,119
Matt mentioned some other products

1655
01:03:54,719 --> 01:03:59,279
earlier on the show yeah that guy's a

1656
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:01,680
dick to me so I I kept pushing his

1657
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:03,059
product forever as much as mine but I'm

1658
01:04:01,679 --> 01:04:04,440
not gonna do that no more because no I

1659
01:04:03,059 --> 01:04:06,180
mean I just I just mean in the sense

1660
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:08,220
like I wasn't even talking about him I

1661
01:04:06,179 --> 01:04:09,659
was talking about the

1662
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:11,039
um what was the other product that you

1663
01:04:09,659 --> 01:04:11,838
mentioned

1664
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:13,798
um

1665
01:04:11,838 --> 01:04:16,440
retain yeah yeah there's there's

1666
01:04:13,798 --> 01:04:18,599
different methods of reversals that were

1667
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:21,119
that that have barely been experimented

1668
01:04:18,599 --> 01:04:23,338
with yeah there's there we're gonna find

1669
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:24,900
some some stuff in the near future I

1670
01:04:23,338 --> 01:04:27,779
think that it's just it's been a bunch

1671
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:29,160
of us us like pseudo-farmers that are

1672
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:30,780
just weed people trying to figure it out

1673
01:04:29,159 --> 01:04:32,699
and like I'm not a scientist and I'm one

1674
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:34,500
of the guys been figuring it out trying

1675
01:04:32,699 --> 01:04:35,759
to figure it out some of longest and

1676
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:38,159
that's not appropriate there's people

1677
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:40,200
way better than me and more qualified to

1678
01:04:38,159 --> 01:04:41,279
do this and I hope I hope in the next

1679
01:04:40,199 --> 01:04:43,679
few years we're going to learn a lot

1680
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:45,359
more as they complain in agriculture

1681
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:47,578
they can bring in colleges and

1682
01:04:45,358 --> 01:04:50,338
universities they can bring in ag

1683
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:52,200
departments they can get scientists you

1684
01:04:50,338 --> 01:04:56,279
know who are helping kids work on their

1685
01:04:52,199 --> 01:04:58,439
phds and stuff study certain things

1686
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:59,460
um and so yeah like the typically the

1687
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:01,798
farmer

1688
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:05,639
isn't actually doing a bunch of wide

1689
01:05:01,798 --> 01:05:08,338
scale experimentation yeah you know um

1690
01:05:05,639 --> 01:05:10,318
one thing that I'm I'm learning as I'm

1691
01:05:08,338 --> 01:05:12,420
talking to more and more academics

1692
01:05:10,318 --> 01:05:14,159
whether it's interviewing them for our

1693
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:15,780
show or like trying to you know schedule

1694
01:05:14,159 --> 01:05:17,219
that or just trying to talk to them

1695
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:18,960
about genetics in general and these are

1696
01:05:17,219 --> 01:05:20,879
the people that are working Hands-On in

1697
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,920
the universities with the genetics

1698
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:25,318
and it's the one the one thing that I've

1699
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:27,180
run into the most is that they really

1700
01:05:25,318 --> 01:05:29,338
don't think cannabis people have

1701
01:05:27,179 --> 01:05:31,558
anything to offer them as far as

1702
01:05:29,338 --> 01:05:34,739
knowledge of History knowledge of

1703
01:05:31,559 --> 01:05:36,839
science knowledge of genetics they

1704
01:05:34,739 --> 01:05:38,338
really really don't think that we have a

1705
01:05:36,838 --> 01:05:40,798
good handle on what has happened over

1706
01:05:38,338 --> 01:05:42,420
the years and they are of the opinion

1707
01:05:40,798 --> 01:05:44,818
that

1708
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:46,318
and when I say they this is this is

1709
01:05:44,818 --> 01:05:48,838
pretty much everyone that's done any

1710
01:05:46,318 --> 01:05:50,460
kind of genomics work in cannabis via uh

1711
01:05:48,838 --> 01:05:54,119
the big company that did it for a while

1712
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:56,699
the universities they are still using

1713
01:05:54,119 --> 01:05:58,798
the method that crowdsourcing and

1714
01:05:56,699 --> 01:06:00,239
getting whoever when they crowdsource

1715
01:05:58,798 --> 01:06:03,119
let's say they crowdsource Blue Dream

1716
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:05,338
whatever they crowdsource and the most

1717
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:08,099
occurs that is what they use as their

1718
01:06:05,338 --> 01:06:09,838
legacy clone and trying to explain to

1719
01:06:08,099 --> 01:06:12,180
scientists how that does not work for

1720
01:06:09,838 --> 01:06:13,920
cannabis because the tighter something

1721
01:06:12,179 --> 01:06:15,298
is held like the more rare it is usually

1722
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:17,280
at the tighter it's held and it doesn't

1723
01:06:15,298 --> 01:06:19,139
proliferate the community as much it

1724
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:21,839
works in Reverse it tends to work in

1725
01:06:19,139 --> 01:06:24,058
reverse and you really have to to be on

1726
01:06:21,838 --> 01:06:26,578
the ground have access to these people

1727
01:06:24,059 --> 01:06:27,539
in in the circles and they have to trust

1728
01:06:26,579 --> 01:06:31,559
you before they're going to tell you

1729
01:06:27,539 --> 01:06:33,240
stories and I think that I'm learning

1730
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:35,099
that they think we're very incapable of

1731
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:36,298
getting this done and and it's going to

1732
01:06:35,099 --> 01:06:37,680
be one of those bridges that we have to

1733
01:06:36,298 --> 01:06:39,780
learn to cross and work with each other

1734
01:06:37,679 --> 01:06:42,298
on because that's going to bust Amigos

1735
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:43,798
like you know like I I feel like I I've

1736
01:06:42,298 --> 01:06:45,239
put in a lot of work to history stuff

1737
01:06:43,798 --> 01:06:48,059
when people tell me that I'm like well

1738
01:06:45,239 --> 01:06:49,798
you know why is it true how do I know

1739
01:06:48,059 --> 01:06:51,660
because we put in the work you know but

1740
01:06:49,798 --> 01:06:52,679
that they don't see it that way so it's

1741
01:06:51,659 --> 01:06:54,719
it's going to be interesting

1742
01:06:52,679 --> 01:06:56,338
establishing those boundaries and and

1743
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:57,719
new relationships and Science and

1744
01:06:56,338 --> 01:07:00,358
working against each other's egos

1745
01:06:57,719 --> 01:07:01,439
because it's hard to talk to phds when

1746
01:07:00,358 --> 01:07:02,699
you've been doing something your whole

1747
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:04,019
life and they've been doing it for a

1748
01:07:02,699 --> 01:07:06,719
year they still think they're they're

1749
01:07:04,019 --> 01:07:09,298
gonna know much better than you and in

1750
01:07:06,719 --> 01:07:12,719
many cases they do

1751
01:07:09,298 --> 01:07:14,759
I mean you know there's a

1752
01:07:12,719 --> 01:07:16,439
I'm not exactly sure what to say about

1753
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:18,440
that one but

1754
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:18,440
um

1755
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:24,720
I'll say this right uh which is not

1756
01:07:22,858 --> 01:07:27,358
exactly what you were talking about but

1757
01:07:24,719 --> 01:07:29,639
I have worked on various projects as

1758
01:07:27,358 --> 01:07:32,818
things have become more legal and things

1759
01:07:29,639 --> 01:07:35,338
of that nature right and you know I've

1760
01:07:32,818 --> 01:07:38,099
crossed paths with you know uh

1761
01:07:35,338 --> 01:07:42,000
conventional AG guys and stuff and there

1762
01:07:38,099 --> 01:07:44,338
was a big fear in our world where we

1763
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:46,679
just thought that oh man once the once

1764
01:07:44,338 --> 01:07:48,659
the AG people get a hold of it right

1765
01:07:46,679 --> 01:07:50,519
they're just gonna Crush

1766
01:07:48,659 --> 01:07:51,598
and we're just these little hobbyists

1767
01:07:50,519 --> 01:07:53,099
and they're going to push us out of the

1768
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:55,140
way okay

1769
01:07:53,099 --> 01:07:56,579
and I think a lot of those AG people

1770
01:07:55,139 --> 01:08:00,659
think it too

1771
01:07:56,579 --> 01:08:02,760
oh yeah they come into it with a a big

1772
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:05,460
swinging dick and they're totally

1773
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:09,539
confident in it you know

1774
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:11,760
um and they flail yes because they

1775
01:08:09,539 --> 01:08:13,260
realize all of a sudden that many of the

1776
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:15,180
chemicals and many of the different

1777
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:17,520
sprays and things that they use in their

1778
01:08:15,179 --> 01:08:20,338
conventional agriculture are

1779
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:22,500
specifically banned yeah and they've

1780
01:08:20,338 --> 01:08:24,359
based their career on doing it and

1781
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:26,819
they're used to Growing well I get x

1782
01:08:24,359 --> 01:08:28,620
amount of tonnage of blueberries per

1783
01:08:26,819 --> 01:08:31,739
acre yeah

1784
01:08:28,619 --> 01:08:33,539
and that's what I'm going for and I grow

1785
01:08:31,738 --> 01:08:34,500
the same clone and I treat it the same

1786
01:08:33,539 --> 01:08:36,659
way

1787
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:38,338
you know and I get x amount of fruit or

1788
01:08:36,659 --> 01:08:41,399
I get x amount of produce or I get

1789
01:08:38,338 --> 01:08:45,420
whatever and this produce has been bred

1790
01:08:41,399 --> 01:08:48,420
to make my life easier yes like almost

1791
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:51,719
all agriculture is not bred for the

1792
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:54,420
consumer to be happy it's bred for the

1793
01:08:51,719 --> 01:08:57,000
farmer to produce a lot of it and ship

1794
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:58,920
it easier and store it longer and yeah

1795
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:02,460
I'll give a perfect example like

1796
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:04,798
tomatoes Tomatoes their primary goal is

1797
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:06,719
weight they don't want it to rot they

1798
01:09:04,798 --> 01:09:09,119
don't want its skin to crack they want

1799
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:11,640
it to store and travel well they want to

1800
01:09:09,119 --> 01:09:14,519
be able to pick it green ship it green

1801
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:16,920
then blast it with ethylene and ripen it

1802
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:18,480
before they put it out on the Shelf yeah

1803
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:21,420
and then after all these different

1804
01:09:18,479 --> 01:09:23,278
factors come in then taste and texture

1805
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:26,039
and flavor come in

1806
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:27,420
where cannabis is the opposite of most

1807
01:09:26,039 --> 01:09:29,519
of this [ __ ] everything you go into the

1808
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:31,319
grocery store and you buy vegetables

1809
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:32,759
they're like the blue I'm like I'm not

1810
01:09:31,319 --> 01:09:34,440
trying to disc Blue Dream but I'm just

1811
01:09:32,759 --> 01:09:36,779
gonna say like blue dream

1812
01:09:34,439 --> 01:09:40,619
has enough qualities that it's an

1813
01:09:36,779 --> 01:09:43,560
obvious commercial Cropper yeah right

1814
01:09:40,619 --> 01:09:46,259
all your food for the most part is an

1815
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:49,380
obvious commercial Cropper that's what

1816
01:09:46,259 --> 01:09:51,238
it was developed for and so big AG gets

1817
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:53,039
involved and they're like what are you

1818
01:09:51,238 --> 01:09:54,298
doing growing all this stringy [ __ ]

1819
01:09:53,039 --> 01:09:57,238
yeah

1820
01:09:54,298 --> 01:09:59,279
why aren't you growing you know and like

1821
01:09:57,238 --> 01:10:01,859
what do you mean the consumer likes it

1822
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:04,500
like we dictate what what the consumer

1823
01:10:01,859 --> 01:10:06,899
even can eat yeah these tasteless

1824
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:09,659
strawberries give us x amount more per

1825
01:10:06,899 --> 01:10:11,460
acre so that's why we grow them yeah the

1826
01:10:09,659 --> 01:10:13,559
flavor ones they tend to rot and they

1827
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:16,140
don't give us nearly as much weight and

1828
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:19,080
so don't even eat normal Tomatoes I'll

1829
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:20,640
only eat cherry now so they're you know

1830
01:10:19,079 --> 01:10:22,738
well that's where the whole heirloom

1831
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:24,300
thing came in yeah yeah because we just

1832
01:10:22,738 --> 01:10:27,059
went back to like when people bread

1833
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:28,679
tomatoes to taste good yeah and they

1834
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:30,600
taste so much better than the ones that

1835
01:10:28,679 --> 01:10:32,940
are just made for weight

1836
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:35,719
so you know to get back to what I'm

1837
01:10:32,939 --> 01:10:38,158
saying is like I thought with big AG

1838
01:10:35,719 --> 01:10:40,439
a lot of the techniques they've relied

1839
01:10:38,158 --> 01:10:42,839
on for most of their career

1840
01:10:40,439 --> 01:10:45,359
um you know they can't rely on in

1841
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:47,340
cannabis because it's banned yeah and

1842
01:10:45,359 --> 01:10:49,198
cannabis is a much different so they

1843
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:51,719
don't have the lifetime of knowledge of

1844
01:10:49,198 --> 01:10:53,698
growing that specific crop

1845
01:10:51,719 --> 01:10:56,340
and they also can't go to universities

1846
01:10:53,698 --> 01:10:58,500
or older guys in the industry and just

1847
01:10:56,340 --> 01:11:01,140
learn from them about this specific crop

1848
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:03,000
most big AG has been building on the

1849
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:06,719
people that came before them in big AG

1850
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:09,600
for decades and decades now yeah nobody

1851
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:12,179
has to reinvent the wheel in big AG and

1852
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:13,860
right now in science what like kind of

1853
01:11:12,179 --> 01:11:16,079
what I was talking about was that they

1854
01:11:13,859 --> 01:11:18,299
really genuinely do not think

1855
01:11:16,079 --> 01:11:20,279
one I I don't even know that they know

1856
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:21,719
that there is like a clandestine nature

1857
01:11:20,279 --> 01:11:23,340
to cannabis and that there are these

1858
01:11:21,719 --> 01:11:25,380
guys in these Hills that have these

1859
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:27,719
stories that they they really the person

1860
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:29,819
people I talk to they really didn't

1861
01:11:27,719 --> 01:11:31,380
think that anybody was really do doing a

1862
01:11:29,819 --> 01:11:33,299
good job of keeping tracking cannabis

1863
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:37,500
they didn't know that anybody was even

1864
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:39,480
trying like didn't nothing the reason

1865
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:41,158
why I brought up that story about big AG

1866
01:11:39,479 --> 01:11:43,379
is it's the same thing that Matt was

1867
01:11:41,158 --> 01:11:46,319
just talking about with phds

1868
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:48,060
they have a lot of assumptions looking

1869
01:11:46,319 --> 01:11:50,340
from outside in

1870
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:52,260
right and they don't really realize the

1871
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:54,000
depth and the level that already exists

1872
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:56,579
within it yeah

1873
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:59,039
and they have there's a lot that they

1874
01:11:56,579 --> 01:12:01,439
can teach us but there's a lot that they

1875
01:11:59,039 --> 01:12:03,238
have to learn yeah and that's that's

1876
01:12:01,439 --> 01:12:05,639
where I'm coming up against a lot of

1877
01:12:03,238 --> 01:12:07,799
problems I mean I realize that there's a

1878
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:09,179
lot that I can learn from them that I

1879
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:10,619
genuinely think that they don't think

1880
01:12:09,179 --> 01:12:13,560
that there's anything they could learn

1881
01:12:10,619 --> 01:12:15,420
from any of us and it's it's humbling

1882
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:17,340
because it's like wow they really don't

1883
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:19,500
take any of us seriously but then it's

1884
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:21,360
also concerning to me and and I'm really

1885
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:23,399
trying to make an effort to make inroads

1886
01:12:21,359 --> 01:12:24,599
there because these are the same people

1887
01:12:23,399 --> 01:12:26,579
that are going to be writing the history

1888
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:28,260
books and the textbooks in universities

1889
01:12:26,579 --> 01:12:30,238
and colleges that tell the history of

1890
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:33,119
cannabis and if we don't make those

1891
01:12:30,238 --> 01:12:35,158
inroads and the person that eventually

1892
01:12:33,119 --> 01:12:36,899
ultimately is in charge of writing these

1893
01:12:35,158 --> 01:12:39,059
textbooks because there's going to be a

1894
01:12:36,899 --> 01:12:40,500
few of them a group of them

1895
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:42,480
um if they don't

1896
01:12:40,500 --> 01:12:44,158
go look at the real history they get to

1897
01:12:42,479 --> 01:12:45,718
write the history and it's lost except

1898
01:12:44,158 --> 01:12:47,939
for these little podcasts here and

1899
01:12:45,719 --> 01:12:50,158
little bits of notes of history but

1900
01:12:47,939 --> 01:12:51,839
that's all lost anyways and doesn't it's

1901
01:12:50,158 --> 01:12:53,698
only real if it's in the in the

1902
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:55,619
textbooks and history books and we've

1903
01:12:53,698 --> 01:12:56,879
seen that happen time and time again so

1904
01:12:55,619 --> 01:12:59,519
I think it's important to make these

1905
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:01,560
inroads but I'm definitely definitely

1906
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:03,780
having a hard time doing it um they're

1907
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:05,100
really nice people over there even the

1908
01:13:03,779 --> 01:13:08,880
people who don't necessarily understand

1909
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:12,120
the need for us or want to work with any

1910
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:16,079
of us are pretty nice and I think if

1911
01:13:12,119 --> 01:13:17,880
they can just be shown our culture and

1912
01:13:16,079 --> 01:13:20,219
understand how it worked or you know

1913
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:21,840
since the 60s and 70s they would have a

1914
01:13:20,219 --> 01:13:24,000
much better appreciation for the people

1915
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:26,460
who did keep long before I came around

1916
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,500
keep the history going and keep tabs on

1917
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:31,079
all this stuff so I hope it'll work I

1918
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:33,000
hope it'll happen but who knows I mean

1919
01:13:31,079 --> 01:13:35,219
there's there's always been a sense of

1920
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:37,619
there's the above board of what's going

1921
01:13:35,219 --> 01:13:39,179
on in the world and then there's the

1922
01:13:37,619 --> 01:13:41,519
there's the underground and there's the

1923
01:13:39,179 --> 01:13:44,819
black markets and there's the uh there's

1924
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:47,820
all kinds of things and so you know

1925
01:13:44,819 --> 01:13:50,698
um they you know arrogance about what

1926
01:13:47,819 --> 01:13:52,619
you don't know is a common human trait

1927
01:13:50,698 --> 01:13:55,259
you know uh you get older and you get

1928
01:13:52,619 --> 01:13:57,119
humbled by how much you don't know and

1929
01:13:55,260 --> 01:13:59,940
by how many things get turned on their

1930
01:13:57,119 --> 01:14:01,439
head about what you think you know yeah

1931
01:13:59,939 --> 01:14:03,479
and the problem with them when they're

1932
01:14:01,439 --> 01:14:05,339
trying to do the Cannabis the Cannabis

1933
01:14:03,479 --> 01:14:07,319
you know I don't want to call it genome

1934
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:10,140
or whatever but like when they were

1935
01:14:07,319 --> 01:14:13,679
doing it for say humans they could go to

1936
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:16,320
like pure Scandinavians oh yeah or pure

1937
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:17,760
Aborigines you know or this or they

1938
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:19,380
could they could go and they could test

1939
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:21,420
so many different humans and they could

1940
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:24,179
build a basis

1941
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:27,359
yeah you know

1942
01:14:24,179 --> 01:14:30,719
um and uh you know and and with cannabis

1943
01:14:27,359 --> 01:14:32,759
they can't really do that yeah

1944
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:34,859
um and so no these people would never

1945
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:36,539
get invited to any Inner Circle tables

1946
01:14:34,859 --> 01:14:38,339
anywhere because they're [ __ ] about

1947
01:14:36,539 --> 01:14:40,679
it and they get they wear it on their

1948
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:42,480
sleeve they do I mean I'll I've said

1949
01:14:40,679 --> 01:14:43,980
this before on the podcast but I'll say

1950
01:14:42,479 --> 01:14:44,819
it again

1951
01:14:43,979 --> 01:14:47,698
um

1952
01:14:44,819 --> 01:14:49,738
you know they like even right now that's

1953
01:14:47,698 --> 01:14:51,779
the problem that you have with testing

1954
01:14:49,738 --> 01:14:54,359
right is that

1955
01:14:51,779 --> 01:14:56,519
testing to my knowledge

1956
01:14:54,359 --> 01:14:58,380
you know testing for potency doesn't

1957
01:14:56,520 --> 01:15:01,320
explain what kind of a high it gives me

1958
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:04,140
no not at all there's a lot of what what

1959
01:15:01,319 --> 01:15:06,420
people considered 30 percent you know or

1960
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:09,659
35 or something that we all consider to

1961
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:13,440
be extremely Bland yeah and boring

1962
01:15:09,658 --> 01:15:15,238
and it testing Can't Tell You Why this

1963
01:15:13,439 --> 01:15:17,339
High makes me want to like Giggle and

1964
01:15:15,238 --> 01:15:19,859
run around and crawl out of my chair and

1965
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:21,840
have a little anxiety yeah and why this

1966
01:15:19,859 --> 01:15:23,759
High wants to make me pull up the covers

1967
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:27,719
and is warm and comforting and couch

1968
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:29,880
lock and easy potato chips I I learned a

1969
01:15:27,719 --> 01:15:31,619
new term yesterday I mean it's new to me

1970
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:35,400
obviously it's not a new term new to me

1971
01:15:31,619 --> 01:15:37,800
term called biphagic and it was used to

1972
01:15:35,399 --> 01:15:39,779
describe cannabis I believe Chimera said

1973
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:41,039
it he said the Cannabis is biphasic

1974
01:15:39,779 --> 01:15:42,779
remember

1975
01:15:41,039 --> 01:15:45,600
um we've we've learned through science

1976
01:15:42,779 --> 01:15:48,059
that you know things that are in the six

1977
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:50,340
percent uh I want to say he said 12 or

1978
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:52,679
somewhere in there have a more you know

1979
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:55,500
peppy jingly type hi to most people

1980
01:15:52,679 --> 01:15:57,600
generally speaking and things are you

1981
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:59,579
know that are in the upper 20s to

1982
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:01,679
whatever it can give you paranoia and

1983
01:15:59,579 --> 01:16:04,920
then have a quicker descending High

1984
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:07,079
faster so it's by phasic I like that

1985
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:09,359
word I wanted to bring it in thanks yeah

1986
01:16:07,079 --> 01:16:11,100
I mean but the the I guess the point

1987
01:16:09,359 --> 01:16:13,439
that I was was trying to make is that

1988
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:14,579
right now there's all this testing going

1989
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:16,319
on and they think they know what the

1990
01:16:14,579 --> 01:16:19,019
hell they're talking about and they're

1991
01:16:16,319 --> 01:16:21,000
not even testing for most terpenes yeah

1992
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:23,100
mostly they're not even testing for most

1993
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:25,020
cannabinoids yeah they're testing for

1994
01:16:23,100 --> 01:16:26,460
the known ones that are the most common

1995
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:29,400
yeah

1996
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:31,920
and so if there's a 150 cannabinoids or

1997
01:16:29,399 --> 01:16:34,738
something and they're testing for 30

1998
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:37,560
or there's hundreds of of terpenes and

1999
01:16:34,738 --> 01:16:39,178
they're testing for two dozen yeah and

2000
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:41,699
they don't even really realize how they

2001
01:16:39,179 --> 01:16:44,279
all blend together science is in its

2002
01:16:41,698 --> 01:16:46,319
infancy on it and so you know science is

2003
01:16:44,279 --> 01:16:47,698
the best tool that we have but like they

2004
01:16:46,319 --> 01:16:51,000
only know what they know until they're

2005
01:16:47,698 --> 01:16:53,039
proven wrong yeah I remember early on

2006
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,600
when CBD became a big thing do you

2007
01:16:53,039 --> 01:16:56,640
remember that they were saying that

2008
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:58,320
there's no psychoactive effects or

2009
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:00,600
effect on the central nervous system

2010
01:16:58,319 --> 01:17:03,000
with CBD so for a long time I didn't

2011
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:05,159
think that CBD like giving someone a

2012
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:07,560
large dose of CBD would do anything to

2013
01:17:05,158 --> 01:17:10,738
them but I mean let's put it this way

2014
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:13,500
right uh the human body

2015
01:17:10,738 --> 01:17:14,759
is one of the most studied parts of

2016
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:16,380
science

2017
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:18,860
because it's one of the most important

2018
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:22,380
things to us right because it's us yeah

2019
01:17:18,859 --> 01:17:23,939
and what year did that Israeli scientist

2020
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:26,119
discover that we had a cannabinoid

2021
01:17:23,939 --> 01:17:28,859
system within our body oh I don't know

2022
01:17:26,119 --> 01:17:30,899
who is uh

2023
01:17:28,859 --> 01:17:33,059
um malusham I want to say I think it was

2024
01:17:30,899 --> 01:17:35,460
I think it was in the 80s

2025
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:38,039
was it 80s I think it was in the 80s you

2026
01:17:35,460 --> 01:17:41,039
could probably look it up no

2027
01:17:38,039 --> 01:17:44,219
no I'm gonna say 80s it could be it

2028
01:17:41,039 --> 01:17:45,960
could be I could look it up but uh uh

2029
01:17:44,219 --> 01:17:47,279
I'm gonna say I don't think we

2030
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:49,560
discovered we had a cannibal night

2031
01:17:47,279 --> 01:17:51,658
system until I was alive oh really yeah

2032
01:17:49,560 --> 01:17:54,179
yeah it could be and so we didn't even

2033
01:17:51,658 --> 01:17:57,000
realize that like that existed I don't

2034
01:17:54,179 --> 01:18:00,420
think no yeah

2035
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:02,579
it's it's really hard to to even figure

2036
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:04,800
it out because like it was a legal thing

2037
01:18:02,579 --> 01:18:06,779
to research you know yeah yeah they go

2038
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,980
through so many Hoops to even do it it

2039
01:18:06,779 --> 01:18:10,019
was pointless

2040
01:18:07,979 --> 01:18:11,639
so I don't know I mean they well that's

2041
01:18:10,020 --> 01:18:14,640
the other thing too is that when it

2042
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:19,400
comes to cannabis and cannabinoids

2043
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:19,400
um they only allowed study for harm yeah

2044
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:27,840
a lot of these phds and stuff like that

2045
01:18:24,359 --> 01:18:29,279
um like I you know they basically it's

2046
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:31,079
like they get handed this thing that

2047
01:18:29,279 --> 01:18:34,079
like no one is real no one has studied

2048
01:18:31,079 --> 01:18:35,698
extensively in decades yeah and they

2049
01:18:34,079 --> 01:18:38,340
think they understand it but they really

2050
01:18:35,698 --> 01:18:40,799
don't yeah

2051
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:42,000
they don't no they just handed it and

2052
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,960
they're hoping to figure it out and

2053
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,359
they're smart and they're used to

2054
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:46,800
figuring stuff out but they they will

2055
01:18:45,359 --> 01:18:48,299
eventually need people to figure it out

2056
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:49,619
correctly that have been doing it for a

2057
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:51,179
long time but whether they're going to

2058
01:18:49,619 --> 01:18:53,460
figure that out or not I mean I remember

2059
01:18:51,179 --> 01:18:55,199
everybody was telling uh the company

2060
01:18:53,460 --> 01:18:57,658
that begins with the p that was doing

2061
01:18:55,198 --> 01:19:00,238
all the genetic stuff they're everybody

2062
01:18:57,658 --> 01:19:01,679
that every consult was telling them this

2063
01:19:00,238 --> 01:19:03,419
is who you need to consult you need to

2064
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:04,980
talk to this guy because he's really

2065
01:19:03,420 --> 01:19:06,779
good with x amount of clones in the

2066
01:19:04,979 --> 01:19:09,359
United States he can get you the Legacy

2067
01:19:06,779 --> 01:19:11,219
cuts at XYZ and everything is spelled

2068
01:19:09,359 --> 01:19:12,839
out for him and in the end all they said

2069
01:19:11,219 --> 01:19:15,779
was no we'll just crowdsource them don't

2070
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:19,020
worry about it yeah sure well I don't

2071
01:19:15,779 --> 01:19:23,039
think they obviously had a different uh

2072
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:24,300
um goal from the beginning yeah you know

2073
01:19:23,039 --> 01:19:26,640
uh

2074
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:30,140
uh I don't know I I think that in our

2075
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:32,520
lifetime uh it's going to be immensely

2076
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:36,619
changing what they discover about it

2077
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:36,620
yeah and I don't think that um

2078
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:41,100
ah here we go the existence of

2079
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:43,920
cannabinoid receptors in the brain was

2080
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:46,260
discovered in studies in the 1980s yeah

2081
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:48,899
yeah it's Christian said 88. but they

2082
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:50,760
discovered THC in the 60s I think that

2083
01:19:48,899 --> 01:19:52,259
was maluchum the guy was referring to at

2084
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:52,920
the Israeli

2085
01:19:52,260 --> 01:19:54,960
um

2086
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:57,539
the Israeli dude that was figuring out

2087
01:19:54,960 --> 01:20:00,600
uh it shows up in the 1960s they

2088
01:19:57,539 --> 01:20:02,880
discovered THC in Canada yeah and that

2089
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:05,219
led to the 1988 discovery of the

2090
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:06,600
endocannabinoid system so they

2091
01:20:05,219 --> 01:20:08,279
discovered it before they knew how it

2092
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:10,920
interacted with our brain

2093
01:20:08,279 --> 01:20:13,019
and essentially the endocannabinoid

2094
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:15,719
system is the largest receptor system

2095
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:18,239
and the master regulatory of homeostasis

2096
01:20:15,719 --> 01:20:20,579
in the human body there you go and we

2097
01:20:18,238 --> 01:20:23,039
didn't even know it existed until 1988.

2098
01:20:20,579 --> 01:20:25,439
yeah and that's not that long ago really

2099
01:20:23,039 --> 01:20:28,619
not no it's not that long ago I mean I

2100
01:20:25,439 --> 01:20:30,479
was like you know it's not that long ago

2101
01:20:28,619 --> 01:20:32,519
it's only been a number it's already 40.

2102
01:20:30,479 --> 01:20:34,379
and yeah it's only it's been a number

2103
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:35,880
it's only been a few decades really yeah

2104
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:38,520
three decades

2105
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:40,859
you know and and so how does that all

2106
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:42,960
interact or why does it do what it does

2107
01:20:40,859 --> 01:20:44,219
um I think phds

2108
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:45,960
um are going to be shocked when they

2109
01:20:44,219 --> 01:20:47,698
start delving into it and they think of

2110
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:49,020
something as simple

2111
01:20:47,698 --> 01:20:51,599
and it's going to be like a lot of

2112
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:55,620
things it was spread by War and conquest

2113
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:58,260
and trade and move and migration human

2114
01:20:55,619 --> 01:21:01,140
slavery and yeah and all there's going

2115
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:03,360
to be an enormous amount of uh

2116
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:06,659
of interest that puck because it's going

2117
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:08,579
to tie into all that stuff yeah

2118
01:21:06,658 --> 01:21:10,259
which is kind of far away from feminized

2119
01:21:08,579 --> 01:21:11,698
seating but you know it's all part of it

2120
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:13,679
I mean

2121
01:21:11,698 --> 01:21:15,178
um I think the only other thing I was

2122
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:16,980
going to touch on a little bit and I

2123
01:21:15,179 --> 01:21:19,199
think we've already touched on it

2124
01:21:16,979 --> 01:21:21,238
pretty well in fact was the Bodhi thing

2125
01:21:19,198 --> 01:21:23,819
I know that was big news this week and

2126
01:21:21,238 --> 01:21:25,379
everybody was talking about it

2127
01:21:23,819 --> 01:21:27,420
um Bodhi working with cookies he made

2128
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:30,420
the announcement just wanted to say

2129
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:32,819
again that's my boy I'm gonna stick with

2130
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:35,760
them through everything y'all don't like

2131
01:21:32,819 --> 01:21:36,539
it tough like I don't I don't think

2132
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,739
there would have been a breed of

2133
01:21:36,539 --> 01:21:38,939
Syndicate without body I would have

2134
01:21:37,738 --> 01:21:40,019
never started any of this stuff without

2135
01:21:38,939 --> 01:21:44,219
him

2136
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:47,580
um I I you know if I get why people are

2137
01:21:44,219 --> 01:21:50,939
are hesitant I've seen a lot of uh

2138
01:21:47,579 --> 01:21:52,439
Partnerships have gone down in in Flames

2139
01:21:50,939 --> 01:21:54,839
over the years I just hope if anybody

2140
01:21:52,439 --> 01:21:56,819
can do it he can

2141
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:59,219
I mean the only thing I'll say on that

2142
01:21:56,819 --> 01:22:01,139
is that um

2143
01:21:59,219 --> 01:22:03,600
the internet is certainly a place where

2144
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:07,340
people can pile on sure

2145
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:10,920
um and I do understand people's feelings

2146
01:22:07,340 --> 01:22:13,679
because and I'll say this

2147
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:16,619
um Bodhi has a special place in my

2148
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:18,480
opinion in the Cannabis World sure and

2149
01:22:16,619 --> 01:22:20,899
that he is pretty well universally

2150
01:22:18,479 --> 01:22:24,779
regarded as a great human

2151
01:22:20,899 --> 01:22:26,579
uh a traveler an Explorer someone who

2152
01:22:24,779 --> 01:22:28,979
brings back all kinds of Oddball

2153
01:22:26,579 --> 01:22:32,399
genetics yeah and that that aren't

2154
01:22:28,979 --> 01:22:34,319
popular at all weird sativas and odd

2155
01:22:32,399 --> 01:22:36,899
things from his travels and he preserves

2156
01:22:34,319 --> 01:22:38,819
them in various ways and he's just a

2157
01:22:36,899 --> 01:22:41,460
generally nice human and so a lot of

2158
01:22:38,819 --> 01:22:44,880
breeders I know look up to him yeah as

2159
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:45,719
sort of an example of you know uh how to

2160
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:46,859
be

2161
01:22:45,719 --> 01:22:49,380
right

2162
01:22:46,859 --> 01:22:53,339
and then he goes and joins the Borg

2163
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:55,560
yeah right and so a bunch of people

2164
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:57,480
um you know while they wouldn't they

2165
01:22:55,560 --> 01:23:00,780
wouldn't harsh on other folks for doing

2166
01:22:57,479 --> 01:23:02,759
that that doesn't seem like it fits with

2167
01:23:00,779 --> 01:23:05,698
bodhi's purest

2168
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:08,460
you know Adventurer you know heart soul

2169
01:23:05,698 --> 01:23:09,899
Spirit kind of person yeah

2170
01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:12,480
um and the only thing I'll say to that

2171
01:23:09,899 --> 01:23:14,399
is that in a rapidly changing

2172
01:23:12,479 --> 01:23:16,919
environment

2173
01:23:14,399 --> 01:23:18,658
um where uh you know where a lot of

2174
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:21,239
where there's a lot of change happening

2175
01:23:18,658 --> 01:23:24,779
fast yeah people are trying to figure

2176
01:23:21,238 --> 01:23:27,419
out how to how to adapt yeah how to

2177
01:23:24,779 --> 01:23:30,359
survive how to move forward how can I

2178
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:31,920
make money ethically how can I you know

2179
01:23:30,359 --> 01:23:33,238
how can I and well there's a bunch of

2180
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:34,619
people that aren't even thinking about

2181
01:23:33,238 --> 01:23:36,539
how to make it ethically they're just

2182
01:23:34,619 --> 01:23:38,158
thinking how to make it but yeah yeah

2183
01:23:36,539 --> 01:23:39,658
yeah but

2184
01:23:38,158 --> 01:23:42,619
um but you know but how to make it

2185
01:23:39,658 --> 01:23:47,539
ethically is even harder yeah you know

2186
01:23:42,619 --> 01:23:51,359
and it's hard to be an outsider Rebel

2187
01:23:47,539 --> 01:23:54,060
Warrior who is never going to touch base

2188
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:56,460
with anyone that's larger or corporate

2189
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:58,320
correct because large corporate groups

2190
01:23:56,460 --> 01:24:01,198
and large players and stuff like that

2191
01:23:58,319 --> 01:24:03,359
are now For Better or For Worse they are

2192
01:24:01,198 --> 01:24:05,698
going to have a not the only hand but

2193
01:24:03,359 --> 01:24:08,519
they are going to have a stake in the

2194
01:24:05,698 --> 01:24:11,039
Cannabis industry moving forward yeah

2195
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:12,540
they they are and so how do you interact

2196
01:24:11,039 --> 01:24:14,039
with them do you try to work with them

2197
01:24:12,539 --> 01:24:17,039
from the inside

2198
01:24:14,039 --> 01:24:18,658
do you try to just lob Molotov cocktails

2199
01:24:17,039 --> 01:24:20,819
against them and hope they burn and go

2200
01:24:18,658 --> 01:24:22,619
away that that's my method that's what I

2201
01:24:20,819 --> 01:24:25,979
do you know

2202
01:24:22,619 --> 01:24:28,079
um and uh still gonna do it but yeah but

2203
01:24:25,979 --> 01:24:29,579
you know and and so there's there's an

2204
01:24:28,079 --> 01:24:31,260
impact there where you see a lot of

2205
01:24:29,579 --> 01:24:33,719
different people trying to figure out

2206
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:35,400
well how do I move forward oh man the

2207
01:24:33,719 --> 01:24:37,500
environment has totally changed the

2208
01:24:35,399 --> 01:24:39,420
market has totally changed my sales are

2209
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:41,219
in the toilet this is how I support

2210
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:44,699
myself this is how I support my children

2211
01:24:41,219 --> 01:24:48,600
what do I do how do I make an impact

2212
01:24:44,698 --> 01:24:50,759
you know and so you know I will I will

2213
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:53,039
say that uh there's a lot of debate

2214
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:54,179
going on in the community about that

2215
01:24:53,039 --> 01:24:56,519
um everyone's free to have their

2216
01:24:54,179 --> 01:24:58,500
opinions about him sure to people that

2217
01:24:56,520 --> 01:25:02,100
actually know him

2218
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:03,420
um you know uh he's still a good-hearted

2219
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:04,400
good person

2220
01:25:03,420 --> 01:25:06,960
yeah

2221
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:09,599
the day before he made that deal you

2222
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:11,520
know and he still has dozens of lines

2223
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:14,100
that probably no one watching would ever

2224
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:15,420
grow because they're weird and they're

2225
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:16,800
odd and they're from here and they're

2226
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:19,319
from Cambodia and they're from the

2227
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:21,600
highlands of Nepal and they're ugly as

2228
01:25:19,319 --> 01:25:23,939
Sin and he has a love of cannabis and he

2229
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:26,100
loves his family well that's just really

2230
01:25:23,939 --> 01:25:28,859
it isn't it like the people that are

2231
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:30,659
upset all I can say is if you're upset

2232
01:25:28,859 --> 01:25:31,859
about it and if you're worried that you

2233
01:25:30,658 --> 01:25:34,079
know like the mainstream people are

2234
01:25:31,859 --> 01:25:36,059
gonna start seeing some of Buddy stuff

2235
01:25:34,079 --> 01:25:39,119
there was a time where you could buy

2236
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:41,460
Bodhi seeds and that wasn't happening

2237
01:25:39,119 --> 01:25:43,260
and everybody had that chance to support

2238
01:25:41,460 --> 01:25:45,600
him Bodhi should have been more

2239
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:47,520
successful than cookies in my opinion he

2240
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:49,620
should have been way bigger than

2241
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:52,140
compound or any of them it doesn't make

2242
01:25:49,619 --> 01:25:54,719
any sense to me and and people have that

2243
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:56,820
voting privilege with their money that's

2244
01:25:54,719 --> 01:25:58,859
how we vote in our cannabis Community is

2245
01:25:56,819 --> 01:26:00,599
with our money we don't like someone we

2246
01:25:58,859 --> 01:26:03,179
want them gone don't buy their stuff

2247
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:05,340
that's it they'll go away eventually but

2248
01:26:03,179 --> 01:26:07,079
we have that chance with Bodhi and that

2249
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:08,340
we've had the chance with a lot of the

2250
01:26:07,079 --> 01:26:11,340
bigger companies that we're going to

2251
01:26:08,340 --> 01:26:13,139
watch slowly go away and people are

2252
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:15,300
going to get mad at their decisions for

2253
01:26:13,139 --> 01:26:17,219
going away and retiring and doing all

2254
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:19,860
this or just still growing not selling

2255
01:26:17,219 --> 01:26:23,100
seeds but we all had the chance to

2256
01:26:19,859 --> 01:26:25,679
change that and not enough people gave a

2257
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:27,600
care at the time I think in mind and you

2258
01:26:25,679 --> 01:26:30,658
know if you look at it like this because

2259
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:32,039
you know uh breeders unfairly mostly but

2260
01:26:30,658 --> 01:26:34,799
some you know a lot of them are regarded

2261
01:26:32,039 --> 01:26:36,479
as artistes yeah in a sense

2262
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:38,880
um you know you watch some of these like

2263
01:26:36,479 --> 01:26:40,799
uh acceptance speeches for Oscars or

2264
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:42,779
whatever and a lot of famous actors

2265
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:45,659
though admittedly that they took a bunch

2266
01:26:42,779 --> 01:26:47,099
of crappy jobs for work yeah and they

2267
01:26:45,658 --> 01:26:48,960
hope that they get successful enough

2268
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:50,820
that they can take some chances and make

2269
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:53,939
some really cool stuff every once in a

2270
01:26:50,819 --> 01:26:56,819
while in between these commercially

2271
01:26:53,939 --> 01:26:58,439
successful Ventures yeah um you know and

2272
01:26:56,819 --> 01:27:01,079
you know I'm not a musician or whatever

2273
01:26:58,439 --> 01:27:03,419
but if you're a musician and you want to

2274
01:27:01,079 --> 01:27:05,460
survive it really helps if you make a

2275
01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:07,380
hit single every now and again playing

2276
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:09,658
punk rock ain't gonna make you rich as I

2277
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:11,159
found out ain't good you know if you

2278
01:27:09,658 --> 01:27:13,799
know like you know there's a joke oh I

2279
01:27:11,158 --> 01:27:15,539
don't hear a single yeah right are you

2280
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:17,279
gonna get popular are you like because

2281
01:27:15,539 --> 01:27:19,920
so there's an aspect of commercialism

2282
01:27:17,279 --> 01:27:21,840
where sometimes you have to bend a bit

2283
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:24,539
in order to keep doing the cool stuff

2284
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:26,100
that you want to be doing exactly and

2285
01:27:24,539 --> 01:27:28,019
you can be like oh this this artist

2286
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:30,360
should stay completely pure and not even

2287
01:27:28,020 --> 01:27:33,540
touch capitalism but you know we live in

2288
01:27:30,359 --> 01:27:35,579
a capitalistic society and and you know

2289
01:27:33,539 --> 01:27:37,560
people are going to be weighing who to

2290
01:27:35,579 --> 01:27:39,539
work with how to work with them what's

2291
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:41,760
ethical what's not can I change them

2292
01:27:39,539 --> 01:27:43,738
from the inside can I do this can I

2293
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:46,619
improve things can I move it toward in

2294
01:27:43,738 --> 01:27:50,039
my direction a little bit uh and I think

2295
01:27:46,619 --> 01:27:52,079
that goes with a lot of Art

2296
01:27:50,039 --> 01:27:54,179
I wouldn't have taken the chances but he

2297
01:27:52,079 --> 01:27:56,279
did with that particular group I admit

2298
01:27:54,179 --> 01:27:59,100
that like I I wouldn't have done it but

2299
01:27:56,279 --> 01:28:00,719
I'm uh but that's I'm very pessimistic

2300
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:03,000
about everyone and and certain things

2301
01:28:00,719 --> 01:28:04,500
maybe maybe there's a reason he's the

2302
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:06,179
one that did like maybe there's a reason

2303
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:08,579
he was there and he's the one that you

2304
01:28:06,179 --> 01:28:10,679
know got that chance he's he's he's much

2305
01:28:08,579 --> 01:28:12,300
more open to people not all being snakes

2306
01:28:10,679 --> 01:28:15,000
and seeing the good people than someone

2307
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:18,179
like me so oh I would say that and I'm

2308
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:20,579
I'm glad too he is Matt's always telling

2309
01:28:18,179 --> 01:28:22,619
me Oh you should have expected that and

2310
01:28:20,579 --> 01:28:24,420
I'm like oh I don't know he was nice you

2311
01:28:22,619 --> 01:28:26,219
know like whatever I I didn't see any of

2312
01:28:24,420 --> 01:28:28,800
that and he'd be like oh dude you're a

2313
01:28:26,219 --> 01:28:31,800
good Lord I believe you're just you're

2314
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:34,139
just naive and so you know they're I'm

2315
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:36,179
not even like I'm not even saying I like

2316
01:28:34,139 --> 01:28:38,819
like Matt I'm not even saying I defend

2317
01:28:36,179 --> 01:28:41,520
the partnership necessarily I certainly

2318
01:28:38,819 --> 01:28:44,099
defend the person yeah everyone is

2319
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:46,320
capable of making mistakes you know

2320
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:50,219
whether it's a mistake or not will only

2321
01:28:46,319 --> 01:28:51,960
be known in time yeah correct you know

2322
01:28:50,219 --> 01:28:55,739
um because cookie has a bunch of clout

2323
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:57,420
you know and so if um if we widen the

2324
01:28:55,738 --> 01:28:59,939
gene pool like who who do you want them

2325
01:28:57,420 --> 01:29:02,340
to work with seed Junkie they already

2326
01:28:59,939 --> 01:29:05,039
did that yeah exactly Chris compound

2327
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:06,119
yeah you know like like think about the

2328
01:29:05,039 --> 01:29:07,679
people they're already working with

2329
01:29:06,119 --> 01:29:09,479
wouldn't you want somebody with the

2330
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:11,760
power and reach of cookie to work with

2331
01:29:09,479 --> 01:29:13,919
someone cool and bring better things and

2332
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:16,679
try to have some better herb I mean

2333
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:19,260
that's kind of the goal and uh you know

2334
01:29:16,679 --> 01:29:21,658
believe me I wish all of us artists out

2335
01:29:19,260 --> 01:29:23,820
there were independently wealthy and

2336
01:29:21,658 --> 01:29:26,039
were able to make every decision based

2337
01:29:23,819 --> 01:29:29,279
on a strict series of ethics and a punk

2338
01:29:26,039 --> 01:29:30,779
rock ethos of [ __ ] the man yeah you guys

2339
01:29:29,279 --> 01:29:32,519
see what happens you guys seen my

2340
01:29:30,779 --> 01:29:34,859
company over the years it doesn't work

2341
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:36,719
as a company like I I it just doesn't

2342
01:29:34,859 --> 01:29:39,658
you can't you can't just buck everyone

2343
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:41,158
it doesn't work there's a totally random

2344
01:29:39,658 --> 01:29:42,960
story that I always think I talk about

2345
01:29:41,158 --> 01:29:44,879
with Matt because Punk is his world not

2346
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:46,739
really mine but I remember watching this

2347
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:49,440
interview with the the lead singer and

2348
01:29:46,738 --> 01:29:51,779
guitarist of Suicidal Tendencies and he

2349
01:29:49,439 --> 01:29:53,519
was talking about how in punk rock they

2350
01:29:51,779 --> 01:29:56,639
basically at some point want you in your

2351
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:59,580
40s to be homeless dead broke addicted

2352
01:29:56,639 --> 01:30:02,520
to heroin uh all your equipment doesn't

2353
01:29:59,579 --> 01:30:05,219
work and you commit suicide via a bomb

2354
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:08,159
on stage and you go out just like a

2355
01:30:05,219 --> 01:30:09,779
raging Inferno to the man that's punk

2356
01:30:08,158 --> 01:30:11,339
rock yeah and he's like you get a little

2357
01:30:09,779 --> 01:30:13,738
older and he's like you want a guitar

2358
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:16,319
tech yeah you want to be able to sleep

2359
01:30:13,738 --> 01:30:17,819
in a decent room the kids that you made

2360
01:30:16,319 --> 01:30:20,039
you want to actually be able to feed

2361
01:30:17,819 --> 01:30:22,679
them and maybe send them to college even

2362
01:30:20,039 --> 01:30:24,600
though you're punk as [ __ ] yeah you know

2363
01:30:22,679 --> 01:30:26,579
I don't want to strap a bomb to my chest

2364
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:29,520
and die at 45 on stage everything

2365
01:30:26,579 --> 01:30:31,019
breaking screaming howling homeless yeah

2366
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:32,880
but he's like that's what the fans

2367
01:30:31,020 --> 01:30:35,040
expected me and so there's there's

2368
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:37,920
always that push-pull between art and

2369
01:30:35,039 --> 01:30:41,158
commercialism yeah and where on the line

2370
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:43,260
do you fall and you know some and a lot

2371
01:30:41,158 --> 01:30:45,599
of times right

2372
01:30:43,260 --> 01:30:48,600
um in order to make cool art you have to

2373
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:51,840
deal with commercialism yes and we got

2374
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:54,179
lucky for a time and that when 215 came

2375
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:57,360
uh cannabis for a while was quite

2376
01:30:54,179 --> 01:30:59,819
profitable and the risk was lowered

2377
01:30:57,359 --> 01:31:02,519
and it allowed this amazing burst of

2378
01:30:59,819 --> 01:31:04,799
creativity and energy yeah where a lot

2379
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:06,659
of small-time farmers could take their

2380
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:08,400
hearts desire and do whatever they

2381
01:31:06,658 --> 01:31:10,738
wanted with

2382
01:31:08,399 --> 01:31:12,779
and then we grew it to the point where

2383
01:31:10,738 --> 01:31:15,539
it got popular and it went from

2384
01:31:12,779 --> 01:31:18,179
Underground to not underground and then

2385
01:31:15,539 --> 01:31:19,679
big money starts coming in and rich kids

2386
01:31:18,179 --> 01:31:22,199
and everything else and all of a sudden

2387
01:31:19,679 --> 01:31:23,880
the scene's all twacked yeah and then

2388
01:31:22,198 --> 01:31:25,678
they give us Hampton all the hemp Fields

2389
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:28,139
start growing weeding it

2390
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:30,179
everybody gets greedy now we got too

2391
01:31:28,139 --> 01:31:32,819
much weed it's too cheap no one's got

2392
01:31:30,179 --> 01:31:35,100
weed jobs and there you go the quality

2393
01:31:32,819 --> 01:31:36,899
of weed has gone way down you know the

2394
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:39,659
quality in dispensaries is way down I

2395
01:31:36,899 --> 01:31:41,399
mean it's a it's a big shift and so if

2396
01:31:39,658 --> 01:31:44,099
he wants to survive you know everyone's

2397
01:31:41,399 --> 01:31:46,319
looking around at how do I survive to be

2398
01:31:44,100 --> 01:31:48,360
able to do more things that I like yeah

2399
01:31:46,319 --> 01:31:49,679
and everyone's out there is going to

2400
01:31:48,359 --> 01:31:51,658
have to make their own generalized

2401
01:31:49,679 --> 01:31:54,179
opinion about which steps are acceptable

2402
01:31:51,658 --> 01:31:57,000
and which steps aren't I suppose yeah

2403
01:31:54,179 --> 01:31:57,600
that's all within everyone's purview but

2404
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:00,119
um

2405
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:02,699
you know it was surprising to see the

2406
01:32:00,119 --> 01:32:04,679
outpouring of anger because I just don't

2407
01:32:02,698 --> 01:32:08,219
think that they expected it to see it

2408
01:32:04,679 --> 01:32:09,960
from Bodhi I was shocked because this

2409
01:32:08,219 --> 01:32:12,840
was announced like

2410
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:15,179
four or five months ago I wasn't super

2411
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:16,980
shocked to be honest because when it was

2412
01:32:15,179 --> 01:32:18,840
announced they had Berner had to turn

2413
01:32:16,979 --> 01:32:20,759
comments off and he deleted the post

2414
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:22,619
yeah you know so there was a big

2415
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:25,619
outpouring of rage and then it kind of

2416
01:32:22,619 --> 01:32:26,698
quieted down for a while and then you

2417
01:32:25,619 --> 01:32:27,840
know then it happened and then it's

2418
01:32:26,698 --> 01:32:31,259
getting released and it's getting

2419
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:32,760
released with the CD and

2420
01:32:31,260 --> 01:32:35,280
you know

2421
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:37,619
um it it's the community is split in a

2422
01:32:35,279 --> 01:32:40,559
lot of ways right now yeah I think the

2423
01:32:37,619 --> 01:32:42,420
just like the country yeah the the uh

2424
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:43,800
the the there's a fracturing of the

2425
01:32:42,420 --> 01:32:45,000
scene

2426
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:47,100
um and there's a lot of new people

2427
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:48,960
jumping in the scene and they and and

2428
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:51,900
there's a lot of change happening and

2429
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:54,719
it's very it's it's very intense for

2430
01:32:51,899 --> 01:32:56,638
people our age yeah that have been in it

2431
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:59,399
and it's been one kind of consistent way

2432
01:32:56,639 --> 01:33:02,159
for some time yeah this is the this is

2433
01:32:59,399 --> 01:33:04,198
the first real cannabis recession I

2434
01:33:02,158 --> 01:33:07,019
think we've ever seen in cannabis period

2435
01:33:04,198 --> 01:33:09,299
not just our age but any age this severe

2436
01:33:07,020 --> 01:33:12,120
um I'm pretty sure

2437
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:16,560
yeah you know and and so it used to be

2438
01:33:12,119 --> 01:33:19,260
it used to be a small subculture yeah

2439
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:21,420
um and and you know and now it's now

2440
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:24,179
it's like a uh it's gonna be a ginormous

2441
01:33:21,420 --> 01:33:27,060
industry yeah and with that comes

2442
01:33:24,179 --> 01:33:29,158
changes and it and uh you know somebody

2443
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:33,060
like burner couldn't exist 20 years ago

2444
01:33:29,158 --> 01:33:34,859
no no because he's all scared out he's

2445
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:37,080
just all I mean forget about scared out

2446
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:41,219
it's just like there was no marketing of

2447
01:33:37,079 --> 01:33:44,519
self yeah you couldn't be famous

2448
01:33:41,219 --> 01:33:46,139
famous people got arrested yeah you know

2449
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:48,179
and

2450
01:33:46,139 --> 01:33:50,699
and you know there you weren't able to

2451
01:33:48,179 --> 01:33:52,380
Market yourself that way

2452
01:33:50,698 --> 01:33:53,939
and so there's just there's just been a

2453
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:55,440
lot of change and I think change will

2454
01:33:53,939 --> 01:33:57,299
continue to happen

2455
01:33:55,439 --> 01:33:58,859
and the important thing is that the

2456
01:33:57,300 --> 01:34:01,500
people you like need to figure out a way

2457
01:33:58,859 --> 01:34:03,658
