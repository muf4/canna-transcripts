4
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,239
there we go

5
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,619
I just had to play this again I'm gonna

6
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,078
Force everyone to watch it because it's

7
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:48,238
real funny before I started

8
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,219
when I was in high school

9
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:51,439
I tried to activate Straight you know

10
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:54,500

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,920
party in high school

I just

19
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:17,719

a bunch of dude

21
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:31,938
I'm at the same time jerking off at the

22
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,939
same time I guess that's pretty straight

23
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:35,480
[Applause]

24
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:48,420
anyway that [ __ ] was funny had to play

25
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:51,659

26
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:54,240

31
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:13,800
what's up what's up

32
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:17,280
did you get to hear the I just want to

33
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,900
fit in song again I did I did yeah I was

34
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,539
one of the people you forced to watch it

35
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,980
yeah yeah I know it's really good yeah I

36
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:25,159
mean you've always been fascinated by

37
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:27,060
male bonding rituals

38
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:28,620
you know

39
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,378
yeah

40
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,599
I wish I had more hands that's all I

41
00:02:31,378 --> 00:02:35,780
mean it you know make friends that way

42
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:39,479
make better friends

43
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:43,199
oh damn it let's see we're gonna get my

44
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:46,318
trying to get my little skunky guy on oh

45
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:49,039
look at that yeah there he goes

46
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:49,039
all right

47
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,980
here we are here we are okay

48
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:58,739
um let's see what are we gonna start off

49
00:02:55,979 --> 00:03:00,060
with what do we usually start off with I

50
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:02,219
mean we usually start off maybe with

51
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,659
like a general overview of like what

52
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:07,318
we're actually gonna chat about I

53
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:09,299
suppose okay you know so we thought

54
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:12,899
today we would we would talk about like

55
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:15,540
different parts of uh growing and flower

56
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,039
and like what it means for you so we'll

57
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:18,359
try to there'll be times where maybe

58
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,699
we'll get a little technical but we'll

59
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,459
try to make it topical and bring it back

60
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:25,259
to stuff that uh because there's a lot

61
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:27,658
of different ways of growing there's a

62
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:30,719
lot of different ways of uh you know

63
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:33,000
there's a lot of methods right yeah and

64
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:35,878
if there's anything in in weed that

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,120
leads people to religion it's the way

66
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:42,239
that I grow is the best way yeah and I

67
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,219
have the best pot because of this method

68
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,739
right and so it gets really hard to

69
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:47,818
debate any part about it because there's

70
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:50,759
so much

71
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:52,679
there's so much pride I guess yeah I

72
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:54,899
mean it's it's like art you know

73
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,580
everybody's got ego with their art and

74
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,840
if someone tells you that you know it

75
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,000
could be done a little bit better it

76
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,098
hurts something you know so yeah

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
definitely and you know there's there's

78
00:04:02,098 --> 00:04:07,318
aspects of two of like you know one size

79
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,180
fits all

80
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:10,738
yeah sense of depending on what your

81
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,900
goals are and we'll talk about we'll

82
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:14,459
break it down into chunks whether you're

83
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,139
breeding or whether you're growing for

84
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:18,000
Pure heads or whether you're trying to

85
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:20,400
grow commercially on a bit larger of a

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,500
scale like there's different pros and

87
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,299
cons to your approach

88
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,620
they're not all the same so it's really

89
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,360
hard to be like oh I just need to learn

90
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,699
this one thing

91
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,379
and this method if I perfect it will

92
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:33,660
consistently do the best for me no

93
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:36,060
matter what I'm trying to do yep and

94
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,100
that's just not the case you know no

95
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,899
it's just really not the case you know

96
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,759
and then maybe we could talk a little

97
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:43,138
bit about like what those methods do to

98
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,840
the flower

99
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:47,759
sure and some misnomers maybe about how

100
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:50,219
and everybody thinks that like nutrition

101
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,199
is like the only thing

102
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,120
really that messes with it but there's

103
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,040
temperature and there's spectrum and

104
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,740
there's how you treat it afterwards and

105
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,720
all that that kind of goes into it yeah

106
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,160
you know

107
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,199
um you know and so as a result of that

108
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,939
there's like there's a lot of there's a

109
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:07,860
lot of people trying a lot of good good

110
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:10,199
ways to grow cannabis that they're not

111
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,580
putting all the pieces together yeah you

112
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:14,879
know I one of the most common questions

113
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:16,859
I get uh in relation to nutrients and in

114
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,439
feet is

115
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:22,020
um when people email me about a specific

116
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:25,259
strain they'll ask like Hey how do I

117
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:26,698
feed it what's it like and and I try to

118
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:29,520
explain to them the difference between

119
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:31,978
like you know it depends it all depends

120
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:33,659
I don't even know what expression you

121
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:34,978
know you're going for I don't know what

122
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,900
expression the plant's going to give in

123
00:05:34,978 --> 00:05:38,399
the first place in your environment so

124
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:39,839
it's really hard to tell people how

125
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:41,459
you're going to feed because it's not

126
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,500
just strain dependent it's it's

127
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:45,538
individual plant and individual rooms

128
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,459
dependent and I think it'd be a good way

129
00:05:45,538 --> 00:05:49,199
to illustrate it talking about matters

130
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:50,879
it's like trying to be like well this if

131
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,160
you just do this like you can pick up

132
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:55,500
any woman you want yeah you know this

133
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:58,080
this this dating method is just 100

134
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:00,240
effective yeah and doesn't take the

135
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,639
other human being into account you know

136
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,500
and I also thought like this is this is

137
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,319
a little esoteric but there's like a

138
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,180
there's this really cool book

139
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:10,500
um by this he writes the New York Times

140
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,019
or whatever and his name's Michael

141
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,360
Pollan uh and it's called the Botany of

142
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:18,060
Desire yeah yeah it's a great book and

143
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,919
documentary and it's a it's a um you

144
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,680
know it's like a plant's eye view from

145
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:25,560
the world so I thought maybe too like we

146
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:28,199
rarely talk about like what cannabis or

147
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,639
hemp or whatever wants yeah like what

148
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:32,038
it's trying to do and what it's going

149
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,418
for because in order for us to get what

150
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:36,000
we want

151
00:06:33,418 --> 00:06:38,879
right we have to play with what it's

152
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,100
doing yeah to convince it to give us

153
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,899
what we're after yeah because what it

154
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,840
wants isn't necessarily what our end

155
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:47,159
product of smoking it is no and I mean

156
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:50,879
in some cases you know like I mean

157
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:53,520
basically it's most basic level uh the

158
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,560
plant wants to mate create seed continue

159
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:58,198
the progeny of itself

160
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,780
uh it has zero interest in creating good

161
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:03,300
smoke for us yeah that's not seedless

162
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:04,619
seedless is failure genetically to it

163
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,939
yeah

164
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,500
um and so there's a bunch of stuff that

165
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:10,259
that plays into that

166
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,418
you know and we just thought that you

167
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:13,919
know like we I I you know we we listen

168
00:07:12,418 --> 00:07:16,500
to a lot of these things we hear a lot

169
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:18,899
of discussions and mostly what I see is

170
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,160
a bunch of people no offense I'm not

171
00:07:18,899 --> 00:07:21,779
trying to piss anybody off but like

172
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,419
patting themselves on the back for what

173
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:26,758
method they've chose yeah and that's the

174
00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:28,978
superior method and people aren't really

175
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:31,319
interested in hearing different opinions

176
00:07:28,978 --> 00:07:33,240
about things too much yeah you know

177
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:36,000
there's yeah it's so it's it's very like

178
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:39,000
it's very cliquish it is very cliquish

179
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,399
whether you're assault farmer or you use

180
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,959
bottles yeah I mean right there like

181
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:44,939
bottle people or you know that's that's

182
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:47,098
kind of faux pas right now organically

183
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:49,740
you know like not only Organics but no

184
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:53,459
bottles organic yes no bottles no

185
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:56,819
bottles knf living soil you know full

186
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:58,379
salts synganic uh you know there's all

187
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:01,080
the I even you know all these different

188
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:02,759
things play into it and then like and I

189
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:03,598
you know I mean I think that there's I

190
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:05,400
think that there's a lot of

191
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:08,159
misunderstanding that goes into all of

192
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:09,598
it yeah right and so you hear all these

193
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,880
there's all these talks I'm not going to

194
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:13,680
sit here and say that I'm some you know

195
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:15,300
there's other more intelligent people

196
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,879
that can talk about like the Pure

197
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,379
Nutrition aspect of it I can give a

198
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:21,598
general overview that will probably work

199
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:23,580
but mostly what we're talking about is

200
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:25,800
like end results

201
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:28,318
and how to manipulate your plants to get

202
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,120
what you want yeah right and there's

203
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,959
different goals and it's not all the

204
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:36,360
same yeah I mean like like I've talked

205
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:37,918
about this a lot in the past uh choosing

206
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,379
for selection

207
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:43,139
um a lot of when I choose a plant for

208
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:44,639
selection or for Keepers I'm I'm

209
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:46,799
choosing a plant for Keepers for

210
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:49,139
breeding you know whereas someone

211
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:51,299
someone else's keeper may not

212
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:54,000
be that because they're looking for an

213
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:55,439
immediate production plan that has all

214
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,820
the traits they want right there I want

215
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,920
something that's going to have the

216
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:01,080
traits that it passes down as opposed to

217
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:03,419
what it's showing up in itself you know

218
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,278
yeah Neville and so the old timers used

219
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:08,099
to talk about that that sometimes the

220
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,179
breast the best breeders were not the

221
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,580
plant that they would put into

222
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:13,620
production from that same line oh yeah

223
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,000
yeah very different things there could

224
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,339
be there could there could be they could

225
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,559
be the same and they could also just end

226
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:21,839
up being different we end up breeding

227
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:24,419
with production plants yeah because

228
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:27,480
those are what survived yeah

229
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:28,979
for the most part you know uh you know

230
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,539
trying to you know it's not like there's

231
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,278
a bunch of even amongst Traders and

232
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:34,980
collectors like ourselves

233
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:37,860
we're not you're not trading old males

234
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:40,080
yeah right no no but you're not getting

235
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,000
like oh that's the 98 male of this and

236
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,519
this you know like no no that doesn't

237
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,139
you're lucky if you're lucky if like you

238
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:48,000
know you'd get a female from that long

239
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:49,559
ago yeah

240
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,419
yeah I don't I don't think I've ever

241
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:53,879
heard of anybody keeping old males like

242
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:55,679
that from uh the Dutch days

243
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:56,759
no I mean some people some of them do

244
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,319
but they're certainly never going to

245
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:00,600
trade them for you they view them as

246
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,580
like the Bedrock of their company oh so

247
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,839
much G13 Hayes Mill that's one that's

248
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:07,320
one that did make it out now that I

249
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:09,899
think about it yeah but yeah rare yeah

250
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,940
very rare rare you know one example now

251
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:13,500
with with STS and stuff like that it's

252
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,180
even become more rare because they've

253
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,299
eliminated the mail in a lot of cases

254
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:20,278
yeah so I don't know maybe we could give

255
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:23,159
it we could start because it is a little

256
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:24,600
rambly or whatever but uh we could we

257
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:26,338
could start maybe with like what's your

258
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,980
goal so like I was gonna break it down

259
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:31,440
basically into like three like big

260
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,420
chunks right yeah there's like growing

261
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,580
for you which is basically trying to

262
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:37,799
make it as heady as possible and usually

263
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:39,440
relatively small scale then there's

264
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:41,879
growing for seed

265
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,540
and then there's growing at a larger

266
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:47,338
scale for uh production yeah and there's

267
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:49,860
various obvious there's various grades

268
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:51,360
and levels of that and that's a lot of

269
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,278
what people are faced with today in

270
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:57,060
terms of like how

271
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:59,700
um How do you scale up headies yeah yeah

272
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:01,319
that's been a major major problem for

273
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,300
people yeah and people are realizing

274
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,920
that like oh like you know this this

275
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:07,078
method that I've done for 20 years it's

276
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:09,360
worked great in my two greenhouses yeah

277
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:12,659
well now I've got six 10 000 square foot

278
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,399
licenses and my weed's not as nice yeah

279
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:15,958
and I think a lot of people convince

280
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,458
themselves at the beginning of wrecked

281
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:19,078
that they were totally gonna be able to

282
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:21,299
scale up you know like it shouldn't be

283
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:23,219
hard you know right

284
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:25,679
anyway it just didn't work out that way

285
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,420
and not only not only from a difficulty

286
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:29,399
standpoint but also certain things that

287
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:32,099
might be perfectly economically feasible

288
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:34,259
at a certain scale you know inputs that

289
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,800
you might be using or whatever

290
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:39,299
um might not scale up yeah yeah right

291
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:40,559
and the amount of liquid you're going to

292
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:41,699
go through and the amount of this and

293
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:45,119
the amount of that and the amount of

294
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:47,579
Labor it might entail yeah uh you know

295
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,220
and so and and so all those things all

296
00:11:47,578 --> 00:11:52,799
those things play into it right so

297
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,879
maybe we'll just start real General and

298
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:55,979
we'll talk about like the difference

299
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:58,078
between like growing good weed and

300
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,360
growing for seed okay

301
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:01,919
right okay so

302
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,120
you know if you're growing if you're

303
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,819
growing if you're trying to grow for

304
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,320
good weed these days that means seedless

305
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:10,980
so that means you're going to trick the

306
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:14,339
plant into constantly going waiting for

307
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,539
pollen That Never Comes yes right and so

308
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:16,800
what you're trying to do is you're

309
00:12:15,539 --> 00:12:18,899
trying to give it you know enough

310
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:21,659
nitrogen enough Badger boost or whatever

311
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:24,360
and to get it to a certain size yet it's

312
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:26,879
a flower set and then grow good flour

313
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:29,100
Harvest it smoke it that's your gig yeah

314
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:32,278
right and so that requires a certain

315
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:34,139
kind of nutrition right where if you're

316
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:35,639
growing from seed

317
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:37,799
um you're planning on pollinating it

318
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:39,778
right and then since it's going to be

319
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:41,519
making babies like seeds inside itself

320
00:12:39,778 --> 00:12:43,078
you'll probably give it a lot more

321
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,879
nitrogen and you'll give it a lot more

322
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:46,979
of a mix

323
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:50,820
um that is is very different than if

324
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:54,240
you'd smoke it yeah I I tend to uh feed

325
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:56,639
heavy nitrogen during uh flour for seeds

326
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,560
uh I feed it like tomatoes a very tomato

327
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,959
regimen is great for seeds keeping them

328
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:03,899
healthy and viable but

329
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:05,699
um I I flip out like if people feed

330
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:08,759
sinsamila like that because it just to

331
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:10,680
me it just ruins it you know when you

332
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:12,659
just flood it with nitrogen for the most

333
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:14,099
part I mean and so maybe there's an

334
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,939
aspect that people should realize here

335
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,740
so

336
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,060
one of the interesting things is there's

337
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:21,060
this I'll give a plug there's this

338
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:23,699
company called Canna okay uh which is a

339
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:26,699
Dutch company that designed nutrition

340
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:28,920
for cannabis right and the reason why

341
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,420
they're special is that for a super long

342
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:31,979
time when people were developing

343
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:33,539
nutrition

344
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,920
um they couldn't test it on cannabis

345
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:39,000
because it was illegal

346
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:40,919
yeah but cannot could so can uh

347
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,620
um you know they they were able actually

348
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:45,539
to grow different plants you know their

349
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:48,120
cannabis different ways and then test

350
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:51,179
how the plant actually uptook nutrient

351
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,639
right so they had this method of like

352
00:13:51,179 --> 00:13:54,719
give it just enough and nothing more

353
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:56,278
yeah

354
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,200
right where like I would say American

355
00:13:56,278 --> 00:13:59,759
companies are more super-sized me like

356
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:03,000
we'll sell the customer way more than

357
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:05,399
they need like Advanced the 32 product

358
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,259
[ __ ] sweet yeah or you know General

359
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:10,860
hydroponic you know I I just mean like

360
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:13,319
the usage rates it's like go heavy put a

361
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:15,180
bunch in there right and so what happens

362
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,560
with you know from a plant's perspective

363
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:18,659
right

364
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:21,419
um you know plants will sit there and

365
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:22,919
what they want to do is they have no

366
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:25,500
idea that there's like humans taking

367
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:27,479
care of them really right so they want

368
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:30,299
to soak up as much food as they possibly

369
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,159
can within themselves so that when the

370
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:34,259
food starts to run low

371
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:37,259
they have enough left inside themselves

372
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:40,919
to like carry on the process of making

373
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:42,120
seed yes right so like back in the day

374
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:43,979
you see a lot of people they're like oh

375
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,500
I want to pack on weight on my flower

376
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:49,440
right and they would like give boosters

377
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:51,120
or something heavy at the end yeah and

378
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,100
then you just you end up with unused

379
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,620
nutrient in your stuff and what can I

380
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:58,019
figured out is that if you gave it at

381
00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:00,480
the at the like early mid part of flower

382
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:04,259
say like week three on a 10 week strain

383
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:07,680
right then the plant would have the next

384
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:10,139
month to use up that excess yeah and

385
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:11,578
grow all that flour and boost itself and

386
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:14,339
then it would still be running out

387
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:16,078
running low towards the end yeah because

388
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:17,339
what you want is since you're going to

389
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:19,379
trick the plant and you're never going

390
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:21,360
to seed it you don't want a bunch of

391
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:25,379
that excess stored inside the plant

392
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,820
itself no in general no right and so

393
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:29,159
that's what happens sometimes when

394
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:31,800
people like quote unquote pump it or

395
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:33,659
they ride a high EC or they have a lot

396
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:36,659
of organic nutrition that's like their

397
00:15:33,659 --> 00:15:37,338
soil's hot the plant just soaks up a

398
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:39,958
bunch

399
00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:41,579
and it and it's got a bunch in there

400
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:43,859
because it's trying to make sure when it

401
00:15:41,578 --> 00:15:45,479
runs out it has enough to make seed yeah

402
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:49,379
it doesn't know you're gonna make

403
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:52,440
seedless yeah so you have to like plan

404
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:53,278
your nutrition around what you're trying

405
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,320
to do

406
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:56,458
yeah

407
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,260
if a plant knew that it was going to be

408
00:15:56,458 --> 00:16:00,419
seedless it just it would probably not

409
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:03,299
put so much energy into making the

410
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:06,179
little hairs you know oh yeah and I mean

411
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:08,879
you know like our buddy uh you know CSI

412
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:10,198
who grows in beds in his rooms that he

413
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:11,698
makes seed I mean he puts enough

414
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:14,458
nutrition in there for six or seven

415
00:16:11,698 --> 00:16:16,620
months yeah he mostly feeds water

416
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:18,179
because he's not concerned it's really

417
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,679
high nitrogen it's not something he

418
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:22,198
would ever do if he was growing for a

419
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:23,638
flower for Market yeah it's like a

420
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:26,039
completely different mix and that's why

421
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:27,839
it's so bunk uh you know when he talks

422
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:28,980
about like when it fails people act like

423
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,800
oh well then you just got a bunch of

424
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:34,740
good heavy weed yeah no and he's like no

425
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:36,659
I got a bunch of overly nitrogen you

426
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,339
know we're not gonna burn the right way

427
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:41,219
like it's not going to come out heads

428
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:44,100
because it was it was a mix for seeds

429
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:46,139
for seed creation yeah you know and for

430
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,659
to grow heads you kind of want to give

431
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:50,820
the plan everything that it needs and

432
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:53,578
then ideally let it use up its excess

433
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:55,379
before you're done yeah

434
00:16:53,578 --> 00:16:57,539
it's also why it doesn't show a lot of

435
00:16:55,379 --> 00:17:00,480
pictures of the actual seed process

436
00:16:57,539 --> 00:17:03,719
making because it's not pretty like to

437
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:06,419
feed it correctly to uh to to have it

438
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:09,480
making healthy seeds it's not a visually

439
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:10,679
appealing plant you know some people and

440
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,900
the majority people wouldn't understand

441
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:15,360
that part they don't even know it's

442
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:18,120
doing a great job of making thick

443
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,500
healthy tiger striped seeds that are

444
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:21,000
that are going to be good for customers

445
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,220
but it's not going to look pretty where

446
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,619
if he has different rooms for instance

447
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:27,838
that he's grow he's using to do like

448
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:29,699
seed pops and experiments yeah he's

449
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:32,759
gonna like Fino hunt and see what they

450
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:34,679
are those soil beds will be mixed at a

451
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:36,538
different ratio yeah

452
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:38,820
you know it'll be a lot less nitrogen

453
00:17:36,538 --> 00:17:39,839
you know it'll be a lot more scaled for

454
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:42,659
flour

455
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:43,980
yeah you know and then you know there's

456
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,558
and then there's an there's there's

457
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:48,240
other aspects too where it's like plants

458
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:50,160
really are like people

459
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,599
in the sense that you know you've got

460
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,400
your friends that can eat whatever they

461
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:55,019
want and like you know and they're and

462
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,160
they stay thin as a rail and you get

463
00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:58,220
your plants that like look at a potato

464
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,538
chip and get intent gain 10 pounds

465
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:02,819
plants do that same thing they eat at

466
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:04,558
different rates yeah they have different

467
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:07,500
feeding requirements they have different

468
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:11,220
root systems they drink different

469
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:13,440
and so what becomes what becomes hard is

470
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,880
like you know I've always thought when I

471
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,558
was doing bigger [ __ ]

472
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,940
that you're trying to put plants that

473
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:20,160
drink the same

474
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:22,080
and eat the same

475
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,240
in the same area

476
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:27,359
yeah right because I've had situations

477
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:31,859
where I'm burning one plant or one line

478
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:34,379
and the other line wants more food yeah

479
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:37,019
right yeah anytime I have Urkle in the

480
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:38,340
room that's going on yeah or or you know

481
00:18:37,019 --> 00:18:40,918
you're trying to grow something that

482
00:18:38,339 --> 00:18:42,720
drinks a lot and really fast versus

483
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:45,059
something that like drinks slower like

484
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,620
Kush and you don't need to water that

485
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:50,038
thing as much so you end up over

486
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:51,538
watering it to compensate you know and

487
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:54,119
that's what makes like that's that's

488
00:18:51,538 --> 00:18:56,640
honestly like people dis monocropping

489
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:59,399
but that's why a lot of people like to

490
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,620
Mono crop yeah because you can dial in

491
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,900
your nutrient regimen or how you're

492
00:19:01,619 --> 00:19:06,418
feeding your plant or your style

493
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:08,700
right to fit that crop like we have a

494
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:10,919
good buddy pip uh souvenir Seed Cow or

495
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,419
whatever and he talks about

496
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:14,820
um you know he was at our party one year

497
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:17,759
remember he was he was blown away by how

498
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:19,200
good that diesel was yeah and he said

499
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:22,019
you know it was it was you know the cut

500
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,120
was from him at the time and you know he

501
00:19:22,019 --> 00:19:25,440
was used to putting one or two in the

502
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:27,599
corner

503
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,058
and he couldn't feed it the way he'd

504
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:32,459
feed a whole room of sour yeah so it

505
00:19:30,058 --> 00:19:34,319
would come out nice but not perfect yeah

506
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,880
you know because it's one of those

507
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:37,558
things where it it had different

508
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,640
requirements than the rest of the stuff

509
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:40,558
he was doing

510
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,720
yeah so it wouldn't come out as nice

511
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:44,700
yeah sour is also one of those where

512
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,940
it's like [ __ ] you miss it you miss

513
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:49,740
it yeah it's very easy to miss you know

514
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,600
it's finicky and so

515
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:53,099
you know there's an aspect to that where

516
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:55,019
people think that there's a

517
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:57,178
one-size-fits all there's a one method

518
00:19:55,019 --> 00:19:59,940
they can they can take the method they

519
00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:01,980
know and apply it to anything I mean you

520
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:05,400
start to see there's these like A5 and

521
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:06,960
C5 and the cough and pith and Cuban

522
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,500
black Haze are starting to gain in

523
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,058
popularity or even GMO right yeah if

524
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,619
you're gonna have a plant that takes 12

525
00:20:12,058 --> 00:20:15,178
to 15 weeks

526
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:16,500
you're going to have to feed it

527
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:18,960
differently than a plant that takes

528
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,279
eight to ten yep

529
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,720
you're going you're going to have to

530
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:22,859
you're gonna have to veg it for longer

531
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,798
you're gonna have to give it a different

532
00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:28,259
mix and just so people know it's not

533
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:29,220
like the mixed dictates what happens to

534
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:31,200
the plant

535
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:34,200
the plants trying to feed on what it

536
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,279
wants yeah and it's either there or it's

537
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,259
not

538
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:39,058
and I think that's a misconception like

539
00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:40,980
maybe we could talk about that for a

540
00:20:39,058 --> 00:20:44,399
second where like the plant absorbs

541
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:47,640
salts yes that's what it absorbs right

542
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:51,720
so if you're feeding GH or

543
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:55,140
you know I don't know uh you know eagle

544
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:58,558
or 20 20 or you know or yeah any kind of

545
00:20:55,140 --> 00:21:01,500
salt or liquid chem nutrition you're

546
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:04,200
giving it like the 17 major and macro

547
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:07,619
elements like in like an IV basically

548
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:09,779
yeah right but if you if you're fully

549
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:12,839
organic you're still feeding it those

550
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:14,700
same salts it's just they're in longer

551
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:17,459
chains so you have to get various

552
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:19,519
bacteria and and fungi and stuff to

553
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:21,779
break it down yeah make it available

554
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:23,519
right and so

555
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:25,139
like people don't get that they're like

556
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:26,940
oh you you know the plant and if you

557
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:30,120
break it if you took a perfectly derived

558
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:31,798
organic salt and a salt that GH you're

559
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:33,658
cutting edge or somebody throws in their

560
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:35,519
mix you couldn't tell the difference

561
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:38,400
under a microscope

562
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:40,139
yeah I I don't even know like even if

563
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,179
you were a soil scientist you could

564
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,259
right no that doesn't mean they're the

565
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:45,679
same thing

566
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:49,140
that's not that's not true so it's like

567
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,880
because like basically like you know

568
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,640
chem is like you know our understanding

569
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,659
of what the plant needs

570
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,100
organic is more like if you get it

571
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:57,659
perfect it gives the plant everything

572
00:21:56,099 --> 00:21:59,639
that it needs and then there's a bunch

573
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:01,860
of like relationships with the with the

574
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,480
soil itself that like it likes and we

575
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:05,158
don't really understand

576
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:09,360
you know I have a question I have a

577
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:11,460
question for you so I I am not worldly

578
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:13,139
or knowledgeable about organic feeding

579
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:15,360
I've always been like a house and garden

580
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,280
Canada type dude bottles sure and that's

581
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:17,939
just what I rocked with you know

582
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:22,558
um

583
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:23,880
so when you want to force the plant to

584
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:25,980
drink what you wanted when you're doing

585
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:29,159
Organics do you just do something to

586
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:30,659
lower the ph or raise the ph to no you

587
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:33,179
have to you basically when you're doing

588
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:35,100
Organics it was I mean there's different

589
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:36,780
approaches like there's bottles like for

590
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:39,839
instance like to use the same thing

591
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:41,940
Canna biocana if you buy organic bottles

592
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:43,859
you're essentially buying things where

593
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:46,019
like the company has taken the time to

594
00:22:43,859 --> 00:22:48,658
sort of like cook it or ferment it or

595
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:50,879
Brew it or whatever method yeah and

596
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:53,159
those salts are more available than just

597
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,980
adding raw amendments to the Earth

598
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:57,539
okay yeah so like for instance we you

599
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,679
know if if you were if you're gonna be

600
00:22:57,538 --> 00:23:01,140
that kind of guy where you're going to

601
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:03,120
get soil and you want to amend it a lot

602
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:04,559
of times you would get it and all you

603
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:06,839
want to do is raw amendments you'd

604
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:08,279
probably get it add your raw amendments

605
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:11,579
and let it cook for a month or two

606
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:12,298
before you'd even ever use it yeah you

607
00:23:11,579 --> 00:23:13,740
know

608
00:23:12,298 --> 00:23:15,538
um and then because what you're trying

609
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:17,940
to do is you're trying to like get all

610
00:23:15,538 --> 00:23:20,400
those all that bacteria and fungi and

611
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:22,740
everything time to break down the

612
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,298
organic food in there

613
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:26,220
and make it available

614
00:23:24,298 --> 00:23:28,139
right because that's the issue right so

615
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:30,900
the big difference is like when you feed

616
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:33,299
salt you can guarantee that the plant

617
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:35,340
the the availability is there

618
00:23:33,298 --> 00:23:37,319
yeah if the temperature is right and the

619
00:23:35,339 --> 00:23:39,178
pH is right and the mix is right and

620
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:40,558
your salt it's going to get all that

621
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:43,980
food

622
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:46,259
inorganics and hoping that food is there

623
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:48,120
but it has to be at a certain pH like it

624
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:51,119
a certain pH as nitrogen can't be

625
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:53,158
carried right certain certain pH chem or

626
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:55,678
organic the the plant has to have that

627
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:57,900
pH to absorb it through its roots yeah

628
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,480
and certain ones like nitrogen is more

629
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:02,519
available at certain pH and yeah there's

630
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,380
there's a rain there's like a chart and

631
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:06,298
that's kind of why people

632
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:08,760
um they give you that range for cannabis

633
00:24:06,298 --> 00:24:11,158
yeah is because you know you get five

634
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:12,419
and a half versus 5.8 or something yeah

635
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:14,520
there's going to be certain things that

636
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:18,960
are more available than in the mid sixes

637
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:21,058
and vice versa right and it's usually uh

638
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,100
you start out lower and up higher right

639
00:24:21,058 --> 00:24:25,319
yeah I mean if you want to do it that

640
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:26,639
way so you know it's it's it's one of

641
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:29,279
those things where like if you have a

642
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,960
well-buffered organic soil it's probably

643
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:34,200
something you don't have to think about

644
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,240
okay if you know uh but it also depends

645
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,279
like if you've got a great soil but your

646
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,500
water is ph9 coming out because it's

647
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:43,139
well water yeah you might need to treat

648
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:46,558
your water to not make the life of the

649
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:50,340
microbial life in your soil harder okay

650
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:52,379
right but yeah so there's an aspect to

651
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:53,939
it where it's like you know and I don't

652
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:55,799
think most people most people look at it

653
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:57,600
it's where it's like salts are sort of

654
00:24:55,798 --> 00:24:59,940
like a cheat code

655
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:03,538
you know where Organics is like the pure

656
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:05,700
way to go right and I don't well I mean

657
00:25:03,538 --> 00:25:07,200
there's an aspect to that I I do think

658
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,240
it's true but I also think that there's

659
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,220
some Organics that's dirtier

660
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,140
than Salt

661
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:14,759
you know people think that like salt is

662
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:17,159
made in some kind of crazy lab when

663
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:19,919
really it's like mined minerals that are

664
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:21,720
refined to a certain Purity and when

665
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,240
you're talking hydroponic Purity that's

666
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:27,120
like one step below like pharmaceutical

667
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,819
grade so it's really really clean and

668
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:32,339
it's designed to run through aerial Jets

669
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:35,519
sprayers drippers all kinds of [ __ ] not

670
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:36,658
clock yeah for the most part yeah you

671
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:38,400
know

672
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:40,740
um and all and all that and so you know

673
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,360
it's it's low in heavy metals uh the

674
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,620
good ones

675
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:45,418
um you know and that's another thing too

676
00:25:43,619 --> 00:25:47,939
is like when people

677
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:50,460
people started uh you know and then you

678
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:52,440
go organic right and so organic is a

679
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:54,600
label but I don't think most people get

680
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:57,720
that a lot of the organic stuff that you

681
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:59,699
get is byproducts from other Industries

682
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:03,179
I didn't know that you didn't know that

683
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:05,759
so no if you get I'll give you a perfect

684
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:08,880
example right if you get bone meal or

685
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:10,200
blood meal yeah okay that's organic by

686
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,559
law

687
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:15,538
but it comes from major slaughterhouses

688
00:26:13,558 --> 00:26:18,240
well that makes sense the cows aren't

689
00:26:15,538 --> 00:26:19,019
organic yeah they weren't fed organic

690
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,400
food

691
00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:23,158
you could be getting McDonald's

692
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,860
hamburger cows yeah and your bone and

693
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:27,960
blood meal Burger King Wendy's right

694
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:30,000
think about like the biggest meat buyers

695
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,558
and producers and that's all mixed

696
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,240
together and it's all it's all the same

697
00:26:31,558 --> 00:26:34,740
and there's not actually a way to

698
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:37,140
differentiate unless you're really lucky

699
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:40,319
and you know an organic farm yeah but

700
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:41,759
it's all certified organic

701
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:43,980
right is one better than the other

702
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:46,500
though like realistically so bone meal

703
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,960
is Ground Up Bones from cows right okay

704
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:51,380
blood meal is the juice and the sluice

705
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:54,240
that comes off the slaughterhouse floor

706
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:57,000
and they collect it and like powderize

707
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,819
it delicious right feather meal is the

708
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,380
same [ __ ] it's a byproduct from the the

709
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:03,359
poultry industry

710
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:06,480
oh I didn't know that yeah that's better

711
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:09,538
sense okay you know pulled turkey uh

712
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:12,538
chickens you know uh all the parts that

713
00:27:09,538 --> 00:27:16,200
they can't sell you yeah ground up and

714
00:27:12,538 --> 00:27:17,640
turned into fertilizer okay right so you

715
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,200
have an aspect where it's like oh I'm

716
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,360
fully organic

717
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,740
and then you end up like in the I use

718
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:24,000
bone meal and blood meal and feather

719
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:26,220
meal and this and that and you're like

720
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,079
holy [ __ ] you know yeah because it's

721
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:31,079
it's it's legally organic it's got the

722
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:33,839
legal label Yeah by law but it doesn't

723
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:35,699
come from organic animals blood meal

724
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:37,558
smells like girls periods it's gross

725
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,778
well yeah it is and you know the issue

726
00:27:37,558 --> 00:27:41,940
the issue used to become too where it's

727
00:27:39,778 --> 00:27:44,519
like you know when we used to be gorilla

728
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:46,980
and stuff like that or whatever uh when

729
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:49,019
I first got to California you used blood

730
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:51,659
meal or something like that and all of a

731
00:27:49,019 --> 00:27:54,379
sudden you get it wet and the the

732
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:57,059
vultures smell it yeah

733
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:59,159
and they start circling or the dogs want

734
00:27:57,058 --> 00:28:00,418
to get into it or a bear comes and wants

735
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:02,460
to rip your [ __ ] up because it's not

736
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:05,100
you'd go put a bunch of awesome fish

737
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:08,159
Emulsion in your [ __ ] and then you get a

738
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:11,399
black bear yeah who thinks that there's

739
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,720
fish and starts digging for it yeah you

740
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,940
know and then you're and then you're

741
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,679
[ __ ] you know and so

742
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:18,240
there's an aspect where it's like people

743
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:20,460
think there's a free lunch and it's like

744
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,380
it takes even if you're using that stuff

745
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:24,900
it takes it a while for it to break down

746
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:27,179
some of it's available quick some of it

747
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:30,360
not so much and like fish Emulsion and

748
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:33,179
all that that's all from the you know

749
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:35,038
the seafood industry yeah it's all the

750
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:37,200
it's all the brewed bits of the nasty

751
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:38,819
parts that they can't sell you some of

752
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,740
the some people like build the soil or

753
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:44,339
whatever you know like some people have

754
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:46,798
stopped using uh bone meal because of

755
00:28:44,339 --> 00:28:48,599
the issues with cows and mad cow and

756
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:50,819
just all the chem yeah and they're

757
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:53,158
selling you fish bone meal

758
00:28:50,819 --> 00:28:55,319
okay because you know because it's it's

759
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:56,580
it's still bones and still calcium and

760
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:58,558
all that but it comes from the seafood

761
00:28:56,579 --> 00:29:00,000
industry because it's not quite as toxic

762
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:02,639
yeah

763
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,619
even though it's organic so

764
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,559
you could have an organic style where

765
00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:09,359
you could pick all these inputs where I

766
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:11,759
would rather use Canna or Cutting Edge

767
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:15,298
yeah I would think it would it would be

768
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:17,278
cleaner to me yeah you know even stuff

769
00:29:15,298 --> 00:29:19,619
that's clean like bakuano or seabird

770
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:21,720
guano right where they don't they're not

771
00:29:19,619 --> 00:29:25,319
there's obviously not like Factory back

772
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:27,899
one or factory seabird yeah you know you

773
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:29,879
are destroying Habitat to get it yeah

774
00:29:27,898 --> 00:29:32,519
right there for bats they're going into

775
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,260
caves and for seabirds they're going to

776
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:36,839
a lot of habitat and they're scraping

777
00:29:34,259 --> 00:29:39,359
the [ __ ] off it literally to send it to

778
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:41,819
you yeah and you know do you know why

779
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:44,579
that [ __ ] comes from like Indonesia and

780
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:48,000
Peru and all that not America

781
00:29:44,579 --> 00:29:49,439
I I don't know because America has OSHA

782
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,419
and you can't send a 10 year old boy

783
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,700
with a bucket and a shovel into a cave

784
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:55,740
that's a good point I have watched him

785
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:57,298
collected one I'm dead seriously that

786
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:58,679
shit's [ __ ] up they do it where it's

787
00:29:57,298 --> 00:30:01,019
super cheap and there's not a bunch of

788
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:02,340
labor law and they'll do an industrial

789
00:30:01,019 --> 00:30:03,898
style and they'll have a bunch of people

790
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:05,398
with buckets and they'll have like a

791
00:30:03,898 --> 00:30:07,019
bunch of bulldozers and they'll be

792
00:30:05,398 --> 00:30:09,599
[ __ ] up some huge we have plenty of

793
00:30:07,019 --> 00:30:10,980
bats in America yeah yeah it's just

794
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:13,859
cheaper to get it out of Peru or

795
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:16,679
Indonesia and ship it because they don't

796
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:18,538
have to obey labor laws yeah and kids

797
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:20,220
are great workers they're great yeah you

798
00:30:18,538 --> 00:30:21,658
know and there's not child labor in

799
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:23,759
there so a kid with a bucket you know

800
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:25,200
and so it's good I'm not I believe me

801
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:26,700
I've used tons of back wano and

802
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,319
seaburguano and stuff so I'm not Disney

803
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,538
I'm just saying that that's the reality

804
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:32,460
of getting it yeah yeah it's a great

805
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:34,200
nutrient I love plants from I love

806
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:37,500
Brewing teas with it and stuff like that

807
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:39,360
it's like it's good stuff but uh it's

808
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:41,398
not exactly harvested environmentally

809
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:43,798
soundly and what happens to the people

810
00:30:41,398 --> 00:30:46,439
isn't the greatest thing I remember the

811
00:30:43,798 --> 00:30:48,538
first time I got sent home with tea from

812
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:52,320
the hydroponic store my very first trip

813
00:30:48,538 --> 00:30:53,759
got sent home with compost tea and I

814
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:54,960
really sat there wondering if I was

815
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:56,460
supposed to drink this like if it was

816
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,720
some hippie Brew like that I was

817
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,480
supposed to drink I didn't understand it

818
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:02,640
was for the plants

819
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:06,058
yeah so you know I mean back you know

820
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:08,880
now we are really in a golden age of

821
00:31:06,058 --> 00:31:11,579
teas and composts and inputs and

822
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,659
availability I'll I'll say that like I

823
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:15,599
mean I used to work in the hydro

824
00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:18,240
industry and so I I got to know how they

825
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:20,038
sourced a bunch of amendments what the

826
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,839
difference is in quality were and why

827
00:31:20,038 --> 00:31:23,339
sir why why certain companies were

828
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:25,439
cleaner and better

829
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:28,199
yeah versus other ones that were using

830
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,600
cheap inputs and covering it up yeah

831
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,278
right and now you have a situation that

832
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:34,379
goes on it's really a bummer but it's

833
00:31:32,278 --> 00:31:36,058
like there's a lot of stuff that's from

834
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:39,059
the ocean that we used to consider super

835
00:31:36,058 --> 00:31:42,000
heavy right but now that they test for

836
00:31:39,058 --> 00:31:43,379
heavy metals it's dangerous yeah because

837
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,240
it's got too much lead or too much

838
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:47,700
arsenic or too much cadmium or whatever

839
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:49,500
in it yeah you know so you could you

840
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:51,298
could be like Oh I'm using fish Emulsion

841
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:54,480
and this and that and I've got all this

842
00:31:51,298 --> 00:31:55,619
amazing stuff and I even have a hook and

843
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,899
you're putting all this stuff in there

844
00:31:55,619 --> 00:32:00,418
and then your weed PAT test high for

845
00:31:57,898 --> 00:32:02,099
heavy metals yeah I mean that's why they

846
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:04,020
tell like women you're only supposed to

847
00:32:02,099 --> 00:32:05,879
eat so much tuna and so much big fish

848
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:07,679
when you're pregnant oh yeah because the

849
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,120
Mercury because the Mercury well that

850
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,298
stuff is in you know you want to get

851
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:13,979
some amazing crab or shrimp or whatever

852
00:32:11,298 --> 00:32:16,139
yeah it's got it in it

853
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:18,839
because they live in a bath of it right

854
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:20,399
yeah and so in some cases it's like

855
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:22,678
people are like oh

856
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:26,099
you know salt to the evil bad choice

857
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:29,580
yeah and Organics is the smooth reliable

858
00:32:26,099 --> 00:32:31,139
choice and I think that that there's you

859
00:32:29,579 --> 00:32:33,418
know there's like it's more complex than

860
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:34,740
that yeah and you can grow good weed

861
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:36,480
with both

862
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,620
you know there's a lot of organic weed

863
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,880
that's grown that I don't consider

864
00:32:37,619 --> 00:32:40,019
that's that nice

865
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,760
yeah

866
00:32:40,019 --> 00:32:45,058
yeah you know oh yeah yeah I've seen

867
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:47,879
some knf [ __ ] be [ __ ] wild yeah and

868
00:32:45,058 --> 00:32:50,759
so maybe maybe we should like get out of

869
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:53,100
the esoteric for a bit and I'll tell a

870
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:55,019
story that like like is pertinent to

871
00:32:53,099 --> 00:32:58,379
people smoking right

872
00:32:55,019 --> 00:33:00,658
so I used to go I used to go to the

873
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:02,340
Oregon Country Fair okay which is right

874
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:04,679
outside Eureka it's like a famous hippie

875
00:33:02,339 --> 00:33:05,879
Festival it still goes on uh it got

876
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:09,059
delayed a little bit with covet or

877
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:10,799
whatever but so I I went up there and I

878
00:33:09,058 --> 00:33:13,259
was I was from Chicago and I lived out

879
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:15,839
in Cali for a few years and all that but

880
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:18,000
so I was all salt back then

881
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:20,879
because where I grew up and where I came

882
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,259
up like growing weed you use salt I

883
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,120
lived in apartments like there wasn't

884
00:33:22,259 --> 00:33:26,038
you weren't like grabbing soil you

885
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:29,219
weren't you didn't have a backyard you

886
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:30,778
know like you it was like so anyway but

887
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,700
you move out to Mendo and it's like a

888
00:33:30,778 --> 00:33:34,079
lot more it's a lot more like back to

889
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,460
the Earth back to the land or whatever

890
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:38,339
so there's a lot of people out here that

891
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:41,159
grow dirt and I went up there and I had

892
00:33:38,339 --> 00:33:43,379
all this salt weed okay and it was like

893
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:45,600
the super skunk and the chem 91 and the

894
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:47,640
Mendo perps and you know sour uh super

895
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:48,959
dog and stuff like that and they all

896
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,880
loved it

897
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,860
and they were all super prejudiced

898
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,679
against kenweed

899
00:33:52,859 --> 00:33:58,558
yeah but they loved my camera right yeah

900
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:00,298
and then they all grew organic

901
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:02,639
and I never knew a bunch of cats that

902
00:34:00,298 --> 00:34:04,319
grew organic like that yeah and so we

903
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:08,280
were like comparing each other's weed

904
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:10,559
all the time yeah you know and so we uh

905
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,119
you know we we ended up you know we

906
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:12,960
ended up teaching each other a bunch of

907
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:15,119
[ __ ]

908
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,559
yeah right and I ended up I ended up

909
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,000
going and working a little bit for John

910
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:19,918
jevins who's written a couple famous

911
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,059
books he lives up in Willits by me and

912
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:24,779
learning as much as I could about

913
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:27,059
Organics right yeah at a time when like

914
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:28,019
Organics was very very like do it

915
00:34:27,059 --> 00:34:30,960
yourself

916
00:34:28,019 --> 00:34:33,358
yeah not very many online didn't exist

917
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,740
really like you know it was basically

918
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:35,878
you were buying raw amendments and

919
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,739
everything you had to do you had to do

920
00:34:35,878 --> 00:34:39,418
the work yourself yeah maybe there was

921
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:41,759
Earth there was Earth Juice

922
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:43,679
yeah Earth I remember earthquakes yeah

923
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,659
yeah still around there was very few

924
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,579
products there was very few inoculants

925
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:50,159
there was very few bacteria there was

926
00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:52,079
very few it was very like Byron

927
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:55,919
ingredients and go for it yourself right

928
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:58,559
yeah so I did this project for

929
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:01,440
I don't know probably four years where I

930
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:03,179
grew my favorite strains in my in one of

931
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,980
my rooms and most of the room was

932
00:35:03,179 --> 00:35:07,500
dedicated for flower for medical right

933
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:09,240
but yeah I had a section that side by

934
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,699
side and the same two lights I would

935
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:14,578
grow the best organic wheat I could and

936
00:35:11,699 --> 00:35:17,039
I would grow the best salt weed I could

937
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:20,579
yeah of the same strains over and over

938
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:22,440
and over again right and then it was

939
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:23,940
just for head and so I would pass out a

940
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:25,139
bunch of joints to friends of mine and

941
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:26,639
stuff like that and it would all be

942
00:35:25,139 --> 00:35:29,338
blind testing and they would just smoke

943
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:31,858
and tell me what's up yeah and that

944
00:35:29,338 --> 00:35:34,380
started to shock me right because

945
00:35:31,858 --> 00:35:37,199
sometimes with certain strains they

946
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:38,940
consistently preferred the salt yeah

947
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:40,679
right and then the salt was so much

948
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,940
easier I didn't have to put all that I

949
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:43,440
mean people should know back then it's

950
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:45,900
like we made the people that taught me

951
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,358
like we made our own soil in like

952
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:50,460
conquer in like those concrete tumblers

953
00:35:48,358 --> 00:35:52,139
you know you'd buy one of those yeah no

954
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:53,699
you know you know you buy your own

955
00:35:52,139 --> 00:35:55,078
concrete tumbler and you put all your

956
00:35:53,699 --> 00:35:56,519
elements and you put everything in it

957
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:58,680
and you'd Stir It Up and then you pour

958
00:35:56,519 --> 00:36:00,358
it out you're wearing a mask and I mean

959
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:02,039
I had multiple friends go to the

960
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:03,838
hospital for

961
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:06,480
um fungus infections in their lungs I

962
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:08,639
bet from breathing guano

963
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,320
yeah so it was actually kind of

964
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:12,960
dangerous you kind of had to like eye

965
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,400
and mask and glove up to be because

966
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,139
you're working with a bunch of [ __ ] and

967
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,260
a bunch of animal byproducts and all

968
00:36:16,139 --> 00:36:20,819
this different stuff right yeah and so I

969
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,900
would try to make the headiest mix I

970
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,700
could

971
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:26,280
yeah and I learned that like some

972
00:36:23,699 --> 00:36:28,039
strains consistently people like the

973
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,119
organic one better

974
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:32,579
and some strains people some

975
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:34,820
consistently like the salt without any

976
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:34,820
language

977
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:43,559
the the chems and the sours uh typically

978
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:46,079
like we're easier with salt yeah uh the

979
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:47,820
Mendo perps the super skunk a few

980
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,800
different ones would come out really

981
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:51,359
nice organic

982
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,800
yeah right

983
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:54,239
um and it's not like you couldn't it's

984
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,579
not like they weren't good it was just

985
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:58,559
like what you preferred back to back and

986
00:36:56,579 --> 00:37:00,240
I think that's really important for

987
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:01,259
people I people have been asking me a

988
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:03,479
bunch because I've been making some

989
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:06,720
posts about various historical strains

990
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:09,179
yeah really the only way to have like an

991
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:10,618
effective comparison is for you to grow

992
00:37:09,179 --> 00:37:12,838
it yourself

993
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:13,680
in your environment in your room same

994
00:37:12,838 --> 00:37:15,358
time

995
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:17,219
okay I'm going to get these four sour

996
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:19,500
plants yeah and I'm gonna grow them at

997
00:37:17,219 --> 00:37:21,419
the same time under the same environment

998
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,739
right I'm not going to get it from my

999
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:24,059
buddy who grows a totally different

1000
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:26,338
style and his room's different

1001
00:37:24,059 --> 00:37:27,719
temperature yeah I'm gonna like it

1002
00:37:26,338 --> 00:37:30,000
doesn't you just have to be able to see

1003
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:31,858
it in the same event right so and you

1004
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,358
can see these plants all these plants

1005
00:37:31,858 --> 00:37:35,159
for three four years we're all treated

1006
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:39,480
the same way every time

1007
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:42,420
yeah you know and and uh you know it was

1008
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:43,559
and it and and so you know and I have a

1009
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:45,539
bunch of obviously you have a bunch of

1010
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:47,699
friends that smoke weed so you're giving

1011
00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:48,838
out a b joints

1012
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:52,319
yeah

1013
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:53,820
right and um and and trying to get

1014
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,579
feedback and I don't think most people

1015
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:58,500
ever compare Styles they're doing one

1016
00:37:56,579 --> 00:38:00,780
style at a time

1017
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,619
yeah right so how do you know what's

1018
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,960
different

1019
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:06,240
right and so we were trying to figure

1020
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,760
out like me and a few friends we were

1021
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:11,699
trying to figure out well what is better

1022
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,859
yeah what is what is and it was

1023
00:38:11,699 --> 00:38:15,659
surprising in the sense that you know

1024
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:17,819
and there's another aspect too where

1025
00:38:15,659 --> 00:38:19,139
it's like you start to realize once you

1026
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,760
start to get a little bit more educated

1027
00:38:19,139 --> 00:38:23,578
about it but

1028
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:26,599
um indoor organic is almost never like

1029
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:26,599
outdoor organic

1030
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:31,859
yeah I wouldn't know so well I mean I'll

1031
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:35,279
give you a perfect example to make total

1032
00:38:31,858 --> 00:38:37,078
sense right so indoor organic is almost

1033
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,119
100 organic

1034
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:42,060
right it's like a mixture of peat moss

1035
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:44,700
and perlite and you know or or cocoa or

1036
00:38:42,059 --> 00:38:47,699
different things where outside maybe

1037
00:38:44,699 --> 00:38:51,059
like 10 of the medium is organic yeah

1038
00:38:47,699 --> 00:38:54,539
and the rest of it is clay or or crushed

1039
00:38:51,059 --> 00:38:55,980
rocks minerals are like almost 45 of

1040
00:38:54,539 --> 00:38:57,838
most soils

1041
00:38:55,980 --> 00:39:00,420
so like that's why they talk about like

1042
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:02,519
there's a six inch layer of topsoil

1043
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:04,139
in a lot of places and that's like your

1044
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:06,420
organic matter and then underneath that

1045
00:39:04,139 --> 00:39:08,819
it's a bunch of rock basically it might

1046
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:11,099
be porous Rock but crushed rock but

1047
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:14,099
that's what most Earth is so like most

1048
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:17,280
People's Organic inside is like soilless

1049
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:18,838
with added amendments yeah like you'd

1050
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,300
never find like if you took say like

1051
00:39:18,838 --> 00:39:23,039
sunshine number four or something and

1052
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:24,240
rice holes and other [ __ ] and you add

1053
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:25,619
all your amendments and you make the

1054
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:27,838
super heady mix

1055
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:29,640
yeah it wouldn't exist in nature

1056
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:32,699
anywhere

1057
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:35,098
your mix yeah it's like a cannabis

1058
00:39:32,699 --> 00:39:37,819
specific mix basically for an indoor

1059
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:41,220
garden yeah so you never actually really

1060
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:43,440
like any kind of organic inside is like

1061
00:39:41,219 --> 00:39:45,179
a series of compromises

1062
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,920
to begin with

1063
00:39:45,179 --> 00:39:48,299
because you're not like scraping up a

1064
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:51,180
bunch of native Earth

1065
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:53,940
yeah and then using that

1066
00:39:51,179 --> 00:39:56,279
yeah I mean it's not really organic is

1067
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:58,079
it well I mean you can't call it organic

1068
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:00,359
anyway organic is like a federal term

1069
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:02,039
yeah that's what I mean it's like I

1070
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:03,719
don't even think

1071
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:06,059
I don't even think legal weed you're

1072
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:08,399
allowed to use the term organic yet

1073
00:40:06,059 --> 00:40:10,799
interesting I don't think so because

1074
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:14,280
because organic is actually you have to

1075
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:16,980
you have to meet Federal criteria yeah

1076
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:19,440
in order to to get the organic label and

1077
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:21,539
not be lying right yeah but you can't

1078
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,280
get Federal approval for cannabis

1079
00:40:21,539 --> 00:40:24,659
because they still think it's it's it's

1080
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,160
funky

1081
00:40:24,659 --> 00:40:28,199
yeah you know people are saying we're

1082
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:29,819
getting artificial light isn't organic

1083
00:40:28,199 --> 00:40:31,379
right so you know and then there's a

1084
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:33,240
thing too where people talk about this

1085
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:34,920
is like a big keyword and I'm by no

1086
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:38,779
means am I trying to diss anybody but

1087
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,780
what does living soil mean

1088
00:40:39,539 --> 00:40:43,679
right you know I always assumed it meant

1089
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:45,899
there were [ __ ] worms and microbial

1090
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:48,419
life a bunch of that [ __ ] right but

1091
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:51,000
almost all organic if it's active has a

1092
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:53,338
bunch of microbial life sure you know if

1093
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,980
you if you take home a well-made tea

1094
00:40:53,338 --> 00:40:58,139
from your hydro store that they brewed

1095
00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:01,079
fresh or you make tea yourself

1096
00:40:58,139 --> 00:41:02,460
you're putting in trillions of living

1097
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:05,579
organisms

1098
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:07,260
into your soil it's alive

1099
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:09,480
yeah no it typically means when people

1100
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:11,400
talk about living soil they're basically

1101
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:13,380
talking about usually like a some kind

1102
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:16,440
of no-till method or some [ __ ] like that

1103
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:18,000
right yeah but you know but even that is

1104
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,559
like do you know why most people use

1105
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,760
no-till

1106
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:25,858
I have no clue to prevent erosion dude

1107
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,960
there's a lot of because if you don't

1108
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:29,699
till the Earth then when the rain comes

1109
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,380
it's not going to wash away into the

1110
00:41:29,699 --> 00:41:35,639
riverbank

1111
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:37,320
okay does that make sense no no okay so

1112
00:41:35,639 --> 00:41:40,078
imagine imagine like you're on a factory

1113
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:42,480
farm in [ __ ] you know somewhere like

1114
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:45,000
Iowa okay and you're telling the Earth

1115
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,500
like a foot geek you're fluffing it up

1116
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,420
and you're making it all light and loose

1117
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,440
and then there's torrential rain that

1118
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:51,659
comes in

1119
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,760
okay and in that runoff a bunch of Earth

1120
00:41:51,659 --> 00:41:55,799
washes away into the Mississippi

1121
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,180
yeah that makes sense right okay so

1122
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,220
that's how that's where most of our top

1123
00:41:57,179 --> 00:42:03,118
soil went when they talk about the Dust

1124
00:41:59,219 --> 00:42:04,739
Bowl in uh in in Oklahoma yeah they

1125
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,539
tilled up all the earth and the wind

1126
00:42:04,739 --> 00:42:08,899
came up and it blew all the [ __ ]

1127
00:42:06,539 --> 00:42:08,900
Earth away

1128
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:12,838
it did there was like yeah because of

1129
00:42:11,219 --> 00:42:15,659
the Buffalo and [ __ ] there was like 10

1130
00:42:12,838 --> 00:42:16,799
feet of topsoil in Oklahoma yeah and

1131
00:42:15,659 --> 00:42:18,480
they didn't know what they were doing

1132
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,640
with with farming and they got a drought

1133
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:23,219
and they tilled it all up and then all

1134
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:25,199
these huge winds came in and they and it

1135
00:42:23,219 --> 00:42:27,239
washed it all [ __ ] away

1136
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:28,618
so I had no idea that's what the Dust

1137
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:31,500
Bowl meant that's what the Dust Bowl was

1138
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:33,480
it was literally it was literally people

1139
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:35,940
tilling farmland and then the Farmland

1140
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,800
blowing away in the [ __ ] storms so

1141
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:40,440
weird so

1142
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:42,300
no-till is basically like this thing

1143
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,980
where in conventional agriculture they

1144
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:46,740
don't want to till the Earth and have it

1145
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:48,780
blow away or rinse away in rain

1146
00:42:46,739 --> 00:42:50,639
so they don't they don't till the Earth

1147
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:53,400
they leave it right and they just dig a

1148
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:56,098
hole for for the plant but a lot of them

1149
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:57,480
use conventional herbicides and kill all

1150
00:42:56,099 --> 00:43:01,619
the weeds

1151
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:03,240
okay so no-till inside is like this guy

1152
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:04,920
just commented I thought no-till was

1153
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:06,179
like not disturbing the microbial

1154
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:08,460
content

1155
00:43:06,179 --> 00:43:11,818
well that's what weed people say

1156
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:13,318
for no for no-till outside it's that but

1157
00:43:11,818 --> 00:43:15,358
it's also a huge amount of erosion

1158
00:43:13,318 --> 00:43:17,759
control

1159
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:19,019
but you don't have erosion problems

1160
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,940
indoors

1161
00:43:19,019 --> 00:43:22,259
yeah you could till all you want it's

1162
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,639
not like you're going to get a windstorm

1163
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:25,140
that's going to blow away your [ __ ] you

1164
00:43:23,639 --> 00:43:26,159
know yeah that's why I was confused when

1165
00:43:25,139 --> 00:43:28,078
you're talking about a windstorm I'm

1166
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:29,399
wondering how that applies to indoor for

1167
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:31,380
no-till but that's what I mean but like

1168
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,519
no-till was designed so the soil doesn't

1169
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:34,318
fly away

1170
00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:36,539
yeah and then it gets applied to an

1171
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:39,539
indoor environment where there's no wind

1172
00:43:36,539 --> 00:43:41,699
yeah that's yeah

1173
00:43:39,539 --> 00:43:43,139
right yeah and then you know there's

1174
00:43:41,699 --> 00:43:44,699
people and when I'm talking about

1175
00:43:43,139 --> 00:43:46,078
nutrition I'm sure how many people are

1176
00:43:44,699 --> 00:43:47,818
going to get all upset because I'm gonna

1177
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:49,740
you're gonna start stepping on toes and

1178
00:43:47,818 --> 00:43:53,039
they're gonna say oh well no it's about

1179
00:43:49,739 --> 00:43:54,779
the layers of microbial and fungal and

1180
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:56,579
this and that not disturbing them or

1181
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:58,920
whatever you know yeah

1182
00:43:56,579 --> 00:44:00,780
um but to be honest like cannabis is a

1183
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:03,900
shallow root growth plant it likes to

1184
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:05,160
grow wider than it does deep yeah and so

1185
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:07,380
basically what you're trying to do with

1186
00:44:05,159 --> 00:44:09,899
cannabis is give it a not some kind of

1187
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:11,700
aerated good amount of air and water and

1188
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:13,559
the ability for the roots to freely go

1189
00:44:11,699 --> 00:44:16,139
where they want yeah

1190
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:18,838
and also a hard compact soil that's not

1191
00:44:16,139 --> 00:44:21,239
that's not a good job I I've also been

1192
00:44:18,838 --> 00:44:23,759
I've also been accused of being wider

1193
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:26,399
than deep this this is uh wider than

1194
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:29,040
people sometimes yeah shallow even

1195
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:31,440
shallow some say shallow some would say

1196
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:33,779
shallow white is all in perspective

1197
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,400
someone say so getting back so you know

1198
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:38,579
getting back to like what all this means

1199
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:40,200
is that you know I I was reading some

1200
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:41,519
comments from some people the other day

1201
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:44,159
where they were talking about like their

1202
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:46,619
friends that do no-till it works amazing

1203
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:48,480
for certain strengths yeah and then

1204
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:49,640
other strains they do don't respond very

1205
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,380
well to it

1206
00:44:49,639 --> 00:44:53,940
or you know you have a situation like we

1207
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:56,640
have a buddy up in Trinity and it's like

1208
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:58,920
if you're going to do depths organically

1209
00:44:56,639 --> 00:45:01,559
yeah that's a lot harder than a single

1210
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:03,539
season where you can give it you know a

1211
00:45:01,559 --> 00:45:05,880
food designed for vegetative growth for

1212
00:45:03,539 --> 00:45:07,800
three years of months yeah and then food

1213
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:10,858
designed for Bloom for a series of

1214
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:13,318
months it's not as easy organically to

1215
00:45:10,858 --> 00:45:14,699
like get two or three rips out of the

1216
00:45:13,318 --> 00:45:17,519
same thing a year

1217
00:45:14,699 --> 00:45:19,139
no yeah that makes sense you know and

1218
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:21,420
time it perfectly for what you're trying

1219
00:45:19,139 --> 00:45:23,159
to do so it's like and I don't go don't

1220
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:26,760
get me wrong I think organic quality

1221
00:45:23,159 --> 00:45:28,980
weed is like can be better than any salt

1222
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,480
to be honest but I think a lot of people

1223
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:32,400
don't get there

1224
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,858
like Seoul has a way higher floor

1225
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,059
there's a lot of poorly grown organic

1226
00:45:34,858 --> 00:45:37,799
wheat

1227
00:45:36,059 --> 00:45:39,599
yeah you know and it's not like they're

1228
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,220
messing up it's it's more just like the

1229
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:42,900
availability of the food isn't there

1230
00:45:41,219 --> 00:45:45,078
when the plant needs it

1231
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:48,119
yeah

1232
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:50,339
it took me years years and years and

1233
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:53,220
years to finally smoke organic weed that

1234
00:45:50,338 --> 00:45:56,460
was really grown well organic and and to

1235
00:45:53,219 --> 00:46:00,358
me was as uh well-grown as anything

1236
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:03,000
grown bad acid salts and that was from

1237
00:46:00,358 --> 00:46:05,818
um Natalie that dude kills it organic

1238
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,159
and changed a lot of my own ego with

1239
00:46:05,818 --> 00:46:10,500
like thinking oh [ __ ] salts are so much

1240
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:12,000
better so much easier why why waste the

1241
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:14,639
time because it was it was really

1242
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,579
special I mean it all it also depends

1243
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:19,139
you know like so you know you gotta fit

1244
00:46:17,579 --> 00:46:21,539
and this is kind of like what I said in

1245
00:46:19,139 --> 00:46:23,460
the beginning where it's it's like you

1246
00:46:21,539 --> 00:46:25,259
know you gotta fit your growing style

1247
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:27,659
for what you're trying to do

1248
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:30,300
yeah of course right and that's

1249
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:33,480
important because they don't all fit you

1250
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:35,039
know yeah and you know if let's face it

1251
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:37,500
like in today's economy with wheat

1252
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:38,699
prices so cheap and you know no matter

1253
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,380
whether you're whether you're in the

1254
00:46:38,699 --> 00:46:42,598
traditional Market or you're in the

1255
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:44,220
fully legal up Market

1256
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:46,859
um you know times are tough

1257
00:46:44,219 --> 00:46:49,078
right and so people are trying to get x

1258
00:46:46,858 --> 00:46:52,619
amount of weight per Greenhouse or per

1259
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:54,000
outdoor patch or per grow room right and

1260
00:46:52,619 --> 00:46:55,740
so you're trying to get as much pretty

1261
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,818
weed because people are visual as

1262
00:46:55,739 --> 00:46:59,459
possible

1263
00:46:56,818 --> 00:47:01,259
yeah right and that's not necessarily

1264
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:03,539
heads I mean even back in the old

1265
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:05,280
traditional days a lot of the guys I

1266
00:47:03,539 --> 00:47:07,440
knew that were running 50 or 100

1267
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,819
lighters would get their heads from

1268
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,900
people that were growing six or eight

1269
00:47:08,818 --> 00:47:11,880
lighters

1270
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:13,920
yeah yeah that's a pretty common things

1271
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:15,838
right now yeah well the other part of it

1272
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:19,079
too is like back in the 215 days when

1273
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:21,779
anybody with a 215 card could go to a

1274
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:23,700
like a dispensary and excuse me legally

1275
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:24,960
sell their herb to that dispenser right

1276
00:47:23,699 --> 00:47:26,939
yeah

1277
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,858
think about that dispensary there was no

1278
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:31,800
regulations there was no cost of Entry

1279
00:47:28,858 --> 00:47:33,598
you they bought so much garage weed oh

1280
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:36,599
yeah tons too and they could just pick

1281
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:38,099
based on quality yeah and guys are

1282
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:40,318
bringing in weed that's like you know it

1283
00:47:38,099 --> 00:47:41,880
was cut two weeks ago it's fresh it's

1284
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:44,460
still in the perfect form it's in Turkey

1285
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:46,079
bags it's like not very regulated and

1286
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:49,619
they could just pick the best and ditch

1287
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:51,359
the rest yeah now with all this legality

1288
00:47:49,619 --> 00:47:52,740
you know a lot of times some of that

1289
00:47:51,358 --> 00:47:55,199
weed doesn't hit the shelf for two or

1290
00:47:52,739 --> 00:47:57,299
three months yeah and it's being grown

1291
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:59,219
in these big salt factories or it's

1292
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:00,780
being grown at a scale where like all

1293
00:47:59,219 --> 00:48:04,879
the little things that the ache the the

1294
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:04,880
eight lighter guy could do they can

1295
00:48:05,838 --> 00:48:10,858
you've actually experienced scaling up

1296
00:48:08,818 --> 00:48:12,838
major right oh yeah why don't you talk

1297
00:48:10,858 --> 00:48:15,838
about that I I've never done the May

1298
00:48:12,838 --> 00:48:18,480
except for the big big uh reversal and

1299
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:21,358
having to save those dummies [ __ ]

1300
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:23,639
already flowering crop for a reversal I

1301
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:25,199
had never done major major scale as far

1302
00:48:23,639 --> 00:48:26,159
as feeding and all that stuff and it was

1303
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:27,719
it was

1304
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:29,759
significantly different especially

1305
00:48:27,719 --> 00:48:32,279
re-veging at that scale it was insane

1306
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:34,140
any you know and there's a there's an

1307
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,819
aspect to where you can talk about this

1308
00:48:34,139 --> 00:48:37,440
is pretty funny because you know there

1309
00:48:35,818 --> 00:48:40,019
was these people that just opened up

1310
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:42,240
like whatever it is like 126 acres and

1311
00:48:40,019 --> 00:48:44,940
in [ __ ] SoCal and they're calling it

1312
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:46,500
craft right yeah yeah

1313
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:48,599
everybody agrees that there's a

1314
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:50,699
difference between craft and Commercial

1315
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:54,180
yeah the difference is is that people

1316
00:48:50,699 --> 00:48:55,139
get hyphy about like when does where is

1317
00:48:54,179 --> 00:48:58,139
that line

1318
00:48:55,139 --> 00:48:59,578
yeah you know and like I said before I

1319
00:48:58,139 --> 00:49:01,639
used to never see the people that would

1320
00:48:59,579 --> 00:49:04,200
do a great Growers and doing a great job

1321
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:05,879
they still would not get the same

1322
00:49:04,199 --> 00:49:07,679
quality weed out of their 50 or 100

1323
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:09,960
lighter that we would get out of a

1324
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:11,219
garage-sized scene yeah

1325
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:13,619
for the most part they just wouldn't

1326
00:49:11,219 --> 00:49:15,118
they had way less time per plant they

1327
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:17,519
weren't doing quite as many little

1328
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,900
things that made the plants happy you

1329
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:21,599
know like it was a little bit more

1330
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:23,220
commercial and yeah you know and then

1331
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:26,940
there's an aspect too where it's like

1332
00:49:23,219 --> 00:49:29,098
they um so scaling becomes hard and a

1333
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:30,659
lot of times when people scale they lose

1334
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:32,519
quality

1335
00:49:30,659 --> 00:49:34,259
so we could talk about that for a minute

1336
00:49:32,519 --> 00:49:35,880
too and I'm not trying to diss them but

1337
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:39,119
you look at like the the jungle boys

1338
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:41,818
right or some of these big you know rock

1339
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:43,079
wool factory farms yeah they're doing

1340
00:49:41,818 --> 00:49:44,338
that because they have all these

1341
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:46,318
different rooms

1342
00:49:44,338 --> 00:49:48,000
and relying on a bunch of hippies and

1343
00:49:46,318 --> 00:49:51,059
Weirdos to like hand water everything

1344
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,800
right every day is problematic yeah for

1345
00:49:51,059 --> 00:49:55,078
sure so you know they're trying to

1346
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,940
automate all this different [ __ ] and

1347
00:49:55,079 --> 00:49:59,160
then just like work on looking at the

1348
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:00,838
data and then messing with the the

1349
00:49:59,159 --> 00:50:03,838
settings and the data and not looking

1350
00:50:00,838 --> 00:50:05,940
each individual plant right yeah and so

1351
00:50:03,838 --> 00:50:08,400
what they're doing is is that there's a

1352
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:10,139
lot of Technology from northern Europe

1353
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,338
um that basically is the basis of all

1354
00:50:10,139 --> 00:50:14,039
Hydroponics

1355
00:50:11,338 --> 00:50:16,440
yeah uh grodan all that they all learned

1356
00:50:14,039 --> 00:50:18,179
how to do all this growing tomatoes and

1357
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:21,240
peppers and cucumbers and all these

1358
00:50:18,179 --> 00:50:22,980
vegetables for places that are shitty

1359
00:50:21,239 --> 00:50:24,598
like northern Europe but have money yeah

1360
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:26,760
yeah and you can go there and you can

1361
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:29,160
see hot houses greenhouses that have

1362
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:30,720
tens of thousands of plants tens of

1363
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:31,920
thousands of Lights

1364
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:34,799
huge

1365
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:36,780
right so you see these trick systems

1366
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,980
that they're installing they're all

1367
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:39,240
based on that

1368
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:42,420
yeah

1369
00:50:39,239 --> 00:50:44,039
right yeah so they get all these things

1370
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:45,780
and they're looking at graphs right and

1371
00:50:44,039 --> 00:50:47,279
they've got they've got like the

1372
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:49,680
moisture meter and they're perfectly

1373
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,599
planning the wet and dry cycles and

1374
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:53,578
they're and they're you know dialing in

1375
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:55,680
their their salts and everything and

1376
00:50:53,579 --> 00:50:57,119
it's like even the setup itself is like

1377
00:50:55,679 --> 00:50:59,159
a plumbing nightmare

1378
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,660
it's so intense

1379
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:01,618
and then people call their weed

1380
00:51:00,659 --> 00:51:04,679
cardboard

1381
00:51:01,619 --> 00:51:06,300
yeah right because what happens is that

1382
00:51:04,679 --> 00:51:09,358
you're trying to do a one-size-fits all

1383
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:11,220
and cannabis actually it turns out it

1384
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:14,639
doesn't like being fed perfectly its

1385
00:51:11,219 --> 00:51:16,259
whole life no like they've done studies

1386
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:18,118
where they've shown that certain amounts

1387
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:20,160
of drought stress or certain amounts of

1388
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:22,200
stress to the plant

1389
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:23,338
um actually creates more terpenes and

1390
00:51:22,199 --> 00:51:25,439
more Crystal

1391
00:51:23,338 --> 00:51:27,119
yeah almost like beat the hell out of

1392
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:30,599
your plant no I've seen it firsthand

1393
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:31,980
though straight stress like uh where did

1394
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:34,260
I first learn that about it was it had

1395
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:36,480
to do with uh bugs attacking the plant

1396
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:39,720
and and that's why the trichomes are

1397
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:41,579
there yeah bugs like bugs signal uh you

1398
00:51:39,719 --> 00:51:43,919
know they they signal a thing to the

1399
00:51:41,579 --> 00:51:45,660
plant where I need to make more THC I

1400
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:47,039
need to make it harder for them to crawl

1401
00:51:45,659 --> 00:51:49,679
on me I need to make it harder for them

1402
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:51,179
to bite me you know and yeah so you get

1403
00:51:49,679 --> 00:51:53,159
these perfect rooms and everything's

1404
00:51:51,179 --> 00:51:55,318
perfect and everything's everything's

1405
00:51:53,159 --> 00:51:57,358
dialed in and they're like fine-tuning

1406
00:51:55,318 --> 00:52:00,838
stuff and they have control over all

1407
00:51:57,358 --> 00:52:04,139
their parameters right and then their

1408
00:52:00,838 --> 00:52:06,358
weed comes out nah not that good

1409
00:52:04,139 --> 00:52:08,039
you know and the guy that like you know

1410
00:52:06,358 --> 00:52:09,960
like they got a little dry and a little

1411
00:52:08,039 --> 00:52:11,759
wilty a few times and they stressed here

1412
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,780
and there a little bit like that weed

1413
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:16,079
was happy

1414
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:17,819
yeah there was it was better but they're

1415
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:19,800
trying to grow like a reasonably good

1416
00:52:17,818 --> 00:52:22,619
looking product at scale

1417
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:25,079
yeah and they can't have [ __ ] you

1418
00:52:22,619 --> 00:52:26,338
know three dozen rooms and treat it like

1419
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:28,140
you have a garage

1420
00:52:26,338 --> 00:52:29,699
or treat it like you have one greenhouse

1421
00:52:28,139 --> 00:52:31,920
and no job

1422
00:52:29,699 --> 00:52:33,419
yeah you know you know you have a

1423
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,980
situation there's people that you that

1424
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:36,240
are on IG that are quite popular and

1425
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:38,639
they they don't have that many plants

1426
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:39,779
and they have a greenhouse yeah and

1427
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:42,179
that's their job and you can go out

1428
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:44,040
there and you can baby them and you can

1429
00:52:42,179 --> 00:52:46,199
give them every little thing

1430
00:52:44,039 --> 00:52:47,460
but then you join a legal scene and and

1431
00:52:46,199 --> 00:52:49,019
like you're working I don't talk very

1432
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:51,358
much about what I was doing but like you

1433
00:52:49,019 --> 00:52:53,219
try to develop some things at scale and

1434
00:52:51,358 --> 00:52:55,380
you've got to water some acreage

1435
00:52:53,219 --> 00:52:58,618
and it's a whole different thing

1436
00:52:55,380 --> 00:53:01,858
yeah and it's not that easy to do

1437
00:52:58,619 --> 00:53:04,079
no I can't imagine you know there's so

1438
00:53:01,858 --> 00:53:05,940
much to go wrong a lot of people messed

1439
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:07,980
up even just going from how big they

1440
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:11,039
were doing just to like two or three or

1441
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:12,838
four ten thousand square foots yeah

1442
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:14,699
like and they started really and they

1443
00:53:12,838 --> 00:53:16,139
started you know really messing you know

1444
00:53:14,699 --> 00:53:19,858
they started really messing up

1445
00:53:16,139 --> 00:53:22,199
yeah you know and and so like a lot of

1446
00:53:19,858 --> 00:53:24,719
and that's why because because like

1447
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:26,699
dispensaries can't just buy the best

1448
00:53:24,719 --> 00:53:29,399
weed from whoever walks in with a duffel

1449
00:53:26,699 --> 00:53:32,219
bag anymore yeah they were able to buy

1450
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:33,960
from like a lot of small time local

1451
00:53:32,219 --> 00:53:36,959
gardeners

1452
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:40,260
you know and the bay would get tons of

1453
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:42,420
people from even L.A and San Diego were

1454
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:45,180
flooded with weed from Humble and Lake

1455
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:47,940
oh yeah like there was people that would

1456
00:53:45,179 --> 00:53:49,440
drive up to my area every week to get we

1457
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:51,000
had to bring it down to the dispensaries

1458
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:53,760
that was their entire gig

1459
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:55,980
was to flow it right into dispensaries

1460
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,359
and so they could they could say yes or

1461
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:58,920
no to any weed that walked through their

1462
00:53:57,358 --> 00:54:01,920
door

1463
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:03,420
right and now there's all this

1464
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,680
regulation and there's all this thing

1465
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:06,059
and there's all this packaging and

1466
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:08,098
there's all this testing and there's all

1467
00:54:06,059 --> 00:54:10,440
this time and people are trying to learn

1468
00:54:08,099 --> 00:54:13,140
how to grow on a lot bigger scale

1469
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:15,659
and their weed is like

1470
00:54:13,139 --> 00:54:18,420
yep way down

1471
00:54:15,659 --> 00:54:19,500
way down in quality in my opinion you

1472
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:20,940
know and people are going to learn

1473
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:23,219
they're going to get better over time

1474
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:24,539
but right now customers are [ __ ]

1475
00:54:23,219 --> 00:54:25,679
because they're paying more than they

1476
00:54:24,539 --> 00:54:29,099
used to

1477
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:32,219
and the availability uh is shittier

1478
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:34,140
but at least it looks good on IG and

1479
00:54:32,219 --> 00:54:37,259
that and that's another thing IG [ __ ]

1480
00:54:34,139 --> 00:54:39,358
it all up yeah because you couldn't

1481
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:41,940
sniff it or smell it or anything like

1482
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:43,078
that like you you know you could just

1483
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:45,780
see it

1484
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:48,240
and so cookies cookies was perfectly

1485
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:51,960
timed for the social media wave

1486
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:54,719
yeah because it was unusually visually

1487
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:56,220
attractive and very unique looking it

1488
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:58,500
definitely did stand out from what was

1489
00:54:56,219 --> 00:54:59,939
out there yeah and now there's a whole

1490
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:01,619
thing where you see so many of these

1491
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:04,019
different strains and a lot of them I

1492
00:55:01,619 --> 00:55:05,280
think have been chosen based on looks

1493
00:55:04,019 --> 00:55:07,920
and testing

1494
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,420
and they can be like not to judge it but

1495
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:12,599
oh look here's Apple Fritter and it

1496
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:14,700
tested 33 look how fire it looks

1497
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:16,440
and then it [ __ ] is the worst term

1498
00:55:14,699 --> 00:55:18,419
bomb on the face of the Earth for

1499
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:19,980
breeding are you smoking and everyone's

1500
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:21,659
all excited because the the people that

1501
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:22,920
they respect are hyping it and then six

1502
00:55:21,659 --> 00:55:24,799
months later you know you're like I

1503
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:27,539
don't think I'm gonna buy that 70 eighth

1504
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:28,619
yeah it just didn't it just didn't hit

1505
00:55:27,539 --> 00:55:30,719
it for me

1506
00:55:28,619 --> 00:55:32,700
you know what before before we scooted

1507
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:34,019
far too far along I do remember there's

1508
00:55:32,699 --> 00:55:36,838
one thing that I wanted to talk about

1509
00:55:34,019 --> 00:55:39,838
and when it's uh feeding for breeding as

1510
00:55:36,838 --> 00:55:41,759
far as vegetative stuff one thing that I

1511
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:43,639
I find a lot of bridges do when I talk

1512
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:46,380
to them and it's totally

1513
00:55:43,639 --> 00:55:49,078
counterproductive is when you are

1514
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:50,579
running cycles of different rooms in

1515
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:52,740
different different strains you're

1516
00:55:50,579 --> 00:55:54,300
trying to do multiple projects and

1517
00:55:52,739 --> 00:55:57,838
they're one after the other after the

1518
00:55:54,300 --> 00:56:00,359
other you start learning to feed

1519
00:55:57,838 --> 00:56:02,759
differently to slow down the growth

1520
00:56:00,358 --> 00:56:04,139
to try to make room and that's not

1521
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,880
something that's that's totally

1522
00:56:04,139 --> 00:56:08,098
counterproductive and counter-intuitive

1523
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:09,599
but some of us have learned how to stunt

1524
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:12,240
our plants and bring them out of being

1525
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:14,338
stunted because it's just there's no way

1526
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:16,739
to to constantly have that room to feed

1527
00:56:14,338 --> 00:56:18,119
in new Cycles so you know there's things

1528
00:56:16,739 --> 00:56:20,219
you'll do when breeding that you would

1529
00:56:18,119 --> 00:56:22,740
never do for production because it would

1530
00:56:20,219 --> 00:56:24,719
absolutely just butt [ __ ] you for for

1531
00:56:22,739 --> 00:56:26,939
great flour well yeah I mean if you've

1532
00:56:24,719 --> 00:56:29,399
got if you've got a big collection of

1533
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:31,679
moms in stock then

1534
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:34,318
very likely what you're doing is you're

1535
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:36,960
keeping a bunch at moderate it's a small

1536
00:56:34,318 --> 00:56:38,699
size under enough light to like keep

1537
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:40,858
them going and happy but nothing too

1538
00:56:38,699 --> 00:56:42,358
vigorous and then you've got a lot of

1539
00:56:40,858 --> 00:56:44,039
great health and then you're playing

1540
00:56:42,358 --> 00:56:46,558
you're planning on putting some plants

1541
00:56:44,039 --> 00:56:47,699
in like a vigorous very well lit spot to

1542
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:49,920
get them going

1543
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:51,419
because you have projects in mind for

1544
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,519
them and you want to get very vigorous

1545
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:55,559
cuttings and small plants going off them

1546
00:56:53,519 --> 00:56:57,960
and so there's a rotation there that

1547
00:56:55,559 --> 00:57:01,740
goes in where it's like a fine balance

1548
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:03,179
yeah if it's hurting to to not you know

1549
00:57:01,739 --> 00:57:04,979
if you're someone like kale you know

1550
00:57:03,179 --> 00:57:07,139
like like CSI or whatever and you've got

1551
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:09,300
150 different plants

1552
00:57:07,139 --> 00:57:10,980
in moms and then you've got a bunch of

1553
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:12,599
stuff you're keeping for Fino hunting

1554
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:14,818
and all of a sudden you've got hundreds

1555
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:16,440
of different strains and and you might

1556
00:57:14,818 --> 00:57:19,199
want to slow things down on a bunch of

1557
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:21,059
it yeah a Fino hunt you might want to

1558
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:23,039
keep it going really slow

1559
00:57:21,059 --> 00:57:25,319
yeah you know and even starve it

1560
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:27,480
somewhat until you see what you have

1561
00:57:25,318 --> 00:57:29,099
because if you start pumping it like

1562
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:30,358
you're trying to pump it to get ready to

1563
00:57:29,099 --> 00:57:32,338
bloom a room

1564
00:57:30,358 --> 00:57:33,900
all of a sudden you've got jungle growth

1565
00:57:32,338 --> 00:57:35,880
and where do you put it all

1566
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:37,920
yeah

1567
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:40,019
yeah especially keeping some of the

1568
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:42,000
older lines the the in all five hazes

1569
00:57:40,019 --> 00:57:46,139
and stuff like that you get it gets

1570
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:48,239
junkly so [ __ ] fast yeah jungling you

1571
00:57:46,139 --> 00:57:50,578
know and then you know and and so you

1572
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:51,899
have an aspect where it's like I just

1573
00:57:50,579 --> 00:57:54,240
thought we could talk about it from a

1574
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:55,858
flower perspective too because you try

1575
00:57:54,239 --> 00:57:57,598
to talk to people and like the thing

1576
00:57:55,858 --> 00:58:00,239
that I get the most when you try to talk

1577
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:04,079
nutrition is like smugness

1578
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:05,759
like they want people people are smug oh

1579
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:07,800
yeah yeah like they want they want to

1580
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:10,200
know that I'm growing the better way

1581
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:11,579
this way works you know what the [ __ ]

1582
00:58:10,199 --> 00:58:13,259
are you talking about I get two and a

1583
00:58:11,579 --> 00:58:14,579
half pounds of light everybody thinks my

1584
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:17,040
meat is fire

1585
00:58:14,579 --> 00:58:19,200
you know and I'm not I'm not dissing

1586
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:20,699
anybody I'm I'm not like that's not what

1587
00:58:19,199 --> 00:58:21,779
I'm trying to say I'm just trying to say

1588
00:58:20,699 --> 00:58:24,480
that like

1589
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:26,940
very few people are doing side by sides

1590
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:28,500
to try to see what methods are giving

1591
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:30,780
them better weed

1592
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:33,119
they're growing the same style at one

1593
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:35,099
time and if they change Styles they

1594
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:37,619
change it over entirely

1595
00:58:35,099 --> 00:58:39,720
yeah you know and so you're not really

1596
00:58:37,619 --> 00:58:41,760
comparing you're just and you know most

1597
00:58:39,719 --> 00:58:43,798
people's goals are just to sell

1598
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,359
right so yeah there's things with

1599
00:58:43,798 --> 00:58:47,159
Organic like when I first moved here

1600
00:58:45,358 --> 00:58:49,199
there was people that had been using

1601
00:58:47,159 --> 00:58:51,480
their beds or using their holes in the

1602
00:58:49,199 --> 00:58:52,639
in the Hills or whatever for 10 or 15 20

1603
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:55,199
years

1604
00:58:52,639 --> 00:58:56,818
and every year those things got better

1605
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:59,219
and better

1606
00:58:56,818 --> 00:59:01,199
right because they were able to add

1607
00:58:59,219 --> 00:59:03,179
amendments they were able to add you

1608
00:59:01,199 --> 00:59:05,939
know bacteria and various things it was

1609
00:59:03,179 --> 00:59:09,558
alive it was like old and aged and fully

1610
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:11,940
functional and work and good to go

1611
00:59:09,559 --> 00:59:13,319
the first rip or two probably isn't

1612
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:14,338
going to be as nice as the fifth or

1613
00:59:13,318 --> 00:59:16,619
sixth one

1614
00:59:14,338 --> 00:59:18,000
okay that makes sense because it take

1615
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:19,140
like you know you've heard about green

1616
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,760
sand

1617
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:22,440
you ever heard about green sand green

1618
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:24,839
sand doesn't even become bioavailable

1619
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:27,720
for two years after you put it in yeah

1620
00:59:24,838 --> 00:59:29,940
same with uh normal silica you know it's

1621
00:59:27,719 --> 00:59:31,618
like one year I think there's things

1622
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:32,940
that are on that are fairly immediate

1623
00:59:31,619 --> 00:59:35,039
there's things that take two or three

1624
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:37,619
months there's things that take a year

1625
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:40,139
you know and so if you have aged if you

1626
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:41,880
have age stuff you know like a lot of

1627
00:59:40,139 --> 00:59:42,960
that breaking down on availability has

1628
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:45,480
happened

1629
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:46,858
and yeah and the natural cycles doing it

1630
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:48,358
for you but if you're starting a fresh

1631
00:59:46,858 --> 00:59:49,798
facility

1632
00:59:48,358 --> 00:59:51,539
you're going to get a bunch of raw

1633
00:59:49,798 --> 00:59:53,699
ingredients or whatever like you know

1634
00:59:51,539 --> 00:59:54,838
tossed together and you're gonna have to

1635
00:59:53,699 --> 00:59:56,578
amend

1636
00:59:54,838 --> 00:59:59,818
yeah

1637
00:59:56,579 --> 01:00:02,280
you know and so if you're like if if you

1638
00:59:59,818 --> 01:00:04,500
probably another thing is that like if

1639
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:05,940
you're a small tent farmer or you're a

1640
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:07,739
small garage farmer and you're just

1641
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:10,740
trying to grow the best you can

1642
01:00:07,739 --> 01:00:13,019
don't try to copy some giant scene

1643
01:00:10,739 --> 01:00:14,519
yeah they are not the way for you they

1644
01:00:13,019 --> 01:00:17,039
are not growing as good a weed as you

1645
01:00:14,519 --> 01:00:19,858
could on a smaller scale you're like

1646
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:22,139
you're like a hobbyist slash farmer

1647
01:00:19,858 --> 01:00:23,460
right yeah if you're gonna grow at scale

1648
01:00:22,139 --> 01:00:25,199
you're gonna try to have to figure out

1649
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:26,818
how can I take the methods that I like

1650
01:00:25,199 --> 01:00:28,259
and scale them up

1651
01:00:26,818 --> 01:00:30,119
yeah you're probably going to sacrifice

1652
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:32,520
some quality at scale

1653
01:00:30,119 --> 01:00:34,858
you know and you know and if you're if

1654
01:00:32,519 --> 01:00:37,139
you're trying to grow for seed then you

1655
01:00:34,858 --> 01:00:38,578
know then definitely you're not growing

1656
01:00:37,139 --> 01:00:40,139
for flour

1657
01:00:38,579 --> 01:00:41,400
you're probably going to want to add

1658
01:00:40,139 --> 01:00:42,719
more nitrogen you're probably going to

1659
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,798
want to top dress with some different

1660
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:46,858
things

1661
01:00:43,798 --> 01:00:49,739
you know I also like to use uh and I'm

1662
01:00:46,858 --> 01:00:51,960
I'm a sucker for power SI just because I

1663
01:00:49,739 --> 01:00:53,459
used you know regular silica for so long

1664
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:55,858
and didn't understand that it wasn't

1665
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:58,019
really very bioavailable for the plant

1666
01:00:55,858 --> 01:00:59,279
and when I started using the power SI

1667
01:00:58,019 --> 01:01:02,219
stuff because someone was asking about

1668
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:03,900
feeding for veg moms and stuff like that

1669
01:01:02,219 --> 01:01:05,578
that's probably been one of the the

1670
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:08,039
biggest game changers for me was that

1671
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:10,500
specific additive monosilicic acid or

1672
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:11,940
orthosolic acid because it makes it

1673
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:14,099
makes everything so readily and

1674
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:16,440
bioavailable it's just so fast how quick

1675
01:01:14,099 --> 01:01:18,720
it up takes nitrogen and everything that

1676
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:20,338
goes along with it and I should also say

1677
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:21,899
something too right like so whether

1678
01:01:20,338 --> 01:01:24,000
you're organic or salt

1679
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:25,740
uh one of the big reasons why things

1680
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,059
don't grow in winter is that the roots

1681
01:01:25,739 --> 01:01:30,000
get too cold

1682
01:01:27,059 --> 01:01:32,099
yeah and then the pores shrink and when

1683
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,139
the pores shrink and the and the and the

1684
01:01:32,099 --> 01:01:36,240
relationship between the pressure both

1685
01:01:34,139 --> 01:01:40,259
in the roots and within the the soil

1686
01:01:36,239 --> 01:01:42,959
itself changes they can't uptake salt

1687
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:43,799
so if you're feeding with 50 degree

1688
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,780
water

1689
01:01:43,798 --> 01:01:47,880
and you've got and you're growing with

1690
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:49,140
like Canna or you know or Athena or any

1691
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:51,180
of these things people are mentioning

1692
01:01:49,139 --> 01:01:52,980
and it's too cold your plants are all

1693
01:01:51,179 --> 01:01:54,419
going to suffer because the plant's not

1694
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:55,858
going to suck up the nutrition your pH

1695
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:58,559
can be perfect

1696
01:01:55,858 --> 01:02:01,558
right but the temperature's too much for

1697
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:03,599
it it needs a certain temperature range

1698
01:02:01,559 --> 01:02:05,940
yeah and there's also a thing too where

1699
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:08,160
it's like water in the 80s holds like

1700
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:09,358
half the oxygen that water in the 60s

1701
01:02:08,159 --> 01:02:11,159
holds

1702
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:14,699
so there's actually like a window there

1703
01:02:11,159 --> 01:02:16,379
yeah where like mid 60s to low 70s is

1704
01:02:14,699 --> 01:02:19,558
probably the best ratio of like

1705
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:21,119
absorbability versus Like Oxygen ratio

1706
01:02:19,559 --> 01:02:23,460
because the only place your plant really

1707
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:25,980
absorbs oxygen is through its roots

1708
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:28,318
yeah it takes CO2 in through the leaves

1709
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:30,599
and it takes O2 into the roots

1710
01:02:28,318 --> 01:02:32,279
you know and when people over water

1711
01:02:30,599 --> 01:02:34,200
that's what [ __ ] the plant up is

1712
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:35,540
there's no Oxygen in there

1713
01:02:34,199 --> 01:02:38,818
yeah

1714
01:02:35,539 --> 01:02:40,079
The Roots can't breathe so they drown

1715
01:02:38,818 --> 01:02:42,960
right

1716
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:44,579
and so you know there's an aspect where

1717
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:46,500
it's like if you're growing indoor and

1718
01:02:44,579 --> 01:02:48,000
you want to be organic

1719
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:49,500
um there's trade-offs like you see these

1720
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,239
people that are like oh they're I'm on

1721
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:53,940
the 26th cycle

1722
01:02:51,239 --> 01:02:56,879
you know I just add various amendments

1723
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:58,039
over time I just water it the bio you

1724
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:00,119
know the the

1725
01:02:58,039 --> 01:03:01,558
organic does what it needs to do the

1726
01:03:00,119 --> 01:03:02,519
plant absorbs what it wants when it

1727
01:03:01,559 --> 01:03:04,500
wants

1728
01:03:02,519 --> 01:03:06,539
but then I have people that grow organic

1729
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:08,699
that grow in pots and their whole goal

1730
01:03:06,539 --> 01:03:11,099
is to give it enough food to veg and

1731
01:03:08,699 --> 01:03:14,939
Bloom to where they want and then run

1732
01:03:11,099 --> 01:03:16,500
out of food towards the end so that the

1733
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:17,760
plant starts to starve itself for

1734
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:19,679
nutrition and you start getting all

1735
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:20,460
those beautiful autumn colors on the

1736
01:03:19,679 --> 01:03:22,078
plant

1737
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:23,699
yeah and then when you harvest it it's

1738
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:25,260
used up all of its excess because if

1739
01:03:23,699 --> 01:03:27,419
you're growing knf style or you're

1740
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:28,920
growing like stuff that's amended that

1741
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:30,539
you just you know you're no-till and

1742
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:32,760
you're never changing it well then

1743
01:03:30,539 --> 01:03:35,219
you're never flushing for instance yeah

1744
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:36,200
and so some people are a big believer in

1745
01:03:35,219 --> 01:03:38,338
flush

1746
01:03:36,199 --> 01:03:40,379
you know whether you even salt or

1747
01:03:38,338 --> 01:03:41,759
organic some people want to give it just

1748
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:44,460
the amount of food it needs and then

1749
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:46,440
starve it yeah and some people give it

1750
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:49,199
chock full food right up until the end

1751
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:51,358
of flower yeah and a lot of times when

1752
01:03:49,199 --> 01:03:53,039
you're growing for production you know

1753
01:03:51,358 --> 01:03:54,719
like people the other thing is is like

1754
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:56,159
when you're growing through flour and

1755
01:03:54,719 --> 01:03:58,618
this always used to make me laugh right

1756
01:03:56,159 --> 01:04:03,500
is that people want the best weed

1757
01:03:58,619 --> 01:04:05,640
but one yellow leaf and you [ __ ] up

1758
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:06,719
you know they're looking at a bag and

1759
01:04:05,639 --> 01:04:08,879
they're like oh there's a little bit of

1760
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:10,439
there's a bit of brown in there yeah

1761
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:12,358
there's a tiny little bit of yellow you

1762
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:13,500
should give me a deal yeah this is some

1763
01:04:12,358 --> 01:04:15,139
[ __ ] up weed and you're like no I

1764
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:18,000
flushed it for two weeks it's perfect

1765
01:04:15,139 --> 01:04:19,679
right that's supposed to look and

1766
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,380
they're like no no it's got some funk in

1767
01:04:19,679 --> 01:04:24,118
it so a lot of people will just Pump It

1768
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:26,519
right up until the day of harvest

1769
01:04:24,119 --> 01:04:28,318
because it looks better because it looks

1770
01:04:26,519 --> 01:04:29,519
better to the broker that's not going to

1771
01:04:28,318 --> 01:04:31,739
smoke as good

1772
01:04:29,519 --> 01:04:33,358
yeah but it looks better to the broker

1773
01:04:31,739 --> 01:04:34,798
yeah and that's what they care about

1774
01:04:33,358 --> 01:04:36,298
they don't want the broker to [ __ ] and

1775
01:04:34,798 --> 01:04:38,460
start kicking the tires and try to knock

1776
01:04:36,298 --> 01:04:40,619
points off yeah

1777
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:43,139
right and so then people don't grow as

1778
01:04:40,619 --> 01:04:44,579
nice of weed I mean there's even a thing

1779
01:04:43,139 --> 01:04:48,298
where

1780
01:04:44,579 --> 01:04:50,818
like you know uh I'll say this about the

1781
01:04:48,298 --> 01:04:53,099
chems where it's like if you grow the

1782
01:04:50,818 --> 01:04:55,318
dog or what people call the chem 91 now

1783
01:04:53,099 --> 01:04:57,380
and you take it what we all use to take

1784
01:04:55,318 --> 01:05:00,358
it which is about 70-ish days

1785
01:04:57,380 --> 01:05:03,539
it usually tests between 18 and 22

1786
01:05:00,358 --> 01:05:08,119
percent yeah and it knocks your head off

1787
01:05:03,539 --> 01:05:10,619
right but if you take it 53 or 54 days

1788
01:05:08,119 --> 01:05:14,818
it'll still have white hairs all over it

1789
01:05:10,619 --> 01:05:16,680
but it'll test 28 to 32 percent yeah and

1790
01:05:14,818 --> 01:05:18,779
so a lot of people that like put it on

1791
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:20,399
the market they take it early

1792
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:23,400
right to get that high percentage

1793
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:25,619
because the the shop and the and the

1794
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:27,660
distro or whatever like it's one they

1795
01:05:25,619 --> 01:05:29,338
don't want to give you for a 19 or 21

1796
01:05:27,659 --> 01:05:31,379
weed they don't want to give you the

1797
01:05:29,338 --> 01:05:33,779
price point that's so [ __ ] but if

1798
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:34,858
it's 31 so you'll you'll see weed and

1799
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:36,540
you're like I'll look at this weed and

1800
01:05:34,858 --> 01:05:40,279
I'll be like that dog is like two weeks

1801
01:05:36,539 --> 01:05:44,159
premium yeah but a test at 30 percent

1802
01:05:40,280 --> 01:05:45,720
and the shop is happy yeah the distro is

1803
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:49,259
happy and they'll give you your price

1804
01:05:45,719 --> 01:05:52,019
yeah and it's not as good for the smoker

1805
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:53,579
right but yeah a lot in a lot of cases

1806
01:05:52,019 --> 01:05:56,280
like these regulations and these new

1807
01:05:53,579 --> 01:05:59,280
rules are not taking the smoker into

1808
01:05:56,280 --> 01:06:02,280
account I mean it in some sense though

1809
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:05,040
like I think smokers may have priced

1810
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:07,940
themselves out just by

1811
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:10,558
just by

1812
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:13,200
absorbing things like cookies things

1813
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:15,839
things that are you know cardboardy with

1814
01:06:13,199 --> 01:06:17,699
high THC stuff and they were happy with

1815
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:19,440
it despite most people like when you

1816
01:06:17,699 --> 01:06:21,480
really ask them like do you really like

1817
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:22,740
like that you know the form cut do you

1818
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:24,599
really like getting high off that like

1819
01:06:22,739 --> 01:06:26,519
they'll be like oh it's okay you know

1820
01:06:24,599 --> 01:06:30,180
for 20 minutes or 10 minutes and then

1821
01:06:26,519 --> 01:06:32,400
it's you know whatever but yeah they

1822
01:06:30,179 --> 01:06:33,419
kind of let themselves be told what to

1823
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,818
buy

1824
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:38,460
you know they do and this is where we

1825
01:06:35,818 --> 01:06:40,380
ended up they so there's an aspect one

1826
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:42,000
of the things that's interesting and

1827
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:44,039
it's something I mentioned before but it

1828
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,440
Bears repeating I guess is like the

1829
01:06:44,039 --> 01:06:48,660
first four or five years that they

1830
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:52,619
published like the emerald cup and like

1831
01:06:48,659 --> 01:06:55,379
some High Times entries for THC and you

1832
01:06:52,619 --> 01:06:57,838
were able to see like you know before

1833
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:59,640
people were breeding by numbers

1834
01:06:57,838 --> 01:07:02,338
before a lot of breeders were getting

1835
01:06:59,639 --> 01:07:04,679
data on like what you know what what the

1836
01:07:02,338 --> 01:07:08,699
THC content was almost everything that

1837
01:07:04,679 --> 01:07:11,699
was winning was between 22 and 26 yeah

1838
01:07:08,699 --> 01:07:14,219
there was like four or five things in

1839
01:07:11,699 --> 01:07:17,219
the first five years like that ever

1840
01:07:14,219 --> 01:07:18,959
tested in the upper 20s or hit 30. yeah

1841
01:07:17,219 --> 01:07:20,759
yeah right like in like in two of them

1842
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,740
were chem 91 there was a Strawberry

1843
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:25,260
Cough there was another weird one you

1844
01:07:22,739 --> 01:07:28,699
remember how rare the 30 Club used to be

1845
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:31,380
yeah yeah it was unheard of until like

1846
01:07:28,699 --> 01:07:34,379
2009 10 people started claiming the 30s

1847
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:37,200
30 right and so now you have this so

1848
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:39,660
basically all the favorite weed that

1849
01:07:37,199 --> 01:07:42,118
people were paying good digits for was

1850
01:07:39,659 --> 01:07:44,338
coming in in the low to mid 20s at best

1851
01:07:42,119 --> 01:07:47,400
yeah so it basically means as soon as

1852
01:07:44,338 --> 01:07:49,440
you hit High Teens to mid-20s that's

1853
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:51,298
where almost all the elites were falling

1854
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:54,179
yeah everything that everybody [ __ ]

1855
01:07:51,298 --> 01:07:56,099
drools over from back then cushions

1856
01:07:54,179 --> 01:07:58,259
sours [ __ ] all this [ __ ] was all

1857
01:07:56,099 --> 01:08:00,119
hitting that range yeah and then people

1858
01:07:58,260 --> 01:08:03,299
started growing because shops were like

1859
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:06,420
I'll pay you more for higher THC yeah so

1860
01:08:03,298 --> 01:08:07,259
they start selecting cuts that test

1861
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:09,900
better

1862
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:10,740
yeah not necessarily ones that smoke

1863
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:13,858
better

1864
01:08:10,739 --> 01:08:16,198
and start selecting the labs that test

1865
01:08:13,858 --> 01:08:19,079
higher so now that's why I say breeding

1866
01:08:16,198 --> 01:08:20,818
by numbers yeah so instead of breeding

1867
01:08:19,079 --> 01:08:23,219
by smoke testing and what your friends

1868
01:08:20,819 --> 01:08:25,500
think and how long lasting the high is

1869
01:08:23,219 --> 01:08:27,659
like you were mentioning or how intense

1870
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:30,479
it might be they start being like Oh

1871
01:08:27,659 --> 01:08:31,920
well this one tests at 32 and four

1872
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:33,838
percent terpenes

1873
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:36,600
there is no such thing as a [ __ ] high

1874
01:08:33,838 --> 01:08:38,238
30 yet is there

1875
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:40,319
I mean

1876
01:08:38,238 --> 01:08:43,318
so I mean there's there's a lot of

1877
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:44,940
things that people do like like uh you

1878
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:46,980
know CSI have talked about this a bunch

1879
01:08:44,939 --> 01:08:49,379
where there's a lot of labs that over

1880
01:08:46,979 --> 01:08:51,358
test sure because it's good for the

1881
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:54,179
distro it's good for the store it makes

1882
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:56,039
an easy sale everybody likes it and so

1883
01:08:54,179 --> 01:08:58,560
he's done experiments where he sent

1884
01:08:56,039 --> 01:09:00,719
things off to commercial labs and sent

1885
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:03,000
the same Bud to a friend who he knows is

1886
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:04,500
going to do an accurate test and it

1887
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,698
might be as much as five or eight

1888
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:08,000
percent different

1889
01:09:05,698 --> 01:09:10,738
oh yeah I've seen it much different

1890
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,600
vastly different it's insane but the

1891
01:09:10,738 --> 01:09:14,278
thing is is now you've got five or six

1892
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:16,620
or seven or eight years ten years or

1893
01:09:14,279 --> 01:09:19,620
whatever breeding by numbers and there's

1894
01:09:16,619 --> 01:09:21,119
a huge 30 plus percent Club oh good good

1895
01:09:19,619 --> 01:09:24,298
skunk Master Flex posted something

1896
01:09:21,119 --> 01:09:27,000
that's 40 well there we go so you start

1897
01:09:24,298 --> 01:09:29,759
getting higher and higher right and but

1898
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:31,079
then the effect sucks yeah

1899
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:33,659
something like what does that matter

1900
01:09:31,079 --> 01:09:36,119
yeah

1901
01:09:33,659 --> 01:09:39,358
I had a blueberry purple punch test at

1902
01:09:36,119 --> 01:09:40,559
34 so you know anything's possible you

1903
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:42,060
can't even pull those numbers out of

1904
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:43,620
them individually you know and what's

1905
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:46,259
crazy about that is when you think about

1906
01:09:43,619 --> 01:09:48,420
30 or 35 or 40 like Matt was just

1907
01:09:46,259 --> 01:09:52,560
laughing about that's the percentage of

1908
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:54,600
THC by weight on the flower yes so yes

1909
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:56,280
it's crazy because you start getting

1910
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:58,560
these numbers and it's like is it just

1911
01:09:56,279 --> 01:10:01,079
going to be like

1912
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:03,060
you know how much THC can you pack on a

1913
01:10:01,079 --> 01:10:04,559
plant yeah and how much is left for

1914
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:06,960
cannabinoids and other cannabinoids and

1915
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:09,300
yeah and it's not obviously like alcohol

1916
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:10,859
where Everclear is stronger than vodka

1917
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:12,719
which is stronger than Wine which is

1918
01:10:10,859 --> 01:10:16,439
stronger than beer it doesn't work like

1919
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:19,020
that like there is there is a certain

1920
01:10:16,439 --> 01:10:20,339
situation where like you know CSI and I

1921
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:22,440
see Fletch on there there's some old

1922
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:25,079
school strains that only test like eight

1923
01:10:22,439 --> 01:10:27,719
ten twelve percent yeah and they don't

1924
01:10:25,079 --> 01:10:31,439
hit that hard but once you get up to 18

1925
01:10:27,719 --> 01:10:34,020
to 20 to 22 to 24 that's where like all

1926
01:10:31,439 --> 01:10:36,059
the elites and the old best weed faults

1927
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:38,219
you know where most of the skunky stuff

1928
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:40,199
is falling right now that we've been

1929
01:10:38,219 --> 01:10:41,640
looking at low teens

1930
01:10:40,198 --> 01:10:44,279
no

1931
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:46,500
four to eight

1932
01:10:44,279 --> 01:10:49,019
four to eight for the most skunky stuff

1933
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:51,119
I mean you know the the Mendo perps is

1934
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:53,219
supposedly you know seed from the late

1935
01:10:51,119 --> 01:10:54,719
70s or whatever yeah

1936
01:10:53,219 --> 01:10:56,579
um and it tests you know eight or ten

1937
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:59,039
percent at best

1938
01:10:56,579 --> 01:11:01,859
yeah some of the s1s can get up into the

1939
01:10:59,039 --> 01:11:03,119
High Teens but the mom cut itself is

1940
01:11:01,859 --> 01:11:05,460
pretty low

1941
01:11:03,119 --> 01:11:07,500
you know and I think that used to be

1942
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:10,980
super common like I think even like old

1943
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:13,738
school skunk one right it was for 13 to

1944
01:11:10,979 --> 01:11:16,439
15 back then yeah when they could get

1945
01:11:13,738 --> 01:11:18,238
testing done you know

1946
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:20,519
um and so we've gone from like the start

1947
01:11:18,238 --> 01:11:22,859
of everything where things were you know

1948
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:25,500
low to you know single high single

1949
01:11:22,859 --> 01:11:28,619
digits to low teens to Mid teens to

1950
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:31,439
Upper teens low 20s yeah and now it's

1951
01:11:28,619 --> 01:11:33,300
all maybe it's all fake or whatever but

1952
01:11:31,439 --> 01:11:35,158
um it doesn't seem like after a certain

1953
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:38,460
point there's a big correlation between

1954
01:11:35,158 --> 01:11:39,299
High numbers and best effect no not at

1955
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:40,980
all

1956
01:11:39,300 --> 01:11:42,480
because my friend would get all pissed

1957
01:11:40,979 --> 01:11:43,319
off because they'd be like dude I don't

1958
01:11:42,479 --> 01:11:44,939
know if

1959
01:11:43,319 --> 01:11:46,619
I don't know if I can get your weed for

1960
01:11:44,939 --> 01:11:50,399
the right price this dog is only this

1961
01:11:46,619 --> 01:11:52,260
chem 91 is only testing at 18 mm-hmm

1962
01:11:50,399 --> 01:11:54,779
but it took your head off

1963
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:58,739
yeah you know but they would rather take

1964
01:11:54,779 --> 01:12:00,359
two week preeny chem 91 because it

1965
01:11:58,738 --> 01:12:01,559
tested 29.

1966
01:12:00,359 --> 01:12:04,198
yeah

1967
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:06,600
right and so I just I just think that

1968
01:12:04,198 --> 01:12:09,000
like people started rather the only

1969
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:10,500
thing that matters is like how how it

1970
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,238
affects you

1971
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:15,060
and yes the more people get away with

1972
01:12:12,238 --> 01:12:17,218
effects and like not testing stuff like

1973
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:20,580
by smoking it with a variety of humans

1974
01:12:17,219 --> 01:12:22,619
yeah because even one person two people

1975
01:12:20,579 --> 01:12:25,140
like some of my favorite weed is stuff

1976
01:12:22,619 --> 01:12:26,698
that Matt doesn't like at all yes just

1977
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:28,560
not that he doesn't appreciate it it

1978
01:12:26,698 --> 01:12:30,419
just doesn't make him feel good yeah

1979
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:32,940
yeah some of it just [ __ ] me up like

1980
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:34,679
paranoid or anxiety or yeah yeah some

1981
01:12:32,939 --> 01:12:36,539
people get some people get weirded out

1982
01:12:34,679 --> 01:12:38,460
some people love a buzz some people like

1983
01:12:36,539 --> 01:12:39,779
sativa I mean there's a range of of

1984
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:42,179
effect

1985
01:12:39,779 --> 01:12:43,920
yeah and so I think if you get away from

1986
01:12:42,179 --> 01:12:46,260
like I don't think a bunch of people are

1987
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:47,880
doing smoke testing anymore

1988
01:12:46,260 --> 01:12:49,619
yeah they're trying to find something

1989
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:52,980
that looks impressive and tests

1990
01:12:49,619 --> 01:12:55,260
impressive yeah right and then all of a

1991
01:12:52,979 --> 01:12:56,339
sudden now we have a bunch of like mid Z

1992
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:58,320
Elites

1993
01:12:56,340 --> 01:12:59,940
yeah right

1994
01:12:58,319 --> 01:13:01,259
we have a bunch of Elites where it's

1995
01:12:59,939 --> 01:13:02,639
like people are saying oh I hate Fritter

1996
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:04,500
you know like well there was a minute

1997
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:05,880
there where like and people are growing

1998
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:08,460
stuff because they're like oh this weed

1999
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:10,800
gets this amount of pound yeah it's an

2000
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:12,119
elite so I'm gonna grow lemon Cherry

2001
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:13,980
gelato

2002
01:13:12,119 --> 01:13:15,479
there I'm gonna grow this runts by this

2003
01:13:13,979 --> 01:13:17,459
or I'm gonna grow this jealousy cut

2004
01:13:15,479 --> 01:13:18,899
because my buddies can get top dollar

2005
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:22,198
for it

2006
01:13:18,899 --> 01:13:23,698
and I'm not trying to call it mids but

2007
01:13:22,198 --> 01:13:24,779
it's probably not going to stand the

2008
01:13:23,698 --> 01:13:27,539
test of time

2009
01:13:24,779 --> 01:13:30,300
no you know like like right now sour is

2010
01:13:27,539 --> 01:13:32,640
coming back around diesels yeah why

2011
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:34,679
because it's Fireweed

2012
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:35,520
and it works and it smokes and it tastes

2013
01:13:34,679 --> 01:13:38,219
great

2014
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:40,620
yeah you know and that we weed that

2015
01:13:38,219 --> 01:13:42,119
works is always going to have a

2016
01:13:40,619 --> 01:13:44,039
popularity basis

2017
01:13:42,119 --> 01:13:46,140
yeah we're a weed that doesn't work you

2018
01:13:44,039 --> 01:13:48,658
know like you can only the hype boys can

2019
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:50,640
only hype it for so long

2020
01:13:48,658 --> 01:13:52,259
I mean Berner can obviously sell the

2021
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:56,039
[ __ ] out of anything

2022
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:57,659
yeah yeah you know he's he's great at

2023
01:13:56,039 --> 01:14:00,238
promotion he's great at getting hip-hop

2024
01:13:57,658 --> 01:14:02,460
and rap and various Stars smoking his

2025
01:14:00,238 --> 01:14:05,819
weed and exclusive spots and building up

2026
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:07,980
but he's a horrible horrible kisser I

2027
01:14:05,819 --> 01:14:10,019
have no idea you know don't let it lie

2028
01:14:07,979 --> 01:14:12,000
to you he's a liar about that [ __ ] but

2029
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:13,440
there's an aspect where it's like you

2030
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,238
can only promote something for you can

2031
01:14:13,439 --> 01:14:18,299
only force people to life something for

2032
01:14:15,238 --> 01:14:21,599
so long yeah before they make their own

2033
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:23,699
decision yeah right and so that's why

2034
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:25,320
that's why you have all this [ __ ] that

2035
01:14:23,698 --> 01:14:27,779
like gets like flash in the pan that

2036
01:14:25,319 --> 01:14:29,340
gets popular for eight or ten months or

2037
01:14:27,779 --> 01:14:31,380
a year a year and a half

2038
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:34,679
yeah and then it's gone it's replaced by

2039
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:36,539
some new hype yep where things that used

2040
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:38,520
to get popular before like the purples

2041
01:14:36,539 --> 01:14:40,500
or the cushes or the sours or whatever

2042
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:42,600
the Skittles when they become

2043
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:44,579
organically popular

2044
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:47,280
right where it's like grass roots

2045
01:14:44,579 --> 01:14:49,260
popularity drives it they're a lot more

2046
01:14:47,279 --> 01:14:52,198
lasting

2047
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:54,659
yeah than when it's hyped

2048
01:14:52,198 --> 01:14:56,939
you know because hype has become

2049
01:14:54,658 --> 01:14:59,339
marketing cannabis weed wasn't weed

2050
01:14:56,939 --> 01:15:01,799
wasn't ready for modern marketing dude

2051
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:04,079
no we weren't ready for it at all we

2052
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:07,800
were so ripe to be abused by modern

2053
01:15:04,079 --> 01:15:09,600
advertising techniques yeah then like

2054
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:11,279
you know it just got overwhelmed and

2055
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:13,500
people realized oh I don't even need to

2056
01:15:11,279 --> 01:15:14,698
have good weed to make money ten years

2057
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:15,899
ago that [ __ ] wouldn't have worked

2058
01:15:14,698 --> 01:15:17,279
everybody would have laughed at a

2059
01:15:15,899 --> 01:15:19,139
[ __ ] for trying to front that

2060
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:21,238
hard you know but nowadays it's just

2061
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:23,039
flies ten years ago the only way

2062
01:15:21,238 --> 01:15:25,198
something became Elite was when enough

2063
01:15:23,039 --> 01:15:28,560
people that were respected decided it

2064
01:15:25,198 --> 01:15:30,779
was good yeah and like or you know the

2065
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:33,719
market demand or the market demanded it

2066
01:15:30,779 --> 01:15:35,099
yeah and the market really when it boils

2067
01:15:33,719 --> 01:15:37,020
down to it when you have stuff like the

2068
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:38,760
purple wave with the Urkel and the Mendo

2069
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:40,320
p and the Grape Ape and all those and

2070
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:42,239
Granddaddy and all that or you have the

2071
01:15:40,319 --> 01:15:44,519
cush wave in Southern California or the

2072
01:15:42,238 --> 01:15:46,738
sour thing that happened for 10 years

2073
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:48,360
that was Market dictated a bunch of a

2074
01:15:46,738 --> 01:15:50,519
bunch of people wanted to get as much of

2075
01:15:48,359 --> 01:15:52,259
it as they could yeah because they knew

2076
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:54,360
that the customers would endlessly buy

2077
01:15:52,260 --> 01:15:56,460
it and they didn't get burned out yeah

2078
01:15:54,359 --> 01:15:59,579
that's why you can have 40 different

2079
01:15:56,460 --> 01:16:00,840
[ __ ] named cushions in SoCal yeah I

2080
01:15:59,579 --> 01:16:02,279
was trying to name them all the other

2081
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:03,900
day and like made me want to pound my

2082
01:16:02,279 --> 01:16:05,579
head against that because oh there's

2083
01:16:03,899 --> 01:16:07,979
literally like you could walk into in

2084
01:16:05,579 --> 01:16:10,019
you know 2010 you could walk into a

2085
01:16:07,979 --> 01:16:12,178
dispensary in LA and they would

2086
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:15,060
literally have like two dozen kinds of

2087
01:16:12,179 --> 01:16:17,579
kush oh easily some of them had like 50

2088
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:18,900
60 different types of OG's yeah yeah all

2089
01:16:17,579 --> 01:16:20,519
these different names on some of them

2090
01:16:18,899 --> 01:16:22,198
were repeated and just somebody of

2091
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:24,780
course they just had different names

2092
01:16:22,198 --> 01:16:27,238
yeah but yeah like the entire dispensary

2093
01:16:24,779 --> 01:16:30,539
was one family a wheat and slight

2094
01:16:27,238 --> 01:16:31,979
variations yeah you know and you know

2095
01:16:30,539 --> 01:16:33,899
from the east coast and different things

2096
01:16:31,979 --> 01:16:34,919
coming to California sour was like

2097
01:16:33,899 --> 01:16:38,420
endless

2098
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:41,340
yeah it was endless demand for gas

2099
01:16:38,420 --> 01:16:43,079
you know and now instead of seeing

2100
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:44,760
endless demand for one or two things

2101
01:16:43,079 --> 01:16:46,260
that people can focus on a lot of

2102
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:49,079
Growers are like what the [ __ ] do I even

2103
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:50,039
grow yeah because if you're in the legal

2104
01:16:49,079 --> 01:16:52,019
Market

2105
01:16:50,039 --> 01:16:53,880
you don't have a direct connection with

2106
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:56,940
your consumer

2107
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:58,319
you have to get a distro and uh unless

2108
01:16:56,939 --> 01:17:00,839
you own them you have to get a distro

2109
01:16:58,319 --> 01:17:02,698
and then a dispensary to buy it

2110
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:04,739
I remember red

2111
01:17:02,698 --> 01:17:07,979
um up in Canada talking about that with

2112
01:17:04,738 --> 01:17:10,019
the the Canadian legal stuff about now

2113
01:17:07,979 --> 01:17:12,238
they have the buyers or or people that

2114
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:14,280
aren't even from Cannabis now and they

2115
01:17:12,238 --> 01:17:16,019
are who determine what value you're

2116
01:17:14,279 --> 01:17:18,359
getting for your weed non-smoking oh

2117
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:20,400
yeah corporate people honestly that was

2118
01:17:18,359 --> 01:17:22,019
a depressing part of that I really liked

2119
01:17:20,399 --> 01:17:24,960
that interview he was super personable

2120
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:27,120
yeah that was hard to listen to uh just

2121
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:30,420
the just the reality of what matters and

2122
01:17:27,119 --> 01:17:33,420
what doesn't yeah and him looking at at

2123
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:34,980
testing and paperwork and deciding what

2124
01:17:33,420 --> 01:17:37,619
to do without even seeing the week

2125
01:17:34,979 --> 01:17:38,819
because if it didn't have the testing

2126
01:17:37,619 --> 01:17:41,039
and the paperwork right it was

2127
01:17:38,819 --> 01:17:43,619
irrelevant yeah it just didn't matter

2128
01:17:41,039 --> 01:17:44,939
and so a lot of times okay there's a lot

2129
01:17:43,619 --> 01:17:47,279
of stuff out there that's really

2130
01:17:44,939 --> 01:17:49,439
Fireweed and the reason why you can't

2131
01:17:47,279 --> 01:17:51,179
get it is because it doesn't make

2132
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:52,859
Financial sense for the grower to grow

2133
01:17:51,179 --> 01:17:56,219
it because the people that are in

2134
01:17:52,859 --> 01:17:59,639
between him and you don't want to do it

2135
01:17:56,219 --> 01:18:01,920
yeah so you get [ __ ] you personally

2136
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:03,780
out there you get [ __ ] because the

2137
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:05,880
Growers friends get to have it

2138
01:18:03,779 --> 01:18:07,619
sometimes you know it gets traded

2139
01:18:05,880 --> 01:18:09,840
amongst each other it gets survived and

2140
01:18:07,619 --> 01:18:12,840
all that you know but the consumer

2141
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:14,699
doesn't get to see it yeah you know and

2142
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:15,960
we were joking I'll mention it one more

2143
01:18:14,698 --> 01:18:17,579
time because there's there's this you

2144
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:19,260
know huge grow that's getting set up in

2145
01:18:17,579 --> 01:18:20,579
SoCal it's like over 100 acres and

2146
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:21,960
everybody was ragging on them or

2147
01:18:20,579 --> 01:18:24,539
whatever because it's like another big

2148
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:25,980
corporate takeover type thing right yeah

2149
01:18:24,539 --> 01:18:27,300
and you look at their clone list and

2150
01:18:25,979 --> 01:18:29,939
they're getting a bunch of gelato

2151
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:32,119
hybrids and Skittles hybrids

2152
01:18:29,939 --> 01:18:34,319
right like the market is under

2153
01:18:32,119 --> 01:18:36,719
underserved right now with gelato and

2154
01:18:34,319 --> 01:18:38,158
Skittles yeah they really got to fill

2155
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:42,000
that niche

2156
01:18:38,158 --> 01:18:44,460
yeah of course not you know and so and

2157
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:46,140
you know if if customers could buy

2158
01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:48,539
straight from the farm or straight from

2159
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:50,159
cooperatives or whatever you know then

2160
01:18:48,539 --> 01:18:51,840
cooperatives would be able to grow more

2161
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:54,119

yeah you know because because there's

2198
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:16,199
there's like you know consumers don't

2199
01:20:15,119 --> 01:20:18,599
have power

2200
01:20:16,198 --> 01:20:20,039
to demand they have to go to the store

2201
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:21,840
and they have to buy what the store

2202
01:20:20,039 --> 01:20:23,698
wants to put in their store

2203
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:25,500
yeah

2204
01:20:23,698 --> 01:20:28,019
you know and that that might be getting

2205
01:20:25,500 --> 01:20:29,760
chosen based on their margin

2206
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:31,800
there's this company up by me [ __ ]

2207
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:33,719
floccana right they blew through a [ __ ]

2208
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:35,400
ton of money do you know I don't know if

2209
01:20:33,719 --> 01:20:38,100
people know this but like there's a lot

2210
01:20:35,399 --> 01:20:40,259
of big companies that pay dispensaries

2211
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:44,400
for shelf space

2212
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:46,739
yeah straight self space shelf space

2213
01:20:44,399 --> 01:20:49,500
like be you know and that and that's a

2214
01:20:46,738 --> 01:20:51,718
profit they make just to put the [ __ ]

2215
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:53,640
the weed on the Shelf so the consumer

2216
01:20:51,719 --> 01:20:55,859
can see it

2217
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:57,659
you know in the 50s or in the 60s or

2218
01:20:55,859 --> 01:20:59,819
whatever there was that huge record

2219
01:20:57,658 --> 01:21:02,219
Scandal because everybody all the DJs

2220
01:20:59,819 --> 01:21:04,738
disc jockeys it was pay to play oh yeah

2221
01:21:02,219 --> 01:21:06,658
the Paola yeah so how did how does your

2222
01:21:04,738 --> 01:21:08,158
how does your hit get be popular if you

2223
01:21:06,658 --> 01:21:09,359
can't get a radio station to play it so

2224
01:21:08,158 --> 01:21:10,259
people hear it and they want to go buy

2225
01:21:09,359 --> 01:21:11,819
your album

2226
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:13,560
yeah and there's people that were

2227
01:21:11,819 --> 01:21:15,299
getting bribed to play certain things

2228
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:17,460
and not play others

2229
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:18,659
yep I'm connecting it to music again but

2230
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:19,980
it's the same [ __ ] thing these

2231
01:21:18,658 --> 01:21:22,079
dispensaries because there's not enough

2232
01:21:19,979 --> 01:21:24,119
of them they're deciding what gets on

2233
01:21:22,079 --> 01:21:26,399
their shelf and not and they're deciding

2234
01:21:24,119 --> 01:21:28,679
it what's based on what's good for them

2235
01:21:26,399 --> 01:21:30,238
yeah not what's good for the consumer

2236
01:21:28,679 --> 01:21:33,779
out there what's good for them

2237
01:21:30,238 --> 01:21:35,279
yeah you know so choice is actually gone

2238
01:21:33,779 --> 01:21:37,619
down

2239
01:21:35,279 --> 01:21:40,679
quite a bit quite a bit expenses up

2240
01:21:37,619 --> 01:21:42,359
quality is down choice is down and how

2241
01:21:40,679 --> 01:21:45,060
do you how do you like let's say that

2242
01:21:42,359 --> 01:21:47,039
that you know CSI or somebody like or me

2243
01:21:45,060 --> 01:21:49,500
or whoever Fletch comes up with an

2244
01:21:47,039 --> 01:21:51,300
amazing new hybrid yeah

2245
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:52,920
right unless you're vertically

2246
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:54,480
integrated and you can control the

2247
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:56,399
supply chain you can't even guarantee

2248
01:21:54,479 --> 01:21:58,738
you're going to get it in a shop

2249
01:21:56,399 --> 01:22:01,979
oh yeah you can't guarantee at all that

2250
01:21:58,738 --> 01:22:05,759
a bud tender will give a [ __ ] yeah

2251
01:22:01,979 --> 01:22:07,500
you know so it's like a whole Deluge of

2252
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:08,579
like everything that's already already

2253
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:11,760
popular

2254
01:22:08,579 --> 01:22:14,158
and variations on that theme

2255
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:17,400
you know and it gets controlled and so

2256
01:22:14,158 --> 01:22:19,319
the reason why I think that all these

2257
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:21,299
Elites from I always talk about like the

2258
01:22:19,319 --> 01:22:24,359
90s and the early 2000s are still my

2259
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:28,940
favorite era of weed is it's because the

2260
01:22:24,359 --> 01:22:28,939
best weed from then was consumer choice

2261
01:22:29,060 --> 01:22:33,960
sorry I just read that question popped

2262
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:36,179
up after everything we said and I was

2263
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:38,579
just anyway yeah anyway but you know but

2264
01:22:36,179 --> 01:22:40,679
yeah that you know it it all the you

2265
01:22:38,579 --> 01:22:42,899
know sour became popular Kush became

2266
01:22:40,679 --> 01:22:43,980
popular because people wanted it they

2267
01:22:42,899 --> 01:22:47,099
were willing to spend a bunch of money

2268
01:22:43,979 --> 01:22:49,019
on it there was demand and yeah you know

2269
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:50,159
and and people wanted to fill that

2270
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:53,340
demand

2271
01:22:50,158 --> 01:22:55,139
yeah and now it's like oh it's you know

2272
01:22:53,340 --> 01:22:57,179
it's here's a bunch of here's a bunch of

2273
01:22:55,140 --> 01:22:59,640
weed and with nurseries people might not

2274
01:22:57,179 --> 01:23:01,500
know this but most most like cultivators

2275
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:03,060
they don't even get to keep their own

2276
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:04,079
mom house they have to get it from a

2277
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:06,000
nursery

2278
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:08,698
that's so wild and then the nursery

2279
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:10,260
might offer 10 or 15 different things

2280
01:23:08,698 --> 01:23:11,819
for this season

2281
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:13,380
they might have a hundred things but

2282
01:23:11,819 --> 01:23:16,500
they're only they only mommed up enough

2283
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:19,020
to do like a lot of certain stuff

2284
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:21,840
yeah so then you're you're forced to

2285
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:23,820
operate off their menu

2286
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:26,100
so it's like the nursery limits you

2287
01:23:23,819 --> 01:23:27,960
right like when I was working in a big

2288
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:30,719
scene a couple of years ago I was trying

2289
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:33,840
to find some some real Sour Diesel like

2290
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:35,939
on the legal Market metric yeah

2291
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:37,140
and I couldn't find it pure

2292
01:23:35,939 --> 01:23:39,359
of course the best thing I could find

2293
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:41,579
was spyrox Sour which was some Sour

2294
01:23:39,359 --> 01:23:43,679
across the some kush

2295
01:23:41,579 --> 01:23:46,920
I couldn't find it pure to grow on the

2296
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:48,960
farm I was Consulting at yeah you know

2297
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:50,340
but back in the day in 215 you could be

2298
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:52,500
like oh we're gonna fill these four

2299
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:53,819
greenhouses with this yeah and then

2300
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:55,198
we're gonna take duffel bags to The

2301
01:23:53,819 --> 01:23:57,359
Dispensary

2302
01:23:55,198 --> 01:23:59,279
and then you're gonna buy it

2303
01:23:57,359 --> 01:24:02,759
people are gonna be stoked

2304
01:23:59,279 --> 01:24:06,059
64 ruin the [ __ ] world most of most

2305
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:08,400
of most of uh most of the good cushion a

2306
01:24:06,060 --> 01:24:10,140
lot of the Good Kush that was in LA came

2307
01:24:08,399 --> 01:24:12,359
from my neck of the woods

2308
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:14,340
yeah there was constantly Brokers coming

2309
01:24:12,359 --> 01:24:16,920
up that their entire job was just to

2310
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:19,860
grab excess capacity from up here and

2311
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:21,359
bring it down to the the SoCal you know

2312
01:24:19,859 --> 01:24:24,899
dispensaries

2313
01:24:21,359 --> 01:24:26,519
yeah you know and and so people could go

2314
01:24:24,899 --> 01:24:28,679
hunt the best weed

2315
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:31,080
and then go me and then the BR and then

2316
01:24:28,679 --> 01:24:32,520
the you know the the uh dispensaries

2317
01:24:31,079 --> 01:24:33,539
could pick the best week if they wanted

2318
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:35,159
to

2319
01:24:33,539 --> 01:24:36,539
yeah now it's like they have to buy it

2320
01:24:35,158 --> 01:24:38,099
from a dispense they have to buy it from

2321
01:24:36,539 --> 01:24:40,079
a distro and the distro has to buy it

2322
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:42,000
from a farmer and it just turned

2323
01:24:40,079 --> 01:24:43,140
everything into like a commodity

2324
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,939
yeah

2325
01:24:43,140 --> 01:24:47,039
you know and so as a result of that

2326
01:24:44,939 --> 01:24:48,479
everybody I never thought I was worried

2327
01:24:47,039 --> 01:24:50,939
about a bunch of [ __ ] with legalization

2328
01:24:48,479 --> 01:24:53,519
I never thought that like we would

2329
01:24:50,939 --> 01:24:55,979
accept way higher prices than the black

2330
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:57,060
market or the gray market and shittier

2331
01:24:55,979 --> 01:25:00,059
quality

2332
01:24:57,060 --> 01:25:02,460
yeah but so far that's what we've got

2333
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:05,100
yep sure is

2334
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:06,859
you know that's what we've got and so

2335
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:09,120
you know we started off talking about

2336
01:25:06,859 --> 01:25:10,920
and the reason why we've gotten that is

2337
01:25:09,119 --> 01:25:13,260
because you have all these

2338
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:15,539
commercial Farms that have intense

2339
01:25:13,260 --> 01:25:17,280
pressure with taxes and overhead and

2340
01:25:15,539 --> 01:25:21,359
regulations and paying out all this

2341
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:24,059
[ __ ] money right and quality and

2342
01:25:21,359 --> 01:25:25,859
consumer happiness is like they do the

2343
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:27,000
best they can in some instances but it's

2344
01:25:25,859 --> 01:25:28,859
not that great

2345
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:30,899
but they're doing the best they can with

2346
01:25:28,859 --> 01:25:33,299
the constraints they're put under

2347
01:25:30,899 --> 01:25:35,158
yeah and a lot of little things that you

2348
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:36,539
used to get done to make weed nice is

2349
01:25:35,158 --> 01:25:40,079
getting eliminated

2350
01:25:36,539 --> 01:25:41,579
yeah and so your weed isn't as nice

2351
01:25:40,079 --> 01:25:43,500
you know and people talk about all the

2352
01:25:41,579 --> 01:25:44,880
time your weed is fire your weed's not

2353
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:48,600
fire

2354
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:49,980
yeah you know and a lot of times it's

2355
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:51,420
like some of these things like the

2356
01:25:49,979 --> 01:25:52,619
emerald cup and all this different [ __ ]

2357
01:25:51,420 --> 01:25:54,960
you know

2358
01:25:52,619 --> 01:25:56,639
like and I'm not saying this I've known

2359
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:59,100
Tim for a long time so this isn't a

2360
01:25:56,639 --> 01:26:01,199
distant him and on any level but

2361
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:03,300
when you're forced to basically like for

2362
01:26:01,198 --> 01:26:04,979
the most part only accept from like

2363
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:07,199
licensed buyers

2364
01:26:04,979 --> 01:26:08,698
people aren't entering the best weed in

2365
01:26:07,198 --> 01:26:10,259
California anymore

2366
01:26:08,698 --> 01:26:12,119
no no

2367
01:26:10,260 --> 01:26:13,920
because you have to cut off this large

2368
01:26:12,119 --> 01:26:15,779
segment of the population that used to

2369
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:17,279
win [ __ ] cups

2370
01:26:15,779 --> 01:26:19,079
yeah that used to be able to come there

2371
01:26:17,279 --> 01:26:20,039
with their perfectly grown Greenhouse

2372
01:26:19,079 --> 01:26:21,479
weed

2373
01:26:20,039 --> 01:26:23,279
from their little Greenhouse that they

2374
01:26:21,479 --> 01:26:25,019
treated perfect and they got to give two

2375
01:26:23,279 --> 01:26:27,300
for two to four ounces to the testing

2376
01:26:25,020 --> 01:26:30,300
and then they placed third

2377
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:31,619
yeah oh but you know but but the thing

2378
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:33,000
is the difference Fletcher's like stop

2379
01:26:31,619 --> 01:26:34,679
[ __ ] on my weed the difference

2380
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,420
between Fletcher from what like from

2381
01:26:34,679 --> 01:26:38,579
archive from what I understand is that

2382
01:26:36,420 --> 01:26:41,940
they have a dispensary

2383
01:26:38,579 --> 01:26:44,039
yes they have control archive can make a

2384
01:26:41,939 --> 01:26:46,138
choice to I'm like I'm gonna take the

2385
01:26:44,039 --> 01:26:47,819
moonbow I'm going to take this that I

2386
01:26:46,139 --> 01:26:49,500
love and I'm going to make sure

2387
01:26:47,819 --> 01:26:50,579
consumers get it

2388
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:51,719
yeah

2389
01:26:50,579 --> 01:26:54,899
right

2390
01:26:51,719 --> 01:26:57,000
so but most performers most farmers in

2391
01:26:54,899 --> 01:26:59,399
California aren't vertically integrated

2392
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,779
yeah they have to sell their they have

2393
01:26:59,399 --> 01:27:02,279
to sell their week

2394
01:27:00,779 --> 01:27:03,840
you know and so if you're vertically

2395
01:27:02,279 --> 01:27:06,238
integrated then you can have some

2396
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:07,619
uniqueness and you can choose like he

2397
01:27:06,238 --> 01:27:08,939
could choose to take things that he

2398
01:27:07,619 --> 01:27:11,039
doesn't want to share

2399
01:27:08,939 --> 01:27:12,539
and you can only come to his stores to

2400
01:27:11,039 --> 01:27:14,760
get them

2401
01:27:12,539 --> 01:27:17,219
it's no fair [ __ ]

2402
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:19,560
you know and and a lot of people are cut

2403
01:27:17,219 --> 01:27:23,100
off and a lot of people's top shelf yeah

2404
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:24,360
dispensaries top shelf used to be six to

2405
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:25,620
twenty lighters

2406
01:27:24,359 --> 01:27:28,380
yeah

2407
01:27:25,619 --> 01:27:30,840
you know done by small-scale people

2408
01:27:28,380 --> 01:27:33,359
and that was constantly filling the top

2409
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:35,460
shelf because that was the top shelf

2410
01:27:33,359 --> 01:27:37,019
yep now all those people are [ __ ] cut

2411
01:27:35,460 --> 01:27:39,119
off

2412
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:41,760
and what used to be the Mitzi shelf is

2413
01:27:39,119 --> 01:27:43,880
now top shelf for more money while those

2414
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:46,679
people are looking for new [ __ ] jobs

2415
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:49,319
you know and so a lot of the best weed

2416
01:27:46,679 --> 01:27:52,079
got cut off from consumers

2417
01:27:49,319 --> 01:27:53,819
yeah you know before they could even

2418
01:27:52,079 --> 01:27:56,579
smoke it

2419
01:27:53,819 --> 01:27:58,859
you know you can't like I don't know you

2420
01:27:56,579 --> 01:28:00,300
can't you can't get real Haze in

2421
01:27:58,859 --> 01:28:01,319
California

2422
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:02,219
yeah

2423
01:28:01,319 --> 01:28:04,198
no

2424
01:28:02,219 --> 01:28:06,239
you can't get real Sour Diesel it's

2425
01:28:04,198 --> 01:28:09,000
starting to make a comeback maybe it'll

2426
01:28:06,238 --> 01:28:10,799
start forcing itself on some shelves

2427
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:13,020
yeah yeah

2428
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:15,119
but there's only but then there's all

2429
01:28:13,020 --> 01:28:16,739
this stuff too where it's like these

2430
01:28:15,119 --> 01:28:18,179
vertically integrated companies like if

2431
01:28:16,738 --> 01:28:19,678
you're gonna get from Jungle boys or

2432
01:28:18,179 --> 01:28:21,179
whoever you're probably going to get

2433
01:28:19,679 --> 01:28:22,440
mostly their weed that they're growing

2434
01:28:21,179 --> 01:28:24,060
because they want to sell their weed

2435
01:28:22,439 --> 01:28:25,799
through their Outlet

2436
01:28:24,060 --> 01:28:28,380
yeah

2437
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:30,119
two so then you know you get the

2438
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:31,859
selection from them

2439
01:28:30,119 --> 01:28:33,779
you know and a lot of these dispensaries

2440
01:28:31,859 --> 01:28:36,299
have captured markets

2441
01:28:33,779 --> 01:28:38,579
so yeah what you're getting is you're

2442
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:41,400
getting a lot of commercially grown weed

2443
01:28:38,579 --> 01:28:45,179
that they're trying to grow for cheap

2444
01:28:41,399 --> 01:28:47,219
and get a minimum level of quality

2445
01:28:45,179 --> 01:28:49,739
and then you're trapped because you can

2446
01:28:47,219 --> 01:28:50,639
only there's only you know 700 stores in

2447
01:28:49,738 --> 01:28:53,099
California

2448
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:55,679
you got to buy it in one of them and you

2449
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:57,900
can't really get great deals so you end

2450
01:28:55,679 --> 01:28:59,039
up like getting a bunch of expensive

2451
01:28:57,899 --> 01:29:01,979
commercial

2452
01:28:59,039 --> 01:29:05,158
yeah and that access to that actual top

2453
01:29:01,979 --> 01:29:07,019
self top shelf that actual fire that was

2454
01:29:05,158 --> 01:29:09,059
treated deliciously and grown perfectly

2455
01:29:07,020 --> 01:29:10,980
with organic or salt or whatever and all

2456
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:12,600
the little things done the right way

2457
01:29:10,979 --> 01:29:13,500
yeah you don't even get to see that

2458
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:16,800
anymore

2459
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:18,719
yeah like you know what's funny is uh

2460
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:21,600
all these American beer companies were

2461
01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:24,420
never winning any any beer Awards

2462
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:26,239
did you know that right no so these all

2463
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:29,100
these like International competitions

2464
01:29:26,238 --> 01:29:31,079
obviously like Michelob and Milwaukee's

2465
01:29:29,100 --> 01:29:33,000
best and Budweiser and all that were

2466
01:29:31,079 --> 01:29:35,340
never winning any gold medals at any of

2467
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:38,639
these at any of these competitions the

2468
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:40,020
Beast wasn't winning medals no so they

2469
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:42,179
made their own

2470
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:43,500
they made their own category American

2471
01:29:42,179 --> 01:29:45,600
lager

2472
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:47,039
oh now so now a bunch of these companies

2473
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:49,199
have gold medals

2474
01:29:47,039 --> 01:29:50,639
because they were only [ __ ] competing

2475
01:29:49,198 --> 01:29:52,738
against themselves

2476
01:29:50,639 --> 01:29:54,420
yeah right when they were competing

2477
01:29:52,738 --> 01:29:56,218
against other micro breweries and places

2478
01:29:54,420 --> 01:29:58,619
from Belgium and Germany and all that

2479
01:29:56,219 --> 01:29:59,698
[ __ ] they had no chance yeah their beer

2480
01:29:58,619 --> 01:30:02,399
wasn't as good

2481
01:29:59,698 --> 01:30:04,500
yeah right so now you're getting the

2482
01:30:02,399 --> 01:30:06,899
same thing here where you're getting all

2483
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:09,359
these big factory farms and they're like

2484
01:30:06,899 --> 01:30:11,579
do you want old style do you want Old

2485
01:30:09,359 --> 01:30:13,738
Milwaukee do you want Michelob do you

2486
01:30:11,579 --> 01:30:16,319
want Budweiser do you want cores

2487
01:30:13,738 --> 01:30:18,238
yeah you know like oh you want some

2488
01:30:16,319 --> 01:30:21,599
heady how about some Heineken

2489
01:30:18,238 --> 01:30:22,500
yeah maybe some Amstel Light get an

2490
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:24,420
import

2491
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:26,100
right and that's what they're you're

2492
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:28,619
competing against you'd actually can't

2493
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:30,060
get these little you can't get these

2494
01:30:28,619 --> 01:30:32,579
little things where the quality really

2495
01:30:30,060 --> 01:30:35,520
matters and until they open that stuff

2496
01:30:32,579 --> 01:30:38,579
up so if you're growing for yourself

2497
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:40,080
I said it before don't emulate some big

2498
01:30:38,579 --> 01:30:42,779
farm

2499
01:30:40,079 --> 01:30:44,819
yeah they're cutting corners

2500
01:30:42,779 --> 01:30:46,019
they're doing things that only work at

2501
01:30:44,819 --> 01:30:49,738
scale

2502
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:51,480
mm-hmm you know uh and and all that

2503
01:30:49,738 --> 01:30:52,859
right like do things there's there's a

2504
01:30:51,479 --> 01:30:54,419
there's a I mean it's I don't want to

2505
01:30:52,859 --> 01:30:58,259
get too technical because I'm trying to

2506
01:30:54,420 --> 01:31:00,539
keep it General enough that like uh you

2507
01:30:58,260 --> 01:31:01,920
know it it stays fairly popular because

2508
01:31:00,539 --> 01:31:03,420
I don't know how many people are actual

2509
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:05,760
Growers on this thing versus just

2510
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:08,039
smokers or whatever but yeah

2511
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:09,659
um but yeah it's it's it's there's an

2512
01:31:08,039 --> 01:31:10,800
aspect where it's like plants don't

2513
01:31:09,658 --> 01:31:13,738
drink the same

2514
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:14,940
it's really hard to like just automate

2515
01:31:13,738 --> 01:31:17,459
everything

2516
01:31:14,939 --> 01:31:21,119
and there is micro climates even like

2517
01:31:17,460 --> 01:31:22,920
yeah reversing a shitload how how one

2518
01:31:21,119 --> 01:31:24,300
clone to the next clone won't reverse

2519
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:26,219
the same way even if they're two feet

2520
01:31:24,300 --> 01:31:27,840
apart from each other or a foot apart

2521
01:31:26,219 --> 01:31:30,179
from each other getting the same exact

2522
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:32,699
feed microclimates are a real thing too

2523
01:31:30,179 --> 01:31:34,920
so yeah and some of those big rooms the

2524
01:31:32,698 --> 01:31:36,719
micro climates are really different yeah

2525
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:39,239
you know and I mean we haven't even

2526
01:31:36,719 --> 01:31:40,980
talked about Spectrum but yeah that has

2527
01:31:39,238 --> 01:31:42,419
a big roof you're not growing with with

2528
01:31:40,979 --> 01:31:44,218
the sun

2529
01:31:42,420 --> 01:31:45,719
um one of the best lights to this day is

2530
01:31:44,219 --> 01:31:47,658
still the single-ended old school

2531
01:31:45,719 --> 01:31:50,819
horoluxe thousand

2532
01:31:47,658 --> 01:31:52,259
a lot of these grown under double endeds

2533
01:31:50,819 --> 01:31:54,420
and stuff like that like a lot of them

2534
01:31:52,260 --> 01:31:55,619
people are choosing spectrums that give

2535
01:31:54,420 --> 01:31:57,719
the most weight

2536
01:31:55,619 --> 01:31:58,920
yeah and not Blends that give a better

2537
01:31:57,719 --> 01:32:00,420
quality

2538
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:03,658
yeah

2539
01:32:00,420 --> 01:32:05,340
you know uh and because because we're

2540
01:32:03,658 --> 01:32:08,879
not in a position yet it's like such a

2541
01:32:05,340 --> 01:32:10,739
regulated and taxed industry that the

2542
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:14,699
best isn't allowed to Bubble to the top

2543
01:32:10,738 --> 01:32:18,000
yeah it's controlled buy dispensaries by

2544
01:32:14,698 --> 01:32:20,638
dispos by burner by people popularizing

2545
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:22,738
things by celebrities stepping in and

2546
01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:24,300
people throwing their money around and

2547
01:32:22,738 --> 01:32:26,218
so that's why that's why if you're if

2548
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:27,659
you're bummed at how your the weed sucks

2549
01:32:26,219 --> 01:32:28,800
in clubs that's why

2550
01:32:27,658 --> 01:32:30,960
yeah

2551
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:33,179
because consumer Choice has gone way

2552
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:36,239
down since 2 15.

2553
01:32:33,179 --> 01:32:38,819
we are at an hour and a half right now

2554
01:32:36,238 --> 01:32:40,979
dang people always want to be winding it

2555
01:32:38,819 --> 01:32:42,599
down we could start doing the [ __ ] you

2556
01:32:40,979 --> 01:32:44,819
want to take some questions or I could

2557
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:46,800
take some questions I mean I could talk

2558
01:32:44,819 --> 01:32:48,420
to maybe I'll talk for five or ten

2559
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:50,100
minutes even though we're winding it

2560
01:32:48,420 --> 01:32:53,158
down because I haven't uh I haven't

2561
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:54,840
talked about it but aside from nutrition

2562
01:32:53,158 --> 01:32:56,939
and environment which we kind of talked

2563
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:58,619
about a little bit before

2564
01:32:56,939 --> 01:33:00,238
um the spectrum that the plants grow

2565
01:32:58,619 --> 01:33:01,920
under makes a big difference

2566
01:33:00,238 --> 01:33:04,799
yeah and that could probably be its own

2567
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:07,199
whole show but just in general plants

2568
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:09,300
developed underneath the sun which has

2569
01:33:07,198 --> 01:33:14,099
all the Spectrum all the time everything

2570
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:16,679
from UV to you know every color huge

2571
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:18,360
where most indoor lights are

2572
01:33:16,679 --> 01:33:20,760
approximations of that and they have

2573
01:33:18,359 --> 01:33:23,579
relatively narrow spectrums yeah right

2574
01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:25,440
and you put Plants underneath them and

2575
01:33:23,579 --> 01:33:27,000
they grow vastly differently depending

2576
01:33:25,439 --> 01:33:30,059
on what kind of light they're exposed to

2577
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:31,738
yeah we used to 20 years ago when there

2578
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:34,380
wasn't all these other lights we would

2579
01:33:31,738 --> 01:33:36,539
grow one light of metal halide and the

2580
01:33:34,380 --> 01:33:38,340
buds would come out half the size

2581
01:33:36,539 --> 01:33:41,880
but they would burn better and they'd be

2582
01:33:38,340 --> 01:33:43,679
way frostier than the HPS stuff yeah now

2583
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:45,600
you see all this stuff with Ceramics and

2584
01:33:43,679 --> 01:33:47,819
LEDs and this and that and everything

2585
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:50,639
else and it's like

2586
01:33:47,819 --> 01:33:52,380
different plants some plants respond to

2587
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:55,319
like a different different types of

2588
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:57,779
light and do well regardless some plants

2589
01:33:55,319 --> 01:33:59,698
do phenomenal under one type of light

2590
01:33:57,779 --> 01:34:00,779
and then you like you move them and you

2591
01:33:59,698 --> 01:34:02,099
think oh I'm going to put them under

2592
01:34:00,779 --> 01:34:04,800
this and it's going to do great and then

2593
01:34:02,100 --> 01:34:07,079
they hate it yeah because they're not

2594
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:09,360
getting sometimes you'd see people where

2595
01:34:07,079 --> 01:34:12,000
they were growing all these straight

2596
01:34:09,359 --> 01:34:13,738
hps's and then they'd have straight up

2597
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:16,139
old school metal halides like hanging

2598
01:34:13,738 --> 01:34:18,299
from the ceiling yeah you mean the

2599
01:34:16,139 --> 01:34:20,279
vertical ones yeah vertical just just to

2600
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:22,320
give but I just mean I still got scars

2601
01:34:20,279 --> 01:34:24,359
from those [ __ ] but just just to give

2602
01:34:22,319 --> 01:34:26,219
a different Spectrum like not to be the

2603
01:34:24,359 --> 01:34:28,979
majority of it but just the shine some

2604
01:34:26,219 --> 01:34:30,980
blue yeah so the plants had that to use

2605
01:34:28,979 --> 01:34:33,899
and you remember like the Crusty buckets

2606
01:34:30,979 --> 01:34:37,678
yeah that guy's that guy swore if you

2607
01:34:33,899 --> 01:34:39,299
didn't have 25 metal halide light you

2608
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:42,480
couldn't get those kind of huge plants

2609
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:45,300
yeah he swore if you if you had all HPS

2610
01:34:42,479 --> 01:34:47,218
you get you get shittier wheat yeah in

2611
01:34:45,300 --> 01:34:49,679
order to get the size and the frost you

2612
01:34:47,219 --> 01:34:52,079
needed some blue yeah and that's

2613
01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:53,760
partially why the old HPS single endeds

2614
01:34:52,079 --> 01:34:55,260
a lot of people considered them to be

2615
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:57,539
the best all-around light and they were

2616
01:34:55,260 --> 01:34:58,739
the standard because they had 25 percent

2617
01:34:57,539 --> 01:35:00,779
more blue

2618
01:34:58,738 --> 01:35:03,718
yeah you look at their Spectrum versus

2619
01:35:00,779 --> 01:35:06,059
like a double-ended right now that's HPS

2620
01:35:03,719 --> 01:35:09,480
and the HPS is almost all orange and red

2621
01:35:06,060 --> 01:35:11,219
yeah very little UV very little and so I

2622
01:35:09,479 --> 01:35:13,859
have a bunch of plants like my headband

2623
01:35:11,219 --> 01:35:15,239
and my sours and dog and stuff you know

2624
01:35:13,859 --> 01:35:18,238
and you grow them under different lights

2625
01:35:15,238 --> 01:35:21,779
I groove that I grew the dog once under

2626
01:35:18,238 --> 01:35:23,638
pure ceramic yeah I cut it at 85 days

2627
01:35:21,779 --> 01:35:25,979
and it still had white hairs

2628
01:35:23,639 --> 01:35:28,560
yeah and you know what's weird is that I

2629
01:35:25,979 --> 01:35:30,299
agree the dog [ __ ] under that same light

2630
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:31,679
and it finished two weeks earlier than

2631
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:34,440
it normally would

2632
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:36,420
with a different Spectrum yeah with the

2633
01:35:34,439 --> 01:35:38,879
with the CMA normally the dog [ __ ] would

2634
01:35:36,420 --> 01:35:43,020
go 12 or 13 weeks yeah I grew it under

2635
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:45,539
pure 3100 ceramic metal halides it was

2636
01:35:43,020 --> 01:35:47,699
done in 70 days every hair turned fully

2637
01:35:45,539 --> 01:35:49,800
ripened I've got beautiful pics of it

2638
01:35:47,698 --> 01:35:52,619
it's shaved two weeks off but the same

2639
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:54,480
Spectrum made the dog go two weeks

2640
01:35:52,619 --> 01:35:56,819
longer than I've ever taken her yeah

2641
01:35:54,479 --> 01:35:59,039
that's funny I've never taken the dog 85

2642
01:35:56,819 --> 01:36:02,399
days in my life dude yeah

2643
01:35:59,039 --> 01:36:05,158
you know she's she's 65 she's 63 to 70

2644
01:36:02,399 --> 01:36:07,559
and she's pretty done yeah and when I

2645
01:36:05,158 --> 01:36:08,879
finally cut her and I gave up tons of

2646
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:12,480
white hairs all over

2647
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:13,679
yeah so you know maybe like as a as a

2648
01:36:12,479 --> 01:36:16,799
final thing if you're trying to grow

2649
01:36:13,679 --> 01:36:19,079
heads Spectrum plays a big deal food

2650
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:21,600
plays a big deal your style definitely

2651
01:36:19,079 --> 01:36:25,139
helps and like less is more

2652
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:27,659
yeah in a lot of ways like just enough

2653
01:36:25,139 --> 01:36:29,520
and nothing more is a better style than

2654
01:36:27,658 --> 01:36:33,119
like let's give it way too much and pump

2655
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:35,159
it let's supersize it let's get hot you

2656
01:36:33,119 --> 01:36:37,319
know let's run hot

2657
01:36:35,158 --> 01:36:39,000
um you know I don't that's not gonna

2658
01:36:37,319 --> 01:36:40,559
that might give you better weight but I

2659
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:43,979
doubt it'll give you better better wheat

2660
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:46,020
yeah you know and so and that's a lot of

2661
01:36:43,979 --> 01:36:48,658
times like what what it happens is like

2662
01:36:46,020 --> 01:36:50,340
like whether it's drying or curing or

2663
01:36:48,658 --> 01:36:52,859
growing or your nutrition or your

2664
01:36:50,340 --> 01:36:54,420
environment like growing the same

2665
01:36:52,859 --> 01:36:56,460
strains over and over they're your

2666
01:36:54,420 --> 01:36:59,219
favorites and learning why some rips

2667
01:36:56,460 --> 01:37:01,319
they come out amazing yeah and some rips

2668
01:36:59,219 --> 01:37:03,899
you're like eh

2669
01:37:01,319 --> 01:37:08,039
you know yeah because even good Growers

2670
01:37:03,899 --> 01:37:10,079
get they get the ant runs oh yeah

2671
01:37:08,039 --> 01:37:12,300
yeah I mean honestly people people are

2672
01:37:10,079 --> 01:37:15,059
still using [ __ ] other than LEDs I think

2673
01:37:12,300 --> 01:37:16,860
LEDs have come a long way I'm still not

2674
01:37:15,060 --> 01:37:17,940
convinced they're better than a blend of

2675
01:37:16,859 --> 01:37:19,319
other light

2676
01:37:17,939 --> 01:37:22,019
I still never

2677
01:37:19,319 --> 01:37:23,880
tried LED lights so if any LED light

2678
01:37:22,020 --> 01:37:26,460
sponsors want to sponsor I'll give it a

2679
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:28,679
[ __ ] try but I I tend to like CMH

2680
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:30,719
quite a bit do I think that LEDs are

2681
01:37:28,679 --> 01:37:32,579
great for for various aspects of heat

2682
01:37:30,719 --> 01:37:33,899
and do I what do I have I started seeing

2683
01:37:32,579 --> 01:37:36,658
a lot of nice weed under them and did

2684
01:37:33,899 --> 01:37:39,479
they have good applications I do

2685
01:37:36,658 --> 01:37:41,099
but I still think some of the best heads

2686
01:37:39,479 --> 01:37:44,459
you can ever grow are often old school

2687
01:37:41,100 --> 01:37:45,600
hortiluxe single-ended bulb yeah

2688
01:37:44,460 --> 01:37:47,819
you know

2689
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:50,460
a lot of award-winning weed and a lot of

2690
01:37:47,819 --> 01:37:52,799
fire came out of that yeah the whole

2691
01:37:50,460 --> 01:37:56,340
indoor sour era the whole indoor Kush

2692
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:58,619
era the whole indoor uh purple era all

2693
01:37:56,340 --> 01:38:00,539
grown under those bulbs you know I

2694
01:37:58,619 --> 01:38:02,219
always hated [ __ ] horror Deluxe that

2695
01:38:00,539 --> 01:38:04,139
is they had a chick that was running it

2696
01:38:02,219 --> 01:38:07,260
and they were so anti-fucking cannabis

2697
01:38:04,139 --> 01:38:08,699
it was [ __ ] how anti-cannabis that

2698
01:38:07,260 --> 01:38:10,739
company was and how much money they made

2699
01:38:08,698 --> 01:38:12,539
off cannabis Growers yeah I mean it's

2700
01:38:10,738 --> 01:38:15,959
it's well you know there's prohibition

2701
01:38:12,539 --> 01:38:17,519
it's it's it's dangerous there's a like

2702
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:19,500
we could wind it down but I'll tell a

2703
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:21,239
story so I live in Mendo

2704
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:24,000
and one time

2705
01:38:21,238 --> 01:38:26,579
uh I was friends with the uh I was

2706
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:28,920
friends with the produce guy at our

2707
01:38:26,579 --> 01:38:31,019
Safeway and there was one point in

2708
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:33,179
Willits where that Safeway sold more

2709
01:38:31,020 --> 01:38:35,460
organic produce than any Safeway in the

2710
01:38:33,179 --> 01:38:36,840
country yeah because there was so many

2711
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:39,239
[ __ ] of us

2712
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:41,100
right it was just unbelievable so this

2713
01:38:39,238 --> 01:38:44,459
guy he tells me this funny story of this

2714
01:38:41,100 --> 01:38:48,120
guy from Reynolds comes in

2715
01:38:44,460 --> 01:38:51,179
right because this Safe Way was the

2716
01:38:48,119 --> 01:38:53,099
number one selling turkey bag store for

2717
01:38:51,179 --> 01:38:55,440
Reynolds turkey bags in the entire

2718
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:57,539
country we were number one he couldn't

2719
01:38:55,439 --> 01:38:58,638
believe it they came out there to figure

2720
01:38:57,539 --> 01:39:01,859
out

2721
01:38:58,639 --> 01:39:03,420
what the hell is going on why are people

2722
01:39:01,859 --> 01:39:04,859
cooking so many [ __ ] turkeys why are

2723
01:39:03,420 --> 01:39:06,539
people cooking they had no idea they

2724
01:39:04,859 --> 01:39:09,299
were like this Zone

2725
01:39:06,539 --> 01:39:12,060
we have more like can we spread what

2726
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:13,920
we're doing here to other parts because

2727
01:39:12,060 --> 01:39:15,960
our sales are through the [ __ ] roof

2728
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:18,539
you know yeah and when they find out it

2729
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:20,819
was all for weed like the dude's face

2730
01:39:18,539 --> 01:39:23,519
just you know he was just so bummed

2731
01:39:20,819 --> 01:39:26,099
right but it was it was like because

2732
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:28,380
back then you couldn't get like turkey

2733
01:39:26,100 --> 01:39:30,539
bags and 50 or 100 packs like you can

2734
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:33,119
today yeah you would have to go to the

2735
01:39:30,539 --> 01:39:35,039
store and like the turkey turkey they

2736
01:39:33,119 --> 01:39:36,719
came in like two or three packs yeah

2737
01:39:35,039 --> 01:39:39,060
yeah so if you had you know an indoor

2738
01:39:36,719 --> 01:39:41,399
and 20 pound you'd buy 10 bat 10 boxes

2739
01:39:39,060 --> 01:39:43,380
yeah and you're at the store you know

2740
01:39:41,399 --> 01:39:44,879
it's like buying like Lube or something

2741
01:39:43,380 --> 01:39:46,260
like that you're like you want to get

2742
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:48,779
other [ __ ]

2743
01:39:46,260 --> 01:39:49,980
what I never got the turkey bag [ __ ]

2744
01:39:48,779 --> 01:39:51,899
thing because it's not like it really

2745
01:39:49,979 --> 01:39:54,299
kept smells

2746
01:39:51,899 --> 01:39:57,119
like it was the standard it was it was a

2747
01:39:54,300 --> 01:39:59,460
bag to fit a pound you could tie it and

2748
01:39:57,119 --> 01:40:01,679
like the thing is with fluffy weed if

2749
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:03,480
you didn't get the bigger turkey bag you

2750
01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:05,060
could not have enough of a tail to make

2751
01:40:03,479 --> 01:40:08,399
a knot

2752
01:40:05,060 --> 01:40:10,500
yeah off a full pound so like where do

2753
01:40:08,399 --> 01:40:12,479
you get a bag that can fit a pound

2754
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:14,039
yeah that's a good point that's a very

2755
01:40:12,479 --> 01:40:16,138
good point you know and it's like you

2756
01:40:14,039 --> 01:40:18,300
grow kush or something or you know Urkel

2757
01:40:16,139 --> 01:40:20,219
you're gonna get a a tight pound

2758
01:40:18,300 --> 01:40:24,060
yeah right you grow Diesel and it's

2759
01:40:20,219 --> 01:40:26,819
going to be like a a tall pound yeah you

2760
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:29,340
know so there's an aspect to it where

2761
01:40:26,819 --> 01:40:31,979
it's like it just became the standard

2762
01:40:29,340 --> 01:40:33,900
and one days of fighting over [ __ ]

2763
01:40:31,979 --> 01:40:36,059
sizes of bags and weight

2764
01:40:33,899 --> 01:40:38,158
yeah and and so the amount what's crazy

2765
01:40:36,060 --> 01:40:40,320
is that like will the will it Safeway

2766
01:40:38,158 --> 01:40:41,519
learned and they just had I mean they

2767
01:40:40,319 --> 01:40:44,179
would just they would they would just

2768
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:46,440
buy immense amounts of the [ __ ]

2769
01:40:44,179 --> 01:40:48,300
all the time it was like such a huge

2770
01:40:46,439 --> 01:40:50,099
seller for so long because there wasn't

2771
01:40:48,300 --> 01:40:51,539
eventually companies started making

2772
01:40:50,100 --> 01:40:54,420
where you could go to the hydro store

2773
01:40:51,539 --> 01:40:56,340
and you could buy like 25 or 50 or 100

2774
01:40:54,420 --> 01:40:58,020
and it was like something you could

2775
01:40:56,340 --> 01:41:00,480
purchase there and not be so embarrassed

2776
01:40:58,020 --> 01:41:01,860
but yeah you had to back in the day you

2777
01:41:00,479 --> 01:41:04,198
had to just go into the grocery store

2778
01:41:01,859 --> 01:41:07,799
yeah that's where you [ __ ] got it you

2779
01:41:04,198 --> 01:41:09,238
know yep and that's how it fit so

2780
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:11,760
um so yeah I guess we've been on I mean

2781
01:41:09,238 --> 01:41:13,379
we've been I the reason why we wanted to

2782
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:16,020
chat about this is because we thought

2783
01:41:13,380 --> 01:41:17,940
that uh and we could get deeper into it

2784
01:41:16,020 --> 01:41:20,159
so you can always reach out to us on our

2785
01:41:17,939 --> 01:41:22,619
Discord which model plug or you can

2786
01:41:20,158 --> 01:41:24,299
reach out to us on IG or whatever but

2787
01:41:22,619 --> 01:41:26,399
there's a lot of different strategies I

2788
01:41:24,300 --> 01:41:28,260
didn't want to nerd out too hard

2789
01:41:26,399 --> 01:41:30,179
but there's a lot of depth to what kind

2790
01:41:28,260 --> 01:41:33,539
of weed you're trying to grow and what

2791
01:41:30,179 --> 01:41:34,739
your goals are for it right and how you

2792
01:41:33,539 --> 01:41:37,679
want to feed it and how you want to

2793
01:41:34,738 --> 01:41:39,359
treat it and it matters you know and so

2794
01:41:37,679 --> 01:41:40,739
don't just look online at someone you

2795
01:41:39,359 --> 01:41:42,479
think is killing it

2796
01:41:40,738 --> 01:41:43,500
and just feel like oh I figured it all

2797
01:41:42,479 --> 01:41:45,899
out I don't have to ask any more

2798
01:41:43,500 --> 01:41:48,300
questions I'm good I'll just replicate

2799
01:41:45,899 --> 01:41:49,138
this one method that I know all I need

2800
01:41:48,300 --> 01:41:51,060
to know

2801
01:41:49,139 --> 01:41:53,279
yeah because a lot of times there's a

2802
01:41:51,060 --> 01:41:56,760
lot of issues with them

2803
01:41:53,279 --> 01:41:57,599
you know so you know

2804
01:41:56,760 --> 01:41:59,699
