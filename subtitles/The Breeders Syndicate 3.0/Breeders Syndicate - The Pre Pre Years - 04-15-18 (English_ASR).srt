d so yeah I've told you guys about some

21
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:10,118
of my craziness going on with my

22
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,978
landlord and [ __ ] finally have all that

23
00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:14,650
settled everything's gonna be safe taken

24
00:01:11,978 --> 00:01:16,209
care of I'm really stoked like I said I

25
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:18,310
have a bunch of seeded plants those are

26
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:21,309
going out of town like with my father

27
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:23,109
and and the other stuff's gonna go

28
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:25,030
somewhere else the the veg stuff so I'm

29
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:27,430
really stoked that it's amazing to have

30
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:31,090
such good friends that are willing to do

31
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:34,560
stuff like that for me there's a leading

32
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,560
cannabis channels they can suck my dick

33
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:40,780
yeah we're gonna be having Mooney on

34
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:43,379
more often and probably DSG labs and a

35
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:46,030
few others I'd like to have on and just

36
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:48,069
man I think people come to these live

37
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:49,509
feeds because they want they want to

38
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:51,368
learn they want to learn about breeding

39
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:54,700
and they want to learn about cannabis in

40
00:01:51,368 --> 00:01:56,200
general and you know there are channels

41
00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:00,060
like bubble man's that talk about s

42
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:02,700
extracts or hashed Church you know but

43
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,409
yeah I have to move this stuff out but

44
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,670
as far as breeders go I don't think

45
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:09,159
there's anyone teaching breeding I

46
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:12,789
really don't and and considering how

47
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:14,259
many people call themselves breeders you

48
00:02:12,789 --> 00:02:19,060
know Mike does some live feeds that are

49
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:21,039
excellent and and of course there are

50
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,900
breeders who are more shy about being on

51
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:26,530
camera and I understand that because

52
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,959
there are some amazing breeders but he

53
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,830
just got banned from YouTube for 90 days

54
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:35,319
damn that sucks

55
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:39,220
what's up green dragon yeah strain

56
00:02:35,318 --> 00:02:40,659
history tissue culture tech anything

57
00:02:39,219 --> 00:02:42,609
that has to do with breeding or it can

58
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:44,199
help reading I want to I want to I want

59
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:47,230
to be the best source of info for that

60
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:48,878
for everyone and when I bring on guys

61
00:02:47,229 --> 00:02:52,119
like Mooney I'm learning with you guys

62
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:53,620
you know can you really teach breeding

63
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,000
you could teach breeding basics you

64
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:57,009
could teach breeding terminology you

65
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,719
could teach breeding you teach

66
00:02:57,009 --> 00:03:00,149
everything except the hands-on stuff

67
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:03,639
really

68
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:06,400
you can't teach people how to select you

69
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:08,619
can't teach people how to properly test

70
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,240
their lines stuff like that it's really

71
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,099
hard to do you know you have it or you

72
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,510
don't either

73
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:14,310
understand the plant you don't and you

74
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:16,530
cannot teach ethics exactly bittersweet

75
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:18,979
you can't teach breeding ethics I can

76
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:24,539
try but I can't instill that in anyone

77
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:26,609
but I can teach you I can teach you all

78
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:27,179
the basics of breeding words that you

79
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:31,110
should know

80
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:33,780
you know terminology and I can give you

81
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:36,180
advice on where to get more info to

82
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:40,500
learn even further but nothing replaces

83
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:41,670
hands-on approach to breeding and like I

84
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,099
said you know I've been getting a lot of

85
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:45,479
questions from new up-and-coming

86
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,639
breeders people that are new to

87
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:50,039
everything and they want advice lay down

88
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:53,129
marry and they want to they want advice

89
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:54,569
on what they should start doing and I

90
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:56,789
gave the advice you know if you want to

91
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:58,889
see evolution in action quick and you

92
00:03:56,789 --> 00:03:59,549
want to see your trait selections done

93
00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:02,879
fast

94
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:04,500
practice on Auto flowers you know and I

95
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,789
think a lot of people didn't get the

96
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,550
reason why it's just because auto

97
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:12,329
flowers have a quicker germination to

98
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:13,710
flower to finishing flower time than

99
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:18,840
anything else so you can get through

100
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:20,370
several crops very very quickly and you

101
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:25,259
could do it while having your plants in

102
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:27,660
24 hours veg if you want yeah but the

103
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:30,990
other thing is and I and I say this from

104
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:33,300
time to time learn the bass lines learn

105
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:36,920
the bass lines if you want to become a

106
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:39,509
full and complete breeder to be able to

107
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:42,600
recognize those bass lines and other

108
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:44,219
lines recognize those traits learn how

109
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,970
to select those traits if that's the

110
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:49,920
trait you want learn the bass lines that

111
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,540
and bass lines being skunk one be

112
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:56,840
familiar with multiple kinds of Afghan

113
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:59,450
ease haze of course original haze

114
00:04:56,839 --> 00:05:02,009
Northern Lights which can also you know

115
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:04,769
Afghan ease and Northern Lights a pretty

116
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:06,539
pretty similar for all intents and

117
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:09,750
purposes most learn lights that you see

118
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,980
are 2 X 5 that that's the most common or

119
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,399
the lights that you're going to see or 5

120
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:18,200
X 2 I don't remember how it was written

121
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:22,439
and what else skunk haze run likes

122
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:24,620
puh-puh-puh buh-buh-buh Afghani I know

123
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:26,459
I'm forgetting a major one here

124
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:29,220
well what's the major when I'm

125
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:32,459
forgetting anyway learn the baselines

126
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:34,680
that's gonna help you so so much in the

127
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:36,810
future for breeding and and I was lucky

128
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,850
that my mentor taught me that I don't

129
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,110
think many people teach that Northern

130
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:44,210
Lights number six is quite different

131
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:48,420
that's from Tyco trichome technologies

132
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:50,849
what's a mr. Cuban yeah blueberry isn't

133
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,770
necessarily baseline but it's a good one

134
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,900
to learn however I highly recommend not

135
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:57,029
running the new blueberry which is very

136
00:05:54,899 --> 00:06:00,449
very in economic I recommend the old

137
00:05:57,029 --> 00:06:03,269
blueberry sativa lies cush is would be

138
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:07,920
involved with the Afghan ease and lights

139
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:09,719
so that kind of covers that but just

140
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,310
learn those baselines even public push

141
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,130
cuz Bubba push isn't so much different

142
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:16,620
stuff people don't realize that once you

143
00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:19,290
learn those lines even Super Skunk would

144
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:22,530
be one then you will have doggies not a

145
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:24,150
baseline now not even um

146
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:27,149
once you learn those you'll be able to

147
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:28,739
identify everything on that note what's

148
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:30,779
the makeup of right Barry right Barry

149
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,170
was just like every other [ __ ]

150
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:35,579
legendary line it was a bag seed

151
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:37,560
actually was a jar seat if you want to

152
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:44,668
get technical was that came out of jar a

153
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:47,639
jar it was at pnc no no no no no where

154
00:06:44,668 --> 00:06:50,430
was i working was it called it was a bcc

155
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:52,800
beneficial pair collective San Diego I

156
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:54,150
was doing I was growing in the back for

157
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,129
them the blood that they were selling

158
00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:58,889
but they would also buy but bring it in

159
00:06:56,129 --> 00:07:01,110
this dude who he's a well-known older

160
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:02,909
breeder in San Diego and he brought in

161
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,710
some cherry cone Kush which is his

162
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:06,780
strain and it was really good really

163
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:08,370
dang but it didn't smell like cherries

164
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:12,059
at all so I was never sure why I called

165
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:14,759
it that and then he brought in what was

166
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:16,379
labeled as Strawberry Cough and I asked

167
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:17,668
I said what is this because I saw it had

168
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:19,290
seeds in it he said oh that's actually

169
00:07:17,668 --> 00:07:21,000
blueberry and I smelled it and smelled

170
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:22,439
like peanut butter so I was even more

171
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,300
confused but that peanut butter [ __ ] was

172
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:26,879
[ __ ] day so I picked the seeds out of

173
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,680
it brought him home popped him trying to

174
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:31,230
just get fee knows of that that peanut

175
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,769
butter run it see it was life but out

176
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:36,810
came these beautiful gorgeous purple

177
00:07:33,769 --> 00:07:39,299
blueberry syrup plants and that would

178
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:41,730
that was how she was born so it's

179
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,680
supposed to be a blueberry it's probably

180
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:47,280
blueberry P 91 I'm guessing because of

181
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:51,090
the peanut oil traits but yeah that's

182
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:52,619
the genesis of ryut berry that's my baby

183
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:59,009
one of my many babies

184
00:07:52,620 --> 00:08:03,480
oh [ __ ] you give it what a bastard

185
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:05,250
talk about horses [ __ ] genetics

186
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:08,490
of blueberry muffin blueberry muffin is

187
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:11,009
just a phenotype or a cut is the right

188
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:13,889
berry phenotype from right berry OG

189
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:16,740
which was right Barry frost Asst like

190
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:18,569
the original og crossed you Pakistani

191
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:22,530
JIT Rolly the green female green lemon

192
00:08:18,569 --> 00:08:24,449
FINA anyone done a side by side with the

193
00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:26,549
dark heart release of what his they're

194
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:28,649
they're fake blueberry muffins why would

195
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:30,960
they did why would he do that we already

196
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:33,059
know where they're [ __ ] [ __ ] came

197
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:36,088
from and who he did it and it has no

198
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:42,658
relation to mine it's [ __ ] [ __ ]

199
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:48,510
it's a they're a [ __ ] yeah this has no

200
00:08:42,658 --> 00:08:50,159
relation to mine they just took a

201
00:08:48,509 --> 00:08:52,889
well-established name slapped it on

202
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:56,759
their [ __ ] new [ __ ] and are

203
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:58,080
trying to push it as legit I mean there

204
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:04,409
is no comparison because it's so

205
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:07,080
drastically different I didn't know

206
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:09,120
people were calling sunshine daydream

207
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:12,410
the blueberry muffin cut but I don't I

208
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,820
don't think that there's any way that I

209
00:09:12,409 --> 00:09:17,879
it's one of those times when I just have

210
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,320
to realize that I didn't pick an

211
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:21,629
original name by calling it blueberry

212
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,030
muffin because it's just it's something

213
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:25,370
that people want to slap on everything

214
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:30,169
so I just don't give a [ __ ] anymore

215
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:30,169
about the term or any of it

216
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:37,219
I'm not sure where the Humboldt seed PO

217
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:39,560
is from and not to be confused with

218
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:42,649
Humboldt seed organisation Humboldt Seco

219
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:43,639
are the ones naming lines like Jack hare

220
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:46,459
or they have nothing to do with Jack

221
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:48,139
Herer or very little to do with Jack air

222
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:50,030
they took my blueberry muffin cut

223
00:09:48,139 --> 00:09:51,470
slapped it on one of their lines they've

224
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:54,199
done that with a bunch of [ __ ] they're

225
00:09:51,470 --> 00:10:05,000
just uh all-around pieces of [ __ ] and I

226
00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:07,070
don't you know no HSC not hso hso4 fine

227
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:12,049
they've never done anything like that

228
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:13,970
Humboldt seed company are [ __ ] I got

229
00:10:12,049 --> 00:10:19,549
blue baby [ __ ] I do not have blueberry

230
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:24,019
butt holes though I do need to come out

231
00:10:19,549 --> 00:10:28,309
of my shell don't I what do I think

232
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:30,439
about 10k Jack um it depends on which

233
00:10:28,309 --> 00:10:32,989
one you're asking about there's the

234
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:35,480
original 10k Jack from Oregon which was

235
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:37,430
a lemon Jack Herer it was very much a

236
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,930
traditional lemon Jack hair and I mean

237
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:41,209
that's one of the common phenotypes you

238
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:43,849
find in Jack here is the lemon Jack it

239
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:46,240
wasn't massively yielding but it was it

240
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:48,170
was a solid bud you know very very

241
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,899
Norton like dominance in the bud

242
00:10:48,169 --> 00:10:54,019
structure probably closer to stunk in

243
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:57,139
the actual structure of the plant very

244
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:59,269
little haze in it but man it's [ __ ]

245
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:01,399
its stellar weed man it's one of the

246
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:05,539
best lemons I've ever grown there's also

247
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:08,720
10k Jack which was named by Green Dave

248
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:10,159
and it was a a Jack Herer cut that came

249
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,370
from Bodie that was just called Jack

250
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:16,789
Herer he called that 10k and that is

251
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:19,460
closer to say like a Jack the Ripper

252
00:11:16,789 --> 00:11:21,759
Chernobyl looking string and it's very

253
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,759
lime

254
00:11:25,179 --> 00:11:30,279
I don't know Kuban um as long as they

255
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,860
keep your Cuban ass out and I think

256
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:34,120
we're good

257
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,460
the panic pit yeah

258
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,169
who has that I think my buddy kaya has

259
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,129
some panic pift run out and shown on

260
00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:46,299
Instagram

261
00:11:39,129 --> 00:11:49,000
the original kaya see we got death by

262
00:11:46,299 --> 00:11:51,549
lemons I'm not sure the ten came from

263
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,129
Bodhi yeah it's it's it's very similar

264
00:11:51,549 --> 00:11:56,649
to Jack the Ripper in looks but it's

265
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:58,360
purple kind of like Chernobyl and it

266
00:11:56,649 --> 00:12:04,000
looks like the golden ticket cut and who

267
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:05,680
looks - very limey I don't know I don't

268
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,779
know much about buddy's lines anymore

269
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:10,599
just because like we just were good

270
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:12,039
friends but we both kind of keep our

271
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,769
heads down and do our own things you

272
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:18,279
know so I don't I don't memorize all his

273
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:20,019
lines and he has a lot that he puts out

274
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:23,289
so I would just be too hard to keep

275
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:28,210
trapped to be honest yeah I'm sure it's

276
00:12:23,289 --> 00:12:32,529
good I have never seen an orange gelato

277
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:33,730
strain so I don't think all of you a lot

278
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:35,649
of strains are orange because I've never

279
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:37,269
seen that in orange gelato there might

280
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:39,569
be one or two but I don't know about

281
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:39,569
them

282
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,250
ooh

283
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:04,610
Oh things tipping there we go

284
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:06,439
his world of seeds

285
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:11,870
no they're terrible company there

286
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:16,579
there's [ __ ] they the real Seco is very

287
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:19,179
good world of seeds not so good one

288
00:13:16,578 --> 00:13:19,179
second here

289
00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:33,959
why are you puffing at me Mary okay so

290
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:35,580
someone asked the difference I wanted to

291
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,900
make sure that I have a right someone

292
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,460
wanted that asked the difference between

293
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:41,759
strawberry roadkill and roadkill

294
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:44,970
switchblade strawberry roadkill

295
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:46,289
okay so strawberry switchblade don't the

296
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:48,210
main difference between the two is the

297
00:13:46,289 --> 00:13:50,159
strawberry switchblade incorporates the

298
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:52,110
double black doja as well in it which

299
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:56,519
has a lot of like reddish purple traits

300
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:58,909
or magenta even and strawberry

301
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:03,269
switchblade is extreme extreme

302
00:13:58,909 --> 00:14:07,110
strawberry extreme whereas the

303
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:09,240
strawberry cream Afghani is it's still

304
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:12,509
very strawberry but it's more focused on

305
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,310
yield and resin production whereas that

306
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:16,950
the roadkill

307
00:14:13,309 --> 00:14:19,919
switchblade is is a little bit less

308
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:21,180
yield but way more strawberry it's hard

309
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:23,669
to explain because they're both very

310
00:14:21,179 --> 00:14:26,459
strawberry yeah

311
00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:30,439
the the switchblade will always have the

312
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:30,440
double black Doge incorporated into it

313
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:35,850
motor growth 15 you're asking me for

314
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:37,860
something way later more recently made

315
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:43,230
and I don't know about it don't haven't

316
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:46,200
used it don't care again I don't know

317
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:47,820
much about bodis Lyons guys that have

318
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,500
come out within the past few years I

319
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,060
wish I could answer it but I just

320
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,600
there's so many that come out I don't

321
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:56,699
it's impossible to keep track of it I

322
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,930
have my own company that I run and make

323
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,390
seeds with that I have a hard enough

324
00:14:57,929 --> 00:15:07,379
time keeping track of myself you know

325
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:11,039
what I mean real lemon tree railroad

326
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:13,740
lemon tree is lemon diesel oh is that

327
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:18,929
right yeah Oregon lemon diesel it's just

328
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:21,240
the same cut renamed sfe OG and candy

329
00:15:18,929 --> 00:15:24,839
been done a long time ago by cat and

330
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:28,560
[ __ ] so who gives a [ __ ] someone already

331
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:29,820
did it probably did it better who made

332
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:31,109
it is that Jimmy nits

333
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,550
I shouldn't be mean like that because I

334
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:33,870
mean the guy the guy's been around a

335
00:15:32,549 --> 00:15:35,609
while and I'm sure it's great it's just

336
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:37,409
it's been done before and I don't know

337
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:39,600
why people just picked up on it now

338
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:42,929
that whole height thing you know if

339
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,490
people were knowledgeable they'd be like

340
00:15:42,929 --> 00:15:46,888
oh that's already been done and I could

341
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:49,289
have already had it 90 times over

342
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:50,730
captain kripp released those chem d sfe

343
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:52,948
I wish I could remember the name offhand

344
00:15:50,730 --> 00:16:02,399
but I think it was just chem vs Fe it

345
00:15:52,948 --> 00:16:04,169
wasn't a name and I know that it's

346
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,620
probably been done a thousand times

347
00:16:04,169 --> 00:16:09,328
between captain cramp and Jimmy nits say

348
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:14,938
it like that's a common combination the

349
00:16:09,328 --> 00:16:17,909
Kem's and SF ease I would think that it

350
00:16:14,938 --> 00:16:22,860
would be very similar to chem 91 you

351
00:16:17,909 --> 00:16:24,688
know I've never heard of Pittsburg cat

352
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,699
piss but the San Diego cat piss I'm

353
00:16:24,688 --> 00:16:29,370
familiar with but I think that's just

354
00:16:26,698 --> 00:16:32,429
one of those terms kind of like skunk or

355
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:34,528
whatever that people use like if a old

356
00:16:32,429 --> 00:16:36,958
plant back in the day smelled like cat

357
00:16:34,528 --> 00:16:38,850
piss they would call it cat piss so

358
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:41,599
there's a lot of regional campuses I'm

359
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:43,649
not familiar with the Pittsburgh one

360
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,050
storing seeds for long term preservation

361
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:47,730
if you are gonna store seeds and not

362
00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:49,349
touch them for and you know you're not

363
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:51,750
gonna touch them for say 10 to 15 years

364
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,920
or your own - you're gonna storm and

365
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,929
you're gonna take them out the second

366
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:56,969
you want to pop them freezers okay for

367
00:16:54,929 --> 00:16:59,578
that but you don't want to come in and

368
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:00,689
out doing that [ __ ] you know you don't

369
00:16:59,578 --> 00:17:03,508
want to take it in and out of the

370
00:17:00,688 --> 00:17:05,568
freezer that's not good for it

371
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:08,730
long-term storage fridge work great or

372
00:17:05,568 --> 00:17:12,918
anywhere that is a cool dark dry

373
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:15,779
environment will work realistically

374
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:21,959
there's my water married you stole my

375
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:24,359

377
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,899
water buffer

378
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:32,380
mmm I guess I don't have one okay come

379

382
00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:46,960
jump up and get him so now he's being a

383
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:48,580
dick the cut called push for that Bodhi

384
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,808
uses sorry for another bell I don't mind

385
00:17:48,579 --> 00:17:51,819
Bodhi questions I just don't know a lot

386
00:17:49,808 --> 00:17:53,740
about his strains but the cush 4 is an

387
00:17:51,819 --> 00:17:55,359
old Nevel strain if I remember correctly

388
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,700
and I do believe he got it from Jim

389
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:59,109
Ortega other than that I don't there's

390
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:02,860
not a lot of info about push for out

391
00:17:59,109 --> 00:18:04,569
there yeah that was an old Jim Ortega

392
00:18:02,859 --> 00:18:07,658
line if I remember correctly

393
00:18:04,569 --> 00:18:11,470
Jim Ortega I met on mr. nice when he was

394
00:18:07,659 --> 00:18:14,200
using the name dogmas nice guy but yeah

395
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:16,480
I don't I it's not one that I'm really

396
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:19,090
it's not one that pops up often it's a

397
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:25,179
very rare rare rare cut however it's

398
00:18:19,089 --> 00:18:26,798
said to be it's said to be the basis of

399
00:18:25,179 --> 00:18:30,090
a lot of push lines which I'm not sure

400
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:30,089
how true that is

401
00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:50,528
there's also some lines that I'm gonna

402
00:18:46,898 --> 00:18:52,538
get to look at from the scientist which

403
00:18:50,528 --> 00:18:55,749
is really cool that's someone I know has

404
00:18:52,538 --> 00:18:58,239
finally gotten those packs very rare old

405
00:18:55,749 --> 00:19:01,058
[ __ ] and I'm curious to see what's going

406
00:18:58,239 --> 00:19:02,379
to be in there I don't think a lot of

407
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:04,178
people know that term but I'll just

408
00:19:02,378 --> 00:19:06,148
leave it at that for right now and I'll

409
00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:09,009
bring it up later when I have more info

410
00:19:06,148 --> 00:19:10,569
first ever cross is there any specific

411
00:19:09,009 --> 00:19:12,308
minerals renewed sighs should push more

412
00:19:10,569 --> 00:19:13,898
to help with seed production if you're

413
00:19:12,308 --> 00:19:16,178
feeding your plant for seeds feed it

414
00:19:13,898 --> 00:19:19,408
like a tomato beetle lots of nitrogen

415
00:19:16,179 --> 00:19:19,409
your veg that helps them

416
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:27,609
what about 4d I have no idea where does

417
00:19:24,638 --> 00:19:29,589
the name Oh G originated from I just

418
00:19:27,608 --> 00:19:31,058
think it means like original I think

419
00:19:29,589 --> 00:19:32,829
that's really what it means like og

420
00:19:31,058 --> 00:19:35,950
could this is the old cush og cush

421
00:19:32,829 --> 00:19:37,658
that's typical it's not over grow it's

422
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:43,269
not ocean grown any of that [ __ ] there's

423
00:19:37,659 --> 00:19:51,070
just though the original og perhaps

424
00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:52,839
perhaps perhaps perhaps what's the white

425
00:19:51,069 --> 00:19:55,950
in white Tonto cookies I think it's just

426
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:55,949
white Tahoe the white

427
00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:11,619
what is oh gee 18 that's a DNA strain I

428
00:20:09,298 --> 00:20:13,898
you know I think it was from bears

429
00:20:11,618 --> 00:20:15,908
selection karma said they knew more

430
00:20:13,898 --> 00:20:18,908
about that than I do but again I don't

431
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:20,860
pay attention to [ __ ] lame ass [ __ ]

432
00:20:18,909 --> 00:20:22,269
ass companies and I mean [ __ ] ass in

433
00:20:20,859 --> 00:20:24,368
the nicest way that has nothing to do

434
00:20:22,269 --> 00:20:26,349
with homosexuality one of those [ __ ]

435
00:20:24,368 --> 00:20:29,829
that have used that word to refer to dip

436
00:20:26,349 --> 00:20:31,269
shits DNA is that they're pieces of [ __ ]

437
00:20:29,829 --> 00:20:35,259
they've always been pieces of [ __ ] they

438
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:36,788
bait and switch their lines and that all

439
00:20:35,259 --> 00:20:37,778
that info is out there and if people are

440
00:20:36,788 --> 00:20:41,019
still buying that [ __ ]

441
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:42,599
it's on them to [ __ ] suck it up and

442
00:20:41,019 --> 00:20:46,859
realize they just bought a load of [ __ ]

443
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:46,859
that isn't what they say it's gonna be

444
00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:55,629
overgrow cush that's right I had crybaby

445
00:20:51,069 --> 00:20:57,819
watched the I had crybaby watch the

446
00:20:55,628 --> 00:21:00,368
video of Steve Tuck talking about how he

447
00:20:57,819 --> 00:21:01,749
helped create oh gee cush what do you

448
00:21:00,368 --> 00:21:03,009
think about the white I see a lot of

449
00:21:01,749 --> 00:21:05,319
breeders using it but I hate it

450
00:21:03,009 --> 00:21:07,960
personally as a flower okay um the white

451
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:11,319
is an excellent breeder however it does

452
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:13,480
take a few crop of bat crossings to

453
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:17,349
whatever you cross the white to in order

454
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:19,599
to get rid of that that mushroom eat

455
00:21:17,349 --> 00:21:21,788
earthy taste and and that's not ideal

456
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:24,638
what's ideal from the white is its resin

457
00:21:21,788 --> 00:21:28,329
production it's a it's solid it's solid

458
00:21:24,638 --> 00:21:30,428
structure it's uh it's a great plant as

459
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:33,398
far as that goes but I don't like the

460
00:21:30,429 --> 00:21:34,929
taste smell or high from the white but

461
00:21:33,398 --> 00:21:37,388
breeding wise it's an excellent breeder

462
00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:39,399
and like like that this goes with all

463
00:21:37,388 --> 00:21:41,079
things there are plants that are

464
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:43,719
excellent growers and terrible breeders

465
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:47,439
rogue blue floors one it's not

466
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:49,509
predictable you're gonna see a lot of

467
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:53,788
boo Fifi nose pop out when you cross

468
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:58,690
Gorilla Glue for to anything however

469
00:21:53,788 --> 00:22:02,710
with with certain lines they breed

470
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:07,230
better than bro and the white would be

471
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:07,230
one what's up Mooney

472
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:14,259
that's right they'll do it Friday

473
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:16,599
and we have someone recording these now

474
00:22:14,259 --> 00:22:22,779
so we're gonna have it up on YouTube

475
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:23,949
finally yeah you know people don't

476
00:22:22,779 --> 00:22:26,410
realize that when they're buying ice

477
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:28,720
ones they're not they're not buying

478
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:30,790
direct copies of the clone mother that's

479
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,180
not how it works unless the plum mother

480
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:36,549
was picked from a line that was made

481
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:39,370
very very very very stable in uniform

482
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:41,829
you know so like a deep chunk s-1 what

483
00:22:39,369 --> 00:22:43,989
resemble its mother very well whereas a

484
00:22:41,829 --> 00:22:45,779
guerrilla glue for s1 you're lucky if

485
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:49,299
you ever see that same phenotype again

486
00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:51,730
um Jack Herer I like some Jack Harris

487
00:22:49,299 --> 00:22:54,069
but Jack Herer has thousands of

488
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:56,259
phenotypes so and I definitely don't

489
00:22:54,069 --> 00:22:58,029
like all of them so it's it's kind of a

490
00:22:56,259 --> 00:23:03,369
bowl a broad statement to cover by

491
00:22:58,029 --> 00:23:07,660
saying yes I like Jack Herer people

492
00:23:03,369 --> 00:23:10,750
think that p90 1s ones they all kind of

493
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:14,050
revolve around that mom but the the it's

494
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:16,420
it's weird different you'll see less

495
00:23:14,049 --> 00:23:19,240
peanut oil sometimes more skunky more

496
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:23,170
skunky less peanut oil but they all tend

497
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:25,599
to kind of scale around that mom any

498
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:27,730
thoughts on the cube or Starfighter I

499
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:31,359
don't know about the cube as far as like

500
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:33,549
I never I've never grown it Starfighter

501
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:34,899
same thing never grew it but when those

502
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:36,519
seeds were originally sold you could

503
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,380
still buy the [ __ ] parents and seed

504
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:39,549
so I didn't understand why people are

505
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,260
paying a bunch of money for something

506
00:23:39,549 --> 00:23:44,319
that you could buy the parents of the

507
00:23:41,259 --> 00:23:46,960
seed stock for from and it was just an

508
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:48,909
f1 hybrid so you would see the same

509
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,380
exact results pretty much it would just

510
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:53,560
be a wide-open

511
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:55,030
shotgun result you know and that's what

512
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:58,779
you would seem a Starfighter anyways I

513
00:23:55,029 --> 00:24:02,410
know mike has found a good Starfighter

514
00:23:58,779 --> 00:24:06,180
and they use that and but a lot of those

515
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:08,140
star fighters were not very good so yeah

516
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:09,640
yeah I noticed Dan Kannamma has been

517
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:11,140
pushing those blues this one blues

518
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,660
pretty hard they look they look cool the

519
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:16,240
ones that he's had with right very how

520
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:20,290
long did the broadleaf Phoenix continue

521
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,630
in the f generation a 5 is when we

522
00:24:20,289 --> 00:24:26,430
started seeing more of the city

523
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:28,530
kick in to be true breeding subject I'm

524
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:34,049
not hungry right now I'm doing the thing

525
00:24:28,529 --> 00:24:38,849
for the Nike I'm doing that live feed

526
00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:43,289
right now what yeah you were driving so

527
00:24:38,849 --> 00:24:52,980
I don't need it right now I don't have

528
00:24:43,289 --> 00:24:55,440
space for it you haven't been good

529
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:58,730
Murray you know you're just doing his

530
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:07,080
own thing actually just isn't listening

531
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:09,470
cuz they're driving hey do smeels del

532
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:12,539
Taco

533
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:13,650
yeah once once moody's in LA once he's

534
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:15,149
living down there we're gonna we're

535
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:17,790
gonna have the full-time podcast it's

536
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:19,050
finally starting I know people have been

537
00:25:17,789 --> 00:25:23,220
asking for it for a long time

538
00:25:19,049 --> 00:25:25,430
but you know how long do I take skunk

539
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:29,009
spray chem it depends on the phenotype

540
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:31,320
just like everything else different

541
00:25:29,009 --> 00:25:33,299
females go different lengths and I take

542
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:35,490
it as long as it needs to go I don't do

543
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:37,500
the whole week counting thing I just run

544
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:39,150
plants until they're finished I've never

545
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,279
understood that I mean I guess it's good

546
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:44,970
to try to have things planned out but as

547
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:46,379
you learn how seedlings go you should

548
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:47,940
know that there are several different

549
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:51,090
phenotypes and just giving you a number

550
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:55,009
would be again a shotgun effect of just

551
00:25:51,089 --> 00:25:55,009
trying to guess at what you're gonna get

552
00:25:56,569 --> 00:26:02,250
yeah that makes real filly real filly

553
00:25:59,549 --> 00:26:07,649
that makes sense what's up Joey how you

554
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:09,150
doing brother did you did you see Gold

555
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:12,470
Coast pee pee his pants did you make him

556
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:12,470
pee pee his pants I hope you did

557
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:22,490
it's hard not to think of ethos when

558
00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:22,490
people think of s1 glue

559
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:43,269
look that guy koukin bucum guys a [ __ ]

560
00:26:39,869 --> 00:26:46,589
bi itch

561
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:48,910
what a question you guys got that aren't

562
00:26:46,589 --> 00:26:51,129
specifically about Bodhi seed lines and

563
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:53,440
I have no idea about anymore cuz he's a

564
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:55,270
you know like I said and it's not any

565
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,000
disrespect to Bodhi but he's my boy I

566
00:26:55,269 --> 00:26:59,769
love him I love him to the end of the

567
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,710
moon and back but I just it's hard to

568
00:26:59,769 --> 00:27:10,089
keep track of my own lines let alone his

569
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:11,529
you know yeah you know apprenticea with

570
00:27:10,089 --> 00:27:13,449
a good breeder is gonna be a hard thing

571
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:16,839
to do because a lot of the good breeders

572
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:18,519
are older guys and paranoid of people

573
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:20,169
and we've all been [ __ ] over a lot by

574
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:24,369
a lot of people especially people that

575
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:26,680
we've helped our apprenticed yeah dying

576
00:27:24,369 --> 00:27:32,759
breeds II keep I can talk about z-cube I

577
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:36,100
actually can talk about Z cube z cube is

578
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:39,519
okay so the Z cubes I have grown in seen

579
00:27:36,099 --> 00:27:43,480
are very tall plants very lanky very

580
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:45,460
leggy plants into the moon and if stars

581
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:49,769
but you're further I love you further

582
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:53,650
friend it's actually further than that

583
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:55,299
it's very leggy it has hard dense buds

584
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:58,480
but they stay about golf ball-sized

585
00:27:55,299 --> 00:28:00,759
berry for very [ __ ] resinous however

586
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,339
the skittles trait with the the sweet

587
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:07,690
skittle smell it's I haven't found it in

588
00:28:03,339 --> 00:28:09,009
any busy cubes I ran so I'm not sure if

589
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:11,740
that was their intention with the line

590
00:28:09,009 --> 00:28:15,400
but I'm thinking with this get those

591
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:17,019
lines it's something that they wanted

592
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,880
and didn't get but it is very uniform

593
00:28:17,019 --> 00:28:23,559
even for an f1 they were all pretty

594
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:25,270
uniform and as was their black rose' no

595
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:27,700
not doing anymore sour grapes grape

596
00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:31,720
stomper I did that nine years ago

597
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:33,940
released it and to not much fanfare and

598
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,509
then later on gauge during released the

599
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,730
bx1

600
00:28:34,509 --> 00:28:41,440
and then claimed he created it because

601
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:43,240
you know and people bought it ate it up

602
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,538
and still repeat the gauge green made

603
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:49,288
grapes doctor to this day

604
00:28:45,538 --> 00:29:00,099
that was made by our buddy Jojo Rizzo

605
00:28:49,288 --> 00:29:03,730
it's a black beard bring Jim in but with

606
00:29:00,099 --> 00:29:05,500
all that said about Zeke you I can say

607
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:08,230
it's [ __ ] good it's a good line it's

608
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:10,089
very good line it's worth growing I've

609
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:14,308
been very surprised with the dying breed

610
00:29:10,089 --> 00:29:17,379
stuff usually when a company pops up I

611
00:29:14,308 --> 00:29:19,359
don't I don't buy the hype automatically

612
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:22,299
like a lot of people are like oh what's

613
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:24,869
up zip zip zap zow you know like with

614
00:29:22,298 --> 00:29:27,429
all disease and just all about it and I

615
00:29:24,869 --> 00:29:28,689
hung back and I said you know I'm gonna

616
00:29:27,429 --> 00:29:31,269
wait until I grow some of this [ __ ]

617
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:33,429
before I uh Chi does not have the panic

618
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:35,829
piff picks what does he have up he has

619
00:29:33,429 --> 00:29:38,500
panicked something it might just be 7 1

620
00:29:35,829 --> 00:29:40,689
Oh panic then I'm not sure if he has the

621
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:46,659
panic pit 4 7 1 Oh panic it's been a

622
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:51,730
while but yeah III I had to grow up for

623
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:54,100
myself and yeah man I'm impressed

624
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:57,329
the black rose' is probably the most

625
00:29:54,099 --> 00:30:00,069
impressive thing that they have done

626
00:29:57,329 --> 00:30:00,730
dragon fruit I have popped I haven't run

627
00:30:00,069 --> 00:30:02,138
yet though

628
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:05,860
we'll see I'll give you I'll give you a

629
00:30:02,138 --> 00:30:09,038
report on that later but the z-cube in

630
00:30:05,859 --> 00:30:11,918
black rose' and watermelon skittles is

631
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:13,990
okay it's not bad it's it's as good as

632
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:17,320
anything you could get from from most

633
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:20,409
common places but I think the black

634
00:30:17,319 --> 00:30:22,750
rose' is special I think that one is the

635
00:30:20,409 --> 00:30:24,580
special one as is their gas pedal to

636
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:26,710
their gas pedals [ __ ] amazing the

637
00:30:24,579 --> 00:30:28,359
chem defy herbology that was one of the

638
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:29,740
most beautiful lines I've ever seen I

639
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:31,959
got a female from that it was just

640
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:35,769
[ __ ] gorgeous absolutely [ __ ]

641
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:37,450
gorgeous so again I'm not working them

642
00:30:35,769 --> 00:30:39,308
into lines or anything I just wanted to

643
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:41,470
see what was up with it

644
00:30:39,308 --> 00:30:44,109
the watermelons giggles in it didn't get

645
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:47,139
watermelon from it at all at all from

646
00:30:44,109 --> 00:30:49,538
anything that I grew from it it was

647
00:30:47,138 --> 00:30:51,250
slightly sweet like Dutch sweet so I

648
00:30:49,538 --> 00:30:54,638
think there was some Dutch sweetness in

649
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:56,888
it I don't know I don't know what she'll

650
00:30:54,638 --> 00:30:57,849
be is but I know the sham D and that was

651
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:59,558
just a term

652
00:30:57,849 --> 00:31:03,189
we used to refer to anything that was

653
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:10,240
Paul Kennedy that wasn't oh Sh I'll OD

654
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:12,009
no I don't know he had gas pedals the

655
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,440
[ __ ] I'm not in a lie

656
00:31:12,009 --> 00:31:18,490
to have black rose' gas pedals he cubes

657
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:22,870
very good but black rose' and gas pedal

658
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:25,089
were phenomenal be [ __ ] nominal I

659
00:31:22,869 --> 00:31:30,219
don't know who did the fireball oh gee

660
00:31:25,089 --> 00:31:31,808
I'm not sure whose that is but one thing

661
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:34,630
I will say with black rose' is that I

662
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:37,928
didn't see a single purple Fino in any

663
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:40,150
of it and they're all super uniform it's

664
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:42,280
just one of those lines and sometimes in

665
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:46,080
f1 you'll see it a lot where it's a -

666
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:49,509
poly hybrids crossed and you'll get a

667
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:53,259
very uniform line but and then f2 it

668
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:54,640
turns into craziness lemon Versace I've

669
00:31:53,259 --> 00:31:58,990
seen pictures of that and I didn't

670
00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:03,100
didn't appeal to me it's not black rose

671
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:05,079
it's black rose a black rose is a

672
00:32:03,099 --> 00:32:07,959
different line and I've seen stuff

673
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:10,538
called California black rose' but this

674
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:12,250
seed pack was just said black rose' so

675
00:32:10,538 --> 00:32:13,960
you know with them I'm not sure if it's

676
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:15,849
California black rose' and black rose'

677
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,288
is just a shortened term or if black

678
00:32:15,849 --> 00:32:20,649
rose' was something different

679
00:32:17,288 --> 00:32:23,379
and then there's also rose a so yeah

680
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:25,990
there's there's rose a is different than

681
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:28,030
California black rose' and I'm not sure

682
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:32,440
if California black rose' and black

683
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:34,960
rose' are the same thing yeah see I

684
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:37,298
Minds just says black rose' on it and it

685
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,730
was in one of the that's like a

686
00:32:37,298 --> 00:32:43,569
cardboard cylinder thing and just as

687
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:44,829
black rose' on it yeah I don't know if

688
00:32:43,569 --> 00:32:46,990
it's California black rose' or black

689
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:48,730
rose' I've seen green Dave's Grove

690
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:51,038
California black rose' and his was like

691
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:52,419
deep purple and beautiful none of these

692
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:55,329
were remote they didn't look anything

693
00:32:52,419 --> 00:32:57,429
like that not even close not even close

694
00:32:55,329 --> 00:32:58,839
to what Dave's looked like so I'm

695
00:32:57,429 --> 00:33:01,470
assuming it's a different line but I

696
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:01,470
don't know for sure

697
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:08,929
no black rose is not a black rose cross

698
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,980
Rose a I'm 99% sure

699
00:33:08,929 --> 00:33:13,548
and they're probably to tell me I'm

700
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:16,849
wrong but I'm 99% sure about this it

701
00:33:13,548 --> 00:33:19,759
does not increase science yeah it's

702
00:33:16,849 --> 00:33:24,859
Russian cush Oz cush in the old Mendo

703

733
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:11,630
[ __ ] [ __ ] Bruce everybody go

734
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:13,809
YouTube [ __ ] Bruce best rapper on

735
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:13,809
earth

736
00:35:15,528 --> 00:35:21,748
um let's see I already did the right

737
00:35:20,338 --> 00:35:24,978
berry story you missed it before he came

738
00:35:21,748 --> 00:35:24,978
in you missed it

739
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:28,829
San Diego Green crack now that I know

740
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:30,690
it's different from cush well there's

741
00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:31,979
any other green crack we've always kind

742
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:34,349
of thought it was the same thing and

743
00:35:31,978 --> 00:35:37,078
that's and it always kind of made me

744
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:42,869
wonder why the cush was called a cush

745
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:44,519
but Danny of Green crack is either drove

746
00:35:42,869 --> 00:35:47,479
on a papaya crossed to something else

747
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:51,409
but it lines up closer with so mango and

748
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:56,939
probably so mangoes Super Skunk or

749
00:35:51,409 --> 00:35:59,460
papaya Super Skunk um I don't know much

750
00:35:56,940 --> 00:36:09,239
about NorCal campus I only know San

751
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:10,920
Diego campus yeah it's hard to say dank

752
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:12,960
man I'm not sure what that could

753
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:15,568
possibly be you need a lot more than

754
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:19,228
that to look at it and kind of get an

755
00:36:15,568 --> 00:36:20,548
idea and with so many new companies just

756
00:36:19,228 --> 00:36:22,199
Paul and Chuck and 90 lines together

757
00:36:20,548 --> 00:36:25,518
it's really getting harder to do that

758
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:28,108
that identification just from either a

759
00:36:25,518 --> 00:36:30,358
description or from just looking at it

760
00:36:28,108 --> 00:36:32,670
it's easy it's easier to break it down

761
00:36:30,358 --> 00:36:34,528
to base lines but I couldn't tell you

762
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:37,400
exactly what it is I can tell you base

763
00:36:34,528 --> 00:36:37,400
lines usually though

764
00:36:40,659 --> 00:36:46,629
great banana dank um do you remember

765
00:36:44,349 --> 00:36:48,579
what's in that that was I didn't sell

766
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:52,930
much of that line I'm pretty sure it was

767
00:36:48,579 --> 00:36:56,079
like the shock something or I can't

768
00:36:52,929 --> 00:36:57,699
remember off the top of my head yeah you

769
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,610
can try to yeah you could DME a picture

770
00:36:57,699 --> 00:37:09,659
of it but there's no there's no

771
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:12,970
guarantee hey it's you you [ __ ]

772
00:37:09,659 --> 00:37:15,009
the the lightest of the lime is going to

773
00:37:12,969 --> 00:37:16,659
be the lime light

774
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:19,450
I think that carries the heaviest lime

775
00:37:16,659 --> 00:37:23,199
traits of any of my lines I'm not

776
00:37:19,449 --> 00:37:24,759
currently selling sprite or limes I

777
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:27,039
guess it's called slider because I mr.

778
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:28,180
Beldon instead of spider I misspelled it

779
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:29,320
when I was printing out the tabs and I

780
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:30,789
just got lazy and I was like all right

781
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:33,220

00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:08,340
run is there's only one real cut of

807
00:39:04,139 --> 00:39:11,449
great pie hairy palms got one seed of it

808
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:14,100
and that one seed that he popped was the

809
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:18,629
it was a great pie it was really really

810
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:21,569
lucky it was amazing yeah well once you

811
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:25,410
start seeing amber trichomes Denali that

812
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:28,260
means that degradation from THC to CBN

813
00:39:25,409 --> 00:39:31,349
has started to occur so you want it when

814
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:34,320
it's most cloudy least amber that's what

815
00:39:31,349 --> 00:39:35,519
you want to go for and if that's where

816
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,730
you like the smoke to be some people

817
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:40,320
like CBN heavy smoke though that is

818
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:43,619
indeed the one I used to make black

819
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:49,519
banana pie not black pie but I hear my

820
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:51,630
black Y is equally as amazing yeah I

821
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:53,869
don't really have a black pie that was a

822
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:53,869
joke

823
00:39:54,739 --> 00:40:00,179
yeah there there's a bunch of crosses I

824
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:02,280
wanted to do with my um my my chocolate

825
00:40:00,179 --> 00:40:06,480
time ale but I didn't because it won't

826
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:09,540
sell however I'm working on a few places

827
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:12,389
for that to go I'm gonna give it to

828
00:40:09,539 --> 00:40:13,670
Cuban to work some lines and it's going

829
00:40:12,389 --> 00:40:15,920
to go to another location

830
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:20,180
where I can work some lines with it

831
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:22,849
finally you feel less cloudy trichomes

832
00:40:20,179 --> 00:40:24,618
on horace given more sativa hybrid high

833
00:40:22,849 --> 00:40:26,210
i think it just gives you a different

834
00:40:24,619 --> 00:40:27,950
high but i don't think that there's any

835
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:32,980
high associated with sativa or indica

836
00:40:27,949 --> 00:40:35,538
that is accurate it's a very it's bad

837
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:37,639
you can't associate a specific guy with

838
00:40:35,539 --> 00:40:40,160
indica or a specific I was sativa

839
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:42,048
there's no way that doesn't doesn't play

840
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:44,719
out that way unfortunately but that's

841
00:40:42,048 --> 00:40:47,000
how most people do refer to it but

842
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:49,159
that's they if you have any knowledge

843
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,568
and have grown out a lot of different

844
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:51,739
lines that you would cause it to even a

845
00:40:50,568 --> 00:40:53,358
lot of different lines you would call

846
00:40:51,739 --> 00:40:55,759
indica and a lot of different lines

847
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:57,230
you'd call hybrid you'd find sativas

848
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,450
that have what you would call an indica

849
00:40:57,230 --> 00:41:01,190
high you'd find indicas to have what

850
00:40:59,449 --> 00:41:05,538
you'd call hybrid high so it's really

851
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:07,929
hard to say on that give it a little

852
00:41:05,539 --> 00:41:07,930
miracle

853
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:20,750
yeah it is an old wives tale that's for

854
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:22,369
sure it's gonna stick around till time

855
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:24,980
immemorial though because collective's

856
00:41:22,369 --> 00:41:27,170
one people who own and run collectives

857
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:29,059
for the most part are uneducated and

858
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:31,579
they will always call [ __ ] indica sativa

859
00:41:29,059 --> 00:41:33,049
or hybrid and they'll be the first ones

860
00:41:31,579 --> 00:41:34,730
to [ __ ] act like used-car salesmen

861
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:37,340
and tell you exactly how that lines

862
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:39,079
gonna affect you and that is [ __ ]

863
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,590
[ __ ] and double should I've ever

864
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:41,869
heard

865
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:43,610
everybody has a different body chemistry

866
00:41:41,869 --> 00:41:45,920
everybody's receptors interact

867
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:48,760
differently with different strains so

868
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:51,710
it's just it's stupid it's stupid it's

869
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:53,320
it's reckless to in many senses it's

870
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:55,579
reckless because a lot of people have

871
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:58,490
you know medical conditions that they

872
00:41:55,579 --> 00:42:00,440
require cannabis to alleviate the pains

873
00:41:58,489 --> 00:42:02,509
of or whatever you know the symptoms of

874
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:04,519
and these people are recklessly telling

875
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:07,970
them that this will do that and that is

876
00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:09,259
that's reckless ok let see what else got

877
00:42:07,969 --> 00:42:11,029
whatever that weird mutation

878
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:12,650
malformation on the monkey haze someone

879
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:14,540
said it was a trait seen in the opt I'm

880
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:17,660
not sure what you're referring to

881
00:42:14,539 --> 00:42:18,949
is it the crinkle leaf which I mean the

882
00:42:17,659 --> 00:42:22,399
crinkly if you can find a deep chunk

883
00:42:18,949 --> 00:42:25,039
anywhere but I don't know or you're

884
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,660
referring to sure you can tell more on

885
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:31,400
the leaf structure whether it's an it

886
00:42:26,659 --> 00:42:34,159
occurs to you but no the the term indica

887
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:36,889
and sativa is kind of out the window

888
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:39,349
monkey haze if I remember was the black

889
00:42:36,889 --> 00:42:41,599
deep chunk Fino cross to tom hills haze

890
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:43,610
and Tom Hill he made this way later

891
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:45,860
right right before he stopped making

892
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:48,980
seeds or not stop making seeds but

893
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:50,510
before I don't know I don't even know if

894
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:52,099
he make seeds anymore but that was it

895
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:55,130
was way later when he made that I

896
00:42:52,099 --> 00:42:56,719
remember you had already you chunk had

897
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:59,890
already stopped being on the market by

898
00:42:56,719 --> 00:42:59,889
the time monkey Hayes came out

899
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:13,060
yeah I don't know how many times I could

900
00:43:09,099 --> 00:43:14,889
say different different but the terms

901
00:43:13,059 --> 00:43:17,920
indica and sativa really don't have a

902
00:43:14,889 --> 00:43:20,250
place in this market or in cannabis

903
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:23,530
anymore specifically referring to

904
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:27,099
effects or structure or type because I

905
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:29,200
can absolutely show you a [ __ ] even a

906
00:43:27,099 --> 00:43:31,599
tie with a broadleaf slightly broadleaf

907
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:33,159
tie that with narcotic effects that

908
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:35,079
would be more narcotic than what most

909
00:43:33,159 --> 00:43:38,819
people would associate with like above a

910
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:41,590
push so that alone shuts down that whole

911
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:42,640
indica sativa hybrid type thing you know

912
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:45,190
what I mean like it just doesn't make

913
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:46,690
any sense there is not there is not nor

914
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:50,650
has there ever been just three types of

915
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:53,679
cannabis it was a really for the time

916
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:55,660
and the knowledge with cannabis it

917
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:58,409
worked for a while but it definitely has

918
00:43:55,659 --> 00:43:58,409
no place in now

919
00:44:03,298 --> 00:44:08,248
yeah committed I think you're missing

920
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:10,679
the whole point on it there's it's not

921
00:44:08,248 --> 00:44:12,988
indica sativa nor should have ever been

922
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:15,749
referred to that it's just the fact is

923
00:44:12,989 --> 00:44:17,099
that our education wasn't complete at

924
00:44:15,748 --> 00:44:21,298
the time and that's why it was called

925
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:22,739
the way it was let me know when you get

926
00:44:21,298 --> 00:44:26,659
that done you like em I'd like to see it

927
00:44:22,739 --> 00:44:29,668
man but it's not just about poly hybrids

928
00:44:26,659 --> 00:44:32,909
taking over indica sativa when I'm

929
00:44:29,668 --> 00:44:34,288
referring to as landraces even that have

930
00:44:32,909 --> 00:44:37,199
similar effects to what people would

931
00:44:34,289 --> 00:44:39,269
call an indica whereas it is a sativa so

932
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:41,130
you can't quantify it that way you know

933
00:44:39,268 --> 00:44:42,928
what I mean and that was it's always

934
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:45,028
been that way but people's education

935
00:44:42,929 --> 00:44:47,309
hadn't caught up to what cannabis

936
00:44:45,028 --> 00:44:49,548
actually was and how it works if that

937
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:49,548
makes sense

938
00:44:59,469 --> 00:45:04,129
the is there a guidebook or that

939
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:06,339
indicates kind of annoyed and terpene

940
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:10,119
profiles and how it affects that again

941
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:11,840
everybody has different body chemistry

942
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:13,429
everybody has a bought different body

943
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:15,079
chemistry there's no book that can tell

944
00:45:13,429 --> 00:45:16,730
you which way a certain terpenes can

945
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:20,779
affect your body chemistry because it's

946
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:22,099
so vastly different so yeah that's the

947
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:23,390
answer to that what else we got

948
00:45:22,099 --> 00:45:25,579
the indigent term was originally

949
00:45:23,389 --> 00:45:27,619
developed for India that's correct

950
00:45:25,579 --> 00:45:32,329
indicas were developed for Indian

951
00:45:27,619 --> 00:45:34,250
subcontinent cultivars yeah it's kind of

952
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:36,559
more about right seeds like being it's

953
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:39,619
like indica sativa hybrid right seeds so

954
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:41,210
yeah and then there's like type 1 type 2

955
00:45:39,619 --> 00:45:43,159
type 3 and now there's type 4 which is

956
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:49,670
just right seeds so yeah pretty much

957
00:45:43,159 --> 00:45:51,949
just you know if yeah right seats yep

958
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:53,510
personal body chemistry plays the

959
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:56,599
biggest role of anything and that's why

960
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:58,430
you when you go into a collective and

961
00:45:56,599 --> 00:46:00,380
they tell you how somebody's gonna

962
00:45:58,429 --> 00:46:01,819
affect you you should slap them in the

963
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:06,769
[ __ ] face tell them not to be so

964
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:11,240
goddamn reckless I saw another question

965
00:46:06,769 --> 00:46:16,759
somewhere yeah sativa is simply Latin

966
00:46:11,239 --> 00:46:18,829
for cultivated correct elaborate on

967
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:22,040
males that throw a single set of pistols

968
00:46:18,829 --> 00:46:24,259
on a whole plant what what that would

969
00:46:22,039 --> 00:46:26,630
mean if you have a set a male throwing a

970
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:29,420
set of pistols on one single spot of the

971
00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:33,110
plant it means for some reason ethylene

972
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:35,300
was directed to methylate yeah yeah

973
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:38,090
ethylene was directed and not blocked

974
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:40,220
for whatever reason that hormone was

975
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:42,559
released in that particular region of

976
00:46:40,219 --> 00:46:46,689
the plant and that's what causes it to

977
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:50,719
throw pistols most males release enough

978
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:53,720
to Brennan on their own and they block

979
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:55,399
ethylene so they can be a true male

980
00:46:53,719 --> 00:46:57,319
that's how it usually works however

981
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:59,090
sometimes it's not always the case and

982
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:02,930
for some reason and it's not always the

983
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:04,400
same reason ethylenes let in inter

984
00:47:02,929 --> 00:47:06,859
brothers blocked on a single branch and

985
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,690
it could be something from light leaks

986
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:10,539
or for some reason nutrients are getting

987
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:11,829
trapped in that one area and excel

988
00:47:10,539 --> 00:47:13,750
if nitrogen's causing that to happen

989
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:16,299
there's a thousand reasons that cause

990
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:18,219
that to happen it doesn't necessarily

991
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:19,900
mean that the plant is always a herm but

992
00:47:18,219 --> 00:47:23,889
it does mean that for some reason it is

993
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:25,510
letting that trade through now there's

994
00:47:23,889 --> 00:47:28,059
the argument and I I don't know

995
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:29,650
scientifically I honestly don't know how

996
00:47:28,059 --> 00:47:31,539
accurate it is

997
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:35,380
I know DJ short talked about it in his

998
00:47:31,539 --> 00:47:39,009
book saying that he likes males that

999
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:42,070
herm because it leads to more female

1000
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:46,470
offspring in the progeny because it has

1001
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:50,860
a a leaning towards letting more

1002
00:47:46,469 --> 00:47:54,029
ethylene in to cause female production

1003
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:56,440
it means like like the the progeny is

1004
00:47:54,030 --> 00:48:00,010
predetermined to be ethylene heavy if

1005
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:02,050
that makes sense yeah I don't know if

1006
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:05,230
it's true or not though I I did it once

1007
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:11,070
with I was a head of blue sativa line

1008
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:15,519
blue velvet and I crossed it to a c99

1009
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:17,380
male because there was of trying out the

1010
00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:20,199
DJ short technique and seen if that

1011
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:22,750
worked the blue velvet would her him

1012
00:48:20,199 --> 00:48:25,059
from time to time and the c99 was a

1013
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:27,010
hermaphroditic male and from the progeny

1014
00:48:25,059 --> 00:48:29,259
we didn't see any harms but there wasn't

1015
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:30,700
much it was a slight but only only

1016
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:32,440
slight and I didn't have enough of a

1017
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:39,210
population to run to really get an idea

1018
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:39,210
of if it was truly female dominant so

1019
00:48:50,769 --> 00:48:55,900
uh-huh I don't smoke a lot of CBD so I

1020
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:57,099
don't know about the lucid dreams if you

1021
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,930
eat a bunch of Fenton although you have

1022
00:48:57,099 --> 00:49:09,368
some [ __ ] lucid [ __ ] dreams

1023
00:48:58,929 --> 00:49:12,659
I remember the Afghan occur

1024
00:49:09,369 --> 00:49:15,789
I remember the Afghan occur quite well

1025
00:49:12,659 --> 00:49:17,920
I'm growing outside and I'm getting

1026
00:49:15,789 --> 00:49:21,730
hollow main stems and I got no other

1027
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:23,740
problems any idea is that bad no hollow

1028
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:26,530
stems I mean there's no difference

1029
00:49:23,739 --> 00:49:28,419
between Hollow or not Hollow like as far

1030
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:30,760
as it being bad or good there's a

1031
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:33,460
difference but it's not bad nor good one

1032
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:36,340
is it necessarily more hippie than the

1033
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:38,949
drug type it's just old it's it's an old

1034
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:42,070
terminology it's old thought processes

1035
00:49:38,949 --> 00:49:44,349
back when they were still trying to keep

1036
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:47,200
hemp as a separate cultivar from the

1037
00:49:44,349 --> 00:49:48,699
drug type and they would say oh this

1038
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:50,469
one's more of a drug type you know

1039
00:49:48,699 --> 00:49:52,059
selecting out of hand this one's more of

1040
00:49:50,469 --> 00:49:53,618
a drug type cos got the hollow stem you

1041
00:49:52,059 --> 00:49:55,150
know this is from a long time ago

1042
00:49:53,619 --> 00:49:57,430
shouldn't it's it's not even remotely

1043
00:49:55,150 --> 00:50:00,820
relevant anymore not remotely relevant

1044
00:49:57,429 --> 00:50:02,829
so don't worry about that how wide of

1045
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:06,039
generations a variation on s one seed

1046
00:50:02,829 --> 00:50:09,940
there's no way to to say that because it

1047
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:11,679
depends on one let me see if I can break

1048
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:15,030
this down because I try to explain this

1049
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:18,039
a lot and a lot of people don't get it

1050
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:20,710
let's say you are going to choose the

1051
00:50:18,039 --> 00:50:23,590
clone yourself that you're gonna s1 from

1052
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:25,300
the seed line so let's say you have some

1053
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:27,250
let's go with skittles let's just say

1054
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:29,890
skittles was a line right it was a it

1055
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:32,949
was an f1 line and you're like okay I

1056
00:50:29,889 --> 00:50:35,440
want to pick this phyno from skittles

1057
00:50:32,949 --> 00:50:38,439
because it is [ __ ] awesome and I want

1058
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:41,260
to s on it and start to lock down the

1059
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:43,720
traits from this specific Fino now you

1060
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:46,000
go to do it you reverse it the plants

1061
00:50:43,719 --> 00:50:48,939
will come out pretty plentiful and and

1062
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:51,280
and different well while variants

1063
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:52,780
because the skittles has a lot in it and

1064
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,700
it's a poly hybrid and the line wasn't

1065
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:57,160
heavily worked it was an f1 hybrid it's

1066
00:50:54,699 --> 00:50:59,649
not like it's an f6 it's an f1 so you're

1067
00:50:57,159 --> 00:51:01,719
gonna see wide variance swing not quite

1068
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:02,889
as wide as out crossing it obviously cuz

1069
00:51:01,719 --> 00:51:04,480
you're not bringing in more genetics

1070
00:51:02,889 --> 00:51:06,369
you're keeping it at the

1071
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:08,139
genetics however your students see that

1072
00:51:06,369 --> 00:51:10,449
wide swing however let's say you go to

1073
00:51:08,139 --> 00:51:12,519
s1 deep chunk because deep chunk is a

1074
00:51:10,449 --> 00:51:15,039
heavily worked line to rush down to

1075
00:51:12,519 --> 00:51:17,079
roughly for 3 to 4 phenotypes that

1076
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:19,480
majorly show themselves probably five or

1077
00:51:17,079 --> 00:51:21,880
six but three to four that make that

1078
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:24,460
that show up the most often you're gonna

1079
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:26,800
see much less variance than that because

1080
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:28,059
you chose it from a worked line and

1081
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:33,940
hopefully that helps you describe that

1082
00:51:28,059 --> 00:51:35,590
or understand that clearer you subscribe

1083
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:37,300
to the idea that picking late showing

1084
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:38,890
males is always better because early

1085
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:40,480
showing Mouse yeah no I don't just I

1086
00:51:38,889 --> 00:51:44,859
don't subscribe to that at all I choose

1087
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:46,389
my males based on a few things but some

1088
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:47,890
of them are superstitious and I'm gonna

1089
00:51:46,389 --> 00:51:49,690
be real like that a lot of the male's

1090
00:51:47,889 --> 00:51:51,759
that I pick it's all on superstition and

1091
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:53,170
I don't know until I run the progeny if

1092
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:55,420
that was correct but you got to start

1093
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:57,340
somewhere right I like to keep that

1094
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:59,650
proprietary of what my actual choosing

1095
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:06,880
is but it needless to say it's

1096
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:08,710
superstitious but yeah you have to you

1097
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,630
have to when it comes to choosing else

1098
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:12,490
you never know until you run the progeny

1099
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:14,590
and a lot of the times the males that

1100
00:52:12,489 --> 00:52:16,869
end up being the most effective in the

1101
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:20,170
out cross of the plants that I run

1102
00:52:16,869 --> 00:52:21,460
weren't my initial choices that's God

1103
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:22,750
that's gotten to be less and less and

1104
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:28,230
I've gotten better at it over the years

1105
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:28,230
however still that that tends to show up

1106
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:35,760
to find an outlier of deep chunk what

1107
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:39,789
you need to do is do do like five or six

1108
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:41,080
F gens of open pollination and you'll

1109
00:52:39,789 --> 00:52:44,889
find those outliers they'll start

1110
00:52:41,079 --> 00:52:48,869
popping out that's how you work the line

1111
00:52:44,889 --> 00:52:48,869
back out is through open pollination

1112
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:54,340
exactly cry baby I think a lot people

1113
00:52:52,539 --> 00:52:56,110
like when I hear people say oh I always

1114
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:59,380
choose my males that when they have the

1115
00:52:56,110 --> 00:53:02,650
the the late flowering males that have

1116
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:06,760
like hollow stands like all that [ __ ] is

1117
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:09,280
just as good as [ __ ] flinging [ __ ] at

1118
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:11,770
at a plant and whatever has the largest

1119
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:14,019
amount of [ __ ] on it you pick like that

1120
00:53:11,769 --> 00:53:14,559
it is the same thing it really is it's a

1121
00:53:14,019 --> 00:53:16,780
wing and a prayer

1122
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:17,769
and then but the only thing that matters

1123
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:20,080
is running on

1124
00:53:17,769 --> 00:53:22,539
finding out if it's accurate in the way

1125
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:26,920
you want it and being willing to drop

1126

the white I love it I love it for

1140
00:54:06,519 --> 00:54:14,980
breeding in certain things I can have

1141
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:17,360
reversed males palm be sterile reversed

1142
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:18,990
males pollen is almost always sterile

1143
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:22,570
[Music]

1144
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:24,099
well the pistols are mostly sterile I

1145
00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:26,830
should say not their pollen or reverse

1146
00:54:24,099 --> 00:54:30,009
smell shouldn't have fallen a reversed

1147
00:54:26,829 --> 00:54:32,049
female can have sterile pollen sometimes

1148
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:34,330
a lot of is more sterile than others but

1149
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:36,610
yeah it's it's definitely a lot harder

1150
00:54:34,329 --> 00:54:38,559
than people think to reverse it's easy

1151
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:40,720
to get a plant to reverse it's not easy

1152
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:45,789
necessarily to collect said reverse

1153
00:54:40,719 --> 00:54:47,829
