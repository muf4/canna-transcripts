1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,940
so we're just going to assume that we're

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:08,460
here what's up everybody how's everybody

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,559
doing welcome to uh breed of Syndicate

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,080
today we're going to go and talk about

5
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:16,378
the sequel to what we were discussing

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,660
last uh episode which was the early

7
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:22,199
years of the deaf seed banks

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,778
yep so I mean kind of last year we uh or

9
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,760
last last time so to speak we chatted a

10
00:00:24,778 --> 00:00:28,800
lot about how they got started we

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,179
chatted about Neville and all that and

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,800
we kind of

13
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:33,479
um we kind of took us took everybody

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,039
through like the first three or four

15
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:36,779
years

16
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,519
um you know I see that there's a bunch

17
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,200
of cool questions this week that have

18
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,000
already popped up so we'll get to that

19
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,100
in a little bit but we're going to kind

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,960
of start on

21
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,239
um we're gonna kind of start and take

22
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,420
you guys through like

23
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,378
um the last say like 10 years or so of

24
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,539
uh

25
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:58,019
of Neville's influence and kind of his

26
00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:00,058
history so uh you know we got a bunch of

27
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,680
notes and things like that we'll hold up

28
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:04,500
some stuff on occasion to give you guys

29
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:06,299
some ideas all that all that type of

30
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,359
stuff so

31
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:13,380
um you know uh probably the easiest way

32
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:15,539
to start is to say that in uh in 1990 in

33
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:17,699
1988

34
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,680
um that was kind of when Neville had

35
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,140
been in business like three years or so

36
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,020
and that's when he kind of started to

37
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:27,900
sort out like favorites among amongst

38
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:30,118
what's he what he had he had had to uh

39
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,100
he'd collected a number of cuttings from

40
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:35,040
America by then he dealt with a bunch of

41
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:36,658
breeders by then he had

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,000
um bread with a number of these things

43
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,939
for three or four years in some cases at

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,040
this point and that's where his uh

45
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:48,179
collection started to go from sort of a

46
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:50,700
a hodgepodge grab bag of things to more

47
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,140
of the famous stuff that we all became

48
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,079
familiar with when we started getting

49
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:59,519
into weed history uh Northern Lights one

50
00:01:55,078 --> 00:02:02,699
Northern Lights two uh G13 you know hash

51
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:05,099
plant NL you know NL hazes and stuff

52
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:09,118
like that so

53
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:11,038
um 88 to 90 is kind of really when

54
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:14,939
um people are probably like more

55
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:16,979
familiar with that stuff yeah because he

56
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:18,959
you know he's he'd sort of settled on

57
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:21,119
what worked for him yeah right where

58
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,620
before he'd been just kind of playing

59
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,259
around with everything he really didn't

60
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,180
know what he'd had people had sent him

61
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:31,079
stuff people had he'd bought things off

62
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:34,200
various folks and he you know but these

63
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,480
are just names to him to us you get NL

64
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:37,979
you get Maple Leaf you get Haze that all

65
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,079
means something because there's a lot of

66
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:42,359
history behind it but probably to him

67
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,879
there was just a lot of they were just

68
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,040
literally names from dudes well early on

69
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,780
he was sourcing a lot of seeds and later

70
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,060
on and over those three years he became

71
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,039
a breeder as opposed to just sourcing

72
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,140
and passing on genetics he actually

73
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:57,900
started working lines which is which is

74
00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:59,759
where these amazing lines come from yeah

75
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,500
and he he and he had done a bunch of

76
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,479
breeding and he sort of figured out what

77
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,519
was an inconsistent pain in the ass for

78
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:07,079
lack of a better term and what was

79
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,539
consistent

80
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,340
um you know Neville was always

81
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:13,859
um he was always sensitive to what

82
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,300
people wanted uh you know he wanted to

83
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:19,200
sell seeds he wanted to make people

84
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:21,180
happy and so uh people weren't happy a

85
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:25,259
lot of times with incredibly variable

86
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:27,780
stuff that didn't perform well and so he

87
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:31,259
uh you know he had started to figure out

88
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:34,500
what males were good to use repeatedly

89
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:36,780
um what females were Champs and bred

90
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,340
well with lots of different stuff and so

91
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,039
we're gonna we're gonna start kind of

92
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,959
you know walking through some of that

93
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:44,759
type of thing okay which one do you want

94
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,900
to start with first

95
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:48,120
um

96
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,939
maybe we should start with we kind of

97
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,680
talked a lot about uh Northern Lights

98
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:54,359
last time that was probably one of the

99
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,640
things that we expounded upon the most

100
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,400
yeah so maybe we could chat about

101
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:02,939
because 1988 is when things dramatically

102
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,580
changed yeah uh in that regard from 85

103
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:08,098
to 87 he just sort of sold a variety of

104
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:10,739
Weird Hybrids of Northern Lights and you

105
00:04:08,098 --> 00:04:13,018
kind of got you just bought straight NL

106
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:16,620
Northern Lights it was a grab bag of all

107
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:19,798
the different types yeah well by by 88

108
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:22,560
he had decided that there was two lines

109
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:26,339
that really made the most sense nl1 and

110
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:29,339
nl2 yeah nl1 was sort of like a

111
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:31,019
broadleafed Afghan

112
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:34,500
um possibly you could call it a Bubba

113
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:37,019
type you know wisely Frosty golf ball

114
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,540
type uh you know nugs almost maybe

115
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:40,859
slightly yellowish

116
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:43,740
and that was probably one of his most

117
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,419
consistent lines he had because he took

118
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:49,259
all the northern lights and he bred them

119
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:52,198
together yeah right uh independently and

120
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:53,819
so in 88 he offered what was called nl1

121
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:57,900
F3

122
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:59,399
yes and nl2 F3 I wish I could put these

123
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:01,379
up on the screen but I can't because I

124
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:03,120
don't have the controls yeah we'll just

125
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:05,399
have to read it we'll just have to read

126
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,300
it so so basically

127
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:10,918
um you know those two things they became

128
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,660
and we'll talk about a little bit more

129
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:16,079
later but these kind of became like

130
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:18,300
Mainstays in cannabis for quite some

131
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:21,418
time they became permanent editions

132
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,400
right yeah as well as that as well as

133
00:05:21,418 --> 00:05:25,978
offering them pure so let's figure he

134
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:31,198
gets them at 80 84. he starts messing

135
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:33,300
around with them in 85-ish by 88 he'd

136
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:37,139
had you know three years of having them

137
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:39,180
he'd taken them to F3 right and he was

138
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:41,879
releasing them as a more consistent

139
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,860
variety yeah and so that's the for 88 is

140
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:47,038
the first is the first year that those

141
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:49,199
two things pop up right and it's also

142
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:50,759
the first year that you start seeing so

143
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,960
in addition to offering both of those

144
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:58,199
strains as straight itself you start

145
00:05:54,959 --> 00:06:01,138
seeing nl2 and nl1 being used as

146
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:02,580
breeding males in all kinds of stuff

147
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:04,019
that he had

148
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:06,599
right

149
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:09,659
um nl1 there's probably nothing that he

150
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,879
used as much as a breeding male as nl1

151
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,740
is that the the biggest one biggest

152
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:16,319
focus on the company is a male overall

153
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:19,379
looking back yeah I would say so I mean

154
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:23,099
you can you can look at stuff and

155
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:24,899
um you know he a lot of the you know a

156
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,539
lot of the stuff that he had you know

157
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:29,279
that he got his cuttings for instance

158
00:06:27,538 --> 00:06:31,019
um like hash plant

159
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:34,079
um hash plant he first offered his hash

160
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:36,959
plant by no one yeah he gets big butt as

161
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:38,399
a cutting he offers it as big bud by nl1

162
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:40,620
yeah

163
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,899
um you know he gets uh he gets a variety

164
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:46,560
of things and he starts Crossing it by

165
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:49,379
nl1 88 is interesting too because you

166
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,620
know he had gotten these old Haze seeds

167
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:54,180
from Sam Skunk Man

168
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:57,240
and uh in addition to some other people

169
00:06:54,180 --> 00:07:00,538
in Holland and 88 is the first year that

170
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,220
any kind of haze hybrid pops up and it's

171
00:07:00,538 --> 00:07:05,180
one that maybe a lot of people haven't

172
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:08,840
heard of right yeah uh it's very weird

173
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:13,379
it's Haze by nl1

174
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:14,279
uh and so it was only offered for one

175
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:17,159
year

176
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:19,559
but what's unique about it is that all

177
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,439
the other Haze hybrids he offered used

178
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,699
Haze as a male yeah this actually was a

179
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:26,939
female that he found that he called

180
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:29,699
Hayes B yes right so there's this one

181
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:33,598
year where all of a sudden you could get

182
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:36,379
Haze B by nl1 and of all things it was

183
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:39,240
nl1 Rooter always yeah

184
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:41,939
so uh that's the first time that Haze

185
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:44,098
pops up that I'm aware of in a catalog

186
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:47,459
in Holland

187
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:50,819
okay I think so yeah you know that's

188
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:52,500
that's I do think you're right

189
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:54,840
um and it was because he hadn't settled

190
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,699
on he had you know he he was still

191
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:58,978
experimenting a little bit but he'd

192
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:00,060
figured out some things yeah right it

193
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,038
also

194
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:05,160
um he'd gone to America

195
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:08,159
and he had acquired through Jorge

196
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,979
cervantes's Connections in the Pacific

197
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,680
Northwest uh in the Oregon uh Washington

198
00:08:10,978 --> 00:08:17,159
area uh Jorge had hooked him up with

199
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:21,418
some unknown uh Growers and those

200
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:22,800
unknown Growers gave him G13 and what

201
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:24,299
became known as the Pacific Northwest

202
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,639
hash plant

203
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:29,160
uh both of those things ended up getting

204
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,780
used pretty extensively in future years

205
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,399
yeah right

206
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:33,059
so

207
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,519
um

208
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:36,958
you know he he also I don't know if I

209
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,939
don't know if Matt can show it or not

210
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:42,299
but

211
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:43,800
he the 87 update I don't know I can't do

212
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:46,799
it I don't know you don't you can't do

213
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:48,419
it so he offered this 87 update one of

214
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:51,359
the things that was cool about novel is

215
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:53,519
that he he gave a lot more data on what

216
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,680
the hell he was doing versus most other

217
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,299
breeders it was just extensive

218
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:59,099
especially in that 87 update that's

219
00:08:57,299 --> 00:09:00,479
really like more of data than most

220
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,300
Growers back then would have even given

221
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,879
a [ __ ] oh yeah I'm glad he did he he

222
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:08,699
lays it out right so yeah

223
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:10,439
um you know he uh he starts talking

224
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:13,680
about it and he talks about basically

225
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:18,240
both the hash plant and the big bud that

226
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:21,659
he crossed to nl1 yes and then he took

227
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:24,120
that and he back crossed it uh males of

228
00:09:21,659 --> 00:09:26,399
that back to the original and so that's

229
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,500
how he became that's how big bud and

230
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:32,639
hash plant actually got offered as as

231
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:35,639
separate strains yeah is he used nl1

232
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:38,399
um to be reacts them for uh you know he

233
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:40,319
so so they're actually

234
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,220
um you know he never had seed lines of

235
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,560
those

236
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,420
right so and he lays out in like

237
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:46,799
extensive detail I can't show it to you

238
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:48,958
on the screen right now but he kind of

239
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:50,939
lays out like his like step by step how

240
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:52,259
he figured it out yeah what kind of he

241
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,880
knows we're going to be in it what you

242
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:56,458
could look for

243
00:09:53,879 --> 00:10:00,539
um all that type of stuff and so that's

244
00:09:56,458 --> 00:10:02,099
when 88 is when a lot of uh

245
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:04,740
that's when a lot of the famous stuff

246
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:07,800
that we all know of really pops up the

247
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:10,500
G13 hash plant I think pops up that year

248
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:13,139
I think it you know it does and then you

249
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,839
know he you know it he found some of

250
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:17,580
these some of these Indica strains these

251
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,500
you know he

252
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,000
um some of these Indica strains were a

253
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,440
lot more consistent than what he was

254
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,899
working with and so once you find

255
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,180
consistency you start Crossing them to

256
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:28,500
different things and

257
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:30,059
um you start

258
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:34,559
you know you start getting these various

259
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:36,059
hybrids sure of such so uh

260
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:39,299
you know I don't know

261
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:40,819
um and then 89.90 is really when like he

262
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:44,939
solidified

263
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:47,100
the sort of the lineup as it were and

264
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,720
that lineup ended up staying pretty

265
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,620
consistent

266
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,680
um

267
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:54,480
in in in the seed bank catalog and even

268
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:56,039
going into Scentsy

269
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,680
um a lot of that stuff ended up gets

270
00:10:56,039 --> 00:11:00,958
getting ported over yeah so you could

271
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:03,239
kind of look at it and if you're

272
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:07,199
thinking about it in that way I would

273
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:09,180
say probably by the late 80s

274
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,420
probably the three most consistent

275
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:13,139
females that he used were

276
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:15,799
um

277
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:20,039
nl5

278
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:22,139
G13 yep and hash plant

279
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:24,899
yep those those were sort of the three

280
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:28,740
most common indicas that he would use as

281
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:31,740
as standard females the hash plant this

282
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,959
is the pnw hash plant cutting

283
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,519
still looks very similar yeah

284
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:39,419
after all these years they still looks

285
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:41,700
similar kind of ugly very ugly to be out

286
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:43,860
to be perfectly honest about it not the

287
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,778
by modern standards not particularly

288
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:48,539
pretty

289
00:11:45,778 --> 00:11:51,120
and then as far as males go

290
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:53,759
by 89.90

291
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,860
you would say that the the most common

292
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:59,759
males he used was like I said before was

293
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:01,560
certainly nl1 he also used nl2 a bunch

294
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:04,860
yep

295
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:07,199
um you know and you know he you had

296
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:11,639
um Northern Lights five by Northern

297
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:14,940
Lights two you had G13 by nl2

298
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:17,519
yep um had Northern you had all kinds of

299
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:20,579
stuff by nl1 yeah

300
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:24,419
Hawaiian Indica was by nl1 Big Bud was

301
00:12:20,578 --> 00:12:28,078
by nl1 hash plant was by nl1 uh that

302
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:31,259
Haze I spoke about was by nl1 Hawaiian

303
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:33,299
yeah all that stuff I'll answer one

304
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:35,458
quick question I see it coming on the

305
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:38,939
thing people talk about the Airborne and

306
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:41,518
the Pacific G13 Cuts uh those are a

307
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:44,940
little hazy but

308
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:49,078
um it's most likely they're not pure G13

309
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:52,200
they're most likely a G13 by nl2 like

310
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:53,759
that like that would be uh Fino popping

311
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,579
out of the seeds the Airborne popped

312
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:59,338
from Pacifica is a lot different

313
00:12:56,578 --> 00:13:02,458
um that one that one is a lot has a lot

314
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:03,899
more of a cloudy history we know the

315
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:05,759
Breeders that offered it and stuff but

316
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:08,639
it never quite panned out the same as

317
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:12,299
Airborne as far as uh producing quality

318
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:14,759
and and stuff similar to G13

319
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:18,359
so yeah so and then

320
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:20,519
um aside from nl1 and nl2 uh the other

321
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:23,399
probably two most common males that he

322
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:27,659
used by you know 89.90 would have been

323
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:30,139
the haze mail uh and skunk one which

324
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:30,139
Hazel

325
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:37,139
um he you know the haze story it's

326
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,659
probably we could probably talk about it

327
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:42,000
a little bit yeah if you could brush up

328
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:43,319
on it brush on it we could brush on it

329
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,759
so

330
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:50,639
um so uh Sam Skunk Man uh flees America

331
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:52,799
and he comes over to your he comes over

332
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,899
to Europe and he's trying to get set up

333
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:58,199
and he has

334
00:13:54,899 --> 00:14:00,600
um skunk one and Haze seeds and then

335
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:03,120
from Mel Frank he has Durban Poison and

336
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,339
Afghani one seeds and he has a couple

337
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,200
other uh seed lines that he'd collected

338
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:09,540
from the orange right California Orange

339
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:12,180
I think that was from Rob Clark oh was

340
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:13,620
that for Rob okay I believe so um he had

341
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:15,659
a number of things

342
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,759
um Paul uh Paul you know he had a number

343
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:22,139
of things from Rob Rob followed him out

344
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:24,539
later early Pearl early girl yeah the

345
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:26,959
Early Girl the

346
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:30,059
um you know the Pearl stuff early Pearl

347
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:33,419
uh some of the Mexicans that that

348
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:36,719
Neville offered uh those were from Sam

349
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:37,639
initially yeah but they were from

350
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,440
um

351
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:42,299
but they were from Rob yeah you know so

352
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,300
Sam ended up coming over

353
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:48,059
Sam ended up coming over to

354
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:50,819
um to Europe first in New York he kind

355
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:54,359
of brought a hodgepodge of various uh

356
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:56,278
collectors and and people's lines right

357
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,919
yeah um

358
00:14:56,278 --> 00:15:01,679
and so uh

359
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:03,539
so you know there's there's a there's a

360
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:04,620
debate between

361
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:06,659
um well it's not a debate anymore

362
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:09,120
because Neville's passed unfortunately

363
00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:12,179
but there was a long debate that was

364
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,879
likely never to be solved where

365
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:17,278
um Sam has a number of stories about the

366
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:19,019
early Haze and how it happened Neville

367
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:22,078
has his own stories that could be an

368
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:26,100
entire podcast in itself but suffice to

369
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:30,539
say that when Sam came over to uh Europe

370
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:34,379
he sold some Haze seeds to Neville

371
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:37,078
uh he sold some Haze seeds to uh the

372
00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:40,740
founder of sssc

373
00:15:37,078 --> 00:15:43,019
um he gave some to the owner of uh

374
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:46,680
positronics

375
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:48,179
um and maybe someone else maybe um there

376
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:51,599
was a few people at least at least three

377
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:53,819
people are documented to have gotten

378
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,740
um stuff from some from Sam right when

379
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,360
he came over right yeah I think that's

380
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:02,459
been pretty well done with the haze yeah

381
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:04,980
with the haze so uh Sam so Neville

382
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:07,500
Neville Neville's story just real quick

383
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:10,139
is there were a bunch of old seeds he

384
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:14,039
cracked a bunch of them uh most of them

385
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:17,278
did not pop uh and he the first female

386
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:19,198
he got he unfortunately killed because

387
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:21,600
it never finished flowering it took

388
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:23,458
forever it was a huge pain in the ass he

389
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,199
got another female which is the bee

390
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,979
which I spoke about

391
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:27,958
um

392
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:31,079
which I spoke about earlier as being the

393
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:34,198
first actual release and what really

394
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:36,419
became famous is he got two males which

395
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:37,979
he called A and C

396
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:40,519
right

397
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:43,019
um and sadly

398
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:44,759
and your audio's clipping a little bit

399
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:47,759
it is

400
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:49,079
yeah yeah I think so

401
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,639
my back

402
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:54,859
yeah yeah you're there but I mean it's

403
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:58,680
like it's hitting high points clipping

404
00:16:54,860 --> 00:17:02,278
it should be good okay so

405
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:05,459
um he got two males uh A and C they both

406
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:10,140
ended up uh becoming kind of famous see

407
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:11,699
much more so and he he he crossed he

408
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:15,120
crossed the a to basically everything

409
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:18,179
every good Indica he had uh and he made

410
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:22,379
a mistake with his workers in 89 and he

411
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:25,100
lost the mail early so yeah ever he

412
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:27,600
never sold he never sold any commercial

413
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:30,659
uh he never sold any commercial seed of

414
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:33,119
a so everybody everybody that

415
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:35,279
um that gets nl5 Haze or any of that

416
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:37,859
other kind of haze crosses silver haze

417
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:39,298
all that it's all using the sea mail

418
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:43,500
because that's the one that survived

419
00:17:39,298 --> 00:17:45,900
yeah right uh and strangely

420
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:50,579
um it seems like Neville had more

421
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:52,740
success finding fire in the haze seeds

422
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:54,359
that he got than other people did

423
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,798
yeah that's what it sounds like that's

424
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:58,439
what it sounds like I mean and it sounds

425
00:17:55,798 --> 00:18:00,599
like he had 10 seeds total is what it

426
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,820
sounds like so he so there's debate in

427
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:05,339
that and there's yeah camp that believes

428
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:07,918
that he got similar things to everyone

429
00:18:05,339 --> 00:18:10,439
else yeah and he just had better indicas

430
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:14,520
to cross them to than anybody else yeah

431
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:17,820
there's another camp that thinks that um

432
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:19,139
Neville claimed that Sam sold him old

433
00:18:17,819 --> 00:18:20,759
seeds

434
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,980
that he said would have a low

435
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:26,220
germination rate that we're from 69 to

436
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:27,960
70. and maybe Sam and that maybe Sam

437
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,240
when he first got there sold some

438
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,880
original stuff before he did his open

439
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,160
pollinations in Holland and the people

440
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,440
that got a hold of that original first

441
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:40,259
batch of haze that he brought over with

442
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,480
him got better quality Haze than people

443
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:45,000
did later on yeah

444
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,519
uh it's not really a debate that we can

445
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:53,400
solve being that it's two dudes from

446
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:55,918
1984 1985. yeah right and they disagree

447
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:59,100
um you know but we do have you know all

448
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:03,179
three guys that he that well Neville and

449
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:05,459
the you know the guy from SSC and the

450
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:06,600
positronics gentleman they all agreed

451
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:10,500
that they got

452
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:13,439
Hayes seed from Sam at the same time at

453
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:16,019
the same time same year same time same

454
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,120
bag everything all that kind of stuff

455
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:20,400
and so we know you know we have we have

456
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:22,979
we have documentation from others that

457
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,820
that it certainly happened yeah

458
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:30,298
right and so that's when

459
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:31,678
um by 80 by 89.90 that's when all the

460
00:19:30,298 --> 00:19:36,000
famous stuff you start hearing about

461
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:39,720
which is nl5 by Skunk one and a five by

462
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:43,019
two G13 by nl2

463
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:46,200
um you know nl5 by I think nl5 by Hayes

464
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:49,558
was actually released via catalog not

465
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,240
until 1880 990. here's a pretty picture

466
00:19:49,558 --> 00:19:53,759
and I was just looking earlier and it's

467
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,919
nl5 it's a I think it's a much prettier

468
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:57,599
picture than on the back of a lot of the

469
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,500
catalogs that they show where it's just

470
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:02,639
like

471
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:04,500
a jumbled up close shot of some kind of

472
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,480
Frosty leaves this one is a much better

473
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:09,119
I think it gives a much better picture

474
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,740
of the bud structure overall growth

475
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:13,199
patterns and whatnot

476
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:17,220
so that's really interesting uh because

477
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:20,220
that's the famous nl5 cutting yeah

478
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,538
um a uh I'll answer a quick question

479
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,160
just because I was talking about it

480
00:20:21,538 --> 00:20:27,298
somebody just asked where's Tom Hill's

481
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:29,340
Haze fits in yes and uh you know I would

482
00:20:27,298 --> 00:20:32,639
say that uh Matt knows a bit more about

483
00:20:29,339 --> 00:20:35,879
that than I but I believe that Tom Hill

484
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,740
got his hay stock from positronics yeah

485
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,120
it's the old positronics Haze I don't

486
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:42,298
know if I think it's the old positronics

487
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:43,678
Haze 19 based on all that so that that's

488
00:20:42,298 --> 00:20:46,558
where

489
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,720
um Tom Hill's Hayes comes from one of

490
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:52,798
the uh you know one of the one of the

491
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:55,200
first people that gave and gave Hayes to

492
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:57,359
um positronics um

493
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,360
and

494
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:01,798
let's see here so lost my train of

495
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:04,079
thought for a second answering that

496
00:21:01,798 --> 00:21:06,240
question but the nl5 that he was just

497
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:07,558
holding up maybe we can talk about that

498
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,798
for a second because that's true

499
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:12,000
interesting so Neville there's we were

500
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:15,538
talking about on the previous podcast

501
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,880
how there was always two famous cuttings

502
00:21:15,538 --> 00:21:20,160
of ml5

503
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:23,100
um on the interview that Matt did with

504
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:26,700
uh Greg Seattle Greg of Northern Lights

505
00:21:23,099 --> 00:21:29,519
Fame he said that he got a cutting of

506
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:33,659
nl5 and it was from his friend Herbie

507
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:36,779
who at Steve Murphy's Afghan and crossed

508
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:38,460
it to a Colombian Mexican yeah and that

509
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:40,740
was the cutting that he sent Neville

510
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:42,179
Neville claims he got that cut and he

511
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:45,480
didn't like it very much compared to the

512
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:48,419
cut that he found Neville story is that

513
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,740
he popped a bunch of nl5 seed lines

514
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:52,140
because that's one of the lines he got

515
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:54,779
from Greg and most of it was an Indica

516
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:57,000
sativa hybrid mess yeah it wasn't

517
00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:58,980
particularly useful but he got this one

518
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,079
plan attempts that was what he called

519
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:04,019
the throwback plant that looked pure

520
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:06,178
Afghan and had no influence of sativa

521
00:22:04,019 --> 00:22:09,658
whatsoever and as you see this short

522
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:10,740
stocky dense butted Frosty yeah that

523
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:14,760
picture

524
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:17,159
I would say leads up to

525
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:19,259
um to nebels you know Neville's story

526
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:20,880
being correct yeah

527
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:22,440
um and probably having some truth to it

528
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,240
because I would look at that thing and I

529
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,220
would not say it had any Colombian or

530
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,200
Mexican influence yes I would instantly

531
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:31,200
say that looks pure Afghani it would

532
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,360
look like a pure Afghan yeah to me at

533
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,380
least so

534
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:38,099
um

535
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:40,919
you know and uh so yeah I mean that

536
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:43,379
right there that's the famous nl5 Haze

537
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:45,600
that's the famous cutting that got

538
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:47,760
crossed the haze that got crossed the

539
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:49,619
skunk one that got crossed in Northern

540
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:52,019
Lights to

541
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:53,819
um and it's really you know we mentioned

542
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:56,579
it before but there was never a pure

543
00:22:53,819 --> 00:22:59,519
seed line of nl5 offered there was one

544
00:22:56,579 --> 00:23:02,879
hybrids correct

545
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:04,079
right there was only hybrids offered so

546
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:08,039
um

547
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:10,379
you know uh that's the cutting

548
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:11,519
there we go let's discuss the nl5 do you

549
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:14,340
want to go into

550
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:16,379
Maple Leaf Indica the big bud stuff like

551
00:23:14,339 --> 00:23:19,199
that did we cover that I don't think we

552
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:20,880
covered that too too much so

553
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,700
um we won a second I gotta do something

554
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,799
with Murray go ahead and start talking

555
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,759
the uh

556
00:23:25,798 --> 00:23:30,480
um

557
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:33,000
so the so basically once he once he

558
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,380
found that nl5 cutting

559
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,240
um like I said before that's when he

560
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:39,240
started Crossing it it became one of his

561
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,919
standards yeah you know in in the in the

562
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:44,819
situation

563
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:47,280
um and you know he had you know like he

564
00:23:44,819 --> 00:23:50,519
crossed it to skunk one that became an

565
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:53,038
extremely famous strain uh Amplified by

566
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:55,619
Skunk one nl5 Haze is probably the most

567
00:23:53,038 --> 00:24:01,019
famous line he did yeah I know five by

568
00:23:55,619 --> 00:24:04,798
two is also Super Famous and uh so you

569
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:07,679
know he nl5 G13 hash plant those became

570
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:11,700
sort of his standard indicates yeah his

571
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:13,380
his best producing females uh skunk one

572
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:17,460
Haze

573
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:18,240
nl2 and nl1 became his most common

574
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:22,019
um

575
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:24,779
males yeah that he used and he offered

576
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:28,500
obviously he never offered a pure nl5

577
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:33,058
line or a pure uh Haze line but he did

578
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:35,700
offer pure nl1 pure nl2 pure skunk one

579
00:24:33,058 --> 00:24:38,038
um you know that type of thing I you

580
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:39,900
know I never got to ask him why

581
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:43,079
the why of that why didn't you ever

582
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:45,000
offer Ace peer or nl5 pure

583
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:47,099
you know I think I think part of the

584
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,079
reason why he never offered uh Hayes

585
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:52,139
pure is because he's he's screwed up

586
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:56,038
early on and he lost too much of it yeah

587
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:57,000
he talked about later on wishing that he

588
00:24:56,038 --> 00:25:01,500
could

589
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:04,619
um that he could cross the uh that he

590
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:07,259
would have been able to cross the B to

591
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:09,899
the a yeah

592
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:11,460
and he you know but he he lost the B

593
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,140
early

594
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:16,500
um because he didn't realize what he had

595
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:19,559
he lost the A on an accident and so he

596
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:21,119
sort of ended up with uh he sort of

597
00:25:19,558 --> 00:25:23,279
ended up with not very much that he

598
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:25,739
knows he was like his most consistent

599
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,658
yeah what do you have what he had left

600
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:30,240
yeah

601
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:31,740
um you know and then strangely it seems

602
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,740
like for whatever reason all the other

603
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:36,900
people that got A's nothing much came of

604
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:38,640
yeah no matter how much breeding or

605
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:41,340
crossing they did nothing became famous

606
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,320
like the later Neville hazes so like

607
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:47,459
when I was going to when I was going to

608
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:50,700
coffee shops uh coffee shops were

609
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:52,140
um you know they were full of of C5

610
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:57,659
which is

611
00:25:52,140 --> 00:26:01,500
uh nl5 AC 85 which is nl5 haze a uh

612
00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:05,340
ag-13 which is G13 Hayes a they also

613
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:07,859
they also had a G13 hey c yeah they were

614
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:09,959
full of Neville work yep um they didn't

615
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:12,959
really carry much posi work they didn't

616
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,819
carry any Sam work they didn't carry any

617
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,440
of those things

618
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:18,839
um you know even though they were easily

619
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:21,900
accessible yeah those were standard

620
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:23,278
people in Holland so uh there must have

621
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,919
been a significant quality difference

622
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:29,700
yeah yeah it had to have been

623
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:33,538
um and you know I think even today

624
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:36,900
is there is there a famous Sam cut

625
00:26:33,538 --> 00:26:40,319
is there a famous pot you know it's all

626
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:43,200
the stuff that they do is not really

627
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:46,798
all the stuff that they do is is all the

628
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:49,919
stuff that's hoarded over there yeah is

629
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:53,220
um you know is uh Whatchamacallit

630
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,659
Neville Cuts yeah and and right now I

631
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:57,058
just want to take the time if any of you

632
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:59,400
older gentlemen are watching this and

633
00:26:57,058 --> 00:27:02,220
have all these cuts

634
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,778
give me a give me a ring I'd love to

635
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:05,220
just to be able to chat about them and

636
00:27:03,778 --> 00:27:07,798
get and get further Histories on a lot

637
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:09,480
of these yeah I mean a lot of this stuff

638
00:27:07,798 --> 00:27:12,298
you know one thing that should be

639
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:14,579
mentioned about this is uh all this

640
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:18,179
stuff happened on a different continent

641
00:27:14,579 --> 00:27:19,980
and you know what uh the story sounds

642
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:23,278
pretty straightforward and simple right

643
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:25,919
now but the amount of talking and time

644
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:27,900
and energy and interviewing people and

645
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,120
trying to make sure that like it's not

646
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:32,580
just one person's opinion and we can get

647
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:36,000
other people to back up opinions on this

648
00:27:32,579 --> 00:27:37,558
stuff takes a long time yeah

649
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,179
I mean me and you have been working

650
00:27:37,558 --> 00:27:41,700
steady on this for I want to say three

651
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:43,679
years now just me and you together and

652
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:46,259
we've done our work on our own obviously

653
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,580
but like we have been pushing hard on

654
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:49,079
this so it's taken a long time to even

655
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:51,599
get up to this point to be able to say

656
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:54,359
any of these things positively yeah and

657
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:55,980
I mean when we say them positively uh

658
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:58,379
most of what we're saying is generally

659
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:00,480
accepted generally accepted fact for now

660
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:02,220
like you said if there's some Old-Timers

661
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,798
or whatever with some secret information

662
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:07,200
out there that's not well known most of

663
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:09,658
this history is oral some of these old

664
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,220
guys have beefs with one another some of

665
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:13,799
them don't like one another very much

666
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:17,100
yeah have their own Egos and their own

667
00:28:13,798 --> 00:28:20,879
versions of of history and events

668
00:28:17,099 --> 00:28:22,439
um and so uh see there's a guy right

669
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:26,159
there that just said it's his 70 year

670
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:28,980
old neighbor has had nl2 since 93.

671
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:31,440
um if that's the case uh possible we

672
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:32,099
would love to talk to you yeah yeah all

673
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,320
right

674
00:28:32,099 --> 00:28:35,959
because there could be pockets of these

675
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:39,298
things that survive

676
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:43,259
yeah the hard part now is that for a

677
00:28:39,298 --> 00:28:45,960
long time nobody gave a [ __ ] about these

678
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:47,400
uh about these strains and so the

679
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,319
information was a little bit more

680
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,960
verifiable because there wasn't anybody

681
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:55,079
trying to claim rep or trying to claim

682
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:57,419
we have this joke we call it pre-pre

683
00:28:55,079 --> 00:29:00,119
um where now ancient old whatever has

684
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:02,100
come out of the woodwork so it gets a

685
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:04,739
lot harder to weed through who has what

686
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:06,119
yeah and like I I was talking with

687
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,740
another gentleman that we're we're

688
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:09,298
starting an interview with

689
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:10,798
um and he was very important in the

690
00:29:09,298 --> 00:29:12,778
Dutch C team and he was talking about

691
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:14,158
some of his old lines possibly popping

692
00:29:12,778 --> 00:29:16,798
up in the U.S

693
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,899
and this is something that happens every

694
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:21,658
few years someone says I've got this

695
00:29:18,898 --> 00:29:23,819
stash of XYZ I've kept you know mason

696
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:26,340
jars full of every single one and done

697
00:29:23,819 --> 00:29:28,558
reproductions since 80 something and

698
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:30,119
it's it's hard unless you have extensive

699
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:31,980
knowledge about these old lines and it

700
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:33,658
have run some how are you ever going to

701
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:35,339
tell him no that's not correct it's it's

702
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:37,200
a hard situation

703
00:29:35,339 --> 00:29:39,778
yeah I mean there's a guy saying you you

704
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,399
know there's some old school Growers

705
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:44,460
um there's pockets in America that

706
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:46,500
aren't on Instagram that sure aren't on

707
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:49,259
on some of these they've never done on

708
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:52,859
the forums that live in police states

709
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:54,960
that have kept their circles quite tight

710
00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:57,599
um they don't they might not even know

711
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,278
how rare or how cool

712
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:00,658
some of the stuff that's been within

713
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:03,240
their little circle that they've just

714
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:06,299
been growing and smoking on might be you

715
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:08,519
know so we still have hope every time a

716
00:30:06,298 --> 00:30:10,139
[ __ ] artist comes up I'll freely

717
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:12,898
admit that there's a small part of me

718
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:15,000
that wishes it was true yeah yeah I just

719
00:30:12,898 --> 00:30:17,639
want it to be true I want all the

720
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,679
stories to be true I want every ancient

721
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:22,620
rare being imaginable

722
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:25,919
to be accessible yeah cuts and stuff

723
00:30:22,619 --> 00:30:28,199
like yeah to pop up and be

724
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:31,320
um you know and be available to people

725
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,880
sure um sadly there's a lot of people

726
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:33,839
out there that are just trying to make a

727
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,140
quick buck

728
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:38,579
uh and when you sell beans I mean think

729
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:41,880
about how many people have been selling

730
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:44,579
beans of uh roadkill skunk for the last

731
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:46,679
two or three years now right yep

732
00:30:44,579 --> 00:30:49,199
um but I haven't seen any roadkill skunk

733
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:51,240
flower yeah it's hard it's hard to get

734
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,159
finished flour with roadkill Terps

735
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,960
everybody's figuring that out you know

736
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:57,419
and you can sell beans for quite some

737
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,038
time before nobody you know and exactly

738
00:30:57,419 --> 00:31:00,899
and take a while before they realize

739
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:03,058
that you're not finding roadkill skunk

740
00:31:00,898 --> 00:31:04,678
exactly and sell a lot of beans and

741
00:31:03,058 --> 00:31:07,798
there's people that have dropped

742
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:10,980
thousands of dollars of you know hopes

743
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:13,918
and dreams and spent months hunting and

744
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:16,440
they get some floral Citrus skunk ones

745
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:19,080
Citrus skunk one resold them skunk one

746
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:22,919
it's like you know slight Funk slight

747
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:24,720
whatever not roadkill not clear skunk

748
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:27,480
Terps

749
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,620
um so you know it's uh it's sad in that

750
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,659
way

751
00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:32,639
um you know people were asking some

752
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:34,799
other stuff and you know we got a lot to

753
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,038
cover so we'll we'll move on a bit but

754
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:40,639
to say

755
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:43,140
89.90 is when Neville really established

756
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:45,899
most of the strains that kind of became

757
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:47,700
famous yes yes that's when they all

758
00:31:45,898 --> 00:31:49,619
started popping up that's when they all

759
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:52,259
started popping up that's when he sort

760
00:31:49,619 --> 00:31:54,658
of figured out what he had what was

761
00:31:52,259 --> 00:31:58,440
consistent to breed with what made sense

762
00:31:54,659 --> 00:32:00,179
what lines people liked uh you know he's

763
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,860
had this running joke that people would

764
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:04,140
ask for the highest level of quality

765
00:32:01,859 --> 00:32:06,178
imaginable and if he sold them an

766
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:07,919
awesome Indica that was a hybrid of two

767
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:09,720
pure indicas and it yielded like [ __ ]

768
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,880
they'd [ __ ] and [ __ ] and moan and

769
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:14,038
whine and complain because they wanted

770
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:16,620
the best possible and they also wanted

771
00:32:14,038 --> 00:32:19,679
to crush yields yes so that's always

772
00:32:16,619 --> 00:32:21,479
been a difficulty in in cannabis

773
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,179
um you know people want the best people

774
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,620
want the greatest Terps uh there's lots

775
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:27,000
of people out there in commercial world

776
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:28,979
that don't want to grow anything that

777
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,339
takes longer than nine or ten weeks yeah

778
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:35,579
they don't be a pain to trim wanted to

779
00:32:32,339 --> 00:32:39,898
be larfy they don't want it the finicky

780
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:41,699
or low Peter massive yielding Frosty the

781
00:32:39,898 --> 00:32:45,418
highest amount of chirps yeah

782
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:47,038
everybody's 20 THC I want the strongest

783
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:48,960
most potent weed you can possibly

784
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:50,819
imagine with crazy herbs and I want

785
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,519
donkey dick Buds and I want it done in

786
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:56,759
50 days yeah send it

787
00:32:53,519 --> 00:33:01,319
yeah but you know rarely does that occur

788
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:03,119
yeah same package sadly yeah you know a

789
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:05,158
lot of the a lot of the famous strains

790
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:07,199
that we all smoke

791
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:10,020
um from a production standpoint are

792
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,659
annoying yeah very much especially at

793
00:33:10,019 --> 00:33:14,220
the last decade or so it's gotten worse

794
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:16,919
nobody would ever pick to grow cookies

795
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:19,019
no nobody would ever pick to grow Kush

796
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:21,360
where it's like dink dink dink dink dink

797
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:23,700
yeah nugs here and there they don't hold

798
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:26,639
themselves up I mean if you were like a

799
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:28,380
commercial farmer in the real world

800
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,320
um you know they'd be looking for some

801
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:33,140
kind of like green crack blue dream

802
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:36,839
type structure

803
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:39,538
top to bottom buds easy to grow fairly

804
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:41,939
fast finishing you know that's what from

805
00:33:39,538 --> 00:33:43,558
a production standpoint uh and a

806
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:46,080
happiness standpoint that's what you

807
00:33:43,558 --> 00:33:48,538
want yeah but you know

808
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:50,220
um even Sour Diesel you know that yields

809
00:33:48,538 --> 00:33:52,859
pretty well takes a long time kind of

810
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:55,620
feathery makes a lot of debugs if you

811
00:33:52,859 --> 00:33:58,079
mess up it can be really larfy

812
00:33:55,619 --> 00:34:00,599
um you know super tasty and it works

813
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:03,240
really good it burns really nice but

814
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:05,099
it's not blue dream no it's not

815
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,298
it's not you know Barry White or

816
00:34:05,099 --> 00:34:08,579
something like that it's not something

817
00:34:06,298 --> 00:34:10,378
that that's just covered in Nubs

818
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:15,418
and so

819
00:34:10,378 --> 00:34:17,460
um so yeah so uh the uh uh maybe we

820
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:19,918
should talk about so he created all this

821
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:21,960
stuff Neville was the largest there was

822
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:23,460
really only two you know there's other

823
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:26,579
people that will claim to have seed

824
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:29,460
banks yeah Scentsy seeds had a tiny seed

825
00:34:26,579 --> 00:34:31,619
bank positronics had a small seed bank

826
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:33,418
or was other seed banks in Holland but

827
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:34,679
there was really only two seats and this

828
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:36,898
is really why we're spending so much

829
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:38,639
time talking about it is in the 80s

830
00:34:36,898 --> 00:34:39,898
there was really only two seed banks

831
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,659
that were selling a lot of seafood

832
00:34:39,898 --> 00:34:44,579
America in in Amsterdam in it's selling

833
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:47,460
to America correct and they were the

834
00:34:44,579 --> 00:34:49,858
first two seed banks that really offered

835
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:51,418
worldwide sales to anybody that was

836
00:34:49,858 --> 00:34:54,898
willing to come to Holland and buy them

837
00:34:51,418 --> 00:34:56,759
or fill out their their mail order sheet

838
00:34:54,898 --> 00:34:59,338
and send them an envelope with some

839
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,900
money and a list yep and that was super

840
00:34:59,338 --> 00:35:03,179
sativa seed Club

841
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:06,300
uh and the seed bank which was Neville

842
00:35:03,179 --> 00:35:08,219
yes 50 seed club uh started a little bit

843
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:10,260
after Neville

844
00:35:08,219 --> 00:35:12,959
um it had similar things to him it had

845
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:15,180
some of their own stuff but Neville was

846
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:18,119
the he was the elephant he was the big

847
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:20,578
dog he was yeah he was the he was the

848
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:22,500
one selling the vast majority of stuff

849
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:25,320
that people in America were buying from

850
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,880
Holland was Neville's yes and that

851
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,700
really that's really what makes them so

852
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,320
important because

853
00:35:28,699 --> 00:35:32,819
the uh the seed game is super

854
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:36,420
Diversified now

855
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:39,000
right he basically almost had a monopoly

856
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:40,500
yeah and it's why all these strains that

857
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,539
are around today usually have something

858
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,338
of Neville's in it if not both sides

859
00:35:42,539 --> 00:35:46,199
yeah and so that there's a lot of

860
00:35:44,338 --> 00:35:48,299
there's a lot of Neville work in a lot

861
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:49,919
of modern trains yeah

862
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,800
um simply because he was the only game

863
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:55,019
and he was one of the only games in town

864
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:57,660
and tons and tons of people got his

865
00:35:55,019 --> 00:36:00,059
stuff and then they bred his stuff into

866
00:35:57,659 --> 00:36:03,000
stuff they already had in America yeah

867
00:36:00,059 --> 00:36:05,279
and so his stuff got Blended in

868
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:08,760
and you know his stuff got super famous

869
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:10,519
obviously the nl5 haze became a

870
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:13,200
phenomenon in New York

871
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:15,539
it started being it started being sold

872
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:17,399
you know they call it the heist Haze you

873
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:19,099
know the pith the church the this the

874
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:22,200
that whatever

875
00:36:19,099 --> 00:36:26,519
a massive thing

876
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:30,059
um and the super skunk uh you know

877
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:32,280
became Super Famous uh as well

878
00:36:30,059 --> 00:36:34,440
um he's talked about how super skunk and

879
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,640
nl5 Hayes were his two top selling

880
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,079
varieties

881
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:39,000
yeah

882
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:41,880
you know and so enormous amounts of

883
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,099
those seeds got sold right yeah and

884
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:47,820
that's sort of what uh maybe we can talk

885
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:51,480
so the 90 catalog is the final catalog

886
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:54,720
of Neville's ownership of the seed bank

887
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:56,699
yeah I don't think I have that one here

888
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:58,259
um and that there's a couple there's

889
00:36:56,699 --> 00:37:01,139
there's the most famous thing that came

890
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:05,700
out of the 90 catalog was who released

891
00:37:01,139 --> 00:37:08,699
um super skunk yes uh Super Skunk was

892
00:37:05,699 --> 00:37:12,000
you know when sadly

893
00:37:08,699 --> 00:37:14,460
uh Sam did not like skunk

894
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,199
he didn't well you gotta say he Sam

895
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:19,079
liked skunk one he did not like skunk

896
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:21,799
smells he didn't like skunk Aroma yeah

897
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:25,560
Aroma he took skunk one

898
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:28,859
and he tried to breed the skunk out of

899
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:31,739
it that is by his own quote right

900
00:37:28,858 --> 00:37:33,838
yes he did he has his own quote he was

901
00:37:31,739 --> 00:37:36,959
going for more of the Citrus grapes

902
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:38,699
sweet floral he liked those Aromas he

903
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,800
was going for bud structure and other

904
00:37:38,699 --> 00:37:42,899
things yeah he didn't like the rank

905
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,000
skunk he tried to

906
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:47,338
uh this so I'll answer another question

907
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,739
the silver Pearl came out as a single

908
00:37:47,338 --> 00:37:53,578
strain I think in the last two years of

909
00:37:49,739 --> 00:37:57,118
the seed bank uh 88 89 and 90. yeah he

910
00:37:53,579 --> 00:38:01,460
offered silver Pearl and I

911
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:01,460
quote me on the on Silver polich

912
00:38:03,179 --> 00:38:08,399
I think it's I think it's early Pearl it

913
00:38:06,179 --> 00:38:10,618
might be nl5 early Pearl skunk one

914
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,440
something along those lines something

915
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:15,000
like that yeah yeah yeah uh let's see I

916
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,440
only see early Pearl improved in this

917
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,239
one and it doesn't list anything but

918
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:20,099
yeah it's something like that it's

919
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:24,239
something like that and he also released

920
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:26,640
uh silver Pearl by Hayes in those couple

921
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:29,578
years which was called Silver Haze

922
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:30,358
uh at the time uh he called it he called

923
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:33,359
it

924
00:38:30,358 --> 00:38:35,279

925
00:38:33,358 --> 00:38:38,819

926
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:40,800
Scentsy so he um

927
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:42,780
you know there was a guy named Jim

928
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,000
Ortega that we'll talk about real

929
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:48,180

935
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:06,299
in the last couple years of his catalog

936
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:08,820

937
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:10,680

yes called it

940
00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:18,838
a Afghan breeder packs I think where you

941
00:39:16,858 --> 00:39:21,838
could literally buy some of the Original

942
00:39:18,838 --> 00:39:23,338
Seed stock that Jim Ortega gave him you

943
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:26,940
know how amazing would that have been

944
00:39:23,338 --> 00:39:29,039
yeah I mean and he

945
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:30,960
um and he offered garlic Bud as a pure

946
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:32,820
strain uh the only thing that never

947
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,380
really got offered is a pierced that

948
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:37,920
never really got messed with too much

949
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:41,300
was kush four yeah there is a thing he

950
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,300
sold called Kush by Kush

951
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:47,700
Push by Kush which he said he crossed

952
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:50,700
his two best pushes to um

953
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:54,598
you know uh to each other and his two

954
00:39:50,699 --> 00:39:56,098
best coaches were cush four and nl2

955
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:57,480
do you know what year that one's in I

956
00:39:56,099 --> 00:39:58,200
was trying to show it but I can't find

957
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:01,380
it

958
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:04,259
I'm gonna say that one's in here that

959
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:06,720
one might be an 87. here's at least one

960
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:09,619
of them in the 89 talking about it I

961
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:09,618
don't know how clear it is

962
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:15,539
and he also offered skunk Kush which was

963
00:40:13,139 --> 00:40:16,980
and so that's that's you know and then

964
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:18,179
uh

965
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:20,460
um

966
00:40:18,179 --> 00:40:22,440
so maybe

967
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:26,400
we're getting pretty in depth here but

968
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:29,760
yeah maybe maybe we should talk about

969
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,619
um his Fame led to issues right yes

970
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,240
let's get into that he's selling

971
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:36,539
millions of dollars in seed to America

972
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:38,519
yeah right it's the Reagan Era and then

973
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:41,400
the George Bush era it's the height of

974
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:43,800
the War on Drugs large penalties weeds

975
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:47,280
totally illegal everywhere

976
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:49,920
um and there was a situation in which a

977
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:52,920
um a hydro store got rated

978
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,139
um from whatever reason some kind some

979
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,579
kind of action and they discovered that

980
00:40:55,139 --> 00:41:00,598
this guy was supplying a bunch of

981
00:40:56,579 --> 00:41:02,700
Growers and in that they found money and

982
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:05,760
Neville's catalogs

983
00:41:02,699 --> 00:41:08,039
and they realized that uh

984
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,140
they realized that he was selling up the

985
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:12,599
dollars in seed

986
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:14,098
um to America and you notice in some of

987
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:15,599
these back catalogs it always says that

988
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:18,240
it shipped from the US or like in the

989
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:20,820
High Times uh ads for Neville's things

990
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:22,618
it would always say ship from U.S

991
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:24,660
well what's interesting about that is

992
00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:28,440
this isn't factual but I believe it to

993
00:41:24,659 --> 00:41:31,980
be true that Neville I think had

994
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:33,900
partners that he smuggled seeds into

995
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:38,460
America yeah

996
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:40,320
and then you would send Neville money

997
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:42,420
and then he would communicate what you

998
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:44,579
needed and they watched the seeds from

999
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:45,300
within the U.S yeah I think he was

1000
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:47,519
pretty

1001
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:48,660
um he was transparent about that when it

1002
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:50,820
was going on

1003
00:41:48,659 --> 00:41:52,440
and so as a result of that that meant

1004
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:55,079
that every seed batch didn't have to go

1005
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:57,119
through customs yes you just had to get

1006
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:58,980
it through customs occasionally

1007
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:00,440
and then he could sell it within the

1008
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:03,599
United States

1009
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:06,539
uh the DEA and the government at the

1010
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:08,760
time took a pretty uh poor view of that

1011
00:42:06,539 --> 00:42:11,099
aspect yeah right

1012
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:13,320
and so

1013
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:16,500
um operation green Merchant happens

1014
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:20,160
where they decide to raid

1015
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:22,440
um everyone every Growth Store in the

1016
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:24,420
united for the most part they raided the

1017
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:28,260
grow stores in the United States they

1018
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:31,380
did a big push right and uh Neville gets

1019
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:33,180
caught I believe in Australia yep and he

1020
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:37,500
gets busted

1021
00:42:33,179 --> 00:42:39,000
okay uh and he ends up spending a good

1022
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:42,300
amount of time in jail

1023
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:45,179
better part of the year yeah

1024
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:47,640
um and so that you know we're not gonna

1025
00:42:45,179 --> 00:42:49,559
this this this particular episode we're

1026
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:51,179
not going to talk very much about sssc

1027
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:52,679
because we're going to save that for a

1028
00:42:51,179 --> 00:42:57,539
different time

1029
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:58,919
um but what that did is that sort of uh

1030
00:42:57,539 --> 00:43:01,739
um

1031
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:04,139
led to a domino effect of sorts it had a

1032
00:43:01,739 --> 00:43:07,919
domino effect of sorts uh uh super

1033
00:43:04,139 --> 00:43:10,019
sativa seed Club decided to stop

1034
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,579
um because they saw what was going on

1035
00:43:10,019 --> 00:43:14,280
with Neville and it was pretty serious

1036
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:15,539
Neville was already in was obviously in

1037
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:18,599
jail

1038
00:43:15,539 --> 00:43:22,380
and uh this gave an opportunity for

1039
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:24,240
others yeah who had seen how how Neville

1040
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:27,800
and the super sativa seed Club were

1041
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:30,779
doing right it left a void in Amsterdam

1042
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:32,880
uh in Holland it was still it was legal

1043
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:34,560
at that time obviously to produce seed

1044
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,160
for

1045
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:38,460
um

1046
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:40,739
to produce seed yeah the only places in

1047
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:42,780
in the world where it was totally legal

1048
00:43:40,739 --> 00:43:46,318
to produce cannabis seed yeah

1049
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:48,599
so uh Neville was sitting in jail

1050
00:43:46,318 --> 00:43:50,759
um he was fighting extradition

1051
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:53,519
they didn't want an extradite Neville to

1052
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:54,900
America because

1053
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:57,119
um they wanted to put him in jail for

1054
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:59,400
life in prison yeah

1055
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,900
and Australia and Holland which he was a

1056
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:03,980
citizen of both didn't agree with that

1057
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:07,500
yeah so he was stuck in jail

1058
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:09,480
uh and he

1059
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,980
um

1060
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,199
you know there was all of a sudden there

1061
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:16,019
was no seed banks yeah there was no Key

1062
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:18,419
Banks left it caused a bunch it caused a

1063
00:44:16,019 --> 00:44:21,960
bunch of Ripple effects uh a whole bunch

1064
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:23,940
of growers in America got busted

1065
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:27,480
um to their relationships with various

1066
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:30,179
uh hydro stores and stuff like that

1067
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:32,400
um you know uh Greg Seattle Greg talked

1068
00:44:30,179 --> 00:44:34,739
in his interview with Matt about how by

1069
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:37,318
the late 80s and that era they had

1070
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:40,139
basically lost everything because of a

1071
00:44:37,318 --> 00:44:41,759
series of rolling busts yeah uh there

1072
00:44:40,139 --> 00:44:44,098
were heavy presence they were really

1073
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:46,740
going after people electricity all this

1074
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:47,838
kind of stuff and so

1075
00:44:46,739 --> 00:44:50,939
um

1076
00:44:47,838 --> 00:44:53,338
Scentsy which was founded by Ben and

1077
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:56,280
Alan dronkers they saw an opportunity

1078
00:44:53,338 --> 00:44:57,259
and they offered to bail Neville out of

1079
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:00,060
jail

1080
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:02,520
and uh give them money to help him fight

1081
00:45:00,059 --> 00:45:05,219
his situation as long as he sold them

1082
00:45:02,519 --> 00:45:08,639
their company yes

1083
00:45:05,219 --> 00:45:12,838
and that was the invention of Scentsy so

1084
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:17,460
crazy that was the death of the seed

1085
00:45:12,838 --> 00:45:19,679
bank feed Bank yeah and Scentsy uh since

1086
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:22,679
he absorbed him

1087
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:26,639
and all of a sudden went from a nobody

1088
00:45:22,679 --> 00:45:30,179
to the biggest game in town that's right

1089
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:31,318
um and they bought uh they they bought

1090
00:45:30,179 --> 00:45:34,919
his feedback

1091
00:45:31,318 --> 00:45:37,739
right yeah so sudden they start offering

1092
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:40,019
um you know and we actually the Sensei

1093
00:45:37,739 --> 00:45:42,179
91 seed bank catalog is one of the

1094
00:45:40,019 --> 00:45:44,579
rarest catalogs

1095
00:45:42,179 --> 00:45:46,199
um because it only was out for his

1096
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:48,839
office building out for one year and it

1097
00:45:46,199 --> 00:45:49,919
shows the merger of the seed bank with

1098
00:45:48,838 --> 00:45:52,559
Scentsy

1099
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,838
and they have a much much more limited

1100
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:56,880
catalog than what they offered in the

1101
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:58,980
future and a much more limited one than

1102
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:02,099
Neville was currently offering but by

1103
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:05,519
the time he split so

1104
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:07,859
um yeah and so as a result of that uh

1105
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:10,380
sadly for Neville Neville went from

1106
00:46:07,858 --> 00:46:14,159
being the owner of the largest most

1107
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:16,800
successful seed bank in the world to the

1108
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:20,519
Head breeder

1109
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:22,940
of Scentsy yeah he lost his company

1110
00:46:20,519 --> 00:46:27,480
he lost his self-control

1111
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:29,818
uh the government hated him yeah uh and

1112
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:31,139
he was trapped in Holland for a long

1113
00:46:29,818 --> 00:46:34,259
time

1114
00:46:31,139 --> 00:46:37,078
because the the America wanted to come

1115
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:39,119
steal him yeah got him to America and

1116
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:42,599
have him face charges of life in prison

1117
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:45,000
for seed sales yes Holland refused to

1118
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:47,039
extradite him because since seed sales

1119
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,500
were legal and he was a citizen of

1120
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:50,818
Holland they were not going to extradite

1121
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,260
one of their citizens for doing

1122
00:46:50,818 --> 00:46:54,838
something that was legal in their own

1123
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:56,280
country yes then we go to life in prison

1124
00:46:54,838 --> 00:46:58,078
in some other country in some other

1125
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:01,260
country he is not a citizen yeah and

1126
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:03,240
some other countries not a citizen so he

1127
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:05,579
had his freedom

1128
00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:08,098
but he was stuck in Holland

1129
00:47:05,579 --> 00:47:12,119
the DEA in Interpol was after his ass

1130
00:47:08,099 --> 00:47:15,599
yeah and he lost the biggest most most

1131
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:17,400
uh famous seed company and had to give

1132
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:19,680
it to Ben and Allen drunkers and work

1133
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:22,019
for them yeah any didn't he lose the

1134
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:23,699
castle as well at that point yeah he

1135
00:47:22,019 --> 00:47:24,539
lost the castle

1136
00:47:23,699 --> 00:47:26,539

00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:07,139
and so there was some things uh

1151
00:48:05,699 --> 00:48:10,318
somebody asked if they could see it

1152

so yeah so

1156
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:26,159
so obviously that sucked for Neville

1157
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:29,519

1158

00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:36,420
losing your company's no fun yeah your

1161
00:48:35,099 --> 00:48:38,579
companies know I mean yeah it's like

1162
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:40,079
basically they were like hey we'll do

1163
00:48:38,579 --> 00:48:41,579
you a solid we'll get you out of jail

1164
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:43,859
and we'll get you back to Holland but we

1165
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:45,720
want your [ __ ] Yeah by a minor

1166
00:48:43,858 --> 00:48:48,358
competitor at that someone that wasn't

1167
00:48:45,719 --> 00:48:50,279
even close to the level he since he

1168
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:52,679
wasn't even close to where super sativa

1169
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:55,440
seed club or the exactly they were a

1170
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:58,318
nobody compared to that and so you're

1171
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:00,119
sitting in jail and your options are

1172
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:03,599
keep sitting in jail

1173
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:06,420
or have these sort of uh greasy Dutch

1174
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:08,940
businessmen uh offer to get you out and

1175
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:10,858
get you home and give you some money and

1176
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:14,400
buy your company yeah it sounds real

1177
00:49:10,858 --> 00:49:17,098
good at the time sure you know he chose

1178
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:19,920
the get out of jail yeah

1179
00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:22,880
you know uh card

1180
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:24,539
but then he lost control

1181
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,099
yeah

1182
00:49:24,539 --> 00:49:27,960
so

1183
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:31,140
um you know that was sort of the start

1184
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:33,059
of you know by the time that uh Matt

1185
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:34,440
Matt can speak to this a little bit he

1186
00:49:33,059 --> 00:49:36,179
got to communicate quite a bit with

1187
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:38,880
Neville I I got to meet in it a few

1188
00:49:36,179 --> 00:49:41,940
times uh I've chatted with him a number

1189
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:44,220
of times Matt had a much longer back and

1190
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:48,000
forth with him uh much later in his

1191
00:49:44,219 --> 00:49:49,618
career that sounded super dirty and well

1192
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,420
I just mean that you know no I know what

1193
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:53,039
you mean they communicated a lot more

1194
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:55,920
over a lot more months a lot more

1195
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:57,599
directly yeah than you know I met him

1196
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:01,019
through other people I used to go to

1197
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:02,940
Holland quite a bit to get seeds and I

1198
00:50:01,019 --> 00:50:04,980
ended up meeting him a few times I was a

1199
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:07,920
young guy guy it's not like I had some

1200
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:10,079
kind of uh you know massive uh

1201
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:13,559
information dump from Neville to myself

1202
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:14,700
yeah I wasn't interviewing him in or

1203
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:17,639
anything like that I was a little

1204
00:50:14,699 --> 00:50:19,799
shell-shocked uh yeah meeting somebody

1205
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:22,259
like that so

1206
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:23,818
um but you know Matt can attest that uh

1207
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:24,960
that was sort of the start of Neville's

1208
00:50:23,818 --> 00:50:29,099
bitterness

1209
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:32,639
yeah yeah uh you know uh things Neville

1210
00:50:29,099 --> 00:50:36,240
paid more of a price than most yeah he

1211
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:38,519
did or uh spreading seeds for

1212
00:50:36,239 --> 00:50:39,899
overgrowing the government for that kind

1213
00:50:38,519 --> 00:50:43,259
of thing

1214
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:46,019
um and if you felt like he was owed the

1215
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:48,660
most for doing this and so you know he

1216
00:50:46,019 --> 00:50:51,000
felt like most people lived off the back

1217
00:50:48,659 --> 00:50:53,899
of his work yeah and and it's not

1218
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,900
necessarily incorrect

1219
00:50:54,679 --> 00:50:59,399
yeah he never got

1220
00:50:56,940 --> 00:51:01,760
um he never he never got to reap the

1221
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:05,460
benefits as much

1222
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:07,260
of his work as other people did

1223
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:09,780
um his life got burned down on any

1224
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:11,339
number of different occasions yeah that

1225
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:13,319
should be said you know this is kind of

1226
00:51:11,338 --> 00:51:15,358
a personal part and not

1227
00:51:13,318 --> 00:51:16,679
um not uh

1228
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:18,480
it's not the greatest thing to talk

1229
00:51:16,679 --> 00:51:21,358
about with Neville but he was a heretic

1230
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:25,019
yeah that's actually the reason why he

1231
00:51:21,358 --> 00:51:27,239
went from Australia to Holland was uh

1232
00:51:25,019 --> 00:51:30,599
you know you know he was getting he was

1233
00:51:27,239 --> 00:51:32,459
uh heavily addicted in the early 80s he

1234
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:34,260
was getting treatment

1235
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:36,900
um and so I'm sure

1236
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:39,599
um that some of his life issues were

1237
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:41,280
certainly self-inflicted sure because

1238
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:43,140
when you struggle with addiction like

1239
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,859
that your life is

1240
00:51:43,139 --> 00:51:46,440
um

1241
00:51:43,858 --> 00:51:47,420
I mean your life is tough tell me about

1242
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:51,240
it

1243
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:54,000
you have ups and downs sure uh you have

1244
00:51:51,239 --> 00:51:55,558
issues you know you you probably wasn't

1245
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,920
the easiest person to deal with he

1246
00:51:55,559 --> 00:52:01,079
probably had moods major mood swing sure

1247
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:02,760
change your mood swings you know better

1248
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:04,740
days than others better months than

1249
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:07,559
others type of thing

1250
00:52:04,739 --> 00:52:09,239
um you know and then on top of that like

1251
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:10,619
you know a lot of times really talented

1252
00:52:09,239 --> 00:52:12,118
people

1253
00:52:10,619 --> 00:52:14,300
um sometimes they're pain in the ass

1254
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:16,318
yeah

1255
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:18,599
talented people can be very hard to

1256
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:20,039
communicate with sure

1257
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:22,500
um but what I will say about Neville

1258
00:52:20,039 --> 00:52:25,800
that was different than most people is

1259
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:26,940
that most Dutch which is some which is

1260
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,318
different than a little bit in America

1261
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:31,380
certainly there's lots of people in

1262
00:52:28,318 --> 00:52:32,519
America that are just like this yeah but

1263
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:34,858
um in

1264
00:52:32,519 --> 00:52:37,800
he was probably one of the only Dutch

1265
00:52:34,858 --> 00:52:40,440
that really loved the plant

1266
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:42,180
and really did things as far as the

1267
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:43,679
famous Dutch I'm not like making some

1268
00:52:42,179 --> 00:52:47,039
big general statement about everybody

1269
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:49,199
but of course as far as like the you

1270
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:51,119
know the Dutch are pretty famous for

1271
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:53,578
being extremely business oriented

1272
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:55,800
correct they'll tell you the truth as

1273
00:52:53,579 --> 00:52:57,660
much as it helps their bottom line yeah

1274
00:52:55,800 --> 00:53:00,359
and if it doesn't help their bottom line

1275
00:52:57,659 --> 00:53:02,338
they could give a [ __ ] yeah so Neville

1276
00:53:00,358 --> 00:53:04,558
was extremely open about lines and

1277
00:53:02,338 --> 00:53:06,480
strains and what he used and how he did

1278
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:08,880
it what he did it with and where he got

1279
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:11,699
it from yeah there's nobody in the Dutch

1280
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:13,200
scene that we know more about who he got

1281
00:53:11,699 --> 00:53:15,480
strains from

1282
00:53:13,199 --> 00:53:17,699
and what he did to create strains all

1283
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:20,760
everything yeah a lot of other seed

1284
00:53:17,699 --> 00:53:23,578
banks in Holland it's a mystery they

1285
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:26,160
have zero interest in telling you yeah

1286
00:53:23,579 --> 00:53:27,900
they've had decades to tell you they

1287
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:30,899
don't care yeah there are a few that

1288
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:33,240
might be popping up that that uh are are

1289
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:35,880
pretty interesting that's why I wanted

1290
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:38,759
to make a qualifier because he's by no

1291
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:40,740
means is the only one yeah but there are

1292
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:42,059
plenty of you know and that's the sad

1293
00:53:40,739 --> 00:53:44,399
thing is that

1294
00:53:42,059 --> 00:53:46,619
um you know Ben uh the drunkers are

1295
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:49,260
still alive correct yeah but they're a

1296
00:53:46,619 --> 00:53:51,660
terrible interview yeah and they don't

1297
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:54,000
care about history no that's not their

1298
00:53:51,659 --> 00:53:55,558
interest at all they will tell you to

1299
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,380
this day that they have every original

1300
00:53:55,559 --> 00:53:59,819
plant known to man they lead with all

1301
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:01,440
the same plants they still make their

1302
00:53:59,818 --> 00:54:03,960
own seeds they still make their own

1303
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:05,760
seeds even been verified by any number

1304
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:09,420
of different sources that they Outsource

1305
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:11,880
to Spain sometime yeah yeah and that

1306
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:14,460
they lost a lot of plants

1307
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:16,740
um but you can't get actual history out

1308
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:19,019
of them correct yeah

1309
00:54:16,739 --> 00:54:21,419
they don't care it's hard Neville

1310
00:54:19,019 --> 00:54:23,699
Neville cared while he had the seed bank

1311
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:25,559
he gave a bunch of information he was

1312
00:54:23,699 --> 00:54:29,578
honest about when he lost certain

1313
00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:34,140
strains popped up on Mr Nice a long time

1314
00:54:29,579 --> 00:54:36,780
later in like 09 uh 10 11 era he asked a

1315
00:54:34,139 --> 00:54:39,179
lot of questions pretty directly yeah

1316
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:42,300
um the dronkers and Scentsy are a black

1317
00:54:39,179 --> 00:54:44,699
hole Yeah they don't tell you [ __ ] major

1318
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:47,240
black hole they don't care and I don't

1319
00:54:44,699 --> 00:54:49,259
know that they even know [ __ ] to tell um

1320
00:54:47,239 --> 00:54:51,000
obviously they do and they were part of

1321
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:52,619
but I don't know that they would have

1322
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,539
any kind of knowledge about any of the

1323
00:54:52,619 --> 00:54:57,900
breeding going on at Scentsy

1324
00:54:54,539 --> 00:55:00,358
and so you know this is um so so that's

1325
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:02,519
kind of I guess we kind of segued into

1326
00:55:00,358 --> 00:55:04,799
Scentsy yeah

1327
00:55:02,519 --> 00:55:06,599
so we're headed into Senti we're headed

1328
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:08,460
into Scentsy so Neville you know Neville

1329
00:55:06,599 --> 00:55:10,859
had the seed bank most famous seed bank

1330
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:13,199
created a lot of the most famous strains

1331
00:55:10,858 --> 00:55:15,539
gets busted spends much time in jail

1332
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:18,358
gets bailed out loses his company now

1333
00:55:15,539 --> 00:55:20,159
he's head breeder at something yeah

1334
00:55:18,358 --> 00:55:21,179
um and so it took some time to

1335
00:55:20,159 --> 00:55:23,879
transition

1336
00:55:21,179 --> 00:55:26,039
yeah so Matt and I have spent a bunch of

1337
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:28,920
time analyzing this

1338
00:55:26,039 --> 00:55:30,420
and um

1339
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:33,180
I don't know the best way to put it but

1340
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:38,039
Scentsy there were certain famous things

1341
00:55:33,179 --> 00:55:40,379
like nl5 Haze and uh Super Skunk that

1342
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:42,058
they left alone because the aim already

1343
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:43,619
had such great

1344
00:55:42,059 --> 00:55:46,619
uh

1345
00:55:43,619 --> 00:55:48,300
that's that uh

1346
00:55:46,619 --> 00:55:49,920
it had already been marketed under that

1347
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:51,960
name and was already so successful if

1348
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,400
they didn't have a need to change

1349
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:55,619
there's actually some pretty good

1350
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:57,960
comments happening I'll get to them in a

1351
00:55:55,619 --> 00:55:59,640
minute maybe we can even [ __ ] you can't

1352
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:01,980
see stuff so

1353
00:55:59,639 --> 00:56:04,139
um so anyway well

1354
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:05,699
this is this is super long-winded but it

1355
00:56:04,139 --> 00:56:09,659
is pretty important and the reason why

1356
00:56:05,699 --> 00:56:11,818
it's so important is that the a lot a

1357
00:56:09,659 --> 00:56:13,980
lot a lot of our famous strains and our

1358
00:56:11,818 --> 00:56:15,358
named Elite cuts from the 90s and a lot

1359
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:18,000
of the things that went into the Famous

1360
00:56:15,358 --> 00:56:20,338
Cuts that we all worked with today came

1361
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:23,400
directly from Neville's work yeah

1362
00:56:20,338 --> 00:56:28,318
because he was the biggest game in town

1363
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:30,240
um probably from 1985 to the late 90s he

1364
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:32,219
was the biggest Force

1365
00:56:30,239 --> 00:56:35,519
in cannabis

1366
00:56:32,219 --> 00:56:37,318
and so as a result of that the tons of

1367
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:39,000
people in America were getting in seeds

1368
00:56:37,318 --> 00:56:39,960
and

1369
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,460
um

1370
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:43,380
and

1371
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:44,699
okay so there's there's stuff coming in

1372
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:46,858
that people are saying that's actually

1373
00:56:44,699 --> 00:56:50,818
pretty cool so we'll start chatting

1374
00:56:46,858 --> 00:56:51,960
about that so uh so Scentsy buys the

1375
00:56:50,818 --> 00:56:54,838
seed bank

1376
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:56,220
and they in my opinion they wanted to

1377
00:56:54,838 --> 00:57:00,179
obscure

1378
00:56:56,219 --> 00:57:03,299
exactly how much of the seed bank they

1379
00:57:00,179 --> 00:57:05,940
had taken yeah and they wanted to trade

1380
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:07,019
so like I said super skunk nl5 Haze some

1381
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:09,420
of the stuff that was super famous

1382
00:57:07,019 --> 00:57:11,219
already they left alone

1383
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:14,099
but they were the first company to start

1384
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:16,199
trademarking names in cannabis which

1385
00:57:14,099 --> 00:57:19,318
still goes on today and sucks yeah

1386
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:22,858
there's still battles going on about

1387
00:57:19,318 --> 00:57:24,779
about that and so uh

1388
00:57:22,858 --> 00:57:27,539
uh I see some stuff people are talking

1389
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:29,819
about early Shiva Shanty had garlic bud

1390
00:57:27,539 --> 00:57:31,980
in it anyone remember the early Shiva

1391
00:57:29,818 --> 00:57:34,019
Shanty that threw garlic thinos

1392
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:35,159
uh that type I have one of the catalogs

1393
00:57:34,019 --> 00:57:37,039
it actually talks about that

1394
00:57:35,159 --> 00:57:38,940
specifically that very first catalog

1395
00:57:37,039 --> 00:57:41,039
remember I was just reading it to you

1396
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:44,099
yeah so that's pretty funny in the sense

1397
00:57:41,039 --> 00:57:47,940
that my opinion is is that Shiva Shanti

1398
00:57:44,099 --> 00:57:50,760
is garlic Bud yeah one of them is one of

1399
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:53,099
them at one point was garlic butter

1400
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:55,020
and so I'll try not to get too deep into

1401
00:57:53,099 --> 00:57:57,480
it because it's kind of a it's it's kind

1402
00:57:55,019 --> 00:57:59,699
of a nerdy subject but if you look at

1403
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:01,920
the seed bank catalogs and you look at

1404
00:57:59,699 --> 00:58:02,759
the Scentsy catalogs

1405
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:05,880
um

1406
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:09,420
since he ended up using a lot of

1407
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:12,059
Neville's stock photos yes a lot of his

1408
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:14,818
verbiage and his descriptions

1409
00:58:12,059 --> 00:58:16,500
just much shorter versions of them in

1410
00:58:14,818 --> 00:58:21,960
his catalog

1411
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:25,500
um so uh they she garlic Bud disappears

1412
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:27,300
yes but it becomes Shiva Shanti Shiva

1413
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:29,818
Shanty one and it sounds like a hybrid

1414
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:31,559
of becomes Shiva Shanti too right and so

1415
00:58:29,818 --> 00:58:33,900
they use the same they use a lot of the

1416
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:35,760
same verbiage in describing Shiva Shanti

1417
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:37,980
as Neville's descriptions of garlic bud

1418
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:40,859
and the same picture they use the exact

1419
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:42,599
same photo okay

1420
00:58:40,858 --> 00:58:45,259
um another one that we could talk about

1421
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:49,380
is nl5 skunk one

1422
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:52,020
becomes uh Shiva skunk yep

1423
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:54,480
and that's actually the only one that

1424
00:58:52,019 --> 00:58:56,338
they change the name that in the Scentsy

1425
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:58,980
description they actually say it's

1426
00:58:56,338 --> 00:59:01,078
actually nl5 skunk one yeah but they

1427
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:02,400
still leave that in the description it's

1428
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:04,019
literally in the description they took

1429
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:06,900
it from nl5 skunk one they called it

1430
00:59:04,019 --> 00:59:08,280
Shiva they called it Shiva yeah this is

1431
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:11,298
something that people will probably find

1432
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:11,298
extremely interesting

1433
00:59:11,338 --> 00:59:17,039
um or maybe maybe not but uh Neville's

1434
00:59:15,179 --> 00:59:19,318
nl2 F3

1435
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:21,599
he always referred to going back early

1436
00:59:19,318 --> 00:59:23,759
as the nl2 any description you can find

1437
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:26,280
in the seed bank catalog of any hybrids

1438
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:28,920
he made not only does he call it nl2 but

1439
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:30,900
he always calls it a Hindu Kush type

1440
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:34,139
yeah

1441
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:38,220
so when Northern Lights gets ported over

1442
00:59:34,139 --> 00:59:41,039
from the seed bank Northern Lights

1443
00:59:38,219 --> 00:59:44,039
one F3 be completely Northern Lights

1444
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:45,920
yeah right

1445
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:49,079
um and you can actually tell because

1446
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:51,539
they ins in the Scentsy catalog they

1447
00:59:49,079 --> 00:59:56,818
list Northern Lights as a three-time

1448
00:59:51,539 --> 00:59:59,940
Indica winner yep 88 89 90 and you can

1449
00:59:56,818 --> 01:00:04,159
look it up and nl1 was the Indica winner

1450
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:04,159
in 88 89 90. yep

1451
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:10,260
nl2 becomes Hindu Kush

1452
01:00:08,699 --> 01:00:15,179
yes

1453
01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:15,740
so since he changed the name and

1454
01:00:15,179 --> 01:00:18,598
and

1455
01:00:15,739 --> 01:00:21,959
nl2 use the same picture they use

1456
01:00:18,599 --> 01:00:24,420
similar descriptions you can go back

1457
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:26,720
um even even straight up in certain

1458
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:30,420
stuff like they they sold a skunk cush

1459
01:00:26,719 --> 01:00:33,118
yeah and they called it skunk one by

1460
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:35,460
their best Hindu Kush yeah

1461
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:38,220
Neville sells the skunk Kush at the seed

1462
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:39,358
bank and he calls it nl2 by Skunk one

1463
01:00:38,219 --> 01:00:41,459
yeah

1464
01:00:39,358 --> 01:00:42,838
they call it the same name they have the

1465
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:46,139
same description except for they just

1466
01:00:42,838 --> 01:00:48,539
call it Hindu Kush yeah right so nl2

1467
01:00:46,139 --> 01:00:50,940
doesn't disappear

1468
01:00:48,539 --> 01:00:53,519
it just gets a different name yeah it's

1469
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:57,119
absorbed differently is that there was

1470
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:59,759
another seed company that stole nl2 and

1471
01:00:57,119 --> 01:01:02,640
they sold nl2 it was Dutch Passion and

1472
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:04,140
they saw nl2 under the name Oasis

1473
01:01:02,639 --> 01:01:06,239
and then

1474
01:01:04,139 --> 01:01:09,659
um Adam dumb I think his name is he sold

1475
01:01:06,239 --> 01:01:13,679
one is closet queen that was also in nl2

1476
01:01:09,659 --> 01:01:14,460
purana so nl2 sort of drops off as a

1477
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:16,739
name

1478
01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:20,220
but it lives on in other names and

1479
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:22,979
that's sort of start of uh

1480
01:01:20,219 --> 01:01:26,459
that's sort of the start of

1481
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:28,559
um the rename game yeah this is all the

1482
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:32,220
real early rename game so I'll just read

1483
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:34,440
off some renames he had the renames uh I

1484
01:01:32,219 --> 01:01:36,298
gotta look away at the camera so I can

1485
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:38,700
actually like see this little chart I

1486
01:01:36,298 --> 01:01:40,559
got going on but okay Neville called it

1487
01:01:38,699 --> 01:01:44,338
silver Pearl by Hayes

1488
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:47,460
uh since he calls it silver haze yeah

1489
01:01:44,338 --> 01:01:50,279
um garlic Bud becomes Shiva Shanti

1490
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:52,798
uh like I just said and all one becomes

1491
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:56,099
Northern Lights and L2 becomes Hindu

1492
01:01:52,798 --> 01:01:58,440
Kush big skunk which was Big Bud by

1493
01:01:56,099 --> 01:02:01,680
Skunk one at the scene simply become

1494
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:05,940
Scentsy skunk that's right hash plant by

1495
01:02:01,679 --> 01:02:08,879
nl1 by swazi becomes African queen

1496
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:12,000
that's my other nickname that a lot of

1497
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:14,640
people call me African queen big bud by

1498
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,639
nl1 simply becomes big bud

1499
01:02:14,639 --> 01:02:19,980
Hawaiian Indica by nl1 simply becomes

1500
01:02:17,639 --> 01:02:22,139
Hawaiian Indica yep

1501
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:24,798
um it was really only a few of the most

1502
01:02:22,139 --> 01:02:29,699
famous like skunk one

1503
01:02:24,798 --> 01:02:32,400
uh you know nl5 Haze Super Skunk that uh

1504
01:02:29,699 --> 01:02:34,798
that kept the name yeah they changed

1505
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,900
everything else but they left us Clues

1506
01:02:34,798 --> 01:02:38,818
because they were [ __ ] lazy yeah out

1507
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:41,099
of laziness pure laziness they use the

1508
01:02:38,818 --> 01:02:44,159
same pictures and they use a lot of the

1509
01:02:41,099 --> 01:02:46,680
same verbiage yeah and they even kept

1510
01:02:44,159 --> 01:02:49,318
the same yields and harvest Harvest

1511
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:51,659
times and other data that Neville

1512
01:02:49,318 --> 01:02:53,159
included yeah

1513
01:02:51,659 --> 01:02:55,139
um so they made it

1514
01:02:53,159 --> 01:02:57,539
so they made it uh and then they

1515
01:02:55,139 --> 01:02:59,460
trademarked those things yes

1516
01:02:57,539 --> 01:03:01,500
so then all of a sudden they own the

1517
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:03,480
trademarks yep

1518
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:04,739
right

1519
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:07,318
um

1520
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:10,798
let's see where

1521
01:03:07,318 --> 01:03:11,460
where is a good segue from that

1522
01:03:10,798 --> 01:03:14,579
um

1523
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:16,920
I can't even bring up my notes no fine

1524
01:03:14,579 --> 01:03:19,260
you know you're right so Shiva like I

1525
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:21,780
said Shiva Shanti it is garlic Bud yeah

1526
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:24,000
it uses the same verbiage in the

1527
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:27,720
description it uses the exact same photo

1528
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:29,818
from Neville catalogs it is

1529
01:03:27,719 --> 01:03:31,980
it is the Garlic but I had that pulled

1530
01:03:29,818 --> 01:03:33,298
out earlier just to show too the the

1531
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:35,818
tube side by side but I can't remember

1532
01:03:33,298 --> 01:03:38,519
where I put it it's yeah we don't I mean

1533
01:03:35,818 --> 01:03:40,318
it's it's yeah it's we could we could uh

1534
01:03:38,519 --> 01:03:41,940
we could go we could go in depth I'm

1535
01:03:40,318 --> 01:03:45,298
trying to keep it relatively brief but

1536
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:47,818
the point is is that since he was trying

1537
01:03:45,298 --> 01:03:49,619
to obscure just how much they went from

1538
01:03:47,818 --> 01:03:54,139
a little company that had barely

1539
01:03:49,619 --> 01:03:54,140
anything yeah do the biggest company

1540
01:03:54,179 --> 01:03:58,500
um

1541
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:59,700
the biggest company in Holland and

1542
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:01,440
um

1543
01:03:59,699 --> 01:04:04,199
the timeline we're talking right now

1544
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:07,380
this is 1991. yeah

1545
01:04:04,199 --> 01:04:09,298
uh this is this is early to mid 90s Mr

1546
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:11,099
Nice is I'm just answering a question Mr

1547
01:04:09,298 --> 01:04:14,039
Nice is way way later we probably won't

1548
01:04:11,099 --> 01:04:16,440
even get to that part of cannabis today

1549
01:04:14,039 --> 01:04:18,480
because that didn't start early 2000s

1550
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:20,639
yeah so

1551
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:22,858
Neville's working as the head breeder

1552
01:04:20,639 --> 01:04:25,078
for um

1553
01:04:22,858 --> 01:04:27,420
for Scentsy and we're not going to talk

1554
01:04:25,079 --> 01:04:30,539
about these companies very much but it's

1555
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:33,000
probably good to mention that Neville

1556
01:04:30,539 --> 01:04:35,279
not only spawned Scentsy seeds

1557
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:38,338
but everybody working for Neville

1558
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:39,599
got their own ideas and he spawned a lot

1559
01:04:38,338 --> 01:04:42,659
yeah

1560
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:44,940
so I don't know if uh

1561
01:04:42,659 --> 01:04:47,818
um well yeah somebody just posted Shiva

1562
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:49,858
Shanti as not garlic now uh it was sweet

1563
01:04:47,818 --> 01:04:52,920
we'll get to why things aren't the way

1564
01:04:49,858 --> 01:04:56,338
they are anymore yeah but

1565
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:58,260
Adam Dunn from th seeds

1566
01:04:56,338 --> 01:05:00,019
um uh is that how you pronounce his last

1567
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:05,339
name

1568
01:05:00,019 --> 01:05:08,338
Adam Adam from th seeds uh Simon who is

1569
01:05:05,338 --> 01:05:10,798
famous for serious seeds yeah Tony who

1570
01:05:08,338 --> 01:05:14,039
ended up making sag Martha they all

1571
01:05:10,798 --> 01:05:18,659
worked at Scentsy under Neville

1572
01:05:14,039 --> 01:05:22,019
yeah and they after leaving uh Tony and

1573
01:05:18,659 --> 01:05:24,899
Simon started cerebral seeds in 1994 for

1574
01:05:22,019 --> 01:05:27,659
one year and then split Tony made sag

1575
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:31,019
Martha uh Simon made

1576
01:05:27,659 --> 01:05:35,338
um Sirius and um

1577
01:05:31,019 --> 01:05:38,940
you know and uh uh let's see and Adam

1578
01:05:35,338 --> 01:05:40,980
like I said made THC yeah so

1579
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:43,858
um you know so Neville working with

1580
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:45,920
Neville you know uh Neville sort of put

1581
01:05:43,858 --> 01:05:48,659
all four of those companies on the map

1582
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:50,579
yep those companies would have existed

1583
01:05:48,659 --> 01:05:53,818
if they hadn't been able to work either

1584
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:55,740
for Neville under Neville uh since he

1585
01:05:53,818 --> 01:05:59,338
bought Neville

1586
01:05:55,739 --> 01:06:02,699
um so you know and I think that for most

1587
01:05:59,338 --> 01:06:04,519
of Neville's time it's Scentsy he was

1588
01:06:02,699 --> 01:06:07,558
breeding and doing a bunch of projects

1589
01:06:04,519 --> 01:06:09,719
but uh you look at the catalogs that

1590
01:06:07,559 --> 01:06:12,839
come out from those 90s in those early

1591
01:06:09,719 --> 01:06:15,118
to mid 90s period and

1592
01:06:12,838 --> 01:06:17,039
it's basically the seed bank catalog

1593
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:19,440
yeah

1594
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:21,599
basically you know there was a few

1595
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:23,700
things that Neville got rid of in at the

1596
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:26,700
later era of the seed bank like he

1597
01:06:23,699 --> 01:06:28,858
didn't really like Afghani one yeah he

1598
01:06:26,699 --> 01:06:30,179
sold it for the first few years of the

1599
01:06:28,858 --> 01:06:32,759
seed bank and then he and then he

1600
01:06:30,179 --> 01:06:34,500
eliminated it since he brought it back

1601
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:36,720
um there was a couple other strains that

1602
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:38,338
uh that popped up here and there but for

1603
01:06:36,719 --> 01:06:41,779
the most part

1604
01:06:38,338 --> 01:06:45,779
um Scentsy was the seed bank continued

1605
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:46,798
and uh they they absorbed all of his

1606
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:48,660
history

1607
01:06:46,798 --> 01:06:51,059
you know they started claiming her from

1608
01:06:48,659 --> 01:06:53,759
85 they started oh yeah the originator

1609
01:06:51,059 --> 01:06:55,980
of all these various strains they sort

1610
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:58,440
of like you know since they bought it

1611
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:59,099
they bought all the history too

1612
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,780
um

1613
01:06:59,099 --> 01:07:05,099
and all that

1614
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:06,900
and so Neville was working for some uh

1615
01:07:05,099 --> 01:07:10,039
some Dutch businessmen that he didn't

1616
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:10,039
really like yeah

1617
01:07:10,199 --> 01:07:15,779
that's how it ends up

1618
01:07:13,079 --> 01:07:18,780
yeah so

1619
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:21,000
um so he worked for Scentsy and we can

1620
01:07:18,780 --> 01:07:23,220
since nothing much changed from the seed

1621
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:25,019
bank to Scentsy

1622
01:07:23,219 --> 01:07:27,659
um we don't really have to talk a bunch

1623
01:07:25,019 --> 01:07:31,199
about that except for uh you know I

1624
01:07:27,659 --> 01:07:34,199
started going to Amsterdam in uh 1994.

1625
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:35,818
there's some very famous people on IG

1626
01:07:34,199 --> 01:07:38,639
and stuff that started going in the

1627
01:07:35,818 --> 01:07:40,139
early 90s and mid 90s and stuff and

1628
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:42,358
since he was one of the primary places

1629
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:44,460
where we got things yeah

1630
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:48,358
so you know

1631
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:50,818
um Sensei was really Neville yeah it was

1632
01:07:48,358 --> 01:07:52,259
all his stuff he was their head breeder

1633
01:07:50,818 --> 01:07:56,219
still

1634
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:58,020
um and uh you know and so you know

1635
01:07:56,219 --> 01:08:01,259
Neville from

1636
01:07:58,019 --> 01:08:05,219
you know 85 to 90 at the seed bank and

1637
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:08,819
then from 91 to 95 at Scentsy

1638
01:08:05,219 --> 01:08:12,419
um you know a massive amount of super

1639
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:15,719
skunk and nl5 Haze all the nl5 haze you

1640
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:18,539
know of the Cuban black the pith the

1641
01:08:15,719 --> 01:08:21,899
heights Haze the various the Miami that

1642
01:08:18,539 --> 01:08:24,420
all came from that era yeah of uh you

1643
01:08:21,899 --> 01:08:28,379
know nl5 Haze seed

1644
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:30,420
um and he uh you know they lost the G13

1645
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:32,400
cutting by Neville's own admission and

1646
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:35,759
about 93 was one of the ones that got

1647
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:38,099
sick and died early yeah lost the nl5

1648
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:40,920
haze cutting

1649
01:08:38,100 --> 01:08:43,679
um they're 94.95

1650
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:47,239
it's one of the reasons why all the best

1651
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:53,399
Finos of nl5 hey

1652
01:08:47,238 --> 01:08:57,919
and um and in uh uh America were found

1653
01:08:53,399 --> 01:08:57,920
sort of between 89 and 95. yeah

1654
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:02,939
um and then once the once the mom was

1655
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:05,399
lost people didn't really find the same

1656
01:09:02,939 --> 01:09:07,738
quality I don't think I think all the

1657
01:09:05,399 --> 01:09:10,579
name deletes of nl5 haze of which

1658
01:09:07,738 --> 01:09:13,139
there's probably eight or twelve yeah

1659
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:15,238
they all come from that six year period

1660
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:16,739
yeah

1661
01:09:15,238 --> 01:09:17,818
I don't think there's any that come

1662
01:09:16,738 --> 01:09:19,738
later

1663
01:09:17,819 --> 01:09:21,980
I doubt it and I haven't seen any good

1664
01:09:19,738 --> 01:09:25,619
in on five phase cuttings in a long time

1665
01:09:21,979 --> 01:09:26,218
in that era and so

1666
01:09:25,619 --> 01:09:30,000
um

1667
01:09:26,219 --> 01:09:32,100
you know uh so well maybe we'll tie a

1668
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:35,759
bow on the Scentsy thing because we've

1669
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:38,039
kind of covered most of it yeah by the

1670
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:40,679
uh the last famous thing that never

1671
01:09:38,039 --> 01:09:42,420
Neville did there was he was working on

1672
01:09:40,679 --> 01:09:47,159
this hybrid

1673
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:49,980
um which was nl5 Haze uh or people call

1674
01:09:47,159 --> 01:09:52,139
it C5 now it's still alive he had this

1675
01:09:49,979 --> 01:09:54,419
he had a very famous mother cut that was

1676
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:57,539
sold in all the coffee shops it was one

1677
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:59,279
of the two of his two favorite C5

1678
01:09:57,539 --> 01:10:01,979
cuttings

1679
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:04,319
um and he was trying to play around and

1680
01:10:01,979 --> 01:10:06,959
make a poly hybrid and he was playing

1681
01:10:04,319 --> 01:10:08,460
with Crossing it to skunk Hayes yeah and

1682
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:09,539
he wasn't really happy with where it was

1683
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:13,560
yet

1684
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:15,659
but Ben and Alan dronkers being uh uh

1685
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:18,420
businessmen they had spent a bunch of

1686
01:10:15,659 --> 01:10:21,179
money and they were sponsoring the 95

1687
01:10:18,420 --> 01:10:23,219
Cannabis Cup and the Cannabis Cup was

1688
01:10:21,179 --> 01:10:26,460
all about Jack herrer and it was all

1689
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:29,399
about his life and his history and his

1690
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:32,520
contributions to cannabis and so Ben

1691
01:10:29,399 --> 01:10:36,000
went to Neville and said hey

1692
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:38,100
we want to release a Jack Herer yep I

1693
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,380
have something that we drop at the

1694
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:43,699
Cannabis Cup wouldn't that be a great

1695
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:46,380
marketing tool yeah he's the number one

1696
01:10:43,698 --> 01:10:49,139
sponsor of this cup we're spending a

1697
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:51,060
bunch of money it's all about Jack how

1698
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:53,699
about we release [ __ ]

1699
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:56,219
yeah so what ready

1700
01:10:53,698 --> 01:11:01,198
um as far as Neville was concerned but

1701
01:10:56,219 --> 01:11:03,840
he released nl5 Haze by Skunk Haze and

1702
01:11:01,198 --> 01:11:05,219
they called it Jack Herer yeah I doubt

1703
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:09,900
we need to spend very much time talking

1704
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:13,760
about Jack herrer uh because it's

1705
01:11:09,899 --> 01:11:18,839
super fast yeah it's Jack Jack

1706
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:21,000
it led to Cindy 99 you know it led to a

1707
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:23,460
whole bunch it was big yielding it was

1708
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:27,719
fast it was chunky it was a tremor's

1709
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:33,179
dream uh it was it smelled like uh

1710
01:11:27,719 --> 01:11:36,420
terpenoline uh it's people have a a love

1711
01:11:33,179 --> 01:11:40,020
and hate a lot of people have dislike

1712
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:43,380
for that Aroma the Jack Aroma became

1713
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:45,420
Infamous for uh

1714
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:47,819
you know being something that repelled

1715
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:49,920
people yep you know

1716
01:11:47,819 --> 01:11:51,779
and stuff like Jack Terps and someone

1717
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:53,880
was saying yep Jack Terps Jack yeah

1718
01:11:51,779 --> 01:11:55,679
people not genuinely know what genuinely

1719
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:57,779
speaking know what uh or generally

1720
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:59,819
speaking no what Jack Terps are I I

1721
01:11:57,779 --> 01:12:01,800
think the first time that people ever

1722
01:11:59,819 --> 01:12:04,079
heard about the word terpenoline long

1723
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:07,380
before that terp was identified yeah

1724
01:12:04,079 --> 01:12:10,559
called it Jack Terps yep Jack Terps Jack

1725
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:13,140
Jack was a super high yielding uh you

1726
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:15,179
know strain a lot of people grew it and

1727
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:17,699
that was People's First experience with

1728
01:12:15,179 --> 01:12:22,619
extremes terpenoline

1729
01:12:17,698 --> 01:12:25,139
um and it it bred dominant very Matt can

1730
01:12:22,619 --> 01:12:27,359
talk about trying to get interesting

1731
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:30,780
phenos out of terpenoline dominant

1732
01:12:27,359 --> 01:12:33,479
strains that don't give you terpenoline

1733
01:12:30,779 --> 01:12:35,099
it's pretty tough it is very tough to to

1734
01:12:33,479 --> 01:12:37,678
breed with serpentaling anything and try

1735
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:40,860
to infuse that into your life Jack Terps

1736
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:43,079
train wreck derps a lot of breeders have

1737
01:12:40,859 --> 01:12:45,000
have thrown their hat in the ring and

1738
01:12:43,079 --> 01:12:48,300
tried to breed with the lot because it's

1739
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:52,500
such a vigorous powerful high-yielding

1740
01:12:48,300 --> 01:12:54,420
fun plant yeah and it's real hard to

1741
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:57,539
find a not terpenaline dominant Fino

1742
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:59,399
that works I think um in in modern times

1743
01:12:57,539 --> 01:13:00,779
though people are finding out that

1744
01:12:59,399 --> 01:13:03,238
terpinoline is actually really good in

1745
01:13:00,779 --> 01:13:04,319
extracts it makes them very flavorful so

1746
01:13:03,238 --> 01:13:07,019
there's been a little bit of a

1747
01:13:04,319 --> 01:13:08,460
Renaissance for the terpenolene Queens

1748
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:09,659
out there

1749
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:11,039
so maybe

1750
01:13:09,658 --> 01:13:13,619
um maybe since you can't see anything

1751
01:13:11,039 --> 01:13:15,600
maybe we'll pause you want to answer

1752
01:13:13,619 --> 01:13:17,698
some questions yeah you go ahead and

1753
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:19,800
figure out what uh questions we need to

1754
01:13:17,698 --> 01:13:21,599
answer and let's do it so the number one

1755
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:23,760
voted thing and we talked about it a

1756
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:26,940
little was why was Sam's never able to

1757
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:28,860
produce a haze to rival Nevels what was

1758
01:13:26,939 --> 01:13:31,678
the outstanding difference

1759
01:13:28,859 --> 01:13:34,979
that's the number one biggest question

1760
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:36,239
yeah I think I think you you you've uh

1761
01:13:34,979 --> 01:13:38,698
answered this before when I was talking

1762
01:13:36,238 --> 01:13:40,439
with you about it so go ahead

1763
01:13:38,698 --> 01:13:42,119
um I actually think I mentioned it

1764
01:13:40,439 --> 01:13:43,979
mostly a little earlier in the program

1765
01:13:42,119 --> 01:13:45,000
but

1766
01:13:43,979 --> 01:13:48,599
um

1767
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:51,960
we don't know why Sam you know Sam sold

1768
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:54,539
Haze to positronics if you bought haze

1769
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:57,658
from The Flying Dutchman that was Sam's

1770
01:13:54,539 --> 01:14:01,260
Haze he sold the clothes of wholesale

1771
01:13:57,658 --> 01:14:02,939
seed to any number of brokers in Holland

1772
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:05,640
and then they sold it through their seed

1773
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:08,219
banks and for whatever reason

1774
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:09,900
uh everybody in Holland wanted Neville's

1775
01:14:08,219 --> 01:14:12,539
Haze hybrids

1776
01:14:09,899 --> 01:14:15,359
and nobody found anything that rivaled

1777
01:14:12,539 --> 01:14:19,439
what Neville was able to find

1778
01:14:15,359 --> 01:14:22,920
um you know and a lot of times uh Caleb

1779
01:14:19,439 --> 01:14:24,479
uh CSI myself Matt others we always talk

1780
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:28,560
about like the proof is in the plants

1781
01:14:24,479 --> 01:14:30,119
yeah you know people lie plants don't uh

1782
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:33,480
and for whatever reason maybe it was

1783
01:14:30,119 --> 01:14:35,939
sheer luck uh maybe it was Neville's

1784
01:14:33,479 --> 01:14:39,619
story is true and he did get an earlier

1785
01:14:35,939 --> 01:14:41,819
Haze than than Sam produced later maybe

1786
01:14:39,619 --> 01:14:44,279
has been open

1787
01:14:41,819 --> 01:14:45,059
which is something that I found

1788
01:14:44,279 --> 01:14:49,920
um

1789
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:51,659
which is I found uh uh

1790
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:57,539
hard to believe to be honest as a

1791
01:14:51,658 --> 01:14:59,879
breeder is he loves Haze and uh he never

1792
01:14:57,539 --> 01:15:02,158
ever made any selections

1793
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:04,560
and he just he just said all I did was

1794
01:15:02,158 --> 01:15:08,099
open pollinate it to keep it as wide as

1795
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:10,920
possible for 30 years yeah he didn't do

1796
01:15:08,100 --> 01:15:14,940
any selection work any Line work on it I

1797
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:17,640
as a as a breeder never ever playing

1798
01:15:14,939 --> 01:15:19,979
around with your favorite phenos from

1799
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:23,940
your favorite line

1800
01:15:19,979 --> 01:15:25,919
seems really unusual to me yeah yeah it

1801
01:15:23,939 --> 01:15:26,939
is uh it's like me never [ __ ] with

1802
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:29,279
blueberry

1803
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:32,399
you know yeah but but that's what Sam

1804
01:15:29,279 --> 01:15:33,539
says yeah and it's also possible so we

1805
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:35,879
could talk about this for a second

1806
01:15:33,539 --> 01:15:38,698
sometimes when you open pollinate that's

1807
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:40,380
great because you open it up wider but

1808
01:15:38,698 --> 01:15:43,139
that means it might be a hell of a lot

1809
01:15:40,380 --> 01:15:46,199
more effort to take more effort stuff

1810
01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:48,360
that you want and so and by repeatedly

1811
01:15:46,198 --> 01:15:50,219
open pollinating it and never making any

1812
01:15:48,359 --> 01:15:52,319
selections

1813
01:15:50,219 --> 01:15:56,520
um he might have open pollinated his way

1814
01:15:52,319 --> 01:15:58,439
into jungle weed or hemp or he might

1815
01:15:56,520 --> 01:16:00,179
have lost a bunch of the quality that

1816
01:15:58,439 --> 01:16:00,960
led people to love Hazel in the first

1817
01:16:00,179 --> 01:16:03,000
place

1818
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:04,079
well you look at um like Tom Hill's

1819
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,579
Hayes

1820
01:16:04,079 --> 01:16:08,158
um he would even say you need at least

1821
01:16:05,579 --> 01:16:12,000
10 packs you know 100 seeds to find a

1822
01:16:08,158 --> 01:16:13,859
single keeper so the the the repeatedly

1823
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,479
oping probably didn't help anything

1824
01:16:13,859 --> 01:16:17,819
because obviously there's so many

1825
01:16:15,479 --> 01:16:19,259
phenotypes even in positronics Haze

1826
01:16:17,819 --> 01:16:20,698
that's been worked there's so many

1827
01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:23,280
phenotypes that you need to pop a

1828
01:16:20,698 --> 01:16:25,379
hundred to find a single one yeah I mean

1829
01:16:23,279 --> 01:16:27,119
Sam has claimed that everyone got the

1830
01:16:25,380 --> 01:16:30,060
exact same Haze and no one got any

1831
01:16:27,119 --> 01:16:32,039
different yeah I find that a bit hard to

1832
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:33,840
believe because there's lots of people

1833
01:16:32,039 --> 01:16:35,640
that bought Flying Dutchman Haze there's

1834
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:37,560
lots of people that bought posi Haze

1835
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:41,699
there's tons of people that bought uh

1836
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:44,840
Tom Hill Hayes uh Hayes has been sold

1837
01:16:41,698 --> 01:16:46,619
for decades in a wide variety of places

1838
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:49,319
and

1839
01:16:46,619 --> 01:16:52,859
all the elites that people hoard

1840
01:16:49,319 --> 01:16:55,500
come from Neville's stuff yeah

1841
01:16:52,859 --> 01:16:56,939
for whatever reason yeah and you would

1842
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:58,920
think that we have a lot of quality

1843
01:16:56,939 --> 01:17:01,559
Afghans out there and you'd be able to

1844
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:04,199
cross some pure Haze to some other good

1845
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:05,940
Afghans and get all the results to

1846
01:17:04,198 --> 01:17:09,779
Neville

1847
01:17:05,939 --> 01:17:11,698
um but the G13 Haze and the nl5 haze and

1848
01:17:09,779 --> 01:17:14,819
so on and so forth no one's been able to

1849
01:17:11,698 --> 01:17:18,059
replicate yep those ones are better and

1850
01:17:14,819 --> 01:17:20,039
they did also have the theory that he

1851
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:22,500
talked about much later on that he only

1852
01:17:20,039 --> 01:17:24,539
believed in breeding with Haze males

1853
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:26,640
that that was the key to finding the the

1854
01:17:24,539 --> 01:17:28,619
the Holy Grail Haze was through Hayes

1855
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:29,699
males breeding and not using them as

1856
01:17:28,619 --> 01:17:31,619
females

1857
01:17:29,698 --> 01:17:34,619
you know some of that might be that he

1858
01:17:31,619 --> 01:17:36,719
lost the two best phenos of females in

1859
01:17:34,619 --> 01:17:38,279
the 80s

1860
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:41,579
that's what he ended up doing I would

1861
01:17:38,279 --> 01:17:45,119
also say too that collecting pollen from

1862
01:17:41,579 --> 01:17:47,819
some 18 or 20 week Haze mail and then

1863
01:17:45,119 --> 01:17:51,059
dusting it on other plants when

1864
01:17:47,819 --> 01:17:54,420
appropriate is probably a lot easier of

1865
01:17:51,060 --> 01:17:57,300
a breeder uh aspect than trying to wait

1866
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:59,460
for a 18 or 20 week female to be the

1867
01:17:57,300 --> 01:18:01,260
appropriate time to pollinate it that's

1868
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:02,880
a good point so there's something to be

1869
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:05,460
said for the fact that you could collect

1870
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:07,679
a bunch of pollen and then dump it on

1871
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:09,658
stuff later and it's probably much

1872
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:12,359
harder to breed with the girls

1873
01:18:09,658 --> 01:18:15,000
yeah so

1874
01:18:12,359 --> 01:18:16,859
um there's another question Mean Gene

1875
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,300
recently mentioned that you and he have

1876
01:18:16,859 --> 01:18:20,158
been doing some research and it looked

1877
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:22,860
like we do Kush could most likely be a

1878
01:18:20,158 --> 01:18:26,099
renamed NL I think we chatted about that

1879
01:18:22,859 --> 01:18:28,319
already at length yep I I definitely

1880
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:30,600
believe that the Hindu Kush that was

1881
01:18:28,319 --> 01:18:32,219
sold at Scentsy is just nl2

1882
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:33,000
yeah

1883
01:18:32,219 --> 01:18:36,619
um

1884
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:41,219
have I had any dealings with Gypsy nope

1885
01:18:36,619 --> 01:18:43,439
I'm not I almost did and um and it was

1886
01:18:41,219 --> 01:18:46,500
just a really bad proposal for me to

1887
01:18:43,439 --> 01:18:49,738
front a bunch of seeds he said that he

1888
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:51,238
would sit on the money for I want to say

1889
01:18:49,738 --> 01:18:53,879
six months to a year

1890
01:18:51,238 --> 01:18:57,539
at which point he would pay you out

1891
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:59,760
mostly in credit store credit

1892
01:18:57,539 --> 01:19:01,619
so you would wait like almost a year to

1893
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:03,600
be able to use anything from anything it

1894
01:19:01,619 --> 01:19:05,819
was stupid it was no way in [ __ ] hell

1895
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:10,079
well we'll have podcasts that deal with

1896
01:19:05,819 --> 01:19:11,759
gypsy's era of seas at some other time

1897
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:13,380
maybe not necessarily a ton of him

1898
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:15,360
specifically but he's from a different

1899
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:16,380
era than we're discussing today sure

1900
01:19:15,359 --> 01:19:17,819
sure

1901
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:19,560
um outside of the work that Neville

1902
01:19:17,819 --> 01:19:21,840
brought to the world who outside the

1903
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:23,460
original big names contributed most new

1904
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:24,840
strains worth something to the culture

1905
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:26,939
early on

1906
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:30,179
that's a pretty good question see yeah

1907
01:19:26,939 --> 01:19:32,219
it is I've mentioned some of it before

1908
01:19:30,179 --> 01:19:35,699
um I'll just associate some names with

1909
01:19:32,219 --> 01:19:39,719
strains uh Sam Skunk Man brought uh

1910
01:19:35,698 --> 01:19:42,479
Hayes and skunk one to Europe uh which

1911
01:19:39,719 --> 01:19:44,779
were popularized it to people uh Jim

1912
01:19:42,479 --> 01:19:48,779
Ortega who's a very mysterious character

1913
01:19:44,779 --> 01:19:51,840
brought Hawaiian Indica garlic Bud uh

1914
01:19:48,779 --> 01:19:54,238
Maple Leaf indica and kush for King

1915
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:56,400
Neville those are all used extensively

1916
01:19:54,238 --> 01:19:58,139
in projects and so became very famous

1917
01:19:56,399 --> 01:20:01,379
building blocks

1918
01:19:58,140 --> 01:20:05,340
uh Mel Frank uh who's still quite well

1919
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:07,319
known he contributed The Afghani one and

1920
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:09,000
the Durbin poison

1921
01:20:07,319 --> 01:20:13,198
two things

1922
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:14,698
uh I don't know if Jorge Cervantes uh

1923
01:20:13,198 --> 01:20:17,279
I don't think he directly contributed

1924
01:20:14,698 --> 01:20:20,099
anything but he did make the links he he

1925
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:21,960
certainly connected Neville

1926
01:20:20,100 --> 01:20:24,600
um uh growers in Oregon and Washington

1927
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:26,039
that led to the hash plant and G13 which

1928
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:28,679
obviously entered into the pretty

1929
01:20:26,039 --> 01:20:31,340
legendary status

1930
01:20:28,679 --> 01:20:33,658
um Rob Clark who wrote marijuana botany

1931
01:20:31,340 --> 01:20:36,060
uh hashish and some other really

1932
01:20:33,658 --> 01:20:37,198
important cannabis books he contributed

1933
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:39,780
a bunch of

1934
01:20:37,198 --> 01:20:41,759
um you know California Orange

1935
01:20:39,779 --> 01:20:44,219
um various Mexicans various sativa

1936
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:47,159
crosses uh he certainly brought Early

1937
01:20:44,219 --> 01:20:49,980
Girl early Pearl yeah that type of stuff

1938
01:20:47,158 --> 01:20:50,698
that's all credited to him

1939
01:20:49,979 --> 01:20:53,459
um

1940
01:20:50,698 --> 01:20:55,738
I'm trying to think of

1941
01:20:53,460 --> 01:20:57,000
you know that's sort of those that those

1942
01:20:55,738 --> 01:20:58,379
names right there are sort of the

1943
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:00,300
backbone

1944
01:20:58,380 --> 01:21:03,659
and the NL guys yeah

1945
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:05,480
the Seattle Greg certainly yeah NL and

1946
01:21:03,658 --> 01:21:08,519
the NL group from the Pacific Northwest

1947
01:21:05,479 --> 01:21:10,799
they contributed obviously all the NL

1948
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:12,239
lines and so

1949
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:14,460
um there's a number of people we don't

1950
01:21:12,238 --> 01:21:16,859
know who they are but those guys are

1951
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:19,020
sort of the foundational

1952
01:21:16,859 --> 01:21:21,299
um people that brought a lot of stuff

1953
01:21:19,020 --> 01:21:23,100
that ended up not only getting brought

1954
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:26,880
over there but ended up getting used a

1955
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:28,020
lot yeah into a lot and Don Downs for

1956
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:31,140
nl2

1957
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:32,880
specifically I believe that was his yeah

1958
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:36,300
yeah I mean there was a guy named Herbie

1959
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:38,159
that contributed the nl5

1960
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:40,619
um you know I'm sure behind all these

1961
01:21:38,158 --> 01:21:41,819
famous names are just like a lot of

1962
01:21:40,619 --> 01:21:44,640
things there's probably a group of

1963
01:21:41,819 --> 01:21:46,139
people uh or good friends and stuff that

1964
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:49,500
contributed various things that their

1965
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:50,340
names have been lost to time yeah you

1966
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:53,279
know

1967
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:57,179
if I've not so dog and Matt Could Turn

1968
01:21:53,279 --> 01:22:00,179
Back Time what hack would you buy

1969
01:21:57,179 --> 01:22:00,179
well

1970
01:22:00,238 --> 01:22:04,439
you know uh

1971
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:05,219
I would buy everything from the seed

1972
01:22:04,439 --> 01:22:06,960
bank

1973
01:22:05,219 --> 01:22:09,480
everything literally everything you

1974
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:11,039
could I would buy hundreds of seeds of

1975
01:22:09,479 --> 01:22:13,379
everything that I could all the Durban

1976
01:22:11,039 --> 01:22:16,319
all the skunk one and all the nl5 haze

1977
01:22:13,380 --> 01:22:19,079
the app the maple leaf mix

1978
01:22:16,319 --> 01:22:20,819
um a lot of these things we talk about

1979
01:22:19,079 --> 01:22:22,500
um but you know Neville was one of the

1980
01:22:20,819 --> 01:22:25,380
few people that got to run through

1981
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:27,800
hundreds or thousands of even of these

1982
01:22:25,380 --> 01:22:31,920
seeds and really see what was in there

1983
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:33,659
we talk about the famous phenos but

1984
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:36,719
um you know

1985
01:22:33,658 --> 01:22:39,839
uh we were really young when these

1986
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:42,359
things were out there I was like six

1987
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:44,400
something I'm a little older than you

1988
01:22:42,359 --> 01:22:47,399
but even still like I said I was I was

1989
01:22:44,399 --> 01:22:49,619
only 18 in 1994 when I started going so

1990
01:22:47,399 --> 01:22:52,379
I was even sort of catching the tail end

1991
01:22:49,619 --> 01:22:54,899
of certain things yeah

1992
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:57,600
let's see there the next question was

1993
01:22:54,899 --> 01:22:59,658
Afghan T what's known about it the

1994
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:01,980
strains it was used in

1995
01:22:59,658 --> 01:23:04,920
geographically what part of Afghanistan

1996
01:23:01,979 --> 01:23:06,839
did it come from via who et cetera Etc

1997
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:09,060
so we don't know where it came I'm gonna

1998
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:10,500
preface this I'm gonna preface this all

1999
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:12,840
these people

2000
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:14,760
all these people talking about roadkill

2001
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:16,800
skunk and all the other stuff I

2002
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:19,159
sincerely believe and and just from the

2003
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:22,800
work with uh even the heirloom Afghani

2004
01:23:19,158 --> 01:23:24,899
the uh later sours the [ __ ] super

2005
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:26,100
skunk and jesel all that I sincerely

2006
01:23:24,899 --> 01:23:27,658
believe that's the direction to learn

2007
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:30,060
and all these people chasing different

2008
01:23:27,658 --> 01:23:31,979
directions I think it's fair to to put

2009
01:23:30,060 --> 01:23:33,239
it out there so everybody's on it even

2010
01:23:31,979 --> 01:23:34,619
playing field that's probably the

2011
01:23:33,238 --> 01:23:35,879
direction I'd look

2012
01:23:34,619 --> 01:23:36,539
so

2013
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:39,600
um

2014
01:23:36,539 --> 01:23:41,760
you know uh the maple leaf we don't we

2015
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:43,679
don't know anything about Jim Ortega we

2016
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:45,320
don't know where any of the strains that

2017
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:48,480
he got came from

2018
01:23:45,319 --> 01:23:51,420
hero documented anything about he's

2019
01:23:48,479 --> 01:23:52,738
still alive yeah so it's possible that

2020
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:55,619
he could

2021
01:23:52,738 --> 01:23:58,259
um come out and tell some stuff but it

2022
01:23:55,619 --> 01:24:00,779
is a mystery we know we'd love to have

2023
01:23:58,260 --> 01:24:02,940
them on we know we know the story of his

2024
01:24:00,779 --> 01:24:05,698
work basically as soon as he started

2025
01:24:02,939 --> 01:24:09,539
trading the Neville yeah that's when he

2026
01:24:05,698 --> 01:24:10,979
pops up and you know the

2027
01:24:09,539 --> 01:24:13,560
um we can talk a little bit about the

2028
01:24:10,979 --> 01:24:15,599
maple leaf so the maple leaf Nevels

2029
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:17,280
talked about extensively

2030
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:19,020
uh when he first started growing it out

2031
01:24:17,279 --> 01:24:20,939
he started getting some sweet big bud

2032
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:23,580
types

2033
01:24:20,939 --> 01:24:25,500
um and then he started growing more of

2034
01:24:23,579 --> 01:24:29,279
it out and then he found some more like

2035
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:32,760
hash plant types some dark hashy thick

2036
01:24:29,279 --> 01:24:34,920
types he called those types Ortega uh

2037
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:36,119
and then he started growing more out and

2038
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:38,760
then he eventually found what he

2039
01:24:36,119 --> 01:24:41,340
considered two skunk archetypes which he

2040
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:42,840
called Afghan T and Afghan s and and

2041
01:24:41,340 --> 01:24:44,400
it's important again because when most

2042
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:46,260
people hear skunk they think skunk one

2043
01:24:44,399 --> 01:24:48,779
he wasn't referring to skunk one types

2044
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:50,340
in this Afghani no he was just kind of a

2045
01:24:48,779 --> 01:24:51,840
little bit of the structure a little bit

2046
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:54,119
of the nose a little bit of the look

2047
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:57,600
that type of thing and what he said

2048
01:24:54,119 --> 01:25:00,658
about it is that so obviously the the

2049
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:02,520
maple leaf was kind of a a hodgepodge of

2050
01:25:00,658 --> 01:25:04,859
different phenos that popped out of

2051
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:07,080
Indica but what he found is if you took

2052
01:25:04,859 --> 01:25:09,238
a big bud type and you bred with it the

2053
01:25:07,079 --> 01:25:12,119
maple leaf big bud type bread big bud

2054
01:25:09,238 --> 01:25:14,399
like yeah you took an Ortega type the

2055
01:25:12,119 --> 01:25:16,019
hash plant type and you bred with it it

2056
01:25:14,399 --> 01:25:17,759
sort of ended up being hash plant so

2057
01:25:16,020 --> 01:25:20,640
they kind of bread true to type yeah

2058
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:24,000
when they popped up if you bred with the

2059
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:27,179
Afghan tea or Afghan s it also bleeded

2060
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:30,719
true so the t is pretty famous

2061
01:25:27,179 --> 01:25:33,319
uh in the sense that it is the mom of

2062
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:33,319
super skunk

2063
01:25:34,198 --> 01:25:38,158
uh he claims it's what put the funk in

2064
01:25:36,899 --> 01:25:40,259
super skunk

2065
01:25:38,158 --> 01:25:43,198
it's what Crossing it back to it's

2066
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:46,739
asking you know to an Afghan the Afghan

2067
01:25:43,198 --> 01:25:48,658
T brought out the the rank yeah it took

2068
01:25:46,738 --> 01:25:52,019
uh it took a kind of a sweet floral

2069
01:25:48,658 --> 01:25:56,638
skunk and made it reek yeah

2070
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:58,560
and so uh Afghan T is incredibly famous

2071
01:25:56,639 --> 01:25:59,699
um but it's the probably the least

2072
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:01,620
well-known thing we're going to talk

2073
01:25:59,698 --> 01:26:03,839
about tonight as well as being

2074
01:26:01,619 --> 01:26:05,819
incredibly famous it's the least well

2075
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:08,600
known but it's the mother of one of the

2076
01:26:05,819 --> 01:26:11,158
most famous strains out there

2077
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:12,539
the reason why that stream was so hunted

2078
01:26:11,158 --> 01:26:14,638
nowadays

2079
01:26:12,539 --> 01:26:16,920
yeah Super Skunk is probably one of the

2080
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:17,719
most well-known cannabis strains in the

2081
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:21,420
world

2082
01:26:17,719 --> 01:26:22,198
uh and he says that that's what made it

2083
01:26:21,420 --> 01:26:25,500
super

2084
01:26:22,198 --> 01:26:27,719
yep reading to Afghan T

2085
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:30,359
um Afghan tea also crossed well with

2086
01:26:27,719 --> 01:26:32,819
Haze and there's a thing called Afghan

2087
01:26:30,359 --> 01:26:35,658
Haze

2088
01:26:32,819 --> 01:26:35,658
um Mr Knight

2089
01:26:35,819 --> 01:26:41,698
um

2090
01:26:36,779 --> 01:26:45,619
and uh that's supposed to be a uh uh a

2091
01:26:41,698 --> 01:26:48,539
half a maple leaf by AC

2092
01:26:45,619 --> 01:26:51,119
hard to verify obviously if that's the

2093
01:26:48,539 --> 01:26:53,760
case but uh we have documentation from

2094
01:26:51,119 --> 01:26:57,539
Neville that made super Stunt and it

2095
01:26:53,760 --> 01:27:00,780
crossed great with hazy yeah

2096
01:26:57,539 --> 01:27:02,579
um so that's kind of that

2097
01:27:00,779 --> 01:27:04,920
um there's some other stuff

2098
01:27:02,579 --> 01:27:06,479
that I just answered the Jim Ortega

2099
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:08,100
question on a different one there's some

2100
01:27:06,479 --> 01:27:11,819
Mendo perp stuff

2101
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:14,699
I don't know if it's pretty wide ranging

2102
01:27:11,819 --> 01:27:17,519
um we discussed garlic Bud pretty good

2103
01:27:14,698 --> 01:27:19,919
we discussed Hindu Kush the Friesland

2104
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:22,739
and Scentsy star and stuff like that

2105
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:25,139
we'll get to on a different episode uh

2106
01:27:22,738 --> 01:27:27,059
we'll certainly talk about those a

2107
01:27:25,139 --> 01:27:28,079
little bit more

2108
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:31,260
um

2109
01:27:28,079 --> 01:27:34,800
you know uh where they like to have been

2110
01:27:31,260 --> 01:27:38,100
coming from the Seattle Greg's group uh

2111
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:41,460
all that was there a Scentsy nl5 line in

2112
01:27:38,100 --> 01:27:45,780
89 there was not no uh That Never Was A

2113
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:48,179
Sensei didn't have nl5 because in 89 the

2114
01:27:45,779 --> 01:27:51,000
seed bank was still owned by Neville

2115
01:27:48,179 --> 01:27:53,460
uh and there was never a Pure nl5 Line

2116
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:57,060
offered as far as I know and there also

2117
01:27:53,460 --> 01:27:58,079
was never a 1988 Scentsy seeds G13 hash

2118
01:27:57,060 --> 01:28:01,380
plant

2119
01:27:58,079 --> 01:28:05,039
no uh do you can use the melvanics

2120

garlic Fino of nl5 I'll let Matt take

2121
01:28:05,039 --> 01:28:10,920
that one if you want to just answered it

2122
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:12,719
okay so no on that

2123
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:15,840
um do we know if Neville's kids have

2124
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:17,520
knowledge on his father's work yeah his

2125
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:19,380
son has some knowledge of it and I know

2126
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:21,840
his son and Neville's sister are

2127
01:28:19,380 --> 01:28:25,859
currently doing something

2128
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:28,020
any info on what cush4 is

2129
01:28:25,859 --> 01:28:30,439
um not really

2130
01:28:28,020 --> 01:28:33,239
uh like I said Jim Ortega's still alive

2131
01:28:30,439 --> 01:28:36,059
he could maybe one day expound upon that

2132
01:28:33,238 --> 01:28:38,158
if he likes yeah a lot of rumor about it

2133
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:41,159
there's rumor that the Clone might exist

2134
01:28:38,158 --> 01:28:43,920
there's rumor that the Clone is uh is

2135
01:28:41,158 --> 01:28:47,219
not it and it's uh it's ignite pure kush

2136
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:51,179
it's a cure a pure kush variant yeah a

2137
01:28:47,219 --> 01:28:52,859
Bubba yeah nl2 type area RJ on that

2138
01:28:51,179 --> 01:28:53,779
level

2139
01:28:52,859 --> 01:28:56,639
um

2140
01:28:53,779 --> 01:28:58,399
I got this guy said I got to try a maple

2141
01:28:56,639 --> 01:29:00,900
leaf from an old timer in Georgia

2142
01:28:58,399 --> 01:29:04,219
unbelievable flavor almost like Dr

2143
01:29:00,899 --> 01:29:04,219
Pepper means Roadkill

2144
01:29:04,279 --> 01:29:10,019
that sounds good yeah that sounds

2145
01:29:08,399 --> 01:29:12,299
delicious

2146
01:29:10,020 --> 01:29:14,580
um when did the silver Pearl that pip

2147
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:17,639
Works come out

2148
01:29:14,579 --> 01:29:19,800
um I think we talked here earlier the

2149
01:29:17,639 --> 01:29:23,579
silver Pearl started being offered by

2150
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:26,360
Neville at the seed bank around 88.89 uh

2151
01:29:23,579 --> 01:29:28,738
it was offered 88 89.90

2152
01:29:26,359 --> 01:29:31,380
it was one of the strains that got

2153
01:29:28,738 --> 01:29:34,198
offered at Scentsy later on as well

2154
01:29:31,380 --> 01:29:35,100
so it popped up

2155
01:29:34,198 --> 01:29:38,099
um

2156
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:40,679
is Steve Hagar just as guilty as Sam the

2157
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:42,900
skunk man as AKA Dave Watson from

2158
01:29:40,679 --> 01:29:45,658
operation green Merchant who's Steve

2159
01:29:42,899 --> 01:29:48,000
Hagar he's the uh guy he's the one of

2160
01:29:45,658 --> 01:29:51,719
the the big head honchos oh hi friends

2161
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:54,119
yeah that's a whole subject could be a

2162
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:56,158
whole podcast in itself so to speak with

2163
01:29:54,119 --> 01:29:57,960
all the rumors and accusations and

2164
01:29:56,158 --> 01:29:59,219
there's a lot of people that believe one

2165
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:01,020
way there's a lot of people that believe

2166
01:29:59,219 --> 01:30:04,920
another way

2167
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:06,659
um that's a pretty in-depth one yeah as

2168
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:08,039
far as Sam goes a lot of people do say

2169
01:30:06,658 --> 01:30:10,138
that there is something to do with

2170
01:30:08,039 --> 01:30:12,060
Federal informants and stuff I've looked

2171
01:30:10,139 --> 01:30:14,460
up extensively I've never seen a damn

2172
01:30:12,060 --> 01:30:16,260
thing come to life for any proof of any

2173
01:30:14,460 --> 01:30:18,060
of that but I will say Neville told me

2174
01:30:16,260 --> 01:30:20,579
specifically that he said yes everybody

2175
01:30:18,060 --> 01:30:22,620
knew Sam and everybody knew his DEA

2176
01:30:20,579 --> 01:30:24,719
Handler that walked around with them but

2177
01:30:22,619 --> 01:30:26,399
Neville also

2178
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:27,960
during that time Neville was telling me

2179
01:30:26,399 --> 01:30:29,879
that him and Sam were [ __ ] making

2180
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:32,340
video games back and forth at each other

2181
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:35,279
so I don't know how uh reliable that

2182
01:30:32,340 --> 01:30:38,279
information is yeah uh Sam and Neville

2183
01:30:35,279 --> 01:30:43,259
had famous beef coming from Neville's

2184
01:30:38,279 --> 01:30:44,639
bust those Kung Fu dub over video memes

2185
01:30:43,260 --> 01:30:47,760
that they would send back and forth at

2186
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:49,380
each other in 2009 2010 they were I wish

2187
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:51,800
someone still had them they were [ __ ]

2188
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:51,800
hilarious

2189
01:30:52,139 --> 01:30:57,900
um so uh you know there was um

2190
01:30:55,679 --> 01:30:59,279
there was a

2191
01:30:57,899 --> 01:31:02,158
uh yeah

2192
01:30:59,279 --> 01:31:04,319
um so there's a friend of ours that

2193
01:31:02,158 --> 01:31:06,238
mentioned black domino we can touch on

2194
01:31:04,319 --> 01:31:10,439
that real quick sure

2195
01:31:06,238 --> 01:31:13,019
um so black domino was something that

2196
01:31:10,439 --> 01:31:15,359
you know in in Neville's Neville's seed

2197
01:31:13,020 --> 01:31:17,280
bank era the vast majority of the stuff

2198
01:31:15,359 --> 01:31:19,619
that we were talking about in the 80s

2199
01:31:17,279 --> 01:31:21,658
and and this is kind of this is kind of

2200
01:31:19,619 --> 01:31:24,539
the same with the supersedeva seed Club

2201
01:31:21,658 --> 01:31:27,599
is they were basically all F ones or

2202
01:31:24,539 --> 01:31:28,920
very simple hybrids yeah uh that's kind

2203
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:31,500
of what they were doing they were they

2204
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:33,600
were crossing pure strains together they

2205
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:35,520
were releasing lines of pure strains

2206
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:37,380
they had gotten and they were taking

2207
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:40,139
these pure strains like skunk and

2208
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:42,000
Northern Lights or Haze and skunk or you

2209
01:31:40,139 --> 01:31:44,219
know and Northern Lights and Haze and

2210
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:47,279
they were crossing them yeah in the 90s

2211
01:31:44,219 --> 01:31:47,939
uh but the poly hybrid terms started to

2212
01:31:47,279 --> 01:31:49,859
pop

2213
01:31:47,939 --> 01:31:53,819
where you started getting more complex

2214
01:31:49,859 --> 01:31:56,639
breeding coming in so black domino was a

2215
01:31:53,819 --> 01:31:58,799
cross of four indicas

2216
01:31:56,639 --> 01:32:01,260
uh that Neville that they released that

2217
01:31:58,800 --> 01:32:03,300
Neville bred while he was at Scentsy and

2218
01:32:01,260 --> 01:32:07,199
the mother was consistent the mother was

2219
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:08,960
a one of his favorite cuts it was uh nl1

2220
01:32:07,198 --> 01:32:11,819
by hash plant

2221
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:14,760
by nl1 to say it correctly actually

2222
01:32:11,819 --> 01:32:15,899
because uh the no one was the dad that

2223
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:19,500
was the mom

2224
01:32:15,899 --> 01:32:22,920
and released three versions of it

2225
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:24,719
um depending on the year and one of the

2226
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:25,619
dads was

2227
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:29,399
um

2228
01:32:25,619 --> 01:32:32,340
I believe Afghani won by nl2

2229
01:32:29,399 --> 01:32:35,099
there was another dad that was uh

2230
01:32:32,340 --> 01:32:37,319
Afghani won by Ortega which is maple

2231
01:32:35,100 --> 01:32:39,420
leaf and there was the third and final

2232
01:32:37,319 --> 01:32:41,099
dad which I believe was the vast

2233
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:44,219
majority of the seeds but it's kind of

2234
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:45,840
hard to say people wanted uh with all

2235
01:32:44,219 --> 01:32:48,658
these pure indicas being crossed

2236
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:52,079
together people wanted a larger yielding

2237
01:32:48,658 --> 01:32:58,219
thing and so he crossed that hash plant

2238
01:32:52,079 --> 01:32:58,219
by nl1 to a garlic Bud by nl2

2239
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:03,780
um so black domino

2240
01:33:00,539 --> 01:33:07,198
uh had three versions yeah many forms

2241
01:33:03,779 --> 01:33:10,259
yeah three forms uh mom was always the

2242
01:33:07,198 --> 01:33:12,960
same uh dad varied as they played around

2243
01:33:10,260 --> 01:33:14,460
with what to do yeah it was just a

2244
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:17,760
really good name so they just [ __ ]

2245
01:33:14,460 --> 01:33:20,698
went with it yeah it's a great name I I

2246
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:24,179
will say that um of all my trips to

2247
01:33:20,698 --> 01:33:27,419
Europe uh I lost it sadly but a black

2248
01:33:24,179 --> 01:33:31,260
Dominic uh Fino I found was one of the

2249
01:33:27,420 --> 01:33:34,199
best things I ever got uh out of Europe

2250
01:33:31,260 --> 01:33:36,780
um I had a great great variety of it it

2251
01:33:34,198 --> 01:33:40,859
tasted peppery it was extremely Frosty

2252
01:33:36,779 --> 01:33:43,738
yielded pretty nicely uh it was dark uh

2253
01:33:40,859 --> 01:33:46,920
dark Afghan not too leafy really fast

2254
01:33:43,738 --> 01:33:48,539
too it was pretty fast yeah it was a

2255
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:51,840
great cut I wish I still had it it's one

2256
01:33:48,539 --> 01:33:53,100
of my like super regrets uh we have some

2257
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:56,819
good friends

2258
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:58,739
um that there was a rare 12-week Fino

2259
01:33:56,819 --> 01:34:01,259
um that was likely a recessive garlic

2260
01:33:58,738 --> 01:34:04,079
Bud type uh that people really like they

2261
01:34:01,260 --> 01:34:07,980
called the lady Fino uh there was a lot

2262
01:34:04,079 --> 01:34:10,800
of good black domino black dump popped

2263
01:34:07,979 --> 01:34:14,059
um it was probably one of the best later

2264
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:17,159
things that Neville did yeah

2265
01:34:14,060 --> 01:34:19,920
uh and uh so

2266
01:34:17,158 --> 01:34:21,539
I don't know we can um

2267
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:22,739
so we've probably been talking for a

2268
01:34:21,539 --> 01:34:25,500
long time I don't know how long it's

2269
01:34:22,738 --> 01:34:28,138
been going but we'll we'll hour and a

2270
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:30,779
half we'll tie it off with

2271
01:34:28,139 --> 01:34:33,960
um we'll tie off Neville at least with

2272
01:34:30,779 --> 01:34:36,179
sort of um the last phase of what he did

2273
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:38,760
and why that's important maybe and then

2274
01:34:36,179 --> 01:34:40,500
we'll call it good uh we didn't get to

2275
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:42,780
everybody's questions it'll be hard to

2276
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:45,840
get to everybody's questions but some of

2277
01:34:42,779 --> 01:34:48,119
your questions might lead to more uh you

2278
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:50,039
know more podcasts in the future we

2279
01:34:48,119 --> 01:34:52,738
might dive into some of these things in

01:35:30,359 --> 01:35:35,339
times yields flavor effects pros and

2302
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:38,219
cons of the different chem Cuts chemd

2303
01:35:35,340 --> 01:35:41,279
chem 91 chem CIS chem 4. uh we'll do a

2304
01:35:38,219 --> 01:35:43,920
chem Dog episode I won't touch that one

2305
01:35:41,279 --> 01:35:46,319
tonight uh we have a long history with

2306
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:48,119
chem uh I got blessed and I got to be

2307
01:35:46,319 --> 01:35:51,719
one of the earlier people that got a

2308
01:35:48,119 --> 01:35:54,658
hold of the chem 91. I've had the chem D

2309
01:35:51,719 --> 01:35:56,158
since 06. I've had the chem 4 for a long

2310
01:35:54,658 --> 01:35:58,799
time I have a lot of experience with

2311
01:35:56,158 --> 01:36:02,339
them we could do a long talk about that

2312
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:04,920
I promise you you'll hear more about the

2313
01:36:02,340 --> 01:36:07,800
chem the most political episode we will

2314
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:09,600
ever do probably of that one I mean

2315
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:11,940
there's there's other ones I think that

2316
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:13,620
could cost him fire but yeah but we will

2317
01:36:11,939 --> 01:36:16,138
I promise you we will we will talk

2318
01:36:13,619 --> 01:36:17,939
extensively about chem uh we'll be

2319
01:36:16,139 --> 01:36:19,859
popping out these episodes pretty often

2320
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:23,039
so uh you'll hear about it in the future

2321
01:36:19,859 --> 01:36:25,380
sure so to tie off the Neville bit after

2322
01:36:23,039 --> 01:36:28,738
answering questions is

2323
01:36:25,380 --> 01:36:31,500
Neville was ticked off about uh working

2324
01:36:28,738 --> 01:36:36,079
under Ben and Allen dronkers he wasn't

2325
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:39,479
into it uh anymore and so he left in

2326
01:36:36,079 --> 01:36:43,439
95-96. and he partnered with a younger

2327
01:36:39,479 --> 01:36:46,259
cat named Shanti uh Shanti Baba we won't

2328
01:36:43,439 --> 01:36:50,000
talk about him extensively but he came

2329
01:36:46,260 --> 01:36:54,000
to Europe in the early 90s and he

2330
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:57,619
popularized White Widow a great white

2331
01:36:54,000 --> 01:37:00,658
shark White Rhino things of that nature

2332
01:36:57,619 --> 01:37:03,479
he was also from Australia he's a bit

2333
01:37:00,658 --> 01:37:06,299
younger than Shanti he sort of

2334
01:37:03,479 --> 01:37:10,439
um and so when Neville left

2335
01:37:06,300 --> 01:37:13,260
Scentsy uh Shanti Neville and this

2336
01:37:10,439 --> 01:37:16,319
gentleman named Arjun partnered at the

2337
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:18,000
greenhouse uh coffee shop which should

2338
01:37:16,319 --> 01:37:20,639
be pretty familiar to everybody that has

2339
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:23,219
even a rudimentary knowledge of that

2340
01:37:20,639 --> 01:37:27,359
um usually the first seeds everyone buys

2341
01:37:23,219 --> 01:37:30,300
post 2005 yeah they they they had a very

2342
01:37:27,359 --> 01:37:33,299
successful seed bank and they had a very

2343
01:37:30,300 --> 01:37:34,800
successful series of coffee shops in

2344
01:37:33,300 --> 01:37:38,460
Holland

2345
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:40,619
um I went to a bunch yeah and so

2346
01:37:38,460 --> 01:37:42,960
um basically at that point in Neville's

2347
01:37:40,619 --> 01:37:44,579
career he wasn't as interested in

2348
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:46,319
breeding with a bunch of Afghans and

2349
01:37:44,579 --> 01:37:48,479
stuff anymore but he was really

2350
01:37:46,319 --> 01:37:50,158
interested in is continuing his Haze

2351
01:37:48,479 --> 01:37:53,099
work because that's that's what

2352
01:37:50,158 --> 01:37:56,279
interested him so like I said earlier

2353
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:58,260
about the jack herrer

2354
01:37:56,279 --> 01:38:00,779
um Neville didn't consider that line

2355
01:37:58,260 --> 01:38:03,000
finished he just released it under

2356
01:38:00,779 --> 01:38:05,279
pressure from Ben and Alan dronkers to

2357
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:06,300
coincide with the seat with the uh the

2358
01:38:05,279 --> 01:38:09,359
Cannabis Cup

2359
01:38:06,300 --> 01:38:11,880
so after he left Scentsy him and Shanti

2360
01:38:09,359 --> 01:38:13,979
partnered together and they started

2361
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:17,340
taking they already knew what strains

2362
01:38:13,979 --> 01:38:19,399
they had they had two nl5 hazes one of

2363
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:21,539
them was caught one of them we call C5

2364
01:38:19,399 --> 01:38:23,158
which has been spreading around a little

2365
01:38:21,539 --> 01:38:24,899
bit in America now and there's some

2366
01:38:23,158 --> 01:38:26,939
people that are selling seed hybrids of

2367
01:38:24,899 --> 01:38:29,519
it and stuff it's finally popped out on

2368
01:38:26,939 --> 01:38:33,238
our side of the of the world and another

2369
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:37,080
one was called the the 122 or the mango

2370
01:38:33,238 --> 01:38:40,439
right and they were trying to work out a

2371
01:38:37,079 --> 01:38:43,019
poly hybrid using skunk Haze that would

2372
01:38:40,439 --> 01:38:45,178
reflect the qualities of both so they

2373
01:38:43,020 --> 01:38:46,920
were parallel brief and basically what

2374
01:38:45,179 --> 01:38:49,260
they were doing is old school breeding

2375
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:51,179
that's a huge pain in the ass in which

2376
01:38:49,260 --> 01:38:53,039
they were taking different skunk cases

2377
01:38:51,179 --> 01:38:54,480
and they were crossing it to these

2378
01:38:53,039 --> 01:38:56,698
things and they were growing out the

2379
01:38:54,479 --> 01:38:58,979
kids and seeing if the dad threw the

2380
01:38:56,698 --> 01:39:01,079
traits they wanted yeah

2381
01:38:58,979 --> 01:39:03,658
so uh most people don't do that anymore

2382
01:39:01,079 --> 01:39:06,840
as Matt gonna test it that's a super

2383
01:39:03,658 --> 01:39:09,299
time consuming pain in the ass the

2384
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:10,920
market doesn't let you have a strain in

2385
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:12,600
six years later release it you know what

2386
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:14,699
I mean like you can't do it it doesn't

2387
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:15,960
it doesn't work in today's world but

2388
01:39:14,698 --> 01:39:17,819
they

2389
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:20,520
he had been working on that for a number

2390
01:39:17,819 --> 01:39:23,158
of years he kept working on it and

2391
01:39:20,520 --> 01:39:25,500
eventually they found a skunk Haze dad

2392
01:39:23,158 --> 01:39:27,960
that meet their criteria Neville

2393
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:30,479
preferred the line that you see five is

2394
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:33,779
the mom and that line became known as

2395
01:39:30,479 --> 01:39:36,059
super silver haze uh won three cups in

2396
01:39:33,779 --> 01:39:39,779
the late 90s probably everybody knows

2397
01:39:36,060 --> 01:39:43,199
about it it's very famous yeah jonty

2398
01:39:39,779 --> 01:39:46,979
preferred the skunk Hayes dad crossed to

2399
01:39:43,198 --> 01:39:49,799
the 122 or the mango my preference that

2400
01:39:46,979 --> 01:39:51,959
one got named the mango Haze that's also

2401
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:55,380
my preference I would actually the the

2402
01:39:51,960 --> 01:39:58,980
122 is sadly not in America yet it is

2403
01:39:55,380 --> 01:40:01,139
the nicest nl5 Haze i've smoked yeah I'd

2404
01:39:58,979 --> 01:40:05,099
love to smoke that my personal favorite

2405
01:40:01,139 --> 01:40:06,539
out of the a5s the c5s whatever not that

2406
01:40:05,100 --> 01:40:08,579
I'm an expert on all of them or anything

2407
01:40:06,539 --> 01:40:10,380
but I have in coffee shops and getting

2408
01:40:08,579 --> 01:40:12,719
to know people over there smoked most of

2409
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:15,840
it that one's amazing

2410
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:18,658
bit and I wish I had it uh mango Haze is

2411
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:20,520
dang but it lives and you can buy it

2412
01:40:18,658 --> 01:40:24,479
from Shanti still

2413
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:27,300
um as the 122. he it's it's 122 by Skunk

2414
01:40:24,479 --> 01:40:29,879
Hayes it's called mango Haze and then he

2415
01:40:27,300 --> 01:40:32,940
also released something that was the

2416
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:35,159
start of his holy grail project His Holy

2417
01:40:32,939 --> 01:40:38,099
Grail project was trying to recapture

2418
01:40:35,158 --> 01:40:41,579
the magic of haze in an actual line and

2419
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:43,380
not F1 uh Neville talked extensively

2420
01:40:41,579 --> 01:40:46,500
about how he didn't like most of the

2421
01:40:43,380 --> 01:40:49,020
poly hybrid hazes nearly as much as the

2422
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:52,139
f1s yeah so he was trying to figure out

2423
01:40:49,020 --> 01:40:54,139
a way to do that and so what he did is

2424
01:40:52,139 --> 01:40:57,359
he took A5

2425
01:40:54,139 --> 01:40:59,760
A52 which is on the cover I don't know

2426
01:40:57,359 --> 01:41:02,099
if Matt wants to show it but the A52 is

2427
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:03,719
on the cover of the seed bank 89 and 90

2428
01:41:02,100 --> 01:41:07,139
catalog both

2429
01:41:03,719 --> 01:41:10,859
he took the A52 this ugly beast

2430
01:41:07,139 --> 01:41:13,260
he took the A5 to that one and he

2431
01:41:10,859 --> 01:41:16,259
crossed it to Haze C

2432
01:41:13,260 --> 01:41:19,860
and which is the famous dad that was

2433
01:41:16,260 --> 01:41:21,480
used in almost all the releases so

2434
01:41:19,859 --> 01:41:23,698
um that was the first time that the a

2435
01:41:21,479 --> 01:41:26,819
dad and the C dad was crossed in the

2436
01:41:23,698 --> 01:41:29,279
same line so it was 75 percent Haze and

2437
01:41:26,819 --> 01:41:32,519
25 percent Northern Lights and they

2438
01:41:29,279 --> 01:41:34,559
initially crossed it just to be a

2439
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:36,960
personal breeding project as their Haze

2440
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:39,139
Grail but they found so much killer

2441
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:41,760
stuff in it they decided to release it

2442
01:41:39,139 --> 01:41:45,060
Neville's Haze

2443
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:48,420
there is still a cut of that first find

2444
01:41:45,060 --> 01:41:49,320
in Holland it is the strongest sativa I

2445
01:41:48,420 --> 01:41:52,560
know of

2446
01:41:49,319 --> 01:41:55,340
it's almost like a

2447
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:55,340
uh

2448
01:41:55,500 --> 01:42:00,118
maybe the best way to put it is all

2449
01:41:57,658 --> 01:42:02,759
those old school stories of psychedelic

2450
01:42:00,118 --> 01:42:05,399
trippy hold on to your seats sativas

2451
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:07,440
that make you see tracers in the corner

2452
01:42:05,399 --> 01:42:10,138
of your vision and making like

2453
01:42:07,439 --> 01:42:12,419
something's talking to you

2454
01:42:10,139 --> 01:42:15,239
um I kind of believe that was [ __ ]

2455
01:42:12,420 --> 01:42:16,920
and then I smoked Neville's Haze uh that

2456
01:42:15,238 --> 01:42:18,899
Fino that they found that became famous

2457
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:20,880
and it literally felt like the top of my

2458
01:42:18,899 --> 01:42:23,939
head blew off

2459
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:27,239
I'm dead serious I shared a joint I did

2460
01:42:23,939 --> 01:42:30,839
I I at that point I had I had the chem

2461
01:42:27,238 --> 01:42:34,439
91 I had Super Skunk I had a whole bunch

2462
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:36,360
of pretty potent nice quality stuff I

2463
01:42:34,439 --> 01:42:39,118
felt like the stuff we had in America

2464
01:42:36,359 --> 01:42:41,759
was mostly Superior to what Europe had

2465
01:42:39,118 --> 01:42:43,559
to offer I went over there I met a

2466
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:46,440
gentleman uh who used to work with

2467
01:42:43,560 --> 01:42:48,420
Neville became friends I smoked a small

2468
01:42:46,439 --> 01:42:50,039
joint with two friends of the Neville's

2469
01:42:48,420 --> 01:42:51,779
Haze

2470
01:42:50,039 --> 01:42:53,939
and

2471
01:42:51,779 --> 01:42:56,519
it blew my head off I mean it literally

2472
01:42:53,939 --> 01:42:59,039
felt like like air was rushing over the

2473
01:42:56,520 --> 01:43:01,679
top of my skull yeah I remember holding

2474
01:42:59,039 --> 01:43:03,899
on to the railing as I walked down the

2475
01:43:01,679 --> 01:43:06,539
steps of the dude's house

2476
01:43:03,899 --> 01:43:11,219
I remember feeling anxious

2477
01:43:06,539 --> 01:43:12,779
stoned Trace rushing uh definitely

2478
01:43:11,219 --> 01:43:15,420
feelings that I'm not used to in

2479
01:43:12,779 --> 01:43:17,639
cannabis yeah and so at that point I

2480
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:21,300
realized that some of those old sativa

2481
01:43:17,639 --> 01:43:24,239
stories had the were true that some

2482
01:43:21,300 --> 01:43:27,480
people did get a psychedelic energetic

2483
01:43:24,238 --> 01:43:29,759
almost disassociative type of potent

2484
01:43:27,479 --> 01:43:31,738
feeling I don't care how useful you are

2485
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:34,260
to smoking whatever Afghans you're used

2486
01:43:31,738 --> 01:43:36,299
to yeah have a tolerance to Neville's

2487
01:43:34,260 --> 01:43:38,039
Haze and you smoke some you'll probably

2488
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:40,440
get knocked off your feet

2489
01:43:38,039 --> 01:43:41,760
you know there is a person in the U.S

2490
01:43:40,439 --> 01:43:43,859
and and me and this guy don't

2491
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:45,960
necessarily get along the bass now but

2492
01:43:43,859 --> 01:43:47,579
um in all reality the best novels Hayes

2493
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:49,859
I've ever smoked has come from snow high

2494
01:43:47,579 --> 01:43:51,118
he had an amazing selection of it and I

2495
01:43:49,859 --> 01:43:54,299
think he used it in some breeding work

2496
01:43:51,118 --> 01:43:57,299
but it was uh every spice you could

2497
01:43:54,300 --> 01:43:59,820
imagine in a kitchen cabinet all in one

2498
01:43:57,300 --> 01:44:01,739
and it was just it was just so Speedy it

2499
01:43:59,819 --> 01:44:04,139
was crazy [ __ ] it was really good though

2500
01:44:01,738 --> 01:44:07,079
it was unique I don't recommend this but

2501
01:44:04,139 --> 01:44:09,840
if you smoke too much Neville's Haze

2502
01:44:07,079 --> 01:44:14,118
it feels kind of like psychedelic

2503
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:16,619
cocaine oh let's just go do it it feels

2504
01:44:14,118 --> 01:44:19,139
I mean but some people some people feel

2505
01:44:16,618 --> 01:44:21,960
like uncomfortable yeah out of your skin

2506
01:44:19,139 --> 01:44:23,520
yeah in a corner

2507
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:25,679
um you know I get that from afghanis

2508
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:28,380
which is really weird a lot of them oh

2509
01:44:25,679 --> 01:44:30,480
it really it really uh it really has a

2510
01:44:28,380 --> 01:44:31,380
strange feeling

2511
01:44:30,479 --> 01:44:33,419
um

2512
01:44:31,380 --> 01:44:35,159
I looked for that Fino and Neville's

2513
01:44:33,420 --> 01:44:37,020
Haze I bought quite a bit of seeds I

2514
01:44:35,158 --> 01:44:39,658
never found it

2515
01:44:37,020 --> 01:44:41,400
um luckily that Fino still exists it's

2516
01:44:39,658 --> 01:44:43,920
still sold in coffee shops over there

2517
01:44:41,399 --> 01:44:45,839
there's still people that hold it and on

2518
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:49,980
that side of the pond

2519
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:51,960
um yeah panic attacks uh it it was uh

2520
01:44:49,979 --> 01:44:53,459
certain people don't like it yeah I

2521
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:56,520
[ __ ] hate roller coaster weed that

2522
01:44:53,460 --> 01:44:58,859
[ __ ] don't but it is

2523
01:44:56,520 --> 01:45:01,440
it's it's very tasty it's extremely

2524
01:44:58,859 --> 01:45:04,738
potent it hits you extremely differently

2525
01:45:01,439 --> 01:45:06,839
than most things and it certainly was

2526
01:45:04,738 --> 01:45:08,218
factual and I'm like okay some of these

2527
01:45:06,840 --> 01:45:09,960
people that are making these stories

2528
01:45:08,219 --> 01:45:12,600
about ties and Colombians and how it

2529
01:45:09,960 --> 01:45:15,239
made them feel a long time ago

2530
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:19,500
um are true yeah because that that that

2531
01:45:15,238 --> 01:45:22,618
cut has it in Spades yeah uh it's 75

2532
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:25,079
Haze 25 Northern Lights it's the first

2533
01:45:22,618 --> 01:45:28,799
thing that crosses both Haze dads A and

2534
01:45:25,079 --> 01:45:31,439
C in the same line it's nuts uh I've

2535
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:33,000
been it's one of my white rabbits uh

2536
01:45:31,439 --> 01:45:36,118
I've been searching for it since the

2537
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:38,880
late 90s I know where it exists I

2538
01:45:36,118 --> 01:45:40,799
haven't gotten it yet I hope I get it

2539
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:42,179
hopefully after this we'll have I don't

2540
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:44,340
know nine or ten companies making

2541
01:45:42,179 --> 01:45:46,139
crosses with it from the US

2542
01:45:44,340 --> 01:45:48,000
yeah I mean now that we've mentioned it

2543
01:45:46,139 --> 01:45:49,560
everybody's gonna have it all sudden so

2544
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:52,859
here's the quick right is that thing

2545
01:45:49,560 --> 01:45:55,560
takes like 16 weeks yeah so it's a super

2546
01:45:52,859 --> 01:45:57,960
long Runner but it literally yields like

2547
01:45:55,560 --> 01:46:00,360
three and a half pounds of light

2548
01:45:57,960 --> 01:46:01,920
yeah that's insane so even if even if

2549
01:46:00,359 --> 01:46:04,139
you even if you were to take that 16

2550
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:06,000
weeks and turn it into eight weeks

2551
01:46:04,139 --> 01:46:08,579
basically like growing an eight week

2552
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:10,920
pound and a half a light strain yeah but

2553
01:46:08,579 --> 01:46:11,639
it takes twice as long yeah

2554
01:46:10,920 --> 01:46:15,319
um

2555
01:46:11,639 --> 01:46:18,239
you know I I saw I saw a room in Holland

2556
01:46:15,319 --> 01:46:20,880
uh I'll tell this story uh before it

2557
01:46:18,238 --> 01:46:23,039
gets too late but sure I walked into a

2558
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:26,699
room I saw a room in Holland that was

2559
01:46:23,039 --> 01:46:28,079
all uh nl5 Haze and Neville's Hayes and

2560
01:46:26,698 --> 01:46:30,000
it was one of the craziest things I've

2561
01:46:28,079 --> 01:46:32,399
ever seen they were growing on a slanted

2562
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:35,399
floor with drains they were growing in

2563
01:46:32,399 --> 01:46:37,379
Rockwell croutons yeah rock wool is very

2564
01:46:35,399 --> 01:46:39,359
popular in Europe yeah um they were

2565
01:46:37,380 --> 01:46:43,199
growing in one gallon pots

2566
01:46:39,359 --> 01:46:45,539
there was thick thick stems growing out

2567
01:46:43,198 --> 01:46:48,779
of these one gallon pots they were they

2568
01:46:45,539 --> 01:46:51,539
were on constant drip slow drip right

2569
01:46:48,779 --> 01:46:54,238
draining out onto the floor and these

2570
01:46:51,539 --> 01:46:57,779
stems went trimmed up about six I'm six

2571
01:46:54,238 --> 01:46:59,579
foot three they went up over my head The

2572
01:46:57,779 --> 01:47:00,738
netting was about six and a half feet

2573
01:46:59,579 --> 01:47:03,118
tall

2574
01:47:00,738 --> 01:47:06,059
three feet from about six and a half

2575
01:47:03,118 --> 01:47:09,299
feet to about nine or ten feet there was

2576
01:47:06,060 --> 01:47:12,900
a mass Jungle of buds everywhere and

2577
01:47:09,300 --> 01:47:14,880
then 600s all over the place yeah it was

2578
01:47:12,899 --> 01:47:17,399
one of the more unusual Grow rooms I've

2579
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:19,260
ever seen was it all like vertical bulbs

2580
01:47:17,399 --> 01:47:21,658
hanging in there no they were just way

2581
01:47:19,260 --> 01:47:23,219
up high oh okay got you but it's like so

2582
01:47:21,658 --> 01:47:25,799
you look at the ground and there's these

2583
01:47:23,219 --> 01:47:29,039
tiny little one gallons of Rockwell

2584
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:30,600
croutons with these big thick stems

2585
01:47:29,039 --> 01:47:32,579
coming out of the base that went up

2586
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:35,880
thicker than me and then right above my

2587
01:47:32,579 --> 01:47:39,479
head it just branched into crazy sativa

2588
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:41,639
arms at my bed everywhere and after they

2589
01:47:39,479 --> 01:47:42,479
threw it for the coffee shops

2590
01:47:41,639 --> 01:47:44,039
um

2591
01:47:42,479 --> 01:47:46,500
so

2592
01:47:44,039 --> 01:47:47,880
that these last two episodes we

2593
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:50,698
basically sort of walked you through

2594
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:53,300
Neville's main breeding era which was 85

2595
01:47:50,698 --> 01:47:56,039
to 97 98

2596
01:47:53,300 --> 01:47:57,960
that super silver haze won three

2597
01:47:56,039 --> 01:48:02,158
cannabis cups in a row

2598
01:47:57,960 --> 01:48:05,100
uh 97 98 99 most people have heard of

2599
01:48:02,158 --> 01:48:08,279
Neville's Haze Super Silver Haze mango

2600
01:48:05,100 --> 01:48:09,900
Haze and sort of the last major breeding

2601
01:48:08,279 --> 01:48:12,118
that Neville not that Neville stopped

2602
01:48:09,899 --> 01:48:14,579
breeding but he did some much smaller

2603
01:48:12,118 --> 01:48:15,960
projects and some collabs more with

2604
01:48:14,579 --> 01:48:17,698
other people

2605
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:19,560
um it was a bit more about that than I

2606
01:48:17,698 --> 01:48:21,379
do but

2607
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:23,580
um you know Neville probably had a

2608
01:48:21,380 --> 01:48:27,800
17-year run

2609
01:48:23,579 --> 01:48:27,800
yeah it's a good run in this industry

2610
01:48:28,039 --> 01:48:34,079
cannabis yeah it went through the seed

2611
01:48:31,319 --> 01:48:36,840
bank it went through Scentsy it went

2612
01:48:34,079 --> 01:48:38,100
through the greenhouse uh you know he

2613
01:48:36,840 --> 01:48:40,560
sold a bunch of we were not going to

2614
01:48:38,100 --> 01:48:42,179
talk about that uh this episode but he

2615
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:44,760
sold a bunch of his stuff and gave a

2616
01:48:42,179 --> 01:48:46,800
bunch of his cuts to Shanti and then it

2617
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:48,659
continued at Mr Nice seeds in

2618
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:50,940
Switzerland

2619
01:48:48,658 --> 01:48:52,618
um and so that's kind of Neville's as

2620
01:48:50,939 --> 01:48:55,379
far as his breeding work that's kind of

2621
01:48:52,618 --> 01:48:57,000
his Arc yeah for lack of a better way to

2622
01:48:55,380 --> 01:49:00,539
put it

2623
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:01,819
um and uh you know I don't know that's

2624
01:49:00,539 --> 01:49:06,060
probably

2625
01:49:01,819 --> 01:49:08,399
close to a good stopping point yeah um

2626
01:49:06,060 --> 01:49:09,840

01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:04,380
unless you sign up for it so that's uh

2655
01:50:01,738 --> 01:50:05,519
that's the housekeeping details I think

2656
01:50:04,380 --> 01:50:07,139
um I mean the other thing we could say

2657
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:10,260
is we say this every time we have a

2658
01:50:07,139 --> 01:50:11,760
Discord server that's breeder Syndicate

2659
01:50:10,260 --> 01:50:14,940
um you can ask Matt and I questions

2660

2663
01:50:20,639 --> 01:50:25,618
subject requires an hour and a half or

2664
01:50:23,579 --> 01:50:27,359
something like that to discuss

2665
