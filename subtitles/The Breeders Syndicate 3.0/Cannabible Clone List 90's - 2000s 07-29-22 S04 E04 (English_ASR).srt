4
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:16,800
scene through the eyes of the folks who

5
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:18,320

welcome to the underground

10
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,959
yeah i mean i can say in a general sense

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,960
i just went on a

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,239
mission looking for pockets of old

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,079
things

14
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:39,519
yeah and you found some pockets of old

15
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,799
things i did yeah i did yeah so

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,559
you know and that's it's kind of

17
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,479
interesting too because it's like one of

18
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:46,079
the one of the things about

19
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:47,599
about weed that i find really

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,920
interesting and we'll talk about this as

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,679
part of like the clone thing tonight

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,800
is that how

23
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:57,280
like brokers and the demand from the

24
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:59,839
public dramatically changes what people

25
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,239
grow yeah right so

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,680
in california or oregon or washington or

27
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,158
these places that are like really sort

28
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:08,560
of like in tune or can't sort of came

29
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,600
about with medical or legal earlier

30
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,118
there was a lot more rapid change in um

31
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:15,199
and what people grew

32
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:18,079
because of what people demanded

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,478
yeah and so in some cases now

34
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,759
um you know you have to go and look for

35
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:23,679
some of these i don't want to call them

36
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,079
backward states because that's rude but

37
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,520
like yeah states that were slower to

38
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,359
adopt

39
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:31,920
uh you know some of this stuff which

40
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:34,478
meant that people could grow things that

41
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,478
were a lot older and they still worked

42
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:37,679
really well for the crew that they were

43
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:39,039
giving them to

44
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,439
yeah because there was a lot of

45
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,118
competition with the new new as it were

46
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:45,919
there wasn't there wasn't pressure to

47
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:47,438
change yeah um and really you know that

48
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,000
it kind of ties into what we're talking

49
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:51,839
about tonight because pressure to change

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,399
and a desire to make your life easy and

51
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,000
give the broker what they want um is

52
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,399
what kind of makes uh old cuts disappear

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,840
yeah you know that is it and that's what

54
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,439
we're seeing today and we've talked

55
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,759
about the last few episodes i mean if

56
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:08,159
you would have told me 10 years ago

57
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,399
that uh sour real sour diesel could be

58
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:11,359
kind of hard to acquire depending

59
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,439
yeah

60
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,400
no one would believe it yeah i'm

61
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:18,639
actually shocked that lately today uh

62
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,360
people keep telling me that the forum

63
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:23,919
cut of cookies is becoming hard to

64
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,760
source which blows my mind yeah i mean

65
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:27,519
it's one of those things where you know

66
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:30,000
i've mentioned this before but

67
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,959
um every five or ten years weed

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,639
reinvents itself yeah i mean matt and i

69
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,439
matt and i looked at i have a friend up

70
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,958
here who got a freezer of somebody who i

71
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,359
know everyone talks about freezer beans

72
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,039
or whatever yeah but uh my friend got a

73
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,879
freezer of

74
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,400
old beans from people that was someone

75
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,560
that was retiring and kind of getting

76
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,360
out of the game right and instead of

77
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,519
being like from the ancient 80s or sssc

78
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,720
or [ __ ] that people claim it was almost

79
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:59,039
all from 2008 to 2012. yeah it was way

80
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,878
too cool era i reached in i reached out

81
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:02,959
to matt because i was busy having kids

82
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:05,439
and doing a bunch of sit then and that

83
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,158
was sort of like really your prime time

84
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:08,239
yeah

85
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:10,799
right when you were like really really

86
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,120
in tune with what was going on yeah and

87
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,640
it was it was surprising to matt and i

88
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,800
looking over it

89
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:20,000
just how ancient a lot of those things

90
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,239
were and how 99 of it was unavailable

91
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,719
yeah even especially the rascal stuff

92
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,400
like at the time was really hot selling

93
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:27,120
really well a lot of the femme stuff he

94
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,120
was

95
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,599
our main competition at the time as it

96
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,120
were for femme stuff and looking at it

97
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:35,439
i'm not a lot of that stuff's hard to

98
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,200
grab now and it's great stuff yeah a lot

99
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:40,719
of it and that's only from

100
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:42,399
you know 14 12 14 years ago yeah which

101
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:44,560
doesn't seem that long to me

102
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,799
it's not actually because

103
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,920
i you know it uh traumas are very

104
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,159
current

105
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:51,919
you know it always feels good yeah so

106
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,719
that's what that's what's interesting is

107
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:57,199
like you get back to 10 12 years ago and

108
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:59,280
and it's almost impossible to find

109
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:00,878
um a lot of seed stock from then and

110
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,560
then you go back 10 more years and it's

111
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:04,878
harder and you go back to the 90s and oh

112
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,560
my god and you go back to the 80s and

113
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:07,679
it's almost legends

114
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,519
yeah

115
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,280
you know which isn't really all that

116
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,360
long but the way prohibition works and

117
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,519
the way the market works so you know

118
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,560
there's people there might be people in

119
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,079
various states that are slow to adapt um

120
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,360
that have been rocking the same thing

121
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,639
for 20 25 years yeah because it's worked

122
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,319
for them

123
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,918
right and the little customer base that

124
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,159
they have that they you know that they

125
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:32,719
give their access to is super stoked on

126
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,880
it yeah um and you so you almost need

127
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,280
those pockets

128
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:39,360
um you know because like you know when

129
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:42,079
we talked about the purple episode every

130
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,919
big grower i knew ran some kind of gdp

131
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:46,719
urkel mendo p

132
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:47,599
um you know great yeah something hybrid

133
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,759
yeah

134
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,840
and then fast forward 10 years and like

135
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,160
six people held on to it

136
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,799
yep that's how it goes out of hundreds

137
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,680
just in my little area yeah

138
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,040
you know

139
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,560
and yeah there's someone that's talking

140
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,520
right now about oh i'm sick it has to be

141
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,839
purple

142
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:06,319
you know the purple craze was like i

143
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:08,638
would say it was like 030405

144
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:11,439
maybe a little bit of 06.

145
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,400
and then it went away for 15 years yeah

146
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:16,478
it went away for for quite a while 15 18

147
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:19,439
years or something like that and then

148
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:21,680
now all of a sudden it's back

149
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:24,478
and people are just as annoyed now as

150
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,519
they were back then yeah

151
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:28,159
you know

152
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:29,439
um although back then i would say

153
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,680
one of the biggest things about the

154
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:34,079
purple craze that i don't like

155
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,879
uh was it was really the first time

156
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,359
where

157
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,399
a lot of diversity got lost

158
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,240
because

159
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,239
people just wanted what the brokers

160
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,680
wanted to buy yeah

161
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,759
and so they were growing all these

162
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,600
different things and you know

163
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,280
um and then all of a sudden people are

164
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,120
like well i want purple

165
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:53,758
yeah

166
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,319
yeah a lot of beautiful beautiful green

167
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,400
lovely strains went by the wayside for

168
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,479
the the oracle days yeah and we're gonna

169
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,638
we're gonna talk about like old clones a

170
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:04,959
lot today and that was really one of the

171
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,439
eras that be that kind of ushered in

172
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:10,079
like the everybody wants to grow the

173
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:12,959
most popular thing at the time yeah

174
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:15,839
because pre-purple craze of like you

175
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:17,839
know early 2000s the amount of diversity

176
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,638
that worked for the small and the medium

177
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:24,079
market was pretty incredible yeah if it

178
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:26,560
was good weed it probably sold

179
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:28,079
unlike today unlike today where you do

180
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,519
see a lot of really good weed go by the

181
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:31,519
wayside for

182
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:32,839
stuff that maybe we would all agree

183
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:36,079
isn't

184
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:38,399
as what we would consider kind as some

185
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:40,079
of the others oh somebody just said oh

186
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:41,839
six is when i first went to reggae on

187
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:43,439
the river and the custy kids had got

188
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:45,599
purple

189
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:47,279
got purple shirts on i went to i went to

190
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,479
reggae on the river from i don't know

191
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:52,879
probably like 95 to 0304 i think 03 was

192
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:55,120
like their their 20-year anniversary

193
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,319
maybe or something like that

194
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,399
and uh

195
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,919
after going for 10 years i'd seen most

196
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:01,279
of the acts i wanted to see and it had

197
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:02,879
gotten kind of

198
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:04,318
a little hectic

199
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,240
yeah i kind of felt like it was more

200
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,800
like have a bunch of city kids show up

201
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,759
on the river and hope nobody dies

202
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,720
kind of

203
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,639
can you imagine reggae on the river in

204
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,960
bakersfield how that would go with that

205
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,560
there's no river there's a river here

206
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:20,959
but we didn't have we have the kern

207
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,160
river here which is big but we didn't

208
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:23,839
have that we what we had was called

209
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,840
reggae fest

210
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:27,519
and it was just i started playing those

211
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:29,038
shows in about 06 because we had the

212
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:30,639
reggae band going on at the time but it

213
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:31,519
was very different than like the steel

214
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,079
drum

215
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:35,439
type reggae that a lot of people had it

216
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,680
was just phenomenal to see what

217
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:39,918
bakersfield offers in terms of reggae

218
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,680
fans it was it's pretty cool i mean i

219
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:44,000
never got to go to reggae on the river

220
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,680
myself that's a that's a tangent but i

221
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,839
will talk about it just a couple of

222
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,519
times because when i was coming out here

223
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:53,038
in the mid 90s as a midwestern kid

224
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:55,198
reggae on the river has like two

225
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:57,038
extremely clear memories where i really

226
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,720
realized that like the emerald triangle

227
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:01,680
in california was a different place than

228
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,319
where i was from yeah um there was there

229
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,360
was dready kids walking around reggae in

230
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,759
95 96 back then it was still a two-day

231
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,598
it was still a two-day weekend festival

232
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,360
and it was a lot more locals that hadn't

233
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:15,279
had like as many like city kids and

234
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,000
stuff coming up from the bay yet

235
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:20,959
but people were walking around with with

236
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
five gallon buckets with spears in them

237
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:26,000
and you could buy a spear like a a spear

238
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,759
of wheat a top oh oh i thought you made

239
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,360
spirits to threat i'm like wow it's not

240
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,639
like that kind of spear but i mean like

241
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,000
for me as like someone who comes from

242
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,799
like a world where it all had to be

243
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,360
hidden

244
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:37,439
oh yeah walking up and down the lot

245
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,759
with a bunch of stems sticking out of a

246
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,560
top and pulling out an 18-inch top to

247
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:42,479
sell

248
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,399
that's [ __ ] awesome that was pretty

249
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,959
incredible and like where where reggae

250
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,919
used to be it's like um where the river

251
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:52,079
is you can like look up and like the 101

252
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,639
the highway 101 is way up there right

253
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,120
yeah and i remember i was like sitting

254
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:58,480
in a seat on the riverbed and i was

255
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,278
pulling bongs

256
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,080
and i looked up and there was a highway

257
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:06,559
patrol looking right at me

258
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,240
and so coming from the midwest like if

259
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,319
you make eye contact with a cop and

260
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,240
you're doing drugs like you're it's not

261
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,760
a good scene yeah no and he waved to me

262
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,120
and then just went back to what he was

263
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:18,559
doing

264
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,320
and i was like literally ready to like

265
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:22,559
throw the bong in the river and run into

266
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,959
the crowd yeah because that was like my

267
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,039
training like what i you know like you

268
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:29,119
it was time to run yeah

269
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,719
and he just he just gave me a wave and

270
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,240
and went back to what he was doing and i

271
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,240
was like oh my god you know

272
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:38,159
there you are you're back

273
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:41,439
yeah oh my god

274
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:43,199
so yeah i mean those are but those were

275
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,120
like two seminal moments at reggae on

276
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,879
the river that for most people might not

277
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,278
be that big of a deal

278
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:51,200
but it just showed like what yeah like

279
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:53,679
how different how like there was a

280
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,240
bubble that we lived in

281
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:58,319
you know yeah it was a bubble

282
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,959
that was a bubble so

283
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,720
i i went through and and tonight we're

284
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:04,879
gonna be might be joined by someone i'm

285
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,800
not sure we talked about it but as

286
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:10,159
stoners will do we just decided that uh

287
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:11,439
we'll see if he shows up you know

288
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:13,278
because you know

289
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,519
plans or plans and that's that's rough

290
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:17,120
even for me so we'll see if this person

291
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,639
shows up but um

292
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,480
i went through the can of bible 3

293
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:23,679
because i remember that there is a great

294
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,320
list in here of the the late 90s early

295
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:29,439
2000s clones

296
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,440
and i thought it would be fun to go

297
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,959
through this list together

298
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,240
and and there's some that i added in

299
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:35,679
there's some that i took out of their

300
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,519
list because they really weren't that

301
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:39,359
relevant in terms of anything they just

302
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:43,039
happened to be things that he was aware

303
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,720
of that he threw in the middle but um

304
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:47,759
we got it all together brynn even made

305
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,600
it pretty with a fish and

306
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,639
uh yeah whenever you want to start going

307
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,839
through it we can start going through it

308
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:56,159
uh

309
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:59,040
jason someone just asked jason is not

310
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:02,000
the guest no i i no one's talked to him

311
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,120
but um you know who knows you know i

312
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,120
used to be pretty good friends with him

313
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,360
a long time ago he would definitely be a

314
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,480
character to have on one day

315
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:13,120
um yeah for sure in that regard you know

316
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,800
yeah it would be very interesting

317
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,759
super opinionated i don't know maybe

318
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,879
he's mellowed in the last bit but uh you

319
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:21,360
know

320
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:23,439
highly opinionated he definitely oh and

321
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,919
that's mellow uh you know he was super

322
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:29,120
opinionated in person uh some people it

323
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:31,360
drove him absolutely nuts i can relate

324
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,000
that i really liked him and i liked like

325
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,759
his vibe and what he was trying to do

326
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,679
yeah yeah for sure but it's hard because

327
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,439
like when you're when you're so certain

328
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:41,359
about something and you don't leave room

329
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,360
for other people's opinions

330
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,278
yeah you can secretly offend a lot of

331
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,159
people sure which matt knows nothing

332
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:48,159
about

333
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:50,719
i wouldn't i wouldn't i'm very people

334
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:51,600
he's not he's not he's not into that

335
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,519
um

336
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,120
but uh

337
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,919
but yeah you know they

338
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,000
so just as a general sense um before we

339
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:03,199
before we you know dive into the list a

340
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,600
little bit um i will say that you know

341
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,639
like i was mentioning earlier

342
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,879
um

343
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,680
when there wasn't much weed

344
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:13,838
uh most weeds sold

345
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:15,599
yeah because it was better than mexican

346
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,160
that was sort of like the standard like

347
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,159
if it was better than green or brown

348
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:21,519
mexican it's sold

349
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:24,399
and then as

350
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:27,200
the thing matured and and like and and

351
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,600
and fads and waves started happening

352
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,240
certain popular cuts started getting you

353
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,159
know more in demand than others yeah but

354
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,879
there was this period i would say from

355
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:38,879
the mid 90s to the mid 2000s

356
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:42,240
that may have been

357
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:43,838
the greatest diversity era we've seen

358
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,200
and that's where most of these cuts that

359
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,480
matt and i are going to talk about come

360
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,399
from because

361
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,720
they came at a time when there was a lot

362
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,958
of seed banks starting to operate

363
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,959
uh in amsterdam and there was a lot of

364
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:56,159
genetics starting to get traded around

365
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,039
friends

366
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:00,319
and

367
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:01,360
um almost all good weed had a place

368
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,680
yeah

369
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,680
and it hadn't really it hadn't really

370
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:06,958
been like oh you you don't have sour i

371
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:08,479
don't want to buy it you don't have

372
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,719
purple i don't want to buy it you don't

373
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,480
have gelato i don't want to buy it that

374
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,440
hadn't happened so that meant a lot of

375
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,879
people

376
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,880
could

377
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:20,958
grow what they liked pick what they

378
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:23,278
liked and form a little vibe on it yeah

379
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:24,799
and i would honestly say that's probably

380
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:27,919
all that stuff that we're about to chat

381
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:30,639
about is probably the backbone of today

382
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:31,759
you know i would also uh put this in the

383
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,159
era

384
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:35,679
before og kush was readily available in

385
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:38,399
seed for everyone

386
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:41,359
that's when i noticed a big change in

387
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,600
whole collectives being just og kush we

388
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,278
want og og you're [ __ ] nothing you

389
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,040
know um

390
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:48,399
right before that was readily available

391
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:51,198
for everyone

392
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:54,320
i i remember i remember uh walking into

393
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:56,319
a club in in the in uh l.a

394
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,639
yeah seeing literally no exaggeration

395
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,519
like 25 different types of kush

396
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,519
yeah yeah and like reminders based on it

397
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,000
and you're like well like that's all

398
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,278
you're that's that's the whole thing

399
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,759
yeah you know

400
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:11,759
like there's nothing else

401
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:14,319
um but you know the reason why there's

402
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:15,439
financial reasons that happened uh

403
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,600
there's there was you know there's

404
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,800
various economic indicators that push

405
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,800
all those things

406
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:23,278
yeah you know like when i first started

407
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:25,679
coming out to uh to mendo

408
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:27,439
it was very very common to buy mixed

409
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:30,958
phenos pounds

410
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,959
yeah it was all the same strain right

411
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,958
but they were they they would blend the

412
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:37,518
different plants together

413
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:41,039
it didn't have to be like i have a 50

414
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,480
pack of just this one cut

415
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,399
that hasn't started yet but then

416
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,680
eventually it became it had to be this

417
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,639
one thing

418
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:48,879
yep

419
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,519
and every time that's happened even

420
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:52,958
though the purples i love the urkel and

421
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,720
the mendo p and stuff like that are

422
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,159
pretty close to my heart and i love sour

423
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,120
diesel

424
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:58,639
and

425
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,000
most of the sour diesels that people

426
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,600
argue about right now whether they're

427
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,958
real or not or most of them are good

428
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,278
smoke yeah og kush's are excellent smoke

429
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:09,919
i'm not as big a fan of cookies but

430
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:10,799
you know um like you know they're all

431
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:13,439
good

432
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:15,838
yeah they just they just came at a cost

433
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,800
of everything else

434
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,079
a big cost a big cost of everything else

435
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:21,359
so i don't know i don't have the list in

436
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:22,319
front of me you have in front of you i

437
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,480
don't know how you want to keep it in

438
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,399
some kind of entertaining format all

439
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,639
right i will just start naming and then

440
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,440
um let me know if you you have any

441
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,639
members somebody said the aoda

442
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,600
i don't i'm not familiar with it what's

443
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:38,399
that aota is aota

444
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,278
and it was all of the above

445
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,440
okay

446
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:43,519
uh we used to rock the aota in the early

447
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:47,040
2000s i don't know who mentioned it

448
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:49,360
um but the iota was really tasty lead

449
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:51,599
so whoever mentioned that uh super cool

450
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,720
that you popped that up yeah that's

451
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,240
something i didn't even know about i

452
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,480
don't think i don't think i've seen the

453
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,240
aota since probably

454
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,800
oh i don't know i don't know when the

455
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,720
last time i saw the oh the the toyota

456
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,479
but we had it in our crew i don't even

457
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,680
remember where it came from

458
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,920
to be honest

459
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:10,719
um but it was uh it was it was it was

460
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:14,000
good weed it was it was fruity

461
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,839
and uh it was it was really tasty

462
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,360
okay so i keep remembering little ones

463
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,160
to add in as i'm going through this but

464
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,759
i'll start at the top afgooey which

465
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:23,759
predictably was going to be one of them

466
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,440
do you have experience with the apko

467
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,360
uh

468
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,399
you know a lot of people liked the af

469
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,440
gui

470
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,198
i sort of thought it was blandish

471
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,199
you probably smoked that nasty ass

472
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:36,559
outdoor version i mean i don't know you

473
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:38,879
can talk about it then because i don't

474
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:41,198
have the greatest memories of the afgoo

475
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:43,838
so i it it was spelled so many different

476
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:47,039
ways people would spell like afkahui

477
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:49,120
f gui some people think that gooey is f

478
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,919
gooey uh which goes from gooey breeder i

479
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,320
don't know i don't have enough

480
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:54,879
experience with gooey breeders gooey um

481
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,959
the fbi i was familiar with was a more i

482
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:59,519
wouldn't say short but yes it was it was

483
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:01,119
more squatter than most uh

484
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,120
uh plants you people are used to dealing

485
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,359
with it has this beautiful almost

486
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,279
watermelon blueberry type terp that was

487
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:09,759
very hard to describe and it was true

488
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:12,078
breeding for it um almost everything i

489
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:14,000
crossed it to or that it was crossed in

490
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:15,678
took on the af gooey smell and i could

491
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,199
see how people could get very

492
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,959
overwhelmed by it because it's very

493
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,079
distinctive

494
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,120
you could also describe as like

495
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:24,720
cantaloupe berry it was it was unique

496
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:27,038
and i i tended to love it it would pass

497
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,440
on beautiful resin traits uh had good

498
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:30,960
potency not the best yield but

499
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,400
i think overall

500
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,000
uh it's one of my faves off this list oh

501
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,080
there you go i was going to dis it

502
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,200
slightly because i know i just saw a

503
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:41,519
bunch of

504
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,200
lo of midi midzie before we called

505
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,558
things mids uh

506
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,558
midzie outdoor

507
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:48,960
yeah and i i would think it could be

508
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:51,200
very midi outdoor it was not that it was

509
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,240
not i never saw the greatest examples

510
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,798
but then there you go you know yeah

511
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,558
um how about i have no experience with

512
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:00,798
real albert walker but i did get the

513
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:02,399
[ __ ] fake albert walker have you grown

514
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:04,960
albert walker i don't know that i grew

515
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,038
the real albert albert walker but i do

516
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,240
think that was a pretty flavorful and

517
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:09,119
potent cut

518
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,798
yeah

519
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:12,239
i know fletch has a lot of familiarity

520
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,079
with it fletch would be an excellent

521
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,599
person to chat about the history of it

522
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:16,319
that's one that like

523
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:18,399
not

524
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:21,279
my none of my old crew

525
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,120
uh or really had any access to it you

526
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:24,240
know yeah i think there was one friend

527
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:26,159
of mine that might have been growing it

528
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,440
for a bit but it wasn't it wasn't too

529
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,080
much

530
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,400
okay um now this is one that a lot of

531
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:34,399
people are familiar with from um

532
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,798
oh what the [ __ ] dutch flowers their

533
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,480
work with it the blue dot

534
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:41,519
oh

535
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,440
i know there was two the blue dot uh i

536
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:44,879
am familiar with that that stuff there

537
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,759
was this guy

538
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,799
oh my god does he go by crunch bubble

539
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,319
uh

540
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:52,400
there was a guy on the forums you could

541
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:55,359
probably search for him or whatever and

542
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,600
uh the blue dot was one of the big

543
00:18:55,359 --> 00:19:00,079
strains that used to get pushed through

544
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:02,639
grown in oakland a lot and it was pushed

545
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:04,639
through one of the early uh dispensaries

546
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,240
that we called the third floor that's

547
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,160
what it was third floor third floor

548
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,480
which was a pretty famous dispensary

549
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,120
back then in the east bay

550
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,919
um a lot of people got their purple cuts

551
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:18,879
from the third floor they were very tied

552
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,960
into my area to humboldt and and mundo

553
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,880
and stuff like that they got a hold of

554
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,798
like the the granddaddy and the urkel

555
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,520
and stuff like that and yeah crunch

556
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:29,918
bubble from icmag he used to blow up

557
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:32,319
tons of blue dot back in the day

558
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,480
um it was a nice cut i never ran it

559
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:37,678
personally but there it was like it was

560
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:40,798
one of those like bay area specials yeah

561
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:44,480
it really got rocked a lot um and i

562
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:46,319
think it was part of blow fish

563
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,759
that guy used to send it you know you

564
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:50,079
know you have like 40 lighters or

565
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:51,759
whatever and yeah early warehouses with

566
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:52,399
like do you remember like all the old

567
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:55,200
like

568
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,038
skinny rectangle sunlight hoods oh yeah

569
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,080
you know with like the with the single

570
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:02,158
ended 600 watt hortolux hell yeah you

571
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:03,759
know and like the trays and all that

572
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,320
like that was like cutting edge at the

573
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:07,759
time yeah um but you know he had some

574
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:09,678
you know pretty good-sized scenes or

575
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:12,879
whatever that and and there was like a

576
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:14,080
huge demand for blue dot yeah so

577
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,760
i don't have a bunch of personal

578
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:17,599
experience growing it but i mean i would

579
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:18,558
get bags of it on occasion going to the

580
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:20,399
bay

581
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:23,519
um and it was definitely like it was a

582
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,519
bay area classics yeah for a period of

583
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:27,440
years

584
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:30,558
yeah uh someone just said i do think

585
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,759
that green crack is a pheno of skunk one

586
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:34,000
um

587
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:34,720
you know at least it's it's heavily in

588
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,679
there

589
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,279
yeah

590
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,280
and put it that way

591
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:41,918
yeah i could see that definitely i mean

592
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:43,440
the mango that loud mango turp i usually

593
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,960
associate with skunk one touch stuff as

594
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,240
it is

595
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,038
um

596
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,120
blue

597
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:51,119
[ __ ] dream

598
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:53,279
blue dream

599
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:56,399
so blue dream is one of those things

600
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:57,440
that has a bad reputation

601
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,120
um

602
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,558
mostly because

603
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:02,319
uh

604
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:04,879
anything that could get eight to ten

605
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:06,158
pounds at you know five let's say five

606
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,840
to ten pounds be a little bit more

607
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,039
generous anything that could get five to

608
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:11,119
ten pounds

609
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:14,400
outdoor reliably

610
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:16,479
um got blown up in my neck of the woods

611
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,798
and so if you to me if you grow blue

612
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,960
dream in like a little pot and you get

613
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:23,279
like a four to eight or ten ounce plant

614
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,960
or something it's really flavory and

615
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:27,038
really pretty wheat

616
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:30,400
yeah but most people's opinion of blue

617
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:33,359
dream is this giant outdoor

618
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:36,559
sort of b grade maybe poorly dried

619
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:38,000
um you know rock hard buds the terps

620
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:40,480
aren't really there

621
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,919
um but you know it kind of got famous

622
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,720
because

623
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,080
um

624
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,319
you know people used to call it blue

625
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:48,158
dream billionaire right where back when

626
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:51,439
weed was worth a lot you could put out a

627
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,250
99 blue dreams and get 700 pounds

628
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,840
yeah

629
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:56,319
[Music]

630
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:58,240
that's sweet [ __ ] yeah so there's it's

631
00:21:56,319 --> 00:22:00,399
there's this run with blue dream green

632
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,279
crack even my maui a little bit

633
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,519
where

634
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:05,599
um it's really big yielding

635
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:07,440
and then most people smoke the big

636
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:09,759
yielding stuff

637
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,640
and don't smoke like the little more

638
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:15,759
carefully grown nicer versions

639
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,880
yeah so their memory of it is uh

640
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:20,240
is just the big blown out crazy nugs

641
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,760
that are b grade

642
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,319
so another thing that i remember with

643
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:26,240
blue dream during that era was that a

644
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:28,079
lot of people when it first popped off

645
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,679
were growing one cut there was one blue

646
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:32,000
dream cut that was going around it was

647
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,840
pretty pretty well um

648
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
passed out like people a lot of people

649
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:38,000
had this cut was being blown out of

650
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,440
collectives and it was pretty damn i

651
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,279
mean good for the time it was very

652
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:45,038
resonance had good potency good yield um

653
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:46,480
didn't mold up too easy none of the

654
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:49,839
stuff that you know would normally keep

655
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:52,640
stuff down but after that big huge first

656
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:56,079
push seed lines were released named blue

657
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:58,480
dream by emerald triangle seeds i think

658
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:01,599
hso put out a blue dream and those

659
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:04,480
quickly quickly were picked up and run

660
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:06,879
and those cuts were passed as blue dream

661
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,798
and the original cut was quickly drowned

662
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:12,640
out by um

663
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:14,639
other blueberry haze type combos

664
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,280
i do think that that thing that matt

665
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,080
just described is actually a common

666
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:20,240
thing

667
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:23,119
that can happen to certain strains where

668
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,440
a strain gets named something

669
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:26,798
uh then it gets named and put into a

670
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,480
seed line

671
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:30,079
and then there's all these phenos

672
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,720
floating around that aren't the original

673
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:34,639
cut that made it famous yes

674
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,159
um you know so there was a bunch of

675
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,200
different blue dreams it was supposedly

676
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:41,039
blueberry by some kind of haze

677
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,038
um it was a super so the original cut

678
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:46,079
was super silver haze crusty dj short

679
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:48,079
blueberry yeah and and so

680
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:49,519
you know they uh but you know like i

681
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:51,278
said if you grew

682
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:53,038
if you grew like a little six or seven

683
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:55,759
ounce plant of that thing in your light

684
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:57,359
depth or your greenhouse or your indoor

685
00:23:55,759 --> 00:24:00,640
it was really nice weed

686
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:03,119
yeah it was i like it i i still like it

687
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,120
our buddy pat works with it currently he

688
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:07,359
did the blue dream train wreck hybrid

689
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:10,079
for all of us older heads that's like

690
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:11,599
phenomenal and cool

691
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:12,720
yeah i mean

692
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:15,199
yeah good

693
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,200
uh i was just gonna say that you know uh

694
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,720
the first time i really showed my face

695
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,278
on any of these things was when our

696
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,798
buddy uh csi asked me to do an event

697
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:25,038
that he was throwing up in humboldt and

698
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:29,839
i went and i was on a panel with

699
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:31,679
him and um uh you know me and jean and

700
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:34,000
kevin jodry and just different folks you

701
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,519
know yeah um and he talked about like

702
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,359
you know train wreck

703
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:38,480
for northern humboldt was one of like

704
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:40,639
the first

705
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,319
named cuts

706
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,159
you know the rap

707
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:45,599
yeah the wreck

708
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,760
so there's a lot of legends with the

709
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:50,798
wreck because it was uh

710
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:52,079
it was you know it was

711
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:53,759
i don't know if i don't know if santa

712
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:56,079
cruz original haze that's a whole

713
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:59,119
different movie uh

714
00:24:56,079 --> 00:25:02,000
super silver hayes is a much much uh uh

715
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:03,759
changed child of haze

716
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,599
i see i think what select genetics 2 is

717
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:07,519
referring to is again there were several

718
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:09,918
different seed lines uh unknown

719
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:12,879
undisclosed haze so most people would

720
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,559
agree that that blue hen from um what

721
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,159
are they called can

722
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:18,079
kentucky see i can't remember off the

723
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,640
top of my head but blue hen was the

724
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:23,359
super silver haze 98 blueberry probably

725
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,360
where it was selected from um but it was

726
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:26,798
also widely grown other

727
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:29,119
than that under the name blue pen as

728
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:31,278
well but the very first santa cruz cut

729
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:33,119
blue dream which still exists is a super

730
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:35,919
silver haze cross that's the one we're

731
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:38,399
referring to specifically and it's tasty

732
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,919
not everybody likes the high um

733
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,840
and if you grow it too big it definitely

734
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:44,320
is shitty but i think that's true of a

735
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:46,319
lot of weed there's a sweet spot of

736
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:47,599
yield and quality

737
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:49,759
yeah you know bluegrass seed there you

738
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:51,038
go thank you cameron bluegrass yeah

739
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:52,879
there's a there's definitely a sweet

740
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:54,960
spot it's not all the same sweet spot

741
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,799
with strains but there's definitely a

742
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,880
point of diminishing returns as you get

743
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:02,000
bigger and bigger plants where it just

744
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:06,080
doesn't give you as nice of weed yeah

745
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,079
you know so next would be bubble gum

746
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,200
bubble gum i am i i did i had a lot of

747
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,440
experience with a lot of other bubble

748
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:16,159
gums in the seed line but this specific

749
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,640
clone i didn't get until a few years ago

750
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:21,760
and i find it phenomenal it's an amazing

751
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:24,480
breeder uh it's mold resistant this

752
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:28,240
specific cut that csi and pip and all

753
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,599
those guys use came via 1995 from the

754
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,240
cup i believe it was bought the same

755
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:33,839
year that it won the cup so uh that's

756
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,359
that's what goes around it's a serious

757
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:38,480
it's a selection from series seeds

758
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:40,558
bubble gum the bummer for me

759
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,640
it's a great breeder yeah it's very

760
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:44,639
frosty yeah that's fairly potent i

761
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,759
wouldn't say it's uh

762
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,360
i wouldn't say it's up there with the

763
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:48,798
best of the best but it's got it's got a

764
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:50,558
good little punch

765
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:52,879
uh the disappointing thing about it to

766
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:56,639
me is that it smells

767
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:59,120
very strongly of bubble gum terps yes um

768
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,120
but the flavor does not translate for me

769
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:03,359
not even a little bit yeah i don't you

770
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:05,918
don't get any it doesn't it smells like

771
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:07,519
you're smelling big league chew yeah but

772
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,120
it doesn't smell like you're chewing it

773
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:11,278
doesn't feel like you're chewing big

774
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:12,479
league chew when you smoke it yeah but

775
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:14,000
it's a great breeder it's super

776
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,839
consistent it's one of the most mold

777
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,440
resistant things out there

778
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:22,079
um it's a cool plant yeah yeah arrowhead

779
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,080
hemp farms yes indiana is serious seeds

780
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:26,158
it is a serious seed selection though a

781
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:28,000
lot of people put the indiana bubblegum

782
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,360
as the mother of serious seeds that they

783
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,679
use but that's not the case it was

784
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:33,599
actually a selection from their uh

785
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,519
seedline and if we want to go even back

786
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:36,959
further there's you know adam dunn has

787
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:37,918
this whole thing about where it came

788
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,079
from

789
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,278
um you know neville felt like they just

790
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:42,240
stole it

791
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:44,319
from

792
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,399
working with him yeah and renamed it

793
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:48,079
that it was it was some big buzz it was

794
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:51,199
some combination of stuff that he was

795
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:53,439
already working on yeah um you know um

796
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,840
so there's there's dispute over where

797
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,600
where where it came from yeah and that

798
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:59,359
happens a lot where people try to

799
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:01,678
obscure origins

800
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:03,599
yeah definitely that's a common thing

801
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,519
you know so

802
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:07,359
all right i see full writer in the

803
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:09,440
comments everybody wants to hear bull

804
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:11,359
rider and do it i i hate to break it to

805
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,720
you guys bull rider was before my time

806
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:15,278
it was before my time by the time i got

807
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,558
to san diego bull rider was r.i.p

[ __ ] nothing the only thing you could

809
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:21,759
find was afghani bull rider which there

810
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:23,440
is no proof evidence anyway the afghani

811
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:26,640
bull riders related to the original bull

812
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:29,679
writer it's very different um well betsy

813
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:32,399

and is still held and run by multiple

817
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,120
friends and

818
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,880
crew

819
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:43,038
um and it's supposed to be a sister of

820
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,039
the original bull liar i don't know that

821
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:47,200
matter i know anyone that has original

822
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:49,359
bull rider that we believe

823
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,278
not that we're sure of but old betsy

824
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:52,639
exists and who knows it could exist

825
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:54,798
outside of our

826
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,399
our experience

827
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:58,960
it definitely could exist but i haven't

828
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:01,359
seen it a lot of people made uh

829
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,278
a lot of claims about it recently but

830
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:05,199
none holed up and most are

831
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:06,640
based on the afghanistan maybe i should

832
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,399
say something just real quick one time

833
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,880
when i was in chicago

834
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:12,398
uh before i moved to california i saw

835
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,559
some bubble gum

836
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:16,479
that they had bought from out there and

837
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:19,599
brought back and it had

838
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:22,558
hot pink hairs and was lime green

839
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:24,480
um and was super gorgeous

840
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:26,240
i never really saw it again i only saw

841
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,079
it a few times who knows who was growing

842
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,480
it back then but i did see

843
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:33,439
a very cool version of it a long time

844
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,360
ago uh when sirius first released it

845
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,519
yeah

846
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:38,959
so um yeah that we went through bull

847
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:41,359
rider bubble gum

848
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,960
banana oh gee do you have any i know

849
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:45,839
you've grown banana og do you have any

850
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,440
uh memorable experiences with it i do

851
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:48,798
actually think that

852
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,360
you know a lot of these things

853
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:52,960
especially in dessert and uh and fruit

854
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:54,479
names now annoy the [ __ ] out of me

855
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,919
because they have no relation what

856
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,919
they're marketing

857
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,320
they have no relation to whatever they

858
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:02,240
name them after but i do think banana og

859
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:03,599
does have a little bit of banana terp to

860
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,839
it yes

861
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:08,158
you know i i will say that i will say

862
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:09,839
it's it does have i get a banana sense

863
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,320
when i smoked it

864
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:13,599
uh it's an odd og i don't really know

865
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:15,839
what to make of it

866
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:17,439
um the oregon kid or somebody like that

867
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:20,240
made it famous it's not really my

868
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,558
background on that one so banana og came

869
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,480
from a pack of ogiers kush his original

870
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:26,558
release of what he wanted to be the ogco

871
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,480
seedline um

872
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:31,440
no chiquita banana is not the original

873
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,120
game way later and as a rename um so he

874
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,159
got it as

875
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:35,599
uh

876
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,679
the og kush

877
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:39,199
the the clone that he had and he got he

878
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,080
selected a male from

879
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,840
some

880
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:45,199
i think it was an indoor

881
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:47,278
um 60 40 from segrematha which meant 60

882
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,000
sativa 40 indica i remember that line

883
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:52,000
yeah yeah he popped those and i've asked

884
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,679
um tony from sacramento what it was and

885
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,599
he said it was just something he bought

886
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,120
in bulk from someone he didn't know it

887
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:58,959
was just labeled 60 40 so he knew

888
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:01,839
exactly what it was so anyways whatever

889
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,159
was in the 60 40 kicked whatever would

890
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:07,119
be true for these banana terps so he

891
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,880
released ogier's cush expecting it to be

892
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:10,558
a good version of og kush and that's

893
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,640
where people found this beautiful clone

894
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:14,000
that was very banana like and later on

895
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,360
you know as people pop more seeds more

896
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,519
people found different clones they would

897
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:19,278
call banana og there's one that

898
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,440
circulates right now that most people

899
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:22,960
have is the same one and it's very good

900
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,798
there's a few more that are more laffy

901
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,960
taffy like artificial banana type and

902
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:30,000
that's what you smell um i've smelled

903
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:32,399
one banana hybrid from um

904
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,398
pico our buddy and it smelled like

905
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:36,319
[ __ ] banana bread like just dead on

906
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:38,719
like that banana cinnamon it's one of

907
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:40,798
the most amazing banana smelling things

908
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,319
that i've ever smelled so i'll throw in

909
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:44,480
something that's uh

910
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:45,439
kind of related um

911
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,839
you know

912
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,759
before uh there used to be in the in the

913
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:52,398
40s 50s and 60s

914
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:54,960
um the banana the banana that everyone

915
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:57,439
ate was a different banana fino that you

916
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,558
eat then you eat now yeah and it was

917
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,798
destroyed by root fungus

918
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:04,558
right it had a much different flavor

919
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:07,038
than the current banana that everybody

920
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:09,599
has grown up with but what's interesting

921
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:11,679
is kind of how banana candy tastes a

922
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:12,959
little different than you would expect

923
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,200
it to taste

924
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,960
like it's banana but it like it's kind

925
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,640
of you think of it as like candy candy

926
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,600
banana yeah

927
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,519
that flavor was was developed off the

928
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:25,119
first bananas that were commercially

929
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,159
sold in america

930
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:28,639
yeah

931
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:29,760
and they didn't change it

932
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,960
you know

933
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:32,798
yep right there

934
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,720
there you go the cavendish

935
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:37,119
the so most banana candy is based on the

936
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,798
flavor of the cavendish banana not the

937
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:40,079
modern banana that everybody is used to

938
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:42,000
eating

939
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:44,240
and you know i actually owe a great deal

940
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,640
of my career to the banana og and some

941
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,960
of oregon kids stuff and uh tony from

942
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,880
sacramento stuff it still lives on today

943
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,880
and a lot of strains that i work with

944
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,679
and the others work with so banana og is

945
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,840
the [ __ ] i think i like it though i will

946
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:59,440
say in a lot of outcrosses depending on

947
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:01,359
what you cross it to there are phenos

948
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,840
that are just straight cardboard and

949
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:06,719
they're hard to dodge um

950
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:08,879
but that clone stands the test of time i

951
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,319
think for sure it's a it's a good one it

952
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,480
kind of got buried a little bit and it

953
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:14,558
got lost amongst other things but it's

954
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,880
it's a it's a cool unique terp and it

955
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:18,798
had a nice buzz yeah

956
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,039
so you know

957
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:23,200
here's a fun one that that

958
00:33:21,038 --> 00:33:25,679
probably is is actually several

959
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,360
different different clones or seed lines

960
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,798
hold on one second

961
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:31,119
these guys are correct actually the

962
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:32,639
cavendish replaced the

963
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:34,398
i was off the top of my head they're

964
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,919
talking about which banana cultivars

965
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:40,319
existed and i got it reversed uh okay so

966
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:42,480
the cavendish was the first and the uh

967
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:43,678
the cavendish is now and it replaced

968
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,038
this thing i don't know how to pronounce

969
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,559
it but it was like gross macau or

970
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:48,079
something like that

971
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:49,519
so

972
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:51,678
yeah someone keeps asking about the

973
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,079
chiquita that was the chiquita banana

974
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:56,159
was uh popped from the platinum banana

975
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:58,079
og kush which was a hybrid of bubba kush

976
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:00,159
something in banana og

977
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:01,918
and it came i mean that was so much

978
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,519
later because it was from my work and it

979
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,480
was later

980
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,079
like

981
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,480
seven years after i made the platinum

982
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:10,639
banana og and my work was so much later

983
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,559
after oregon kid did so no it's it

984
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,159
they're very different but um the

985
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:16,000
chiquita banana is based on it but has a

986
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,679
lot more in it

987
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,679
okay what's next

988
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:22,320
cat piss again

989
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,079
many many different clones i think i saw

990
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,159
several in san diego

991
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,760
called cat piss that were very different

992
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,079
from each other some i didn't smell any

993
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,480
cat piss in some people did

994
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:35,519
what's your experience uh well i'll say

995
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:38,079
a couple things uh one is that you know

996
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:41,119
i think that it's one of those aspects

997
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:43,039
of smell that people relate stuff to

998
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,800
so i think it's like i think it's like a

999
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:47,358
i think it's like how some people

1000
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,800
perceive certain kinds of terpenoline

1001
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:50,639
yeah right

1002
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,800
um and since terpenoline is kind of a

1003
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,039
common aroma that pops up i think

1004
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,119
there's more than one cat piss

1005
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:59,599
uh and i do believe we're going to have

1006
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,480
uh sha bud on the on the program next

1007
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,559
week

1008
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,880
in the next couple of weeks and so we

1009
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:06,719
could probably save the deep dive into

1010
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,519
cat kiss for him

1011
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:11,199
because that is one of his specialties

1012
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:13,519
and he knows an enormous amount about

1013
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:15,358
the history and he's tried all the

1014
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:16,400
different ones there was the san diego

1015
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:19,039
cat piss

1016
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:22,320
there was a pittsburgh cat piss

1017
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:24,480
um there was different types yeah um you

1018
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,240
know but uh you know so there were there

1019
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:29,199
was a few different names

1020
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:31,118
yeah one second i'm bringing in someone

1021
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:33,679
if he wants to

1022
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:35,680
see how he's doing

1023
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:37,199
all right what is cheetah piss who

1024
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:39,039
[ __ ] knows

1025
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:40,159
this is so other than having the name

1026
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:42,639
piss in it

1027
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:45,118
um you know that's marketing that's like

1028
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:46,639
a cookie team coming up with marketing

1029
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,880
names cookie

1030
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:51,039
never really has any names that tie to

1031
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:53,358
what this strain is actually like yeah

1032
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:54,719
um they definitely have a team of

1033
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:56,960
marketing people

1034
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:58,799
deciding what to call things

1035
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,559
and what kind of art goes with it and

1036
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,960
what the packaging is going to look like

1037
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:05,119
and what the mylars are going to be

1038
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:08,079
um so they're a very new school type of

1039
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,800
approach to naming strains

1040
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,280
so

1041
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,280
it's all good gene you can text

1042
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,560
if you so you have time uh

1043
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,640
what's next

1044
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:18,320
um someone asked if any ssh smells like

1045
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:20,319
catfish yes i mean yeah that's a great

1046
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,480
example of turpin i have that pissy

1047
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:25,519
smells i have argued if you go and read

1048
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,760
like a bunch of neville's uh old posts

1049
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:29,759
on hazes he'll talk about when you

1050
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,599
inbreed hayes all you get is a bunch of

1051
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,079
cat piss yes

1052
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:36,559
and when we in breed haze

1053
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:39,200
all we get is a bunch of terpenoline

1054
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:41,599
and as any breeder will tell you once

1055
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:42,879
terpene becomes the dominant smell in

1056
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,920
your strain

1057
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,039
boy is it hard to get other smells to

1058
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,920
pop up

1059
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:51,759
yeah

1060
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:53,358
you know it is very very very dominant

1061
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,800
yeah now there's different terpenolines

1062
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:56,960
they're not all the same some are sweet

1063
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,240
some are astringent you know some are

1064
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,079
this or that or whatever there's

1065
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:02,879
definitely a range interpenaline there

1066
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:05,680
but um but yeah i when whenever neville

1067
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:08,559
talks about cat piss i think of of

1068
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:10,639
turpentine yeah and i do too i mean i

1069
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:12,559
know there's afghanis that are acrid and

1070
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:14,078
ammonia type and that's what i used to

1071
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:16,799
think of when people would say pissy i

1072
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:18,960
would think of the acrid ammonia urea

1073
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,640
type smells but i think a lot of people

1074
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,639
think of terpenolamine and i just my

1075
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:24,400
nose does not pick up that piss scent

1076
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:25,679
from tropinally and then when you you

1077
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,000
know the other part of it is like once

1078
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:29,759
you when you grow or you smoke c5 or

1079
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,639
something like that and it's just a

1080
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,720
terpenoline monster yeah and he refers

1081
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:37,039
to it as very cat pissy

1082
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:38,239
yeah then obviously that's what his mind

1083
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:39,119
goes to

1084
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:40,479
yeah

1085
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,440
you know

1086
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,760
so

1087
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:47,519
okay um next the cheese

1088
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,480
the cheese so

1089
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:53,679
the cheese has a pretty cool story yeah

1090
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:55,679
it might be the oldest skunk one fino

1091
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:57,118
that's spread around

1092
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:58,879
yeah it's supposed to be from the late

1093
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,960
80s

1094
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,480
it's supposed to be popped by sort of

1095
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,480
like a bunch of

1096
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,920
would you call them punk anarchist

1097
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,280
squatters

1098
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,320
supposed to be i don't know much about

1099
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,040
the crew i thought they were supposed to

1100
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:13,519
be ravers or some electronics same thing

1101
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:17,759
yeah same thing yeah you know i mean

1102
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:20,000
when anarchists you know like punks

1103
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:23,680
uh underground weirdos listening to

1104
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,838
unpopular music yeah you know yeah type

1105
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:29,118
of thing but skunk but it was a phenom

1106
00:38:25,838 --> 00:38:30,960
of skunk one and most skunk one

1107
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:33,920
uh is

1108
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,240
citrus or floral

1109
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,358
uh sometimes grape

1110
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:38,879
uh

1111
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:41,039
never skunk

1112
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,760
and the rarest would be probably the

1113
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:46,800
kind of a funky cheese yeah

1114
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:50,079
aroma yeah and so there's a sister of it

1115
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,960
supposedly called psychosis yeah which

1116
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,640
is not nearly as circulated uh you know

1117
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,159
the english are all big on it because

1118
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:58,838
it's one of the few things that actually

1119
00:38:56,159 --> 00:39:01,838
originated from their island

1120
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:03,199
yeah the blues livers psychosis and

1121
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:05,519
there's another one too that they always

1122
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:07,279
used to talk about and and i really i'd

1123
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:09,119
love to grow them one day but i have

1124
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,880
never been um

1125
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,640
where i could get it from uh

1126
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,960
from a source with provenance i've only

1127
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:16,559
gotten it from like seed lines or you

1128
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,400
know and it's one of those cuts that

1129
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:20,239
different people give different names to

1130
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,320
like the bright side cut or the this

1131
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:23,039
yeah that cut you know that kind of

1132
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,559
thing

1133
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:27,920
but it's basically

1134
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:30,639
it's basically a classic skunk one yes

1135
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,400
yeah you know um the other thing i

1136
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:33,598
will say about is i learned a lot from

1137
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,000
that cut

1138
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:38,240
a huge amount from that [ __ ] cut i

1139
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,079
learned that it was one of those cuts

1140
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:41,919
that like early on growing it it was

1141
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,440
really foot funky cheese for me so as i

1142
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,039
got it later and it was fruity and sweet

1143
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,800
i was like no wait this is a this is a

1144
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:48,960
[ __ ] fake cut [ __ ] this thing this is

1145
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,760
not what i remember and it was one of

1146
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:55,199
those cuts that really taught me um

1147
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:57,119
yeah yeah people are talking suicide cut

1148
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:58,639
there's like any like a lot of old

1149
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:01,440
famous strains

1150
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:03,838
um you know i'll use a different example

1151
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,159
i mean in my lifetime i've watched the

1152
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:08,000
chem dog get called chem dog we

1153
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:10,719
shortened it to dog

1154
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:15,280
our buddy came online and it became the

1155
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:17,519
skunk va cut it got called the chem 91

1156

um you know different cuts that are the

1157
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:20,318
same

1158
00:40:18,318 --> 00:40:22,400
the same cut can get different nicknames

1159
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:25,119
and different different things over time

1160
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,000
with different crews yeah

1161
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:29,599
you know

1162
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,920
exodus suicide bright side

1163
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:33,760
you know all these different things um

1164
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,039
they're all you know

1165
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,200
there's like there was like a small

1166
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:40,079
little family that came out of this late

1167
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:41,279
80s english scene

1172
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:55,359
leafiness makes less leafiness makes

1173
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:57,838
long running colas it's mildly potent i

1174
00:40:55,358 --> 00:40:59,279
would say i'd say most cheap most skunks

1175
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:00,639
are in like the

1176
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,119
mid teens

1177
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:04,879
in terms of in terms of thc

1178
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:07,680
you know gets big

1179
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,720
a little metallic maybe i don't know

1180
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:10,480
yeah

1181
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:12,239
um someone mentioned one that we

1182
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,199
actually i should have put on the list

1183
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:16,719
but i didn't and that's blackberry

1184
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:18,480
do you did you ever have any experience

1185
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:21,679
with blackberry up there not blackberry

1186
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,358
kush but just blackberry uh

1187
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:24,639
we had more with blackberry kush

1188
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:26,799
although i always thought it was just

1189
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:28,639
blackberry and people added kush to it

1190
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,240
because at the time all these brokers

1191
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:31,759
wanted cush so it's like here's your

1192
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:34,000
purple kush

1193
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,000
yeah um the original blackberry was a

1194
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,599
lot different from the the blackberry

1195
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,639
kush the blackberry kush was a white

1196
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:43,359
rhino bubba hybrid from oregon kid um

1197
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:45,358
the original blackberry was from um a

1198
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:47,598
dude named soma blaze if i remember

1199
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:50,159
correctly scott soma blaze and he ended

1200
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:53,119
up passing away naboo ended up

1201
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:54,318
kind of carrying on the torch of it and

1202
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,720
you know there were a lot of beautiful

1203
00:41:54,318 --> 00:41:59,039
pictures i think in one of these can of

1204
00:41:56,719 --> 00:42:01,118
bibles if i can pull it up super fast

1205
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:03,039
has a beautiful picture of it there's a

1206
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:06,480
real famous picture of it inside of a

1207
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:10,159
jar of um like blackberry preserves

1208
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:12,000
uh that was really famous of it um

1209
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:14,078
at the time there wasn't a lot of

1210
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,559
colored weed

1211
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:18,800
so it stood out very much so

1212
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:20,799
and and it was it was used a lot in a

1213
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,960
lot of the hybrids that were famous from

1214
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:25,039
that point on um

1215
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:27,838
because it bred true for whatever its

1216
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:29,358
purple traits were um for a long time it

1217
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:31,679
you know people thought it was different

1218
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:33,519
from the mendo perps but i think later

1219
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:36,078
on people realized that there was a good

1220
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:37,759
chance it was a a bad seed for mendo

1221
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:39,760
perps and i think that's kind of where

1222
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,240
we're at with oh man if nebu had a

1223
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:45,040
voodoo doll right now you'd be i know

1224
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:45,039
the jungler

1225
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:52,719
but it does seem like the timeline

1226
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:54,159
uh is is correct yes you know the one

1227
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:56,078
thing i'll say about the blackberry

1228
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:57,039
whether it was blackberry or blackberry

1229
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:58,720
kush

1230
00:42:57,039 --> 00:43:02,079
um both of them were pretty weak

1231
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:04,559
potency-wise yeah hella mitsy fam

1232
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:06,079
i don't know i wouldn't say midzie but

1233
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:08,159
not potent

1234
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:10,640
no i yeah it was very hard to get high

1235
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:12,399
from that stuff you know

1236
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:14,559
if that was the only thing in your jar

1237
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,000
you better have a light potency a light

1238
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:18,880
tolerance i should say if you want to

1239
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,838
get anywhere on it for me yeah yeah

1240
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:23,760
for me too and and yeah blackberry kush

1241
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:24,880
especially i had a very hard it was

1242
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,640
beautiful too because it was super

1243
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,160
resinous and it was one of those things

1244
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:30,318
that i always put in my head

1245
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:32,000
as like that was some beautiful looking

1246
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:33,920
weed and when you pick it up you see all

1247
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,159
that resin it was the it was the it was

1248
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,760
the [ __ ] that taught me pretty [ __ ]

1249
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:40,318
frosty weed doesn't necessarily mean

1250
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,839
you're gonna get [ __ ] up for me uh

1251
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:43,279
blackberry kush was the kind of thing

1252
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:45,599
that brokers would come up here and

1253
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:47,119
freak out on and buy a [ __ ] ton of

1254
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:49,039
yeah once

1255
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:51,119
yeah once yeah and then they wouldn't

1256
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:53,599
they wouldn't move it they were like no

1257
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:55,440
i got way too many complaints it was too

1258
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:56,800
like people want to get high

1259
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,039
and some people are comparing it to

1260
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,359
purple punch but um

1261
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:03,119
purple punch has i think personally

1262
00:44:01,358 --> 00:44:05,279
great terps and i would say blackberry

1263
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,599
kush really was not on the great terp

1264
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:10,000
range no and we didn't even call there

1265
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:12,400
was no terps then that was even that was

1266
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,920
even before most uh the the revolution

1267
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,559
of hashish that happened again with all

1268
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,960
the nails and all that so it never got

1269
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:20,719
the it never really got the

1270
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:24,000
i don't know it was it was bumped in

1271
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:26,639
mendo for a time but yeah yeah whatever

1272
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,000
okay here's your your your favorite

1273
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:29,679
cam dog

1274
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,039
i think we started covering some of it

1275
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:35,279
so go ahead the camera dog you know yeah

1276
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:36,480
i mean you know it was uh it's one of

1277
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,839
those things where it's been talked

1278
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:42,880
about tons by various people myself uh

1279
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:44,559
our buddy skunk va and all that

1280
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,680
um i would say that the best thing you

1281
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:50,559
could say about chemdawg is that it is

1282
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:53,759
it's got rare potency

1283
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:56,719
uh very rare potency and the potency

1284
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:59,520
tends to be dominant and translate into

1285
00:44:56,719 --> 00:45:01,838
lots of hybrids that you make with it

1286
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:04,559
so it makes up for be and strangely it

1287
00:45:01,838 --> 00:45:07,119
doesn't look very resinous uh it's not

1288
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:08,880
very pretty it sort of looks to me like

1289
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:10,079
ancient um

1290
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,720
it's you know it's like some kind of

1291
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:15,839
ancient ugly afghan yeah i think it's

1292
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:17,679
hideous and in like i see the skunky a

1293
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:19,920
crazy composer those two can make that

1294
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:21,759
[ __ ] look so pretty i i don't know how

1295
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,838
they do it but most grows like even

1296
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:26,720
micros of it i see it is just

1297
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:28,799
cannibalizing its own leaves oh it does

1298
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:30,000
i mean that that actually sour does the

1299
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,560
same thing as that and that's kind of

1300
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,880
why i think but they um there's an

1301
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:36,480
aspect to that where a lot of i'll say

1302
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,318
this and this might piss some people off

1303
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:41,039
or whatever but uh

1304
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:43,920
there's a lot of people that are taking

1305
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:45,358
we would always take the the dog to like

1306
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,358
say 10 weeks

1307
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:50,400
yeah right and that's when we kind of

1308
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:52,480
somewhere between 65 and 72 or 73 days

1309
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,119
depending on how long you could let it

1310
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:57,039
rock you know yeah and uh

1311
00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:00,000
you know it would test somewhere between

1312
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:01,920
you know 18 and 22 or 23 then but it

1313
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,599
knocked your head off yeah and then when

1314
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,318
all this testing [ __ ] came into

1315
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:07,119
effect they realized that that was too

1316
00:46:06,318 --> 00:46:09,440
low

1317
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:12,240
yeah and so some people started cutting

1318
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,880
it at like 53 54 days and you can see

1319
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:16,639
white hairs all over it but it'll test

1320
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,960
at 29

1321
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:21,519
yeah and then so the grower gets to grow

1322
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:23,760
it quicker and turn it quicker

1323
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:26,880
and then the dispensary is happy because

1324
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,720
it gets to put this high thc label on it

1325
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,880
and a lot of people end up on the legal

1326
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:34,000
market these days buying premature chem

1327
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:35,358
dog in my opinion yeah

1328
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
yeah i don't care

1329
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:39,039
i care what it does to my head yeah

1330
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,880
yeah so

1331
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:43,199
it would be nice if it had flavor too

1332
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,119
that helps sometimes this is what i'll

1333
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:47,439
say sometimes and this is just my

1334
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:50,240
personal opinion sometimes

1335
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:52,720
chem dog has amazing flavor

1336
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:55,199
yeah really deep flavor that i love and

1337
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:57,199
i can smell it in the weed and it and

1338
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:59,519
that smell translates

1339
00:46:57,199 --> 00:47:02,000
and like i grow chem dog all the time

1340
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:03,838
and maybe one or two rips a year

1341
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,719
it gives me that flavor

1342
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:06,799
yeah

1343
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:08,559
and i have tried a million different

1344
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,000
ways to figure out whether it's heat

1345
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:11,759
whether it's newt whether it's this

1346
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,760
whether it's that i've grown salt i've

1347
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,440
grown it organic i've grown it every

1348
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,359
which way you can imagine

1349
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:20,000
yeah it's just finicky sometimes it

1350
00:47:17,358 --> 00:47:22,318
gives me the flav sometimes

1351
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,440
the potency is almost always there

1352
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:27,759
yeah it's it it the potency and the high

1353
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:30,000
is pretty is pretty standard

1354
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:32,160
yeah the closest i've seen of that chirp

1355
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,639
extreme was from and i always talk about

1356
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:37,199
this but like it i

1357
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:40,159
like i didn't get the love for chem 91

1358
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:42,399
or the dog as you guys called it until i

1359
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:44,480
smoked a chem 91 hybrid that he had made

1360
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,400
that was very chem 91 dominant in the

1361
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,159
terp but it was just turned to a 10. i

1362
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,079
imagine it's probably how chem 91 was

1363
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:51,199
when you guys first started growing it

1364
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:53,280
and

1365
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:54,960
i understood the love for it after that

1366
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,880
because that that turk profile is

1367
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:59,119
[ __ ] nice and it's very unique i've

1368
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:01,599
never smelled anything close to it it uh

1369
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:03,519
it's in there it's just hard to coax out

1370
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:05,760
and it does do this thing where

1371
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:07,519
you can grow it perfectly organic or

1372
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,760
chem what you know whatever you want to

1373
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:11,679
do and a lot of the times it'll get this

1374
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,200
leaf rust and it'll start cannibalizing

1375
00:48:11,679 --> 00:48:14,639
its leaves and it'll start dying i'll

1376
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:17,279
start looking like [ __ ]

1377
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:19,279
yeah um the bud itself usually stays

1378
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:21,760
perfectly fine yeah

1379
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,440
you know but uh but yeah it's rough i

1380
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,119
see i see a lot of those endless white

1381
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,559
pistols on it too just like no matter

1382
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:27,760
what people do it just will keep

1383
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:29,920
throwing white

1384
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,280
or stigma so i'll throw i'll throw out

1385
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,960
something interesting when you used to

1386
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:36,079
grow it under like hortolox or your

1387
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:38,880
standard whatever yeah it would take 80

1388
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:40,800
it would take 70 like i said 68 72 days

1389
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,559
something like that right yeah i grew a

1390
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,880
bunch of my favorite head stash under

1391
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:47,359
pure ceramic metal halides like a blend

1392
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:50,318
of the 31 and the 42

1393
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:53,279
and the dog [ __ ] got done two weeks

1394
00:48:50,318 --> 00:48:56,800
earlier yeah and i pulled the chem the

1395
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:59,119
chem 91 at 87 days and it still had

1396
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,800
white hairs all over it yeah so it did

1397
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:02,880
this weird thing where the spectrum made

1398
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,920
this sativa finish two weeks faster than

1399
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,079
i'm used to

1400
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,838
yeah and then made the dog go two and a

1401
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:09,839
half weeks longer than i've ever seen it

1402
00:49:07,838 --> 00:49:11,920
and it still wasn't done that's super

1403
00:49:09,838 --> 00:49:14,159
weird who the [ __ ] knows why that is you

1404
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:16,240
know yeah but yeah i mean i've been i've

1405
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:17,920
been growing it since 1998 it's one of

1406
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:20,078
my favorite strains so i usually have

1407
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:22,079
one or two at least going for head yeah

1408
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:24,720
so i've grown it a lot

1409
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:25,839
okay next up your second favorite maybe

1410
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:27,598
ken deep

1411
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:30,799
kim d yeah

1412
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:33,838
uh chem d chem d is cool you know uh

1413
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:36,640
chem d has a different high than chem 91

1414
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:39,599
it's prettier it's frostier much

1415
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:41,039
prettier it smells people's

1416
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:44,480
call it you know i don't like the way

1417
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:48,079
you call it roadkill or dead bodies or

1418
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:50,000
some kind of like decrepit funk i i

1419
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:52,240
always refer to it as like bad breath to

1420
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,239
me but what's weird about it is that i

1421
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:55,759
can crack a jar six feet away from

1422
00:49:54,239 --> 00:49:57,039
someone and they'll be like who's got

1423
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:59,599
the skunk

1424
00:49:57,039 --> 00:50:01,838
yeah but i've also smelled baby [ __ ]

1425
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:03,760
come out of it like pure putrid baby

1426
00:50:01,838 --> 00:50:05,440
[ __ ] but so it has a lot of expressions

1427
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,599
yeah but then you get close to it and

1428
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:10,400
you can't smell that skunk yes you just

1429
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:12,559
smell the putrid yes you know

1430
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:15,200
um and i think i think it's a i think

1431
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:16,640
it's a i think it's a hybrid honestly uh

1432
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:19,838
this might get me in trouble but i think

1433
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:22,480
it's a hybrid of chem 91 and uh super

1434
00:50:19,838 --> 00:50:24,558
skunk yes um and i think the super skunk

1435
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:26,880
gives it its frost and its color it even

1436
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:29,920
herms kind of like the super skunk did

1437
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:31,920
yeah um and like i said uh the chem 91

1438
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:35,200
throws that crazy potency

1439
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:37,519
yeah um so it's a short squat afghan i

1440
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:40,399
would also say that uh there's three or

1441
00:50:37,519 --> 00:50:42,239
four fakes that float around yes um and

1442
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,318
those fakes tended to get

1443
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:46,399
trade baited a lot more than the

1444
00:50:44,318 --> 00:50:48,639
original cut so matt was talking about

1445
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:50,160
how certain cuts got buried by the wave

1446
00:50:48,639 --> 00:50:52,480
of what came after

1447
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:53,598
yes lots and lots of people have fake

1448
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,760
chem d

1449
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:57,920
everybody wanted d but not everybody had

1450
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:01,440
access to d but there was always a bunch

1451
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:03,119
of people willing to to to pass around

1452
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,039
fake versions of it for a little bit of

1453
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:07,119
tinga you know so well and there's this

1454
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:09,119
thing too where it's like when i say

1455
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:10,559
trade baiting what matt and i mean when

1456
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:13,039
we talk about trade baiting is some

1457
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:14,880
people would go after cuts just to get

1458
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:17,440
certain things to be able to trade them

1459
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:20,400
for other things yes so like there was

1460
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:22,400
people like myself or skunk va or others

1461
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,358
that held on onto the the chem d and had

1462
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,519
them and there's different people that

1463
00:51:23,358 --> 00:51:27,039
had it and they held it kind of tight

1464
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:28,960
and then there were some people that got

1465
00:51:27,039 --> 00:51:30,880
it just so they could use that cut to

1466
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:33,838
unlock a bunch of other cuts they wanted

1467
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:35,280
to get access to yes so they spread out

1468
00:51:33,838 --> 00:51:37,039
and it just so happened that they got

1469
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:38,640
some fakes

1470
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:40,079
and even like some pretty reputable

1471
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:41,759
people that like are supposed to know a

1472
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:43,359
bunch got faced yeah so it was it was

1473
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,280
out there there was a bun there's a

1474
00:51:43,358 --> 00:51:47,598
bunch of people and it can be really

1475
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,920
hard to tell in the bag

1476
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:52,240
what you know they look very similar

1477
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:54,720
side-by-side grows usually show you and

1478
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:56,558
to me the real d like it has a potency

1479
00:51:54,719 --> 00:51:57,598
and a flavor the other ones don't

1480
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:59,760
yeah

1481
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:01,200
so there you go on that one

1482
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,720
i have no idea someone just said i have

1483
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:05,519
no idea if the gmo was made with the

1484
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:07,679
real camp i mean gmo was made in spain i

1485
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:10,400
think so i'm very doubtful that it was

1486
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:12,639
used it's a great gmo is a great cut on

1487
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,880
its own so yeah just kind of irrelevant

1488
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:17,440
in the sense that it works good it

1489
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:20,480
yields good it smokes good it

1490
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:23,358
wash is good so you know it's a good cut

1491
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:25,119
yeah um and i i always like when i

1492
00:52:23,358 --> 00:52:27,440
categorize it in my head i always refer

1493
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:30,240
to like the candy i remember it as the

1494
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:32,880
more cushy looking one by its nature how

1495
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:35,199
it stacks and everything and the chem 2

1496
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:38,000
i always remember as the most cushy of

1497
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:40,799
the bunch it was more like little tiny

1498
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,519
nugs looking at all if i'm being real i

1499
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:45,599
think there's there's chem 91 in both

1500
00:52:43,519 --> 00:52:48,239
sour diesel and in chem d

1501
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:50,079
yeah and chem d is sort of like a squat

1502
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:52,799
afghan version

1503
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:53,920
and sours are sort of like a tall lanky

1504
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:57,119
colombian

1505
00:52:53,920 --> 00:53:00,159
uh skunk type version yeah

1506
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:02,400
that's my that's my view okay chem dog

1507
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:04,960
number four

1508
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:07,200
chem dog number four is cool

1509
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,720
uh it's probably the most widely

1510
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:09,598
circulated

1511
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:12,239
chem

1512
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:13,599
yeah uh i would say i didn't see a lot

1513
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:16,000
of fake cuts ever

1514
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:17,599
there's not really fake cuts it yields

1515
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,559
like a champ

1516
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:20,240
um

1517
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:23,760
and uh

1518
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:24,558
it it reminds me a lot of nl5 haze

1519
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:27,359
yes

1520
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:29,200
um our buddy pip who we joke loves to

1521
00:53:27,358 --> 00:53:30,880
take everything 12 weeks no matter how

1522
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:33,439
long it's supposed to take

1523
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:36,318
um i had him take a really nice nug of

1524
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:39,440
chem 4 and put it on top of a picture of

1525
00:53:36,318 --> 00:53:40,880
neville's 1989 nl5 haze

1526
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:42,480
i have it on my phone i can't you know

1527
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:45,519
and but it's like it really is a dead

1528
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,639
ringer yeah um and i if i smoke enough

1529
00:53:45,519 --> 00:53:49,119
chem d

1530
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:50,480
or a chem 4 i get like a raciness in my

1531
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:53,358
chest

1532
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:54,960
yeah it has long running buds it's much

1533
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:56,719
taller

1534
00:53:54,960 --> 00:54:00,240
uh the only thing i'll say about it is

1535
00:53:56,719 --> 00:54:02,959
that uh it takes probably 12 weeks

1536
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:04,318
and a lot of people cut it at 10. yeah i

1537
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:06,720
think a lot of people were cutting it at

1538
00:54:04,318 --> 00:54:08,719
eight to nine like in california so

1539
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:11,358
there's a there's a lot of chemd that

1540
00:54:08,719 --> 00:54:12,799
doesn't make the cut um because most

1541
00:54:11,358 --> 00:54:14,400
people don't want to take it that full

1542
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:16,800
12 weeks

1543
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:19,039
i like that quote the blue dream of gas

1544
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:21,359
yes yeah but if you if you take if you

1545
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:23,440
take the chem 4 84 days or something

1546
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:25,598
like that and you grow it nice it's it's

1547
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:27,760
really nice yeah and i would say no chem

1548
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:30,079
4 is probably one of the furthest from

1549
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:33,520
the original um it looks like nothing it

1550
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:35,119
looks nothing like uh the the chem 91

1551
00:54:33,519 --> 00:54:36,400
actually chem 1 is probably the furthest

1552
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:38,640
from the original but kim ford

1553
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:40,318
definitely is very far from it indeed

1554
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:42,000
yeah um

1555
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:43,759
uh let's see

1556
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,239
we don't have to do the kim sister s1

1557
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:48,640
specifically let's do um we can do the

1558
00:54:46,239 --> 00:54:50,479
kim sis real quick okay go ahead uh the

1559
00:54:48,639 --> 00:54:54,318
kim sis is dead

1560
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:56,559
yes um it exists in a couple of s ones

1561
00:54:54,318 --> 00:54:59,039
one of them is called the bundy cut yep

1562
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:00,480
uh one of them got traded as chem d all

1563
00:54:59,039 --> 00:55:02,079
over the place

1564
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,000
uh mislabeled

1565
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:05,200
my buddy that i always call staten

1566
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,719
island

1567
00:55:05,199 --> 00:55:10,078
confirmed that greg had both the sis and

1568
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:13,358
the dog

1569
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:15,200
in the early 90s yeah and he chose not

1570
00:55:13,358 --> 00:55:17,279
to bring the sis west because he didn't

1571
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:18,558
like the high and it was ugly as [ __ ]

1572
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,559
yeah

1573
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:22,480
so there you go yeah that's that's good

1574
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:24,319
history on it you know

1575
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:26,079
um

1576
00:55:24,318 --> 00:55:28,318
uh cherry slider do you have an

1577
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:30,400
experience with cherry slider no

1578
00:55:28,318 --> 00:55:33,519
it came from a dude named skitty um it

1579
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:35,680
was it was from the early boards um

1580
00:55:33,519 --> 00:55:37,119
i wasn't a big fan of it very leafy

1581
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:39,358
somebody just asked what does the chem

1582
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:40,559
sis skunk va uses i think he uses the

1583
00:55:39,358 --> 00:55:42,880
bundy cut

1584
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:45,200
which is a chem sis s1

1585
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:47,920
uh i talked to greg about the chem sis

1586
00:55:45,199 --> 00:55:49,838
because it since it never came west uh

1587
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,559
with my buddy i never really had a bunch

1588
00:55:49,838 --> 00:55:53,039
of

1589
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:55,359
access to it or anything and he told me

1590
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:57,358
as far as he knew the original was dead

1591
00:55:55,358 --> 00:55:59,358
and there was only some bag seeds that

1592
00:55:57,358 --> 00:56:01,279
existed so

1593
00:55:59,358 --> 00:56:03,358
be that as it may

1594
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,720
all right um you ever [ __ ] with

1595
00:56:03,358 --> 00:56:05,440
chocolate trip

1596
00:56:04,719 --> 00:56:07,838
no

1597
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:09,358
no okay that was a dutch flowers cut

1598
00:56:07,838 --> 00:56:10,798
um the one i grew is the one a lot of

1599
00:56:09,358 --> 00:56:14,159
people grew and i thought it was like a

1600
00:56:10,798 --> 00:56:15,679
c99 probably but no one's ever said that

1601
00:56:14,159 --> 00:56:17,838
like i've never talked to anybody about

1602
00:56:15,679 --> 00:56:20,318
it so maybe i'm just [ __ ] stupid one

1603
00:56:17,838 --> 00:56:22,239
thing i'll say about dutch flowers

1604
00:56:20,318 --> 00:56:23,759
is that i've always i've always i've

1605
00:56:22,239 --> 00:56:25,679
said a bunch on this show that i thought

1606
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:27,839
that weed wasn't ready for modern day

1607
00:56:25,679 --> 00:56:29,919
marketing techniques yeah because we're

1608
00:56:27,838 --> 00:56:31,759
a bunch of like half autistic weirdos

1609
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,358
that hide out with plants but

1610
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:36,160
um you know

1611
00:56:33,358 --> 00:56:38,318
dutch flowers in the forum days

1612
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:40,798

00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:46,559
trip or they're this or that and you'd

1616
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:48,480
read it and they would get people so

1617
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:51,200
hyped for their drop

1619
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:54,239
gorgeous writing about what the weed was

yeah they they did well with let's get a

1626
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,318
professional ad guy in here and evoke

1627
00:57:07,039 --> 00:57:11,199
some language

1628
00:57:08,318 --> 00:57:13,279
yeah they used language very well

1629
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:16,078
they sure did i collected their stuff

1630
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:17,680
heavily and even after i found out like

1631
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:20,160
by growing a bunch of it that it was

1632
00:57:17,679 --> 00:57:21,919
really it was either just stuff renamed

1633
00:57:20,159 --> 00:57:24,159
or just not very

1634
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:26,240
interesting you know um people are

1635
00:57:24,159 --> 00:57:28,719
asking questions real quick that that

1636
00:57:26,239 --> 00:57:31,279
are going way too fast

1637
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:32,639
so i'm apologize if your question

1638
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,960
doesn't get picked up because we're

1639
00:57:32,639 --> 00:57:35,920
trying to chat and whatnot

1640
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:37,920
um

1641
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:40,880
but i will say someone just mentioned

1642
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:41,838
pot of gold pot of gold was a uh

1643
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:44,318
um

1644
00:57:41,838 --> 00:57:46,159
pot of gold and uh was it was one of my

1645
00:57:44,318 --> 00:57:47,358
favorite probably my favorite thing that

1646
00:57:46,159 --> 00:57:49,440
came from

1647
00:57:47,358 --> 00:57:52,400
the flying dutchman

1648
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:54,880
and it was a hindu kush by skunk one

1649
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:56,480
yeah it was a very very flavorful strain

1650
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:58,720
i liked it a whole bunch they also had

1651
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:00,639
this other thing called the real mccoy

1652
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:02,399
which was a hawaiian by scott and they

1653
00:58:00,639 --> 00:58:04,798
might be on the list but there's a it

1654
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:06,318
was a hawaiian by skunk one that was

1655
00:58:04,798 --> 00:58:08,400
also super good

1656
00:58:06,318 --> 00:58:09,920
um i liked both of those a bunch and

1657
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,559
then the final good question i thought

1658
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:13,599
was gravity from neville

1659
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:15,839
um

1660
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:18,640
we think although we're not sure

1661
00:58:15,838 --> 00:58:22,519
it seems like gravity is unreleased

1662
00:58:18,639 --> 00:58:22,519
versions of black domino

1663
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:30,960
uh so black domina was a scentsy release

1664
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:33,119
it was um hash plant by nl1

1665
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:35,280
by uh garlic

1666
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:37,200
yeah but he had a few different versions

1667
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,798
that he made before he released it and i

1668
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:41,279
think gravity is one of the two

1669
00:58:38,798 --> 00:58:43,599
unreleased versions

1670
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:45,680
uh yes metal haze is one of the dutch

1671
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:47,280
flowers ones as well uh that was

1672
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:48,960
basically a skunk haze and it was

1673
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,040
definitely one of the ones that they got

1674
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:53,519
people drooling

1675
00:58:51,039 --> 00:58:55,039
over releasing it i grew a bunch of that

1676
00:58:53,519 --> 00:58:57,199
one as well but we are going in

1677
00:58:55,039 --> 00:58:59,279
[ __ ] alphabetical all right

1678
00:58:57,199 --> 00:59:01,919
i'm [ __ ] it up so whatever

1679
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:03,359
you got damn pendejos so um

1680
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:06,240
uh let's see

1681
00:59:03,358 --> 00:59:07,920
um cotton candy

1682
00:59:06,239 --> 00:59:10,000
cotton candy did you ever grow a cotton

1683
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:12,000
candy cup i did grow a cotton candy i

1684
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,239
wish i knew more about it

1685
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:17,679
um and i actually recently grew a cotton

1686
00:59:14,239 --> 00:59:19,598
candy s1 through my my my buddy who

1687
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:21,519
lives near me that i've traded back and

1688
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:22,798
forth with for forever i don't know

1689
00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:24,239
anything about the lineage of the

1690
00:59:22,798 --> 00:59:25,920
backstory of it

1691
00:59:24,239 --> 00:59:27,919
um but i did like it

1692
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:30,159
it was federation seeds cotton candy was

1693
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:31,920
the one that i was familiar with and

1694
00:59:30,159 --> 00:59:33,679
like most stuff from federation there's

1695
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:36,639
um a lot of

1696
00:59:33,679 --> 00:59:38,960
accusations of name renaming whatnot so

1697
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:40,798
i'm not sure what it really is but i've

1698
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,400
always been a big fan of it you know i

1699
00:59:40,798 --> 00:59:43,920
liked cotton candy i think that it'll

1700
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,280
make a comeback one day just because

1701
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:47,200
it's of its name

1702
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:49,119
and it's a structure it had a good

1703
00:59:47,199 --> 00:59:52,318
modern look to it

1704
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:54,960
yeah somebody just threw in uh uh

1705
00:59:52,318 --> 00:59:56,960
scentsy star genetics um luke from

1706
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:58,880
paradise seeds is scentsy star

1707
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:01,119
sensitizer is an amazing line

1708
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:03,039
he refuses to talk any lineage or

1709
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:04,559
history that i'm aware of about

1710
01:00:03,039 --> 01:00:07,279
specifics

1711
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:10,480
of scentsy star uh matt myself our buddy

1712
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:13,440
pip others have been hunting forever

1713
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:15,760
for real information uh don't know

1714
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:16,880
yeah yeah i i've tried recently with

1715
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,799
luke and

1716
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:21,519
and i highly respect luke like he's one

1717
01:00:18,798 --> 01:00:24,079
of the most respected um actual breeders

1718
01:00:21,519 --> 01:00:26,798
over in amsterdam by other seed makers

1719
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:29,519
and breeders he's a very serious breeder

1720
01:00:26,798 --> 01:00:32,079
but it came from a different era where a

1721
01:00:29,519 --> 01:00:33,599
lot of people stole his his genetics but

1722
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:36,318
he would give out testers people would

1723
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:39,200
release it before he even released it so

1724
01:00:36,318 --> 01:00:40,960
uh yeah i would say a lot of the um

1725
01:00:39,199 --> 01:00:44,399
people like uh

1726
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:46,240
simon from serious seeds luke uh others

1727
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:48,000
they didn't see any benefit in giving

1728
01:00:46,239 --> 01:00:49,759
out lineage that their competitors would

1729
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,559
just steal and claim to have the same

1730
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,640
thing

1731
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:54,720
so neville was extremely open about what

1732
01:00:52,639 --> 01:00:56,239
he used and where he got it and every

1733
01:00:54,719 --> 01:00:57,759
other dutch person after that was

1734
01:00:56,239 --> 01:00:59,358
tight-lipped as [ __ ]

1735
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,799
yeah i would say that's probably

1736
01:00:59,358 --> 01:01:02,318
accurate right yeah that's super

1737
01:01:00,798 --> 01:01:04,318
accurate yeah they got they got very

1738
01:01:02,318 --> 01:01:06,960
tight-lipped they saw no benefit to

1739
01:01:04,318 --> 01:01:08,558
revealing what it was made of it was all

1740
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:10,880
their secret sauce they didn't want

1741
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:12,880
anybody stealing the genetics and they

1742
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:15,680
didn't even want anybody writing similar

1743
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:17,519
genetics on their own packaging

1744
01:01:15,679 --> 01:01:18,960
yeah so they just kept quiet about it so

1745
01:01:17,519 --> 01:01:20,559
i don't we don't know what scentsy star

1746
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:24,798
is we don't know what aka is we don't

1747
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:24,798
know what cali mist is please don't

1748
01:01:30,159 --> 01:01:34,399
is something that we have a really good

1749
01:01:32,239 --> 01:01:36,879
friend of ours on the discord

1750
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:39,119
um that is probably more suited to talk

1751
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:42,000
cough history than us

1752
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:43,599
but cough is very likely an nl5 haze

1753
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,440
fino

1754
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:47,440
it came out of connecticut

1755
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:50,000
in the early 90s and it made its way to

1756
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:53,039
colorado most people refer to it as the

1757
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,639
fort collins cough but it did start on

1758
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:56,960
the east coast

1759
01:01:54,639 --> 01:02:00,078
um it's uh it's an nl fight to me it's

1760
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:02,079
an it's an nl5 haze yeah it grows like

1761
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:05,119
it it smokes like it it's got the buzz

1762
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:07,359
like it um it's a it's one of those you

1763
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:09,119
know it's one of the surviving nl5 haze

1764
01:02:07,358 --> 01:02:11,920
phenos in america

1765
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:13,680
um there was cough one and cough two

1766
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:16,559
which were hybrids of that which have

1767
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:18,798
their own sort of story behind them

1768
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:20,880
um he might be good maybe we'll have him

1769
01:02:18,798 --> 01:02:23,038
on one day to promote he breeds and does

1770
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:24,640
cool [ __ ] and he's

1771
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:26,240
a good friend of ours and he knows a lot

1772
01:02:24,639 --> 01:02:27,440
of the story

1773
01:02:26,239 --> 01:02:30,558
but that's the baby

1774
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:31,838
he just did a um an interview with dude

1775
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:34,079
grow shows

1776
01:02:31,838 --> 01:02:35,759
a working man where he gives the whole

1777
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:36,880
history that he knows of the cough that

1778
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,640
people want to watch it was just

1779
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:41,119
recently uploaded and he's a trustworthy

1780
01:02:38,639 --> 01:02:43,679
character and he's had it for 20 plus

1781
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:45,280
years and yeah you know he knows most of

1782
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:46,558
the people involved that brought it to

1783
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:49,519
colorado

1784
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:51,519
so you know um it's a great cut it's one

1785
01:02:49,519 --> 01:02:54,159
of the survive it's i would say i've

1786
01:02:51,519 --> 01:02:56,798
i've said this before too but nl5 hayes

1787
01:02:54,159 --> 01:03:00,078
probably has the most surviving

1788
01:02:56,798 --> 01:03:00,960
cuts around of any 90s cross

1789
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:02,960
yeah

1790
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:03,838
i would say so that between europe and

1791
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:05,519
here

1792
01:03:03,838 --> 01:03:06,639
um and that's one of them

1793
01:03:05,519 --> 01:03:09,679
yep

1794
01:03:06,639 --> 01:03:12,480
so it's a great cut yield's huge

1795
01:03:09,679 --> 01:03:14,399
takes a while takes 12 13 weeks

1796
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:15,280
you know but there you go

1797
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:17,358

1804
01:03:27,519 --> 01:03:31,440
yeah it's it's it was an awesome cut

1805

most of the blueberries that were around

1808
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:39,358

1817
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:57,440
legends behind it it was supposedly

1818
01:03:54,159 --> 01:04:00,480
grown by monks in central california

1819
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:02,798
um i will say that my my buddy who gave

1820
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:04,400
me both the super skunk and the chem

1821
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:06,000
it was his favorite weed that he could

1822
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:08,559
get on dead door

1823
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:12,000
and supposedly there was big sir holy

1824
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:14,079
skunk and big sir holy haze oh

1825
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,318
interesting and both were sold on dead

1826
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:17,519
tour and he swears

1827
01:04:16,318 --> 01:04:20,480
that

1828
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:22,960
big sir holy had such a unique smell

1829
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:24,798
that you could have somebody walk by and

1830
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:25,838
that was like the fanny pack era you

1831
01:04:24,798 --> 01:04:27,440
know

1832
01:04:25,838 --> 01:04:28,719
you could have somebody walk by and not

1833
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:30,000
only could you tell that they had good

1834
01:04:28,719 --> 01:04:32,078
weed you could tell that they had the

1835
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,000
big sir holy yeah

1836
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:36,000
um and then there's a gut there's some

1837
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,920
guys obviously that

1838
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,079
brought some seeds and some stuff that

1839
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:41,920
have some legend uh to it that brought

1840
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:43,920
it to maybe adam dunn or somebody like

1841
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:45,920
that and they had this supposedly they

1842
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:47,599
mixed it into sage

1843
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,960
um but that's

1844
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:50,640
you know it's working

1845
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:52,798
didn't make sage but so he wouldn't have

1846
01:04:50,639 --> 01:04:54,558
been told i can never pronounce this but

1847
01:04:52,798 --> 01:04:55,759
it's supposedly descended maybe from

1848
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:58,240
purple

1849
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:59,920
oh the z hots nejo purple yeah yeah and

1850
01:04:58,239 --> 01:05:01,679
and they also refer to it as zac attack

1851
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:03,519
as purple because zakatekis is a z and

1852
01:05:01,679 --> 01:05:06,318
easier to pronounce but yeah it was the

1853
01:05:03,519 --> 01:05:08,400
zhua tanejo purple that's so the

1854
01:05:06,318 --> 01:05:10,798
phonics truck never stopped by my house

1855
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:13,358
so i just let matt take that one because

1856
01:05:10,798 --> 01:05:15,199
i was gonna mangle it bad

1857
01:05:13,358 --> 01:05:16,960
if i tried to say it but there's a bunch

1858
01:05:15,199 --> 01:05:20,239
of rumors about it it's a legendary

1859
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:22,079
strain one of my oldest friends uh it

1860
01:05:20,239 --> 01:05:23,919
was his favorite weed on dead tour and

1861
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:24,880
it was sold on dead tour two different

1862
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,920
types

1863
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:28,400
yeah

1864
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:29,760
yeah yeah i i don't know what's been

1865
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:32,400
proven about it but it hasn't been

1866
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:34,640
proven about it um i know that that's

1867
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:36,400
supposedly one of the key ingredients in

1868
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:38,400
scentsy star um

1869
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:39,519
that was from a direct quote from adam

1870
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:42,240
dunn but

1871
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:43,920
thank you for what it is um

1872
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:45,439
yeah you know there's the dance people

1873
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,798
are asking a bunch of questions and

1874
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:49,039
stuff like that and we're trying to go

1875
01:05:46,798 --> 01:05:50,639
through this stuff so you know there's

1876
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:54,079
there's good questions we're not going

1877
01:05:50,639 --> 01:05:55,199
to get to them all which i apologize

1878
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:57,119
i mean we're trying to do this in

1879
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:59,118
alphabetical order or some kind of order

1880
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:00,720
so if you guys are asking for [ __ ] down

1881
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:03,039
in the asses it'll be a while because

1882
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:03,038
like this

1883
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:09,599
[Laughter]

1884
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:11,838
yeah i'm determined to keep this in some

1885
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:14,240
kind of [ __ ] order okay day record

1886
01:06:11,838 --> 01:06:14,239
diesel

1887
01:06:14,318 --> 01:06:19,920
uh you know i um that one has a lot of

1888
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:22,240
legend to it

1889
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:25,039
uh and i think because it has a lot of

1890
01:06:22,239 --> 01:06:26,798
legend and not a lot of like

1891
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:29,440
like information

1892
01:06:26,798 --> 01:06:30,318
there's a lot of claims made about it

1893
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:32,000
yeah

1894
01:06:30,318 --> 01:06:34,719
like some people refer to the day

1895
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,798
wrecker as the first real headband

1896
01:06:34,719 --> 01:06:38,879
yeah although the original crew that had

1897
01:06:36,798 --> 01:06:40,239
the first headband never called it that

1898
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:43,039
at all

1899
01:06:40,239 --> 01:06:44,558
yeah you know um you know it's uh you

1900
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:46,640
know diesel is one of the most famous

1901
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:48,720
american families

1902
01:06:46,639 --> 01:06:50,960
yeah and there's a lot of nicknames that

1903
01:06:48,719 --> 01:06:52,879
get attached to it i've never ran

1904
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:55,039
anything that i thought was day record

1905
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:55,920
diesel that had any kind of

1906
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:58,240
um

1907
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:00,559
any kind of verifiable story

1908
01:06:58,239 --> 01:07:01,919
yeah i i've done a deep dive and it's

1909
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:03,839
actually on the breeders syndicate

1910
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:06,000
youtube i believe it's up there and you

1911
01:07:03,838 --> 01:07:07,838
can watch it up there i recently made it

1912
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,838
available um

1913
01:07:07,838 --> 01:07:12,078
i did a deep dive on trying to uh

1914
01:07:09,838 --> 01:07:14,159
research provenance based on internet

1915
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:16,559
research on the day record diesel and i

1916
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:18,719
got not very far it doesn't go back very

1917
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:21,359
far but the clone's been around a long

1918
01:07:18,719 --> 01:07:23,519
time so it's really hard to find things

1919
01:07:21,358 --> 01:07:25,759
other than like some some tour manager

1920
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:28,880
from grateful dead kind of gave it out

1921
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:32,160
to some people and that's likely where

1922
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:33,680
the where it begins the story but um it

1923
01:07:32,159 --> 01:07:36,639
it does appear to be some kind of chem

1924
01:07:33,679 --> 01:07:37,838
91 hybrid to me like chem 91 early og

1925
01:07:36,639 --> 01:07:40,480
type hybrid

1926
01:07:37,838 --> 01:07:42,400
um super nice it's really potent it's

1927
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:44,559
ripping potent and breeds for that

1928
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:46,400
potency i love the cut but i just don't

1929
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:49,519
know if it's the original diesel like it

1930
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:49,519
claims probably not

1931
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:55,520
what's the next one

1932
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:57,519
uh we got dog [ __ ] electric boogaloo oh

1933
01:07:55,519 --> 01:08:00,559
i know so okay so

1934
01:07:57,519 --> 01:08:03,199
uh the dog [ __ ] electric boogaloo was it

1935
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:06,000
it came out of minneapolis area

1936
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:09,439
minnesota in the very early 90s

1937
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:11,199
it's supposed to be a nl5 haze

1938
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:13,519
i wouldn't say that's a hundred percent

1939
01:08:11,199 --> 01:08:15,759
guaranteed it's conjecture a little bit

1940
01:08:13,519 --> 01:08:19,359
but boy does it really

1941
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:22,000
i think it is uh it made its way to uh

1942
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:26,719
oregon and got renamed dog [ __ ]

1943
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:28,399
which is a shame um because it was uh

1944
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:30,158
i think electric boogaloo is one of the

1945
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:31,358
coolest

1946
01:08:30,158 --> 01:08:33,519
weed names

1947
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:36,319
yeah it is um

1948
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:38,880
i grow it i like it a bunch

1949
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:41,839
it's uh um

1950
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:43,359
you know it's a 12 or 13 week

1951
01:08:41,838 --> 01:08:44,880
uh sativa

1952
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:46,880
very up high

1953
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:49,279
uh and it kind of looks like to me like

1954
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:51,600
classic 90s

1955
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:54,159
northern lights uh it kind of smells

1956
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:56,400
like classic 90s sweet to me yeah it's

1957
01:08:54,158 --> 01:08:58,559
it's it's one of the pretty if if it is

1958
01:08:56,399 --> 01:09:02,158
pure nl5 haze it's one of the prettier

1959

01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:15,520
if you can get it or get hybrids of it

1965

uh i enjoy it quite a bit

1966
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:19,440
so this is one that's totally i have no

1967
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,560
experience with at all but you might

1968
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:22,000
dumpster

1969
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:23,839
dumpster

1970
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:25,119
uh dumpster

1971
01:09:23,838 --> 01:09:27,278
is

1972
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:30,318
uh

1973
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:32,640
supposedly the story of dumpster is that

1974
01:09:30,319 --> 01:09:34,880
a guy got busted

1975
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:36,000
right and the cops in the 90s were

1976
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:39,039
throwing

1977
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,640
all of his equipment and his weed out

1978
01:09:39,039 --> 01:09:42,319
in a dumpster

1979
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:44,159
and while they were upstairs [ __ ]

1980
01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:45,759
with it some people walked by and saw

1981
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:47,358
weed plants

1982
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:49,679
uh sticking out of the dumpster and

1983
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:50,480
grabbed one and ran off with it

1984
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:53,440
and

1985
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:56,479
they named it dumpster yeah

1986
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:59,119
likely story so i mean it might be real

1987
01:09:56,479 --> 01:10:00,799
who knows that's the story behind it

1988
01:09:59,119 --> 01:10:03,519
whether or not that story is true or

1989
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:05,279
whether it's a tail or whatever

1990
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:07,840
um that doesn't give you a lot of

1991
01:10:05,279 --> 01:10:10,158
information about its lineage yeah

1992
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:13,119
obviously but you know

1993
01:10:10,158 --> 01:10:14,960
um g13 we did just a few weeks ago with

1994
01:10:13,119 --> 01:10:17,039
archive we just uploaded it we went into

1995
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:18,960
more detail on it so we can skip over

1996
01:10:17,039 --> 01:10:21,119
that one for now um

1997
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:23,039
the golden [ __ ] goat

1998
01:10:21,119 --> 01:10:26,000

funky [ __ ] or something

2004
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:41,198
like that um i think it was a

2005
01:10:39,198 --> 01:10:43,359
iss romulan

2006
01:10:41,198 --> 01:10:45,279

01:10:45,279 --> 01:10:51,119
somewhere else island sweet skunk is

2009
01:10:47,439 --> 01:10:52,960

really yep 100

2011
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:56,800
um i know multiple canadians that have

2012
01:10:54,880 --> 01:11:00,640
told me that

2013
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:01,600
and uh supposedly it got renamed by mark

2014
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:04,560
emery

2015
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:07,199
yeah who wanted skunk seeds

2016
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:09,600
to sell in his catalog um but it is

2017
01:11:07,198 --> 01:11:11,039
supposedly an nl5

2018
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:13,280
haze fino

2019
01:11:11,039 --> 01:11:16,319
um you know and it was crossed to

2020
01:11:13,279 --> 01:11:18,238
something from uh

2021
01:11:16,319 --> 01:11:21,198
the one that got sold from marc emery

2022
01:11:18,238 --> 01:11:22,399
was crossed to something um that breeder

2023
01:11:21,198 --> 01:11:24,238
steve had

2024
01:11:22,399 --> 01:11:25,759
i can't remember i could get the story

2025
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:27,198
it's not popping up in my head right on

2026
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:28,880
the top of my head but that's that's

2027
01:11:27,198 --> 01:11:31,439
what it is yeah and they're right

2028
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:33,440
actually uh mr dink was from kansas that

2029
01:11:31,439 --> 01:11:35,519
is correct i don't know why i said

2030
01:11:33,439 --> 01:11:36,960
caller it got real popular in colorado i

2031
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:39,199
think maybe he moved there i might be

2032
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:40,960
wrong on that but it got super popular

2033
01:11:39,198 --> 01:11:42,639
at colorado for a long time

2034
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:44,640
and yeah island sweet scone hybrid of

2035
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:46,880
steve's uh sweet skunk and that's why he

2036
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:50,400
flipped out about it um sweet skunk

2037
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:51,920
widow there we go sweet skunk widow iss

2038
01:11:50,399 --> 01:11:53,839
um

2039
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:55,359
yeah i mean that's what steve says it is

2040
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:56,880
and the federation supposedly changed

2041
01:11:55,359 --> 01:11:57,920
the name in his story

2042
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:59,600
um

2043
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:01,920
but yeah it was i thought golden goat

2044
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:03,840
was very frosty it was a nice like

2045
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:06,480
narrow leaf dominant plant i liked it a

2046
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:07,760
lot um but yeah it was it was one of

2047
01:12:06,479 --> 01:12:09,439
those ones that got overblown in

2048
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:11,119
colorado so a lot of people just kind of

2049
01:12:09,439 --> 01:12:12,319
[ __ ] talked it after a time but i

2050
01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:14,559
thought it was pretty good i thought it

2051
01:12:12,319 --> 01:12:17,840
was decent um

2052
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:17,840
the granddaddy purple

2053
01:12:19,279 --> 01:12:23,599
so

2054
01:12:20,319 --> 01:12:25,679
granddaddy purple came about um in the

2055
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:28,000
purple craze era

2056
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:29,199
i would say that the probably the first

2057
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,158
two

2058
01:12:29,198 --> 01:12:36,559
purple cuts that got famous right then

2059
01:12:32,158 --> 01:12:39,920
uh was my mendo perps and the urkel

2060
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:42,640
um and then right around that same time

2061
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:45,039
lavender came up there's a debate

2062
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:46,880
uh between whether or not lavender was

2063
01:12:45,039 --> 01:12:49,198
massively different than urkel or was

2064
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:51,039
just a different little fino

2065
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:53,519
my buddy that i was just talking about

2066
01:12:51,039 --> 01:12:55,760
uh that lives over in lake county i

2067
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:56,560
remember 20 22 years ago something like

2068
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:59,199
that

2069
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:00,800
um he had brought down the lavender

2070
01:12:59,198 --> 01:13:04,559
from uh

2071
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:06,480

the urkel

2073
01:13:06,479 --> 01:13:10,158
and we like looked at it and it was like

2074
01:13:08,158 --> 01:13:12,079
the same it was like almost as close to

2075
01:13:10,158 --> 01:13:14,799
the same weed as you could imagine

2076
01:13:12,079 --> 01:13:19,359

people that worked for him and stuff

2084
01:13:31,359 --> 01:13:35,119
like that said that they don't believe

2085
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:36,960
that because they never saw

2086
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:38,479
it

2087
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:40,800

and uh grew a bunch of hate and grew a

2123
01:14:57,679 --> 01:15:02,079
bunch of sativas and started mixing them

2124
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:03,600
with local afghans and sort of had his

2125
01:15:02,079 --> 01:15:04,559
own which was really common at the time

2126
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:06,480
his own

2127
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:07,440
his own hill wheat

01:15:06,479 --> 01:15:08,559
right

2129
01:15:07,439 --> 01:15:11,599
and then

2130
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:13,440
um he was retiring uh because he'd done

2131
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:15,760
really well and he gave he gave her a

2132

2134
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:19,840
and um

2135

2138
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:30,559
helped her build it actually she

2139
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:31,599
partnered on a 66 lighter with uh ken

2140
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:33,120
estes

2141
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:35,760
yeah right i can say his full name

2142
01:15:33,119 --> 01:15:37,840
because he's he's well known yeah um and

2143
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:40,320
she gave the cut to him

2144
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:42,560
she's a super anarchist had no interest

2145
01:15:40,319 --> 01:15:44,319
in being public or anything like that

2146
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:46,960
ken took it down to the bay and added

2147
01:15:44,319 --> 01:15:49,198
his name to it of course he's one of the

2148
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:50,800
first people i know of that added his

2149
01:15:49,198 --> 01:15:53,519
name to a cut

2150
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:55,039
yep you know later on other people

2151
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:56,400
started doing that taking cuts that

2152
01:15:55,039 --> 01:15:59,198
weren't theirs and throwing their name

2153
01:15:56,399 --> 01:16:01,439
on it as part of claiming it yeah um and

2154
01:15:59,198 --> 01:16:03,279
he's given some mangled versions of that

2155
01:16:01,439 --> 01:16:05,678
story i just told

2156
01:16:03,279 --> 01:16:07,599
yeah because he didn't actually have any

2157
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:08,880
part to do with the origin story he got

2158
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:11,360
it from my friend

2159
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:13,679
yeah and um the interview that i post

2160
01:16:11,359 --> 01:16:15,920
all the time of ken telling his origin

2161
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:18,719
stories at first he says it was a

2162
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:21,039
a skunk from a vietnam vet that quickly

2163
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:23,840
turns into a native american gifted it

2164
01:16:21,039 --> 01:16:25,920
to him in front of a um some headlights

2165
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:26,719
because he was such a wonderful white

2166
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:28,158
man

2167
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:30,480
um so yeah

2168
01:16:28,158 --> 01:16:32,960
so he turned it into a seed line that he

2169
01:16:30,479 --> 01:16:36,479
helpfully called ken's gdp

2170
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:38,880
yep um and all that and so

2171
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:40,079
um but my version of it and i knew them

2172
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:42,560
at the time

2173
01:16:40,079 --> 01:16:44,479
was that she gave it to him

2174
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:46,239
yeah and that you know and this is back

2175
01:16:44,479 --> 01:16:47,759
in the early 2000s or whatever when

2176
01:16:46,238 --> 01:16:49,519
everyone wanted to stay invisible

2177
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:52,079
especially if you were running 60 70

2178
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:54,560
lights and off a generator in the woods

2179
01:16:52,079 --> 01:16:56,559
sure and he decided to go down and flow

2180
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:58,080
it into the bay and flow it into third

2181
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:00,159
floor and flow it into various

2182
01:16:58,079 --> 01:17:01,600
dispensaries and made a name for himself

2183
01:17:00,158 --> 01:17:03,119
yeah

2184
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:04,079
so you can choose what you want to

2185
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:05,439
believe

2186
01:17:04,079 --> 01:17:07,119
yeah about all that

2187
01:17:05,439 --> 01:17:10,559
okay here's here's another one that ties

2188
01:17:07,119 --> 01:17:10,559
straight into it and that's great

2189
01:17:12,238 --> 01:17:18,000
kyle cushman's is it it was he the

2190
01:17:15,119 --> 01:17:20,399
inventor was it brett bogue from um

2191
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,560
apothecary was he the inventor of the

2192
01:17:20,399 --> 01:17:24,799
grape vape who who is who is the creator

2193
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:26,800
of great bait

2194
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:27,679
this might also get me in trouble

2195
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:28,960
um

2196
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:31,039
but uh

2197
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:33,439
so i'll say this okay and i'll just let

2198
01:17:31,039 --> 01:17:35,840
people decide yeah um

2199
01:17:33,439 --> 01:17:38,479
you know as as everyone is well aware

2200
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:40,560
uh you know when things become famous

2201
01:17:38,479 --> 01:17:43,519
quickly one or two famous cuts start

2202
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:46,480
getting renamed or hybrids or bag seeds

2203
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:48,719
start getting named because there's this

2204
01:17:46,479 --> 01:17:50,158
there's this you know um big push to

2205
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:51,679
have your own [ __ ]

2206
01:17:50,158 --> 01:17:53,519
yeah it happened with kush it happened

2207
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:55,679
with cookie it happened with

2208
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:57,600
the purple crates right

2209
01:17:55,679 --> 01:17:59,520
so at first there was just mendo perps

2210
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:02,560
and urkel then all of a sudden there was

2211
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:05,760
mendo perps urkel grape apes gdp

2212
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:07,840
platinum purple purple dragon

2213
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:08,800
on and on and on and on right yeah

2214
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:11,360
so

2215
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:13,119
uh some people think that grape ape came

2216
01:18:11,359 --> 01:18:17,599
out of willets some people think that

2217
01:18:13,119 --> 01:18:19,519
grape ape um was just a rename okay

2218
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:21,600
um but there's a gentleman

2219
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:24,000
uh you can find him on the internet he

2220
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:26,880

and brought the grape ape to mendo

2225
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:38,719
so he claims that

2226
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:41,199
um kyle cushman had nothing to do with

2227

it other than kyle cushman moved to

2228
01:18:41,198 --> 01:18:44,719

2229
01:18:42,238 --> 01:18:45,759

from him

2233
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:52,560
very very very good but kyle had

2234
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:54,079
absolutely nothing to do with it

2235
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:55,679
whatsoever if you want to give anybody

2236

2241
01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:05,679
yeah

2242
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:07,360
you know with a lot of these outlaw

2243
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:08,480
stories and stuff it's kind of who you

2244
01:19:07,359 --> 01:19:10,079
choose to believe

2245
01:19:08,479 --> 01:19:12,238
i remember there was also the story that

2246
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:13,920
it was urkel shiva scott as well and

2247
01:19:12,238 --> 01:19:16,319
just that's just what went around with

2248
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:18,640
it i mean me and modi both referred to

2249
01:19:16,319 --> 01:19:19,759
it as purple's pretty sister it showed

2250
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:22,400
up

2251
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:23,840
after the purple craze was what i mean

2252
01:19:22,399 --> 01:19:25,679
i'll explain the purple craze for a

2253
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:27,440
minute when i mean the purple craze i

2254
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:30,319
mean that there was brokers coming up

2255
01:19:27,439 --> 01:19:32,000
from the bay to mendo and saying we will

2256
01:19:30,319 --> 01:19:33,519
buy every gram

2257
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,600
of this purple weeb that you can get

2258
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:37,360
your hands on yeah you have 50 of them

2259
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:40,159
you have 80 of them you have 150 of them

2260
01:19:37,359 --> 01:19:42,079
you have 250 of them i'll cash you out

2261
01:19:40,158 --> 01:19:43,920
and so what happens to growers when they

2262
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:45,679
start hearing brokers want to cash you

2263
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:47,520
out on however much you have

2264
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:49,840
yeah and so your neighbor is like dude

2265
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:51,679
i'm having some trouble moving my weed

2266
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:53,119
it's not going as fast as i want and the

2267
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:55,119
neighbor's like well i'll give you this

2268
01:19:53,119 --> 01:19:57,119
cut and you just give it all to me

2269
01:19:55,119 --> 01:19:58,000
yeah and i'll move everything you got of

2270
01:19:57,119 --> 01:19:58,800
it

2271
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,640
yeah

2272
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:02,880
right so

2273
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:05,760
you know and then after a craze happens

2274
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:07,840
like that um all these different names

2275
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:09,520
pop up right

2276
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:11,360
so you know it went from one or two

2277
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:12,800
purple strains to eight or ten of them

2278
01:20:11,359 --> 01:20:14,719
within a year or two

2279
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:16,880
yeah and it probably would have lasted

2280
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:19,039
longer but sort of the cush

2281
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:20,000
the kush craze and the sour diesel thing

2282
01:20:19,039 --> 01:20:21,679
happened

2283
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,560
and sort of pushed the purples to the

2284
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:23,679
side

2285
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:25,520
yeah

2286
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:27,039
you know

2287
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:30,000
so that's right

2288
01:20:27,039 --> 01:20:32,399
green crack also known as green cush

2289
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,760
with the sea

2290
01:20:32,399 --> 01:20:36,879
um

2291
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:38,239
i you know i i don't have a verifiable

2292
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:40,400
story

2293
01:20:38,238 --> 01:20:42,000
behind it you know i know people claim

2294
01:20:40,399 --> 01:20:43,198
various things you might know more about

2295
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,399
it than i do that you might want to

2296
01:20:43,198 --> 01:20:47,198
speak on it

2297
01:20:44,399 --> 01:20:49,439
to me it's some kind of skunk one

2298
01:20:47,198 --> 01:20:51,039
yeah it grows like a skunk i don't know

2299
01:20:49,439 --> 01:20:52,638
that it's pure skunk or anything like

2300
01:20:51,039 --> 01:20:55,198
that but boy

2301
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:58,400
it grows and a lot of i think a lot of

2302
01:20:55,198 --> 01:21:01,759
like uh dna's lemon skunk and all that

2303
01:20:58,399 --> 01:21:03,359
[ __ ] is just a prettier name

2304
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:06,000
for green crack

2305
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:08,000
oh interesting yeah um

2306
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,679
um it was called green kush when it

2307
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,679
entered our circle and i got it through

2308
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:13,679
the hogs family circle

2309
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:16,719
um so it was originally whenever it was

2310
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:18,560
on the tags it was always cush kush and

2311
01:21:16,719 --> 01:21:20,480
no cecil did not make green crack or

2312
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:22,320
have anything to do with it how cecil's

2313
01:21:20,479 --> 01:21:24,638
name entered it and me and cecil went

2314
01:21:22,319 --> 01:21:26,399
over this specifically because i was one

2315
01:21:24,639 --> 01:21:27,840
of the first people to bring green crack

2316
01:21:26,399 --> 01:21:29,439
into seed form to the community and

2317
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:31,520
stuff so i wanted to hunt down the

2318
01:21:29,439 --> 01:21:34,399
history on it and i had heard the same

2319
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:37,040
thing with cecil his crew had a seed

2320
01:21:34,399 --> 01:21:38,319
line called kush c-u-s-h

2321
01:21:37,039 --> 01:21:40,639
and

2322
01:21:38,319 --> 01:21:43,840
that's as far as the connection went it

2323
01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:45,920
was that they both had renamed cushes

2324
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:47,920
and and they were both spelled c but

2325
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:49,440
that's as far as the connection went um

2326
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:51,920
yeah i think it's probably a skunk one

2327
01:21:49,439 --> 01:21:53,759
type because it's super mango um with a

2328
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:55,600
little bit of cold it would turn mega

2329
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:57,520
mega purple it also bred true for that

2330
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:59,360
purple trait and it would show up

2331
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:02,159
genetically as opposed to just with cold

2332
01:21:59,359 --> 01:22:03,519
and its hybrids um i think i i want to

2333
01:22:02,158 --> 01:22:05,599
see it come back but it's one of those

2334
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:07,280
clones that was everywhere and now is

2335
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:09,679
nowhere all at once

2336
01:22:07,279 --> 01:22:11,119
um i'll say the same thing

2337
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:13,760
i'll say the same thing about i said

2338
01:22:11,119 --> 01:22:16,559
about blue dream you grow a four to six

2339
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:19,440
or seven ounce plant of green crack

2340
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:21,600
it's really nice weed yeah you grow a

2341
01:22:19,439 --> 01:22:23,119
five or eight pound plant in the outdoor

2342
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:24,560
and beat the [ __ ] out of it and don't

2343
01:22:23,119 --> 01:22:26,719
drive the right way

2344
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:28,960
yeah but you grow a little moderate size

2345
01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:31,679
plan of it it's got really nice lemony

2346
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:34,480
terps it's got a unique kind of aroma to

2347
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:37,199
it it gets it has a nice uplifting buzz

2348
01:22:34,479 --> 01:22:38,959
it's very pretty it burns well

2349
01:22:37,198 --> 01:22:41,839
um and someone mentioned it i do think

2350
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:43,198
dna's lemon skunk is just a renamed

2351
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:45,600
green crack

2352
01:22:43,198 --> 01:22:46,719
that they prettied up to breed with

2353
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:48,639
probably i mean they were known for

2354
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:50,079
doing that i mean when they started

2355
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:51,520
their company no offense to them or

2356
01:22:50,079 --> 01:22:53,198
anything they just went around mendo and

2357
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:55,040
humboldt in various places and gathered

2358
01:22:53,198 --> 01:22:56,000
up as many good clone onlys as they

2359
01:22:55,039 --> 01:22:58,560
could

2360
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:00,238
yeah well they started their company as

2361
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:02,639
soma's little little

2362
01:23:00,238 --> 01:23:04,718
little buddies and he gave them a c99

2363
01:23:02,639 --> 01:23:06,880
that they renamed to uh some sort of

2364
01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:08,719
haze cantaloupe i believe they called it

2365
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:12,319
that yeah so that's they started their

2366
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:14,239
company off of uh c99 and renamed it and

2367
01:23:12,319 --> 01:23:15,359
when you start your company that way

2368
01:23:14,238 --> 01:23:17,919
it it

2369
01:23:15,359 --> 01:23:19,359
there's no reason to start doing it the

2370
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:21,440
right way

2371
01:23:19,359 --> 01:23:22,799
that's why i look at it

2372
01:23:21,439 --> 01:23:25,039
the seed business has never been

2373
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:28,560
particularly honorable no

2374
01:23:25,039 --> 01:23:32,079
yeah um we got hogg's breath

2375
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:34,800
that's you know yeah that was that was

2376
01:23:32,079 --> 01:23:37,760
our san diego crew it was made by jimbo

2377
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:39,760
james hogg rest in peace um

2378
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:42,239
he said several different things that it

2379
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:45,360
possibly could have been made um his big

2380
01:23:42,238 --> 01:23:47,039
one was a williams wonder hybrid um i

2381
01:23:45,359 --> 01:23:48,880
think personally it was probably a skunk

2382
01:23:47,039 --> 01:23:50,399
one some type of afghani williams one

2383
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:51,199
would fit wrong lights would fit of some

2384
01:23:50,399 --> 01:23:54,079
sort

2385
01:23:51,198 --> 01:23:56,559
um it could be foot funky cheese

2386
01:23:54,079 --> 01:23:59,519
it had a lot of the similar thialic

2387
01:23:56,560 --> 01:24:00,639
smells of like a chem d or a

2388
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:03,440
a cheese

2389
01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:05,679
and i've seen sweet hogs

2390
01:24:03,439 --> 01:24:08,158
it's it's it has very specific type

2391
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:10,560
growth traits on top um

2392
01:24:08,158 --> 01:24:13,839
kind of foxtelli a little bit on top

2393
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:15,840
um yeah uh it wasn't allowed out of our

2394
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:18,880
circle for a long time and once it was

2395
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:20,079
it was out in everyone's hands so yeah i

2396
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:22,159
think a lot of people are working with

2397
01:24:20,079 --> 01:24:24,559
it now and the real real ones out there

2398
01:24:22,158 --> 01:24:26,719
and um even though james is gone his

2399
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:29,120
family still runs the clothing company

2400
01:24:26,719 --> 01:24:31,119
and grows and still pushes it so

2401
01:24:29,119 --> 01:24:32,880
yeah it's still out there and cool to be

2402
01:24:31,119 --> 01:24:36,559
had there you go

2403

01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:47,119
yeah and because it was very mysterious

2407
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:48,319
in origin it was supposedly came out of

2408

new york

2409
01:24:48,319 --> 01:24:52,479
and there wasn't a lot of information

2410
01:24:50,479 --> 01:24:54,959
about it which allowed a lot of

2411
01:24:52,479 --> 01:24:58,479
different people to be like this cut is

2423
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:27,280
there's a there's a number of headbands

2424
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:29,120
um almost all of them are good smoke

2425
01:25:27,279 --> 01:25:31,039
right um

2426
01:25:29,119 --> 01:25:33,039
but then recently it's come out and some

2427
01:25:31,039 --> 01:25:37,519
of the old sour crew

2428
01:25:33,039 --> 01:25:38,960
um has come out uh and said that uh

2429
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:40,960
um

2430
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:43,198
that you know the the they had these

2431
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:44,639
cuts diesel 1 and diesel 2 which were

2432
01:25:43,198 --> 01:25:46,879
bag seed

2433
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:49,440
of some chem they were getting

2434
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:51,600
and um they grew them out and there was

2435
01:25:49,439 --> 01:25:53,439
a buddy of theirs in new york that

2436
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:55,840
thought that the diesel 2

2437
01:25:53,439 --> 01:25:57,919
um made there made it feel like there

2438
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:58,960
was a band around his head after he

2439
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:01,440
smoked it

2440
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:03,760
and yeah they nicknamed it the headband

2441
01:26:01,439 --> 01:26:04,638
and it so happens that

2442
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:06,239
um

2443
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:08,960
that diesel 2

2444
01:26:06,238 --> 01:26:10,079
there's it so happens that that cut

2445
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:11,439
uh

2446
01:26:10,079 --> 01:26:12,880
um

the one that matt uses what i call the

2464
01:26:46,399 --> 01:26:50,238
56

2465
01:26:48,238 --> 01:26:52,079
is the original new york city headband

2466
01:26:50,238 --> 01:26:53,919
and people advertised it at that duke

2467
01:26:52,079 --> 01:26:55,679
had it they were bit they're him and his

2468
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:56,880
crew were big on saying it was the first

2469
01:26:55,679 --> 01:26:59,359
headband

2470
01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:01,359
um loompa was big on saying that his

2471
01:26:59,359 --> 01:27:04,479
headband was the only real headband and

2472
01:27:01,359 --> 01:27:06,319
everything else was a pale imitation um

2473
01:27:04,479 --> 01:27:08,079
and then the sour people come out and

2474
01:27:06,319 --> 01:27:08,960
start talking about it and it turns out

2475
01:27:08,079 --> 01:27:10,319
that

2476
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:11,920
you know um

2477
01:27:10,319 --> 01:27:13,840
the headband they're speaking of that

2478
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:14,639
was the first one was not cush-like at

2479
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:16,239
all

2480
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:19,440
yeah

2481
01:27:16,238 --> 01:27:21,198
so it's one of those ones that um

2482
01:27:19,439 --> 01:27:23,198
there was a lot of stories based on it

2483
01:27:21,198 --> 01:27:24,719
because there was a bunch of mystery

2484
01:27:23,198 --> 01:27:26,960
uh and there's also a thing about that

2485
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:28,000
56 day i call it the 56th day just

2486
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:29,760
because that's

2487
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:32,479
it's like the least offensive nickname

2488
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:34,320
of it but um that came out of the cush

2489
01:27:32,479 --> 01:27:35,439
crew in southern california and it came

2490
01:27:34,319 --> 01:27:37,119
up to the bay

2491
01:27:35,439 --> 01:27:39,678
and they renamed it

2492
01:27:37,119 --> 01:27:42,158
yeah intentionally

2493
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:43,760
lumpa's story is a bit shady

2494
01:27:42,158 --> 01:27:45,839
um

2495
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:48,239
he got to say the least and he got it

2496
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:49,520
and he got it and he decided to add his

2497
01:27:48,238 --> 01:27:52,319
name to it

2498
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:54,080
yes and ever since he's been extremely

2499
01:27:52,319 --> 01:27:56,158
touchy

2500
01:27:54,079 --> 01:27:58,000
about uh that headband has to be the

2501
01:27:56,158 --> 01:27:59,519
best headband and everybody else is just

2502
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:02,238
a [ __ ] for trying to have as good of a

2503
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:04,960
headband as luma headband yeah um so

2504
01:28:02,238 --> 01:28:07,279
it's really a muddled history you know

2505
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:09,359
every time we talk about it it stirs up

2506
01:28:07,279 --> 01:28:12,559
so much [ __ ] you guys have no [ __ ]

2507
01:28:09,359 --> 01:28:14,719
clue so there's the 707 headband which

2508
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:17,039
is a mandelbrot seed creation that he

2509
01:28:14,719 --> 01:28:18,480
used off the the mother cut that i still

2510
01:28:17,039 --> 01:28:20,319
have the l.a

2511
01:28:18,479 --> 01:28:23,519
yeah there's a couple what i consider to

2512
01:28:20,319 --> 01:28:24,960
be og kush type phenos which is the 56

2513
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:28,480
and the lumpa

2514
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:30,399
um the old school guys uh that first had

2515
01:28:28,479 --> 01:28:31,759
the diesel 2 and the headband they think

2516
01:28:30,399 --> 01:28:33,759
it's dead

2517
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:35,760
yeah and they're suspect that it could

2518
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:38,159
exist on the west coast

2519
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:41,440
so like a lot of things there's mystery

2520
01:28:38,158 --> 01:28:44,319
yeah let's put it that way

2521
01:28:41,439 --> 01:28:46,158
there was one major claim that um duke

2522
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:47,599
had bought it from chemdawg but i

2523
01:28:46,158 --> 01:28:49,839
specifically asked him dog about it and

2524
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:51,840
he said he's never grown headband so

2525
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:53,600
that that's a problem

2526
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:54,719
i mean i'm pretty sure i'm pretty sure

2527
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:57,600
that when

2528
01:28:54,719 --> 01:29:00,000
uh you know when uh duke and and homie

2529
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:02,239
tried to work for your buddy matt matty

2530
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:04,800
leet yeah that he got it in that little

2531
01:29:02,238 --> 01:29:07,119
era when he was in colorado yeah and had

2532
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:09,119
no previous experience with it yeah that

2533
01:29:07,119 --> 01:29:12,479
cut that that he uses

2534
01:29:09,119 --> 01:29:15,119
is a super super nice very potent cut

2535
01:29:12,479 --> 01:29:16,559
sure yeah it's just it's just a cush cut

2536
01:29:15,119 --> 01:29:18,158
it's not diesel

2537
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:21,280
yeah it's not the original head

2538
01:29:18,158 --> 01:29:22,960
definitely definitely and they and um

2539
01:29:21,279 --> 01:29:25,759
you know and uh

2540

2541
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:28,800
cut that he got under suspicious

2542
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:31,359
circumstances

2543
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:33,279
and uh renamed it

you know i i view most citrus as sort of

2644
01:33:10,319 --> 01:33:14,319
two one note for me

2645
01:33:12,238 --> 01:33:17,119
yeah you know um but it was a big

2646
01:33:14,319 --> 01:33:18,880
yielding kind of ugly long running

2647
01:33:17,119 --> 01:33:21,039
cola's plant

2648
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:23,119
um and it's kind of one of those weeds

2649
01:33:21,039 --> 01:33:25,920
that people love for two or three days

2650
01:33:23,119 --> 01:33:27,599

g hybrid like it's so it's super obvious

2655
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:39,840
to me um it's not the prettiest bud not

2656
01:33:37,279 --> 01:33:43,039
at all no it's kind of i would consider

2657
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:46,400
it a post cookie era i would consider it

2658
01:33:43,039 --> 01:33:49,359
ugly it would yeah it's very ugly um

2659
01:33:46,399 --> 01:33:51,839
so it burns heavily cropped yeah a lot

2660
01:33:49,359 --> 01:33:55,359

2661
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:55,360

01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:01,840
the

2664
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:06,880
the code names

2665
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:08,800
that sssc used gunk one and all five

2666
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:10,400
um i think it's just skunk one nl5 but

2667
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:12,800
it might be a skunk one no five haze i

2668
01:34:10,399 --> 01:34:14,960
can't remember but yeah

2669
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:17,600
if that's the case you know i will say

2670
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:20,000
that you know when we talked to corel he

2671
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:22,320
was extremely honest and upfront about a

2672
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:24,479
lot of their various different subjects

2673
01:34:22,319 --> 01:34:27,198
yeah he did get a little cagey when i

2674
01:34:24,479 --> 01:34:29,599
asked him about uh that and the basic

2675
01:34:27,198 --> 01:34:30,559
five and if he got any seed stock from

2676
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:32,400
neville

2677
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:34,320
um and sort of just called it by

2678
01:34:32,399 --> 01:34:37,119
different names at the time

2679
01:34:34,319 --> 01:34:38,559
uh he laughed and smiled and didn't say

2680
01:34:37,119 --> 01:34:40,399
a whole lot

2681
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:42,480
yeah you know uh so we didn't really get

2682
01:34:40,399 --> 01:34:45,679
any specifics from it

2683
01:34:42,479 --> 01:34:49,359
um but there's no indication that he got

2684
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:51,440
um that he got you know any private uh

2685
01:34:49,359 --> 01:34:52,238
nl stock from anyone

2686
01:34:51,439 --> 01:34:53,039
yep

2687
01:34:52,238 --> 01:34:54,158
so

2688
01:34:53,039 --> 01:34:55,118
you know what are you gonna say about

2689
01:34:54,158 --> 01:34:56,719
that

2690
01:34:55,118 --> 01:35:00,079
here's an interesting one the

2691
01:34:56,719 --> 01:35:00,880
massachusetts super skunk

2692
01:35:00,079 --> 01:35:03,439
boy

2693
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:06,159
so this one has been described in other

2694
01:35:03,439 --> 01:35:08,319
podcasts and stuff quite a bit

2695
01:35:06,158 --> 01:35:10,799
yeah um it's got an enormous amount of

2696
01:35:08,319 --> 01:35:12,880
confusion about it it's a attained

2697
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:14,800
legendary status

2698
01:35:12,880 --> 01:35:17,600
uh especially because some of the people

2699
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:21,039
that are involved in it are very famous

2700
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:22,800
yeah um it was in high times

2701
01:35:21,039 --> 01:35:25,760
uh and

2702
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:26,719
especially since that rank uh roadkill

2703
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:29,520
skunk

2704
01:35:26,719 --> 01:35:31,359
uh seems to be the scam of the minute uh

2705
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:33,360
where for the last five or six years

2706
01:35:31,359 --> 01:35:35,118
people keep claiming that skunk their

2707
01:35:33,359 --> 01:35:36,479
skunk terps are gonna blow you out of

2708
01:35:35,118 --> 01:35:37,759
the water and it's right around the

2709
01:35:36,479 --> 01:35:38,879
corner

2710
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:40,560
um

2711
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:42,639
i had it

2712
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:44,719
because the guy that went and got it

2713
01:35:42,639 --> 01:35:48,719
from virginia uh

2714
01:35:44,719 --> 01:35:51,679
crew uh brought it west yeah um and gave

2715
01:35:48,719 --> 01:35:54,000
it to you know um you know when uh when

2716
01:35:51,679 --> 01:35:56,639
jerry garcia died and skunk va started

2717
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:58,960
growing uh he got the cut from my from

2718
01:35:56,639 --> 01:36:02,319
our buddy uh and started growing it he

2719
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:05,760
posted some pictures of it on his page

2720
01:36:02,319 --> 01:36:07,118
um i believe it's in sour diesel

2721
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:09,840
you know it's not really from

2722
01:36:07,118 --> 01:36:12,158
massachusetts it got dropped off there

2723
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:13,440
uh by my buddy when he got the chem dog

2724
01:36:12,158 --> 01:36:15,759
from dude

2725
01:36:13,439 --> 01:36:17,359
um and what's interesting about it is

2726
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:20,159
that the cut

2727
01:36:17,359 --> 01:36:21,759
when uh when skunk va went east and got

2728
01:36:20,158 --> 01:36:24,479
the chem d and brought it back when we

2729
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:26,079
gave when greg got the dog back

2730
01:36:24,479 --> 01:36:27,519
um

2731
01:36:26,079 --> 01:36:29,840
by that point

2732
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:31,840
according to according to uh to our

2733
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:35,119
buddy he had already lost it

2734
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:37,199
and the the uh massachusetts super skunk

2735
01:36:35,118 --> 01:36:39,439
that they posted in the

2736
01:36:37,198 --> 01:36:41,599
um in the uh

2737
01:36:39,439 --> 01:36:43,678
high times was a lot shorter was a lot

2738
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:45,360
squatter was a lot and that's the one i

2739
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:46,880
believe is the mom of jesus because

2740
01:36:45,359 --> 01:36:48,399
diesel is a spitting image of that one

2741
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:50,840
and i was going to bring that up in the

2742
01:36:48,399 --> 01:36:53,519
sense that it's more than likely bag

2743
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:55,760
seed but it's one of those ones where

2744
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:56,719
nobody really wants to claim the truth

2745
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:58,880
on it

2746
01:36:56,719 --> 01:37:00,960
yeah a lot of people keep popping up

2747
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:02,480
swearing that they have it

2748
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:04,480
um

2749
01:37:02,479 --> 01:37:06,479
a lot of ms it's one of those ones where

2750
01:37:04,479 --> 01:37:08,319
it's like there's a massive demand for

2751
01:37:06,479 --> 01:37:09,198
it

2752
01:37:08,319 --> 01:37:11,198
but

2753
01:37:09,198 --> 01:37:13,279
i've never seen anyone that i grew it

2754
01:37:11,198 --> 01:37:16,000
from probably not 90 i don't know late

2755
01:37:13,279 --> 01:37:19,359
90s to 08-ish or something

2756
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:20,560
uh yeah and uh i've never seen a jar of

2757
01:37:19,359 --> 01:37:21,839
it

2758
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:23,600
yet

2759
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:25,440
you know everyone that claims that they

2760
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:27,840
have rank skunk and it's gonna pop in

2761
01:37:25,439 --> 01:37:29,039
their seeds i've never seen a jar

2762
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:31,760
i've never you know and you would think

2763
01:37:29,039 --> 01:37:34,238
that it's so popular and people so want

2764
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:35,840
those skunk terps that all these various

2765
01:37:34,238 --> 01:37:37,118
breeders and stuff that claim that

2766
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:38,880
they're gonna you're gonna find a bunch

2767
01:37:37,118 --> 01:37:40,079
of skunk in their work

2768
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:42,400
um

2769
01:37:40,079 --> 01:37:44,479
you know it's uh it's one of those

2770
01:37:42,399 --> 01:37:46,799
legendary cuts now

2771
01:37:44,479 --> 01:37:48,879
yeah most people got rid of it because

2772
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:50,239
it smelled like crazy

2773
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:52,800
and uh

2774
01:37:50,238 --> 01:37:55,279
you know and and all that and like the

2775
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:57,360
the massachusetts super skunk i will say

2776
01:37:55,279 --> 01:37:59,920
uh this isn't super well known but it is

2777
01:37:57,359 --> 01:38:02,719
not pure super skunk either

2778
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:06,639
it was bred through various skunky

2779
01:38:02,719 --> 01:38:09,039
things that ssc sssc had and neville had

2780
01:38:06,639 --> 01:38:11,520
and then when neville released the super

2781
01:38:09,039 --> 01:38:12,399
skunk they crossed that

2782
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:14,880
um

2783
01:38:12,399 --> 01:38:16,719
that line that they already had to the

2784
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:18,719
super skunk

2785
01:38:16,719 --> 01:38:20,079
and phenos of that are what became

2786
01:38:18,719 --> 01:38:22,719
famous

2787
01:38:20,079 --> 01:38:25,118
yes that's the latest um

2788
01:38:22,719 --> 01:38:27,279
the information that we got if one of

2789
01:38:25,118 --> 01:38:30,639
our members of our crew got directly

2790
01:38:27,279 --> 01:38:32,719
from the guy who pot or bread

2791
01:38:30,639 --> 01:38:34,880
bread the mass super and there's an

2792
01:38:32,719 --> 01:38:36,000
aspect where you know there's like like

2793
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:37,199
we were just talking about with the

2794
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:40,238
headbands

2795
01:38:37,198 --> 01:38:42,559
mystery history allows various people to

2796
01:38:40,238 --> 01:38:45,439
make wild claims thinking that it won't

2797
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:47,199
ever get popped up um it came out to

2798
01:38:45,439 --> 01:38:49,359
california with my friend when the same

2799
01:38:47,198 --> 01:38:51,198
time he brought the chem dog out and it

2800
01:38:49,359 --> 01:38:52,479
survived amongst our crew and he grew it

2801
01:38:51,198 --> 01:38:55,519
for some time

2802
01:38:52,479 --> 01:38:57,759
um it went to colorado through that that

2803
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:59,920
breeder's other friends and it got

2804
01:38:57,760 --> 01:39:02,719
called skunk six out there

2805
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:04,719
uh after the the the number of the fin

2806
01:39:02,719 --> 01:39:06,000
the number of the fino you know that

2807
01:39:04,719 --> 01:39:08,079
they were growing

2808
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:10,560
and it's got a lot of legend to it you

2809
01:39:08,079 --> 01:39:12,238
know it's probably in it's pr in my

2810
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:14,639
opinion it's probably in chem d it's

2811
01:39:12,238 --> 01:39:17,599
probably it's def i think it's in sour

2812
01:39:14,639 --> 01:39:19,359
um and a lot of people want it and it

2813
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:21,600
seems to not exist

2814
01:39:19,359 --> 01:39:23,679
uh you know maybe it exists in various

2815
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:25,360
forms we'll see maybe it pops up one day

2816
01:39:23,679 --> 01:39:27,359
but

2817
01:39:25,359 --> 01:39:29,759
more people have been excited about

2818
01:39:27,359 --> 01:39:32,079
selling the name

2819
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:33,440
than making sure they have it

2820
01:39:32,079 --> 01:39:35,118
in my opinion

2821
01:39:33,439 --> 01:39:36,638
people have been excited about selling

2822
01:39:35,118 --> 01:39:37,519
the name

2823
01:39:36,639 --> 01:39:39,440
so

2824
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:41,520
i will say one other thing

2825
01:39:39,439 --> 01:39:43,439
um that uh

2826
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:45,760
you know uh neville always said that his

2827
01:39:43,439 --> 01:39:49,279
two best-selling things were super skunk

2828
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:51,119
and uh and nl5 hates yes so there's

2829
01:39:49,279 --> 01:39:53,439
probably a lot of super skunk out there

2830
01:39:51,118 --> 01:39:57,679
blended into various things i think that

2831
01:39:53,439 --> 01:39:59,439
i personally think that super skunk is

2832
01:39:57,679 --> 01:40:01,600
a lot of what people refer to as skunky

2833
01:39:59,439 --> 01:40:03,919
dank um that went around in their area

2834
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:06,239
was probably if you know super skunk i'm

2835
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:09,199
damn near convinced of this after seeing

2836
01:40:06,238 --> 01:40:10,959
stuff like the old p91 um my heirloom

2837
01:40:09,198 --> 01:40:12,960
afghani line just an old afghani line

2838
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:16,158
that happened to be from florida is very

2839
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:17,118
super skunk like um the clock worked cut

2840
01:40:16,158 --> 01:40:18,559
um

2841
01:40:17,118 --> 01:40:19,679
all kinds of [ __ ] around me was super

2842
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:21,920
skunk

2843
01:40:19,679 --> 01:40:23,279
i navigated to people ask how the hell

2844
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:24,560
could it have disappeared and it's

2845
01:40:23,279 --> 01:40:27,039
really simple

2846
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:28,719
um most skunk you know people think

2847
01:40:27,039 --> 01:40:30,960
about this crazy terp and i will say

2848
01:40:28,719 --> 01:40:33,840
that it had the turpin spades

2849
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:36,079
right it was incredibly stinky

2850
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:38,079
it was only moderate potency it was only

2851
01:40:36,079 --> 01:40:40,158
moderate density you could have this big

2852
01:40:38,079 --> 01:40:41,198
ass bud and you'd put it on the scale

2853
01:40:40,158 --> 01:40:42,960
and you'd be like oh that's going to be

2854
01:40:41,198 --> 01:40:44,479
six or seven grams and it'd be like two

2855
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:47,600
and a half

2856
01:40:44,479 --> 01:40:50,319
you know and it was pre-carbon filters

2857
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:52,159
um so it got a lot of people in trouble

2858
01:40:50,319 --> 01:40:54,238
i mean i remember driving up to my house

2859
01:40:52,158 --> 01:40:57,039
a bunch in summer and like parking in my

2860
01:40:54,238 --> 01:40:59,839
driveway and i could just smell it

2861
01:40:57,039 --> 01:41:01,840
and you know it was you know like i said

2862
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:03,360
earlier in the show other things get

2863
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:05,840
more popular

2864
01:41:03,359 --> 01:41:07,759
and people drop [ __ ] and then they think

2865
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:09,679
oh i can always get it back someone else

2866
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:11,679
is holding it someone else is holding it

2867
01:41:09,679 --> 01:41:12,800
and now it's like

2868
01:41:11,679 --> 01:41:15,760
you know

2869
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:18,400
people can't find it you know so

2870
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:20,000
but uh it exists in a lot of children i

2871
01:41:18,399 --> 01:41:21,839
definitely think it's in sour diesel i

2872
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:25,039
can smell it in sour i can even see it

2873
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:27,199
in sourdough yeah there you go i would

2874
01:41:25,039 --> 01:41:29,600
agree a hundred percent

2875
01:41:27,198 --> 01:41:33,439
uh this one's for my buddy sub rob

2876
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:35,119
um the matanuska valley thunder [ __ ]

2877
01:41:33,439 --> 01:41:37,599
i have a cool story about that yeah

2878
01:41:35,118 --> 01:41:39,519
let's hear it so it sounds to me like

2879
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:42,480
the matt nuscavalli [ __ ] ends up

2880
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:44,159
being kind of like crippy or diesel or

2881
01:41:42,479 --> 01:41:47,759
something like that in terms of it was

2882
01:41:44,158 --> 01:41:49,439
like a name for fireweed yes right

2883
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:51,280
and uh

2884
01:41:49,439 --> 01:41:53,599
when i was on dead tour there was a

2885
01:41:51,279 --> 01:41:55,359
buddy of ours that was from alaska

2886
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:57,280
uh and was on tour

2887
01:41:55,359 --> 01:41:58,639
and he would go home to alaska in

2888
01:41:57,279 --> 01:42:01,039
between tours

2889
01:41:58,639 --> 01:42:02,480
yeah and i gave him one time i gave him

2890
01:42:01,039 --> 01:42:03,760
like twelve hundred dollars for a

2891
01:42:02,479 --> 01:42:06,319
quarter pound

2892
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:08,960
yeah and then he didn't give me any weed

2893
01:42:06,319 --> 01:42:10,399
for months and i thought he jacked me

2894
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:12,560
and then he called me up and he said hey

2895
01:42:10,399 --> 01:42:14,960
i'm gonna send you something

2896
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:17,920
and he sent me this weed and

2897
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:19,840
it showed up in the mail and it was wet

2898
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:21,359
yeah and i took it out and i dried it

2899
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:23,279
and it was only like three and a half

2900
01:42:21,359 --> 01:42:25,359
ounces so i lost like a half ounce of

2901
01:42:23,279 --> 01:42:26,719
weight and it was three and a half four

2902
01:42:25,359 --> 01:42:28,719
months late

2903
01:42:26,719 --> 01:42:30,639
uh but he said it was thunder [ __ ]

2904
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:33,118
and it was olive dark green with these

2905
01:42:30,639 --> 01:42:34,880
weird hairs and it was so good

2906
01:42:33,118 --> 01:42:37,679
my buddies and i kept it in the freezer

2907
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:39,039
and we smoked it uh only for special

2908
01:42:37,679 --> 01:42:40,158
occasions over the next six or eight

2909
01:42:39,039 --> 01:42:42,560
months

2910
01:42:40,158 --> 01:42:44,319
yeah great high great buzz

2911
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:46,400
much better weed than anything we had at

2912
01:42:44,319 --> 01:42:48,719
the time as far as kind bud granted this

2913
01:42:46,399 --> 01:42:49,839
is when i was 17 18 19 so take that into

2914
01:42:48,719 --> 01:42:52,000
account

2915
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:53,679
uh and everyone that's claimed matanuska

2916
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,800
[ __ ] since then none of it has

2917
01:42:53,679 --> 01:42:56,399
looked like it

2918
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:58,400
yeah none of it looked like the weed

2919
01:42:56,399 --> 01:43:00,799
that i got back then one time

2920
01:42:58,399 --> 01:43:02,719
so yeah there you go i think that's like

2921
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:04,480
everyone's story that i've met there's a

2922
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:06,158
lot of people from alaska

2923
01:43:04,479 --> 01:43:08,479
that

2924
01:43:06,158 --> 01:43:10,319
i think are very convinced that you know

2925
01:43:08,479 --> 01:43:12,479
the map music [ __ ] that they had

2926
01:43:10,319 --> 01:43:14,639
was the original and the only and they

2927
01:43:12,479 --> 01:43:16,479
can tell you all about it you know who

2928
01:43:14,639 --> 01:43:17,760
grew it who made it et cetera et cetera

2929
01:43:16,479 --> 01:43:19,439
but there's a lot of stories like that

2930
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:21,199
and i think that it i think they're

2931
01:43:19,439 --> 01:43:23,599
probably all telling their own truth i

2932
01:43:21,198 --> 01:43:26,319
know what i mean i will say too that uh

2933
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:29,280
the the package that i got mailed was

2934
01:43:26,319 --> 01:43:31,118
mailed from denali alaska post office

2935
01:43:29,279 --> 01:43:33,679
yeah which was pretty funny

2936
01:43:31,118 --> 01:43:35,679
yeah that is funny yeah

2937
01:43:33,679 --> 01:43:37,118
now yeah yeah so

2938
01:43:35,679 --> 01:43:39,279
uh but i thought i got ripped off for

2939
01:43:37,118 --> 01:43:41,679
months because i gave him 1200 bucks

2940
01:43:39,279 --> 01:43:43,519
and i didn't see any weed for months

2941
01:43:41,679 --> 01:43:45,039
and he kept his he kept the funny thing

2942
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:48,080
about that this is a little bit of a

2943
01:43:45,039 --> 01:43:50,639
side tangent but he kept his he was a

2944
01:43:48,079 --> 01:43:52,960
native to alaska and he kept his

2945
01:43:50,639 --> 01:43:54,079
um license and all that from alaska

2946
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:58,239
because

2947
01:43:54,079 --> 01:43:59,679
alas native alaskans got um oil money

2948
01:43:58,238 --> 01:44:01,279
yeah every year

2949
01:43:59,679 --> 01:44:03,600
so even though he was on dead tour and

2950
01:44:01,279 --> 01:44:04,399
he was like in the lower 48 most of the

2951
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:05,840
year

2952
01:44:04,399 --> 01:44:08,158
he would keep all of his [ __ ] at his

2953
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:09,679
parents house and just go back there in

2954
01:44:08,158 --> 01:44:11,439
between and he would get like between a

2955
01:44:09,679 --> 01:44:13,920
two and a five thousand dollar check

2956
01:44:11,439 --> 01:44:16,158
every year yeah isn't that [ __ ] wild

2957
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:18,000
one of my friends uh in high school got

2958
01:44:16,158 --> 01:44:19,359
shipped out to alaska

2959
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,479
we were a bunch of punk rock kids and he

2960
01:44:19,359 --> 01:44:22,000
got in trouble he got in a lot of

2961
01:44:20,479 --> 01:44:24,399
trouble one day doing some punk rock

2962
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:25,920
things and got shipped out to alaska for

2963
01:44:24,399 --> 01:44:27,920
a few years and he came back and he was

2964
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:30,000
the first person to like talk to me

2965
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:31,520
about some strain that was like he's

2966
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:34,800
like bro

2967
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:36,800
hugest thc numbers ever it's called the

2968
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:39,600
magnus valley thunder [ __ ] you know and

2969
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:41,520
he had this big tale of of uh

2970
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:43,600
you know this very special potent weed

2971
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:45,119
that was out there in alaska you know

2972
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:47,600
and i was always trying to figure out

2973
01:44:45,118 --> 01:44:49,599
more about this thing and as i as i kept

2974
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:51,440
digging deeper and deeper i i learned

2975
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:53,840
that there were several people with

2976
01:44:51,439 --> 01:44:55,839
several claims to several

2977
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:59,119
thunder [ __ ] out there the more you dig

2978
01:44:55,840 --> 01:45:01,279
into it the wider the story becomes

2979
01:44:59,118 --> 01:45:04,000
yeah let's put it that way lots of

2980
01:45:01,279 --> 01:45:05,519
bikers involved in most of them

2981
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,600
let's put it that way so it's hard to

2982
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:10,000
say if it was a one thing or it was just

2983
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:12,320
a regional name like maui wowie like

2984
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:14,639
crippy even my buddies everyone thinks

2985
01:45:12,319 --> 01:45:16,719
about diesel as sour diesel now

2986
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:18,239
but you know in the mid 90s or whatever

2987
01:45:16,719 --> 01:45:20,239
the only reason why i got called sour

2988
01:45:18,238 --> 01:45:21,279
diesel was because the guy wrote our

2989
01:45:20,238 --> 01:45:24,158
diesel

2990
01:45:21,279 --> 01:45:26,800
yeah because diesel was slang for fire

2991
01:45:24,158 --> 01:45:28,479
weed in new york city in that time

2992
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:30,480
yeah my friends that lived there said

2993
01:45:28,479 --> 01:45:31,839
that you got all kinds of diesels

2994
01:45:30,479 --> 01:45:33,359
because that was that was the name and i

2995
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:34,960
think thunder [ __ ] is a bit like that

2996
01:45:33,359 --> 01:45:37,519
but there you go

2997
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:39,679
yeah yeah have you have you ever heard

2998
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:40,800
of sour diesel being called the [ __ ]

2999
01:45:39,679 --> 01:45:43,039
diesel

3000
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:45,840
have you ever heard that no

3001
01:45:43,039 --> 01:45:49,039
okay and i've talked i've talked

3002
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:51,760
i've talked to almost everyone at length

3003
01:45:49,039 --> 01:45:52,639

3004
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:56,480

3005

um and i i never heard [ __ ] diesel but

3006
01:45:56,479 --> 01:46:00,638
you know there you go yeah yeah i don't

3007
01:45:58,479 --> 01:46:02,079
know why that's in my memory bank but

3008
01:46:00,639 --> 01:46:03,920
yeah that's one of the names of my

3009
01:46:02,079 --> 01:46:06,639
memory bank maybe that's a secret they

3010
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:07,679
kept amongst the boys yeah just a few of

3011
01:46:06,639 --> 01:46:10,480
the boys

3012
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:13,199
the boys you know yeah just a few just a

3013
01:46:10,479 --> 01:46:14,319
few of the bros okay so we're almost two

3014
01:46:13,198 --> 01:46:16,960
hours in

of like infomercials about people which

3050
01:47:28,079 --> 01:47:32,639

3051
01:47:30,158 --> 01:47:34,079
lot more diversity in cannabis world

3052
01:47:32,639 --> 01:47:36,719

3063
01:47:57,600 --> 01:48:02,639
um you know we are we are thinking about

3064
01:48:00,479 --> 01:48:04,158
um you know it's one of the reasons why

3065
01:48:02,639 --> 01:48:05,359
we talk about some of these old things

3066
01:48:04,158 --> 01:48:06,960
is that we think they're going to make a

3067
01:48:05,359 --> 01:48:09,439
comeback perhaps

3068
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:11,840
i am thinking about uh you know doing

3069
01:48:09,439 --> 01:48:14,158
some like uh doing some you know i've

3070
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:16,000
never been really a public breeder and

3071
01:48:14,158 --> 01:48:18,399
i'm matt has been trying to convince me

3072
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:20,158
to open myself up to lots of criticism

3073
01:48:18,399 --> 01:48:22,000
and hate and people throwing things at

3074
01:48:20,158 --> 01:48:24,479
me i write his i write his phone number

3075
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:26,639
in every bathroom stall like yeah

3076
01:48:24,479 --> 01:48:27,919
you know so people so but then there's a

3077
01:48:26,639 --> 01:48:30,400
lot of things that like you know i've

3078
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:32,399
always bred for stuff that i love and so

3079
01:48:30,399 --> 01:48:33,599
i don't know um i've been thinking about

3080
01:48:32,399 --> 01:48:35,839
maybe

3081
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:37,679
you know doing some uh doing or

3082
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:39,920
releasing some stuff that might be very

3083
01:48:37,679 --> 01:48:40,800
different than what is currently out

3084
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:42,480
there

3085
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:44,880
um and i don't know if people would be

3086
01:48:42,479 --> 01:48:46,718
into it or not but it's it's always been

3087
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:48,239
sort of a you know a passion thing for

3088
01:48:46,719 --> 01:48:50,239
me or whatever so

3089
01:48:48,238 --> 01:48:51,198
uh you know we'll uh

3090
01:48:50,238 --> 01:48:53,039
um

3091
01:48:51,198 --> 01:48:53,839

3092
01:48:53,039 --> 01:48:55,439
dude

3093
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:56,960
we got pretty far in but there's a lot

3094
01:48:55,439 --> 01:48:58,479

patting your stomach at the same time

3102
01:49:10,719 --> 01:49:15,279
it's really hard to like talk

3103
01:49:12,479 --> 01:49:17,279
intelligently in a flowing form and then

3104
01:49:15,279 --> 01:49:19,118
think about like four or five cool

3105
01:49:17,279 --> 01:49:20,880
questions all at the same time that you

3106

3113
01:49:33,439 --> 01:49:38,638
so hit us up all the time with questions

3114
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:40,158
or you know or ideas or thoughts on like

3115
01:49:38,639 --> 01:49:41,440
what you might want to hear

3116
01:49:40,158 --> 01:49:43,679
you know

3117
01:49:41,439 --> 01:49:45,198
um yeah and i mean i'm not i'm not like

3118
01:49:43,679 --> 01:49:47,359
that that's the whole thing people i've

3119
01:49:45,198 --> 01:49:48,799
you know uh caleb matt other people

3120
01:49:47,359 --> 01:49:50,399
they've been trying for years to not

3121
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:52,719
only get me to talk but to get me to

3122
01:49:50,399 --> 01:49:54,479
like publicly release stuff

3123
01:49:52,719 --> 01:49:55,840
and it's like it's kind of a [ __ ] being

3124
01:49:54,479 --> 01:49:57,598
a public breeder

3125
01:49:55,840 --> 01:50:00,000
so yeah i've been kind of hesitant to

3126
01:49:57,599 --> 01:50:01,920
like open myself up to like a bunch of

3127
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:04,158
criticism and [ __ ]

3128
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:05,840
um yeah but i might i don't know you

3129
01:50:04,158 --> 01:50:06,799
know deserves it there's a lot of

3130
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:08,639
feeling

3131
01:50:06,800 --> 01:50:11,119
there's a lot of uh there's a lot of

3132
01:50:08,639 --> 01:50:13,118
cool things i think that get passed over

3133
01:50:11,118 --> 01:50:14,639
with fads

3134
01:50:13,118 --> 01:50:16,639
so you know

3135
01:50:14,639 --> 01:50:18,079
uh we are almost at two hours so i don't

3136
01:50:16,639 --> 01:50:20,480
know i mean maybe we could we're

3137
01:50:18,079 --> 01:50:23,439
thinking about having shaw on next week

3138
01:50:20,479 --> 01:50:25,039
that's right we could continue this um

3139
01:50:23,439 --> 01:50:25,919
we could you know two hours is kind of

3140
01:50:25,039 --> 01:50:28,238
long

3141
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:30,560
uh but maybe we'll figure out a format

3142
01:50:28,238 --> 01:50:31,919
to do the rest of them fairly soon yeah

3143
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:34,480
