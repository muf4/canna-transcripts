1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:14,190
ready go

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:14,190
[Music]

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,920
welcome to breeder syndicate

4
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:22,159
so yeah let's kick it off dude we're

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,199
gonna have to go over some very basic

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,278
breeding

7
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,118
um terminology just so you can

8
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:28,480
understand when we move on move forward

9
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:29,920
some of the people who haven't quite

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,839
gotten there yet can understand what

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,559
we're going to be talking about

12
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:36,000
all right so uh as far as terms go

13
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:39,039
probably one of the more

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,280
misused terms is f1 right we'll just

15
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,439
start there yeah start with f1 because

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,359
this has a lot of this is used

17
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,878
incorrectly in the cannabis world daily

18
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:48,799
even by myself like i mean there's not

19
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:51,439
really another term to switch it out

20
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:53,359
with as we use it so sadly uh there's

21
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:56,000
almost no f1s

22
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:58,079
um and the reason being is that like

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,039
what an f1 means is when you take two

24
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,920
parents

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,400
that are pretty much true breeding okay

26
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,198
and you cross them together

27
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,680
right

28
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:10,478
um let's you know that would result in

29
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,799
what was called an f1 where

30
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:14,239
basically all the dominant genes from

31
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,799
both parents

32
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,959
will be dominant right and so you'll get

33
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,080
what's called hybrid vigor because

34
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:21,519
you're not going to get any weird

35
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,599
recessives you're not going to get

36
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:25,920
anything like that you

37
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:28,000
basically end up with

38
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,320
whatever the dominant genes are on both

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,118
sides that's what pops

40
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:35,118
yeah right so you know an example of

41
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:37,519
that for instance would be

42
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:40,319
you know say something like you know for

43
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:43,039
our purposes like skunk one by hates or

44
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:45,199
something like that like or or skunk one

45
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,560
by an nl or something something along

46
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,280
those lines part of the reason why they

47
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,079
use skunk one so much was simply because

48
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,840
it was it was an easy way to f1

49
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,599
something right well even even

50
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,520
technically you want to get more basic

51
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:59,679
if you're doing f1s it's like afghani

52
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:02,000
across the tie right sure

53
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,799
because it has to be the definition is

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,920
two

55
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,439
crossing two parental lines with

56
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,000
distinctively different genotypes the

57
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:13,199
most important which makes it more rare

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,919
so it's one of the most incorrect terms

59
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:17,839
um because a lot of times it's used just

60
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,759
to say this is the first time someone's

61
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,400
crossed these two things and my

62
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:24,159
cushman's by skittles f1

63
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,159
yeah right and that and that and that's

64
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:28,719
not right because yeah those aren't like

65
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,079
parental stock from region of origin

66
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,639
you know um

67
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,519
type of thing so f2

68
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:37,199
would be if you take that f1 seed and

69
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,640
you grow up males and females and you

70
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,439
cross them together

71
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:43,839
that's when with a line you should see

72
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:45,919
all the dominance all the recessives all

73
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,000
the various permutations of what's in

74
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,598
that line can pop up

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,759
so instead of getting like all the

76
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:54,878
dominant traits combined

77
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:57,039
you get every trait imaginable combining

78
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:59,359
in every way imaginable and most

79
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:01,120
importantly you'll see stuff that you

80
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,959
would not see in the f1 line stuff

81
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,640
cannot show up there are things that

82
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,000
will never show up in the f1 line that

83
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:10,559
will only show up f2 and f3 yeah to give

84
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,400
to give a really easy example for people

85
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,959
like in humans

86
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,360
brown eyes is a dominant gene and so in

87
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,080
order to have blue eyes gray eyes green

88
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,560
eyes hazel eyes both parents have to

89
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,239
have that gene and they have to line up

90
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,080
to two recessives

91
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,799
right so if one parent doesn't have the

92
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,519
gene it'll never pop

93
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,640
yeah you know so exactly so anyway so

94
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,840
that's that's f1 f2 s1 is is a

95
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:38,318
relatively

96
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,400
modern thing uh in terms of people being

97
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:42,079
able to do it but that's basically it's

98
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,158
a self one

99
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,400
um either through hermaphrodism

100
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:48,239
naturally or something human induced

101
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,599
from some kind of spray that's used in

102
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,759
modern terms you s1 the line it used to

103
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:56,399
be sort of frowned upon

104
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:58,878
but in in recent years because we have a

105
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,360
lot of cuts that we don't have the line

106
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:04,239
anymore we just have the specific cut it

107
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,680
might be the only way to look through

108
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,680
genetics in that line besides

109
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,560
you know besides an outcross or a hybrid

110
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,080
of it right so it's not as good as as

111
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,920
doing uh because you'll get a lot of

112
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,680
weirdness when you inbreed you could get

113
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:19,839
some undesirable things but at the very

114
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,600
least it gives you an idea to like

115
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,198
look through something like

116
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,280
chem d or

117
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,319
you know trinity or you know something

118
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:29,758
that's old that's an elite clone only

119
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:31,759
right yeah

120
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,479
um and then there's a thing called

121
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,319
and also it when in adding on to it was

122
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:38,560
looked down on it was only looked down

123
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:40,719
on in the cannabis sphere in normal

124
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,800
agriculture selfing is the normal way to

125
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,320
breed uniform crops that's how they do

126
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,759
it they don't use filial generations

127
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,879
they go through selfie

128
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,600
yes so that's so is a cannabis kind of

129
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:52,959
old wives tale as it were and one of the

130
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,199
one of the things that happens with

131
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:57,039
cannabis too is that you know in modern

132
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,280
agriculture when you're developing a

133
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,960
seedline you might want a whole bunch of

134
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:03,279
like butter lettuce for instance that

135
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:05,359
comes out extremely similar and you

136
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:07,758
might want a bunch of seeds of whatever

137
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,400
cucumbers or zucchini or what what have

138
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:13,680
you that comes out extremely dependable

139
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:16,239
and so they will s1 that until they get

140
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,519
you know a very dependable very narrow

141
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,199
breeding uniform uniform

142
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,279
not a lot to look not you know that's

143
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,600
part of the reason why like you know and

144
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,918
so ibl maybe we'll shift it yeah this

145
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,160
segways into it because ibl is another

146
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:32,639
like super mis misused terms and it

147
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,680
stands essentially for inbred line

148
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,720
yeah um

149
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,160
but

150
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,039
hold on let me add this in because this

151
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,360
is the point where most people lose it

152
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:43,680
because it says inbred line it does not

153
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,800
mean that if you line breed that you

154
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,280
have an ibl it is a very specific term

155
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,759
and it is a basically don't look at it

156
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:54,079
like okay well i crossed this f1 made

157
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:57,199
f2s that's ibl right it's line bread

158
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:59,839
it's inbred line it it basically what it

159
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,600
means is uniformity in a line and that's

160
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:04,560
it it's not something that can always be

161
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,319
achieved at f6 or f8 it only means when

162
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,038
you're popping those seeds you have a

163
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,000
homogeneous line meaning uniform like

164
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:12,478
clones

165
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,319
so for us um for you know for like

166
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:16,800
large-scale agriculture something like

167
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,879
that might be useful for cannabis it's

168
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,240
not that useful for the most part unless

169
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,759
you get something amazing because what

170
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,800
you see is what you get

171
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,319
if you breed with an ibl it'll throw

172
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,478
what you see

173
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,560
it's very valuable in hemp farms i i

174
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:32,959
know that that's one place where they're

175
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,800
liking seeing uniformity in self lines

176
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,399
because they just it's more vigorous

177
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,240
it's faster they can pop all those seeds

178
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:40,638
and if they come out uniform that's even

179
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,240
more that you it takes the the cloning

180
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,720
out of the you know the picture and

181
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,319
stuff so in in hemp i can see that being

182
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,960
more useful but in modern cannabis

183
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,319
people want to find that that keeper

184
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,560
yeah they want they want a little bit of

185
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,720
variety so there's new paths

186
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,720
yeah for a breeder for somebody like you

187
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,560
know um for a breeder or anything like

188
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,080
that and uh

189
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,519
all that

190
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:03,279
getting something where like there's

191
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:04,318
nowhere to go within the gene pool

192
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:06,159
itself

193
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,680
because it's an ibl and it already is

194
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,039
what it is the traits you see are the

195
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,560
traits you get

196
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:12,959
unless you really want to add those

197
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,720
traits to another line specifically

198
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:15,598
there's not a lot of room for places to

199
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,360
go

200
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:19,680
yeah because it's already been all that

201
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,199
variety has been bred out of it

202
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,560
yeah so that's another thing with

203
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,800
breeding where it's like a lot of

204
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,839
breeding depends on what your goals are

205
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,759
yeah you know

206
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:29,598
some depends on goals some people might

207
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,598
want consistency some people might want

208
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:32,959
like the same three to six phenos to

209
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:35,038
regularly pop

210
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:36,399
some people might want to breed an ibl

211
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:38,959
some people might want to do an open

212
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:40,318
pollination or an f2 and have the widest

213
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,799
possible

214
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,639
gene pool to hunt through depending on

215
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,400
what your what your goals are you trying

216
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,918
to find like a random elite cutting to

217
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:50,638
hold on to are you trying to actually

218
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:52,318
breed a line like matt was saying where

219
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,000
you could like put it in a hemp field

220
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,199
and start thousands of seeds and get the

221
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,720
same consistent you know size bush type

222
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,520
of thing

223
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,000
so

224
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:05,120
that's kind of the thing um

225
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,959
so uh we have ix in cross in cross is

226
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,720
the last one we have left so in cross is

227
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:11,038
the last one so can't this is another

228
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,400
weird term because uh

229
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,439
in um

230
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:18,079
we call it a bx

231
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:19,918
right yes um but in most other breeding

232
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:22,399
they call it a bc

233
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:24,318
a back cross is actually like the

234
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:26,799
technical term that you would use but

235
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,879
for for most cannabis people they're

236
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,038
mostly familiar with a bx

237
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:34,639
and a bx is simply

238
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:36,958
you take a cut um you know and you

239
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:39,199
use an outside pollen donor

240
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:41,119
uh to make a male

241
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,599
line of it and then you take the

242
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,759
children of that and you back cross it

243
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,839
onto the origin that initial female so

244
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:50,799
we've talked about it on the previous on

245
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,959
the previous podcast we talked about how

246
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:56,000
um you know uh

247
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:58,079
you know neville used um seattle greg's

248
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,080
nl1

249
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,920
and uh you know we'd use that as a

250
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,240
pollen donor and would back cross to

251
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:07,599
make a pure hash plant to make a pure

252
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,399
big bud to make a pure nor uh hawaiian

253
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,680
indica

254
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,958
that type of thing uh jj from top dog

255
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,838
you know he took

256
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,719
uh

257
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:19,519
an afghani one and used that to cross

258
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,839
into um chem d and did that a few times

259
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,839
and made double dog and trace dog and so

260
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,720
on and so forth so that's basically what

261
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,720
a bx is is you find a pollen donor

262
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,040
and you cross it to a clone only for the

263
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,480
most part and then you back cross you

264
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:34,159
keep back crossing

265
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,320
so on and so forth so those are kind of

266
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:38,799
like the lockdown single trades when

267
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,760
it's back crossing and and then ix is

268
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:41,838
going to be

269
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:43,360
similar to a bx but going further down

270
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,560
the line and crossing back to a previous

271
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,240
generation so like maybe an f6 cross to

272
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:49,518
an f1 of the same line that would be an

273
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,759
in cross because you're crossing in

274
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,799
between the same line

275
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:54,799
but sure

276
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:57,359
yeah so that it is essentially still a

277
00:09:54,799 --> 00:10:00,159
back cross though so those yeah those

278
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,600
things are and it's only it's only a bx

279
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:03,919
or a bc

280
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,000
if you back cross it to the exact same

281
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:08,399
parent exactly that's super saiyan

282
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,799
cutting like if you for instance had

283
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,440
like a line of chem d for instance and

284
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:16,159
you and you crossed your children of

285
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,959
that to a different chem d parent it

286
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:21,519
wouldn't be a bx it has to go directly

287
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:24,159
back to the original genetic

288
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:27,278
stock that started the process otherwise

289
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:27,278
it's it's not a bx

290
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,679
um those are some basic terms i think

291
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:37,799
that covers like most that cannabis

292
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:37,799
people deal with
