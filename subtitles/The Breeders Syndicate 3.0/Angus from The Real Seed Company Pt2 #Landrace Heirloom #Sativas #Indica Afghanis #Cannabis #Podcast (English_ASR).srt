world my way to save the world got a

5
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:28,400
brand new set words and the going bre

Che a questioning believe wor got it

7
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:31,959

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,719
world my way to save the

10
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:56,119
world what have you noticed or maybe

11
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:58,280
haven't noticed or uh as far as in those

12
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:59,558
uh regions of like Afghanistan and

13
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,879
Pakistan I've noticed there's a lot of

14
00:00:59,558 --> 00:01:04,118
people popping up especially on

15
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:07,239
Instagram as Instagram became bigger

16
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:09,239
especially for cannabis and and seeds um

17
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:11,438
yeah have you noticed a lot more

18
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:14,359
hybridization involved like with modern

19
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:17,599
lines T kind of working their way into

20
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:20,959
these lines that are being declared Pure

21
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:23,399
or you know have you noticed that at

22
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:25,118
all sort of

23
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,478
don't

24
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:31,799
um I generally try and like just ignore

25
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:35,640
most of the the sort of people doing

26
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:38,040
those things um like every every couple

27
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,759
of years I sort of maybe get curious

28
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,399
about what they might be saying and it's

29
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:46,000
always I mean the thing is I don't like

30
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:49,040
I don't really know what they're up to

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,118
uh for the most part um it worries me

32
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,280
because I suspect most of them based on

33
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:57,438
what I've heard um have been involved in

34
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,879
also bringing hybrid seed over to places

35
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:02,078
as well you know yep yeah I can't

36
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:04,920
substantiate that Beyond some Forum

37
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:07,158
things I saw in like 2018 when there was

38
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,080
suddenly there was a 2018 there was this

39
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:14,719
sort of big yes realization among some

40
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:17,120
of these characters that um oh we can

41
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:19,039
get seeds from these places but at the

42
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,080
same time they were sort of wanting to

43
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:21,959
there were certainly some of them were

44
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,400
wanting to bring seeds up to places like

45
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:28,000
Parvati and Milana the sort of typical

46
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:31,840
Himalayan areas for for for for Charis

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,680
in India and um um yeah and then I saw

48
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:38,000
these ridiculous kind of excuses being

49
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:41,760
made oh there's some kind of wind wind

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,639
uh climate type micro climate to do with

51
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,919
winds that means that any pollen from

52
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:47,759
hybrids that we bring up to Milano is

53
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:51,919
not

54
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:53,959
gonna the most self [ __ ] you can imagine

55
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:55,958
and it just after that I just like I

56
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:58,158
think I I wrote a kind of couple of sort

57
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:01,439
of irritated things back then on on the

58
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:03,598
on the on that old blog and about the

59
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,919
amount of [ __ ] that's spouted and

60
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,598
and then just thought [ __ ] it it's is

61
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:09,878
going to put me in a bad mood so I I I

62
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:11,959
don't like going on social media anyway

63
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:13,199
much it tends to put me in a negative

64
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:17,158
State of Mind

65
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:19,039
anyway so I I just have chosen to ignore

66
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:21,519
it and do do my own thing really so I

67
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:25,079
can't give anyone an informed opinion

68
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:27,879
about what exactly is going on up to a

69
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,480
point I know certain outfits have like

70
00:03:27,878 --> 00:03:33,639
stolen stuff from people who Supply me

71
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:35,639
as in as in like yeah they've supplied

72
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:37,759
like I know I know one outfit that one

73
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:39,639
of the guys who supplies me has sent

74
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,759
seeds to then they didn't pay him and

75
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:43,559
they just knocked off his strain and

76
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:46,039
sold the seeds and kept the money for

77
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,878
themselves yeah um so I know there's

78
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:52,120
outfits that are that shitty but that's

79
00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:55,199
that's like I can only

80
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,000
um I only know that because it's

81
00:03:55,199 --> 00:04:00,158
intruded on my world is it where I

82
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,919
haven't proactively seeking out know of

83
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:04,919
what they get up to because it's

84
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:07,719
just not it's not conducive to being in

85
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:12,280
a in a positive State of Mind to involve

86
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:14,199
yourself with [ __ ] but um no I mean

87
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,000
I mean to go back to the plants and

88
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:18,358
stuff like

89
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,720
um one thing I think is probably worth

90
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:24,000
clarifying for

91
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:26,720
people um Himalayan uh land races as in

92
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,720
we're talking between sort of you know

93
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:35,320
Nepal and Kashmir are a distinct group

94
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:38,039
themselves right they're not indicas

95
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:40,439
they're not true tropical sativas

96
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:43,680
they're another kind of group within

97
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:46,399
land races that's very clearly distinct

98
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,639
you know they're much taller plants they

99
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:52,159
generally are triple use multi-purpose

100
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:53,120
plants so they're for seeds for fiber

101
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,800
and

102
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,439
for

103
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:02,038
um Hashi chis uh they're not um you know

104
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:05,240
they have a the canabo profile is

105
00:05:02,038 --> 00:05:07,120
typically like a Central Asian you know

106
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,800
a field of them will break down into

107
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,918
like type one type two and type three

108
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,560
canab anoid profiles

109
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:15,959
chemotypes so they're a very distinct

110
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,959
group and the problem with people

111
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:21,719
bringing Dutch

112
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:25,399
and um genetics up to melan and stuff is

113
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,560
you can see it's just uh that around

114
00:05:25,399 --> 00:05:30,519
that

115
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:33,120
area is very obviously not the same as

116
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:35,839
it was even when I first went there you

117
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:40,840
know yeah

118
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:45,799
it's uh very clear that

119
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:47,799
there's that skunky Dutch kind of effect

120
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:52,960
not just not just a smell the sort of

121
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:56,360
effect it's yeah um uh I was I was there

122
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:58,599
um one time when this uh real kind of

123
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,720
crazy oldtime guy turned up who bought a

124
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:04,919
bunch of like TI brick weed with him in

125
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:08,000
his from from flown from Bangkok

126
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:12,038
to India like oh

127
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,079
my couple of hundred gram like brick

128
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:18,120
of weed from like coang or somewhere

129
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:19,598
Kang and and just a maniac you know but

130
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,399
anyway he had a bunch of it with him in

131
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:25,399
this guest house and it was very

132
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:29,638
interesting like smoking some of

133
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:31,679
that side by side with the the a lot of

134
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,840
what you could find in in manikaran and

135
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,478
places at that point yeah and this is

136
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:40,439
was at least 10 years ago and you know

137
00:06:37,478 --> 00:06:42,199
the effect of the the stuff from around

138
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:44,279
that end of Parvati there had been so

139
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:45,879
much Dutch stuff brought in by that

140
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:50,839
point the smell of it was like that real

141
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:54,719
kind of skunky pissy Ur urine Roma and

142
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:57,399
then it was a very unup foric Buzz

143
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,160
compared to what I associate with that

144
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:03,478
area and then you smoke High stuff and

145
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,599
it was really kind of up and zingy and

146
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:08,038
then the you

147
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:11,918
know yeah it's just really stood out

148
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:15,279
like similarly if you if you go to areas

149
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:18,279
of the Himalayas that haven't had that

150
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:20,839
um uh introduction of foreign hybrid

151
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:23,119
seed the effect is of the Charis in the

152
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:25,439
sort of unfashionable bits of the

153
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,280
Himalayas to go to is is the old school

154
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:30,038
real stuff that's not been obviously

155
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:32,000
[ __ ] up

156
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:35,478
the effect of it is much nicer you know

157
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,199
it's like yeah much more uplifting and

158
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:40,639
positive uh feeling you know it's uh

159
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,919
there's there's rarely something with

160
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,960
skunk one in it that I can smoke because

161
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:49,079
it always takes me to a very specific

162
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:51,799
like negative space in my head so

163
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:53,478
usually I can pick it out it's taking a

164
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,199
long time but I can pretty much like

165
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:57,000
yeah pick out anything that has skunk

166
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,720
one in it there's very few exceptions

167
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,399
that I find something I love you know

168
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:06,479
has that in it at least you know 50%

169
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:08,758
yeah and a lot of the anyway

170
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,359
the the the the most of the

171
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:13,598
continuations of it have been selected

172
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:17,680
for the sort of heavy side of it as well

173
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:19,199
so yes it's uh most mostly in the UK if

174
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,759
if if you get something skunky it's

175
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,919
anywhere it's going to be like a Hindu

176
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,759
Kush skunk Afghan skunk whatever yeah

177
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:30,000
anyway so it's doubly like leaning that

178
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,520
way anyway but the thing thing to bear

179
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,038
in mind as well is that like that's not

180
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:35,718
anyway the if you look in Afghan land

181
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:37,158
races themselves Hindu Kush land races

182
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:38,599
whatever that whole Zone they're not

183
00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:40,718
necessarily like that they're not

184
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:43,240
necessarily sedative like some of them

185
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:48,080
clearly are predominantly like that but

186
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:50,480
there's such a wide uh range of uh

187
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,320
phytochemical you know CH type whatever

188
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,720
that

189
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:57,320
you in these populations that aren't

190
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,000
going to give you that type of uh effect

191
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:03,200
as well so there's no we're not kind of

192
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,278
stuck with this as long as we can keep

193
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:11,040
the some good representations of like

194
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:12,120
pristine uh uh land races in storage you

195
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,278
know there will always be the

196
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:18,200
possibility of creating new things that

197
00:09:14,278 --> 00:09:19,439
that actually feel good which is you

198
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,240
know gets back to your original question

199
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,079
of like why did I get into this and like

200
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:28,799
a lot of people um the sort of standard

201
00:09:25,078 --> 00:09:31,120
narrative is that you know in the UK the

202
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:33,399
standard narrative is oh around around

203
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,120
the year 2000 suddenly all this hybrid

204
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:38,159
stuff arrived and it was just too strong

205
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,440
and it's like not really I wouldn't say

206
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,399
it was too strong was the issue the

207
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,160
effect was just it wasn't very [ __ ]

208
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:45,519
nice you know a lot of it so a lot of

209
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:47,759
people didn't stop smoking because it

210
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,959
was too strong so much as it was just a

211
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:52,799
dysphoric effect from so much of it

212
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:55,399
compared to what they were used to from

213
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:58,359
the the traditional stuff you know yeah

214
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:59,958
so mostly what people people say oh yeah

215
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,399
it used to make me paranoid stuff and

216
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:05,078
it's like the assumption is that that's

217
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,559
um because it's just too strong but it's

218
00:10:05,078 --> 00:10:12,000
not necessarily that you can have very

219
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:13,439
strong tropical sativas that um

220
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,600
primarily don't make you feel

221
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,880
particularly paranoid you know yeah by

222
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:22,120
absolutely yeah yeah no that's a good

223
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:24,320
point yeah

224
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,839
um I don't think that's widely talked

225
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:30,480
about either that's a no it's

226
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,959
just it was it's just too strong that's

227
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,639
why I don't smoke it's like well

228
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:34,958
actually you can have a plenty of you

229
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:39,278
know

230
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:42,199
strong uh highs of cannabis that are

231
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:44,360
uh really nice you know yeah they don't

232
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:47,000
evoke the paranoia and all that other

233
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,639
[ __ ] General kind of grebby dirty

234
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,120
feeling that you kind of get yeah but I

235
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:54,079
mean it's not you know again I I'm

236
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,720
always very wary of talking myself into

237
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:58,879
a corner of being kind of anti-modern

238
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:02,360
stuff which I'm not at all I just I I'm

239
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:05,759
I'm just Pro kind of pro diversity Pro

240
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:08,839
um possibility which is why why I think

241
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:12,200
it's worth preserving as much as we can

242
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:14,440
of what there is left of of these things

243
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,879
so that there is that option in the

244
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,880
future of taking the plant down

245
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:22,078
different routes there's this this a

246
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:24,078
sort of default assumption that we've

247
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:26,958
already arrived at the Pinnacle of what

248
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:29,599
can be achieved in cannabis that was so

249
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:31,359
much a part of the last 10 years of

250
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,920
cannabis discourse this assumption it's

251
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,629
like yeah you know these Elite cuts and

252
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:37,919
stuff are like the best we it's like

253
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:42,000
[Music]

254
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:44,319
no sure but sure as [ __ ] aren like the

255
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,278
all there is to be to be achieved you

256
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,240
know yeah I try to explain to people a

257
00:11:46,278 --> 00:11:49,799
lot of the quote unquote Elite Cuts in

258
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,519
the US like most of those were picked

259
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:55,958
out of two three seeds you know like in

260
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:58,959
someone's closet like it's not I mean

261
00:11:55,958 --> 00:12:01,638
Elites definitely uh it's very rare that

262
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:03,679
I find any of those old clones that have

263
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:05,278
been passed around that everyone

264
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:08,199
universally agrees that's [ __ ]

265
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:11,078
amazing it's so rare to ever find that

266
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:13,278
you know there's very few so yeah I the

267
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:15,239
the Clone Market in the US has been

268
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:18,759
completely taking over lately and with

269
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:20,600
that spreading of hlv so a lot of like

270
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:22,480
the past few seasons of what I've been

271
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,159
doing is trying to explain to people the

272
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,680
necessity of seeds versus clones as well

273
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:32,039
in the US and I know that a bunch of the

274
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:34,278
Spanish SE or Spanish clones stuff from

275
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:35,958
here that went over there has murdered

276
00:12:34,278 --> 00:12:37,240
some of the libraries over there of some

277
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:39,879
of the Old Dutch stuff that they had

278
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:42,919
been keeping um right it's not slowing

279
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:44,600
down it's not slowing down anytime soon

280
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:46,479
and so so that's very interesting I

281
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,199
didn't I wasn't aware that this is the

282
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,399
hot latent thyroid yes so it's just

283
00:12:49,198 --> 00:12:54,399
basically [ __ ] everything up oh it's

284
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,679
scenario where we're paying the price of

285
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,559
how [ __ ]

286
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:00,559
homogeneous all of our stuff is already

287
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,838
yeah [ __ ]

288
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:04,119
yeah about it but I hadn't realized it

289
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:06,920
it actually got to the point of like

290
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:09,919
trashing people's collections as well oh

291
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:12,278
yeah um with one of the bigger clone

292
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:14,799
nurseries that I know of and they'll

293
00:13:12,278 --> 00:13:17,559
remain nameless but um they are pretty

294
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:20,639
content with 3% of clones going out with

295
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:23,439
hlv because it's so

296
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:26,519
inundated right just it's assumed that

297
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:29,279
3% is is the best that they can do not

298
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:31,519
0% but 3% is like when you were

299
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:33,078
constantly testing constantly because

300
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,759
they're still bringing stuff in because

301
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:37,319
everybody wants this cookies renamed

302
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:40,159
whatever the new name for cookie stuff

303
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:42,720
is today you know and and it's still

304
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:45,439
working on people obviously um the

305
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,800
education is out there but it's it's not

306
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,600
being accessed or maybe you know there's

307
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:52,519
a big difference between smokers and

308
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,519
Growers there's there's a wide pool that

309
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:55,839
just it's really hard to get through

310
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:57,839
because most people that I've

311
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,680
encountered here the attitude is why do

312
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,680
you care so much it's just weed you

313
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:09,078
know that's like a very standard British

314
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:13,759
attitude it's like it's all just weed

315
00:14:09,078 --> 00:14:15,838
yeah it's like yeah yeah like um

316
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,919
Americans coming over to the UK are just

317
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:22,519
like H you know when they see

318
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:25,559
what's available to someone who is just

319
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:28,240
randomly turning up in England it's it's

320
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:30,319
dismal you know even these days unless

321
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,360
you grow for yourself and or you happen

322
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,800
to be in a city that's particularly like

323
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:38,560
weed orientated it's very very dismal

324
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:40,359
you know but yeah I mean I I that's

325
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:41,879
that's this this is what I've always had

326
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,360
in mind is that you know there there is

327
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:47,799
going to come a point and I had run

328
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:50,759
across the hlv issue but it's not

329
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:52,559
something that impacts me directly with

330
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:55,399
the way I'm operating so I haven't been

331
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,758
looking into it but I there always just

332
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:58,240
going to come a point where something's

333
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:00,360
going to come along that's just going to

334
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,919
[ __ ] decimate

335
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,519
um the the situation and people are

336
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:07,958
going to realize just how [ __ ]

337
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:11,278
homogeneous everything is and it's so

338
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:16,078
based on such a small handful of for the

339
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:18,399
most part um you know uh Dutch and

340
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:21,719
American lines you know there you could

341
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:26,600
probably count them on two hands I

342
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:30,319
expect the main contributors to the and

343
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:32,159
um and and and people don't

344
00:15:30,318 --> 00:15:34,240
people especially sort of below

345
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:36,399
Generation X don't really have any sense

346
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,519
of that I think unless they're nerds you

347
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,679
know yeah they have deep

348
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:43,360
nerds yeah unless you grew up in in the

349
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:47,359
sort of preh

350
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,919
hybrid era or happen to be interested in

351
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,759
the actual growing side of it there's no

352
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:53,679
reason why you necessarily realize you

353
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:59,079
know yeah it's one of the problems as

354
00:15:53,679 --> 00:16:01,638
well um with the uh groups who are doing

355
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:05,719
collecting is a lot of them I can

356
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:08,240
tell not from an age from a generation

357
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:12,399
where they're necessarily even going to

358
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:15,639
know um what a pure land race looks like

359
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,958
in Thailand or Cambodia or whatever yeah

360
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:18,519
you know something that to me would be

361
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:21,318
so obvious that it's been hit with

362
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:24,240
something Dutch or American that

363
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:25,799
genuinely might not even realize that it

364
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,600
I've had people contact me saying hey

365
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm in you know Cambodia or wherever I

366
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,040
found these great plants and it's it's

367
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,039
like yeah they do look like pretty cool

368
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:38,480
plants but I can tell from just a photo

369
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:42,039
that they're not um lacking in

370
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:44,039
Afghan yeah for sure and uh people just

371
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:46,240
don't realize you know they're still

372
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:48,639
they're still worth collecting so it's

373
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,360
but it does it does matter the

374
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,799
difference between them and a

375
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:57,000
pristine population does matter you know

376
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:58,599
yeah um there's no reason like why they

377
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,480
they're not like bad per se it's just

378
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,959
that they are

379
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:06,360
introgressed they're they're down the

380
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:09,078
route of total homogenization they're

381
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:11,759
well down that route already and they're

382
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:13,720
not not even half as valuable as the

383
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:18,679
real thing you know

384
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:20,919
absolutely yeah it's well put yeah so

385
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:24,798
you have a lot of experience with

386
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:27,360
u maybe Southeast Asian is correct with

387
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:29,558
tyan LA I've I've heard you know some of

388
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,719
the stories that

389
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:34,599
uh it was leosan Farmers bringing down

390
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,919
stuff to Thailand is um is there any

391
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:41,038
veracity to that

392
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:42,600
or um it's more the

393
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:45,480
um

394
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:47,558
the um I mean the the thing to bear in

395
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,919
mind is again like it's really important

396
00:17:47,558 --> 00:17:55,158
like really worth um bearing in mind is

397
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:57,640
that these political boundaries yeah

398
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:59,559
uh very modern Creations for the most

399
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:02,000
part that don't have any real

400
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:02,000
in terms

401
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:11,119
of and the culture of the plant so

402
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:14,440
anyway if you picture the if you picture

403
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:17,479
the the meong kind of running from up in

404
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:19,600
of the east of Tibet down into southeast

405
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,558
Asia from you know through the Golden

406
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:24,279
Triangle and down through Thailand and

407
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:26,279
now down towards Cambodia all along the

408
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:28,480
Mong either side of the Mong is is

409
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:31,319
basically ethnic La anyway once you get

410
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:34,919
into to Thailand and and la

411
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:37,158
so uh large chunks of thailander like

412
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:40,360
isan where which is the famous the

413
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:42,880
famous ttic areas of of Thailand are all

414
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:44,119
ethnically low anyway so it wasn't

415
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,080
really a question of people bringing

416
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:47,879
seeds I don't think it's just that the

417
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:51,720
culture um

418
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:54,000
existed yeah and um if you look at the

419
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:57,960
early historical uh

420
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,279
writing in so far as there is any in um

421
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,880
Thailand

422
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:03,759
about

423
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:07,039
cannabis um I think that's some from the

424
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:08,919
sort of 18th century or 19th I think

425
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:11,839
more 19th century some of the earliest

426
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:15,159
references that I've seen people find

427
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:18,439
found uh to Gano and cannabis In tha

428
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:20,600
literature it the the the Tha writers

429
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:23,880
are very much emphasizing that this is a

430
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:25,519
low thing so this was in the context one

431
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:29,000
of the really early references is in the

432
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:32,558
context of a kind of historical Epic

433
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:37,359
uh which is about the uh huge war

434
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:40,720
between the Lao uh Kingdom and the ties

435
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:43,918
that happened um basically I think it

436
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,079
was 1830s maybe I got it I don't quote

437
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,159
me on the dates but not super long ago

438
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:51,038
but anyway

439
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:53,600
um the LA Kingdom's got quite

440
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:57,038
expansionists uh under a guy called jon1

441
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:59,480
I think it was they got ambitious tried

442
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:01,679
to sort of seize bits of Lao and in

443
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:04,240
return the ti basically just

444
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:07,000
annihilated uh vientian and all the big

445
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,960
cities of wow of La particularly like

446
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,038
literally raised it to the

447
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:16,880
ground moved all of the population into

448
00:20:12,038 --> 00:20:18,839
isan into Thailand across the mikon and

449
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,760
because they wanted to have more people

450
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:22,319
there because it was one of the big

451
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:24,359
problems the ti have always had is that

452
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:29,200
the population density was too low for

453
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:30,639
them to uh sort of uh tax Farm the

454
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,279
they they wanted more people there to

455
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:38,159
tax basically yeah that makes sense for

456
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:39,129
the state to to grow and um yeah so it

457
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,280
was a kind of

458
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:43,000
[Music]

459
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:44,720
um the reason there's a very big L

460
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,480
population in Ean is is partly

461
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:51,919
artificial basically so it's a lot of

462
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:55,839
people moved and um the

463
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:57,679
um the culture from a very early all the

464
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:02,678
indications are is that the can cannabis

465
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:04,919
is associated In tha culture with uh

466
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:07,600
rural um

467
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:10,400
populations particularly ethnic La

468
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:13,079
populations and there's a very very

469
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:16,720
strong uh status

470
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:18,558
Association in the In tha culture is

471
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,960
very very status conscious like it's

472
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:23,079
worse than the English or any kind of

473
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:27,240
snobby

474
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:29,839
culture you can choose so all of the

475
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:33,240
politics of Thailand all about the big

476
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:37,519
city Bangkok versus the the the

477
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:39,159
countryside basically and so this the

478
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:41,960
reason I'm giving all of this kind of

479
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:43,480
context is that it's not surprising to

480
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,278
me at all as someone who knows these

481
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,159
areas fairly well it's not surprising to

482
00:21:45,278 --> 00:21:50,640
me that the law has been changed back in

483
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:53,240
Thailand now to ban cannabis again oh is

484
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,120
did they change it back yeah yeah yeah

485
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:58,200
so they're going to by the sometime this

486
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:59,199
I forget they've got a few more months

487
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,038
perhaps

488
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,038
and then they're going to just ban

489
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:05,079
recreational use again it's another

490
00:22:04,038 --> 00:22:08,278
question about whether they'll actually

491
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:10,480
be able to enforce that but um at this

492
00:22:08,278 --> 00:22:12,440
stage but the absolutely no surprise to

493
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,919
me at all whatsoever that the the

494
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:18,679
consensus has been that in in the

495
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:21,200
Bangkok Elite that this should not be

496
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:22,840
allowed uh and they're going to do what

497
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,558
the British have done they're going to

498
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:26,439
basically copy our model of like

499
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:28,639
allowing some medicinal industry that

500
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:31,278
them and their mates will get to cash in

501
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:34,159
on so the kind of industrialists and

502
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:36,359
Elite will get to make a killing out of

503
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,799
the medicinal industry but and everyone

504
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:41,359
else can go [ __ ] themselves and get a

505
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:43,319
prescription or go to jail you know it's

506
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:46,199
not much different than the US like if

507
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:50,918
you it really ended

508
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:53,360
up yeah um so it's the same it's the

509
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:55,080
same sort of whatever dialectic whatever

510
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:58,639
you want to say just because it's

511
00:22:55,079 --> 00:23:01,079
basically cannabis is a is a is a is a

512
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,240
peasant drug basically in yeah to put it

513
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:06,798
in the bluntest terms in in Thailand

514
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,000
now that means that some people have a

515
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:10,918
some Elite establishment types have a

516
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,798
kind of affectionate attitude towards it

517
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:15,720
it's like oh it's the country bunkin

518
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:18,519
kind of thing other people look down on

519
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:21,839
it disdain for it sure and there's the

520
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:24,839
definite hierarchy you know in terms of

521
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:27,839
things like apetamin and and opiates and

522
00:23:24,839 --> 00:23:29,439
stuff in Southeast Asia that's that

523
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:32,399
about

524
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:35,000
Elite versus

525
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:38,038
rural Poor Man's drug rich man's drugs

526
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,558
and various in between yeah um and

527
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:44,480
cannabis is definitely the poor man's

528
00:23:39,558 --> 00:23:46,240
drug you know so wild yeah [ __ ] up we

529
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,960
will we will assume it's like oh it's

530
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,079
part of the culture quote unquote but

531
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,360
it's much more complicated than that in

532
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:55,158
Asia you need to have a kind of sense of

533
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:57,839
how stratified and fractured all of

534
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:59,679
these countries are in terms of the

535
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:01,639
culture and the the geography and how

536
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,919
that relates to to cannabis it's it's

537
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,120
not straightforward you know it's not

538
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:08,759
straightforward that they're going to

539
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:13,000
legalize India by any means um and it

540
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:14,679
it's very strongly connected to how the

541
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,319
um political establishment relate

542
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:21,919
towards the uh minorities and and

543
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:24,200
Village communities in terms of how they

544
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:27,360
see it and it's all kind of complicated

545
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:30,319
ideas about smoking versus eating it and

546
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:33,879
which is smoking generally not okay and

547
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:35,720
maybe eating it kind of okay and it's so

548
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,600
it's so it's not at all the question

549
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:40,360
that it's

550
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:43,480
like um the shorthand that we in the

551
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:46,000
west tend to go for like uh the

552
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:49,278
Americans came and ban it and bl it's

553
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,640
like yes and but no not really there

554
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:55,159
were moves to ban these things long

555
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:57,720
before the um uh

556
00:24:55,159 --> 00:25:02,600
American hegemony or whatever was a

557
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:05,480
thing and and and a lot of the the the

558
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:08,158
um British involvement ironically was

559
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:09,640
strongly lent towards not making it

560
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,720
illegal because the British were there

561
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:14,840
to make money in in India and places and

562
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,319
the the loudest voices who were pushing

563
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:20,639
for it to be made illegal were generally

564
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:23,798
Indians yeah of a certain establishment

565
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,880
type of in of mentality in India that

566
00:25:23,798 --> 00:25:28,398
regarded this stuff as unacceptable you

567
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,559
know and that was nothing to do with uh

568
00:25:28,398 --> 00:25:33,918
them being contaminated by puritanical

569
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:36,200
Western ideas these were like

570
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,880
locally

571
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:41,880
born ways of thinking about these

572
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,880
substances that Associated them with

573
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,600
undesirable groups like cannabis was

574
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:48,320
very strongly associated with Muslim

575
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:49,918
culture in India for example uh

576
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:52,720
particularly the smoking hashish was

577
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,440
associated with Muslims yeah and then in

578
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,038
far as it had any Hindu connections it

579
00:25:54,440 --> 00:26:00,320
was Associated often with Village forms

580
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:03,278
of Hinduism that were as being

581
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:06,918
um sort of folk versions of Hinduism

582
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:08,558
that were not sophisticated and or or

583
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:10,360
were contaminated

584
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:13,519
with

585
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:15,558
um uh you know unorthodox forms of

586
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:17,558
Hinduism that were disapproved of you

587
00:26:15,558 --> 00:26:19,960
know so there's all kinds of like

588
00:26:17,558 --> 00:26:22,359
nuances in there in terms of it um you

589
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,919
know it's not as as pessimistic but I

590
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:25,798
can't I'm not like anticipating some

591
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,080
glorious future age of legalization

592
00:26:25,798 --> 00:26:29,398
there going to be around the corner

593
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:30,839
unfortunately there was where I thought

594
00:26:29,398 --> 00:26:33,719
maybe maybe because the money will

595
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:35,359
decide it and then I'm like no it's not

596
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:40,679
it's not going to I don't think we're

597
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:44,439
going to be like living in some Global

598
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:46,600
legal situation anytime soon basically

599
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,320
yeah it just seems like no matter what

600
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:50,558
happens it's always going to be putting

601
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:53,359
the hand the the money into the hands of

602
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:55,759
the few so maybe opening it up you know

603
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:59,000
built this Market but closing it back

604
00:26:55,759 --> 00:27:03,158
down puts it back into the 1% type

605
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:06,079
situation yeah yeah it's it's pretty

606
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:09,080
difficult once yeah basically I think so

607
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:11,158
and once it's been once you've got a

608
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:14,319
Prohibition scenario like

609
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:17,278
extricating yourself from

610
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:19,879
that you know it's not straightforward

611
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:22,398
especially when there such a strong

612
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:25,960
plutocratic sort of oligarchical

613
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:28,759
tendency in in in our dysfunctional

614
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:30,600
democracies these days it's like when

615
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:33,398
you combine that with how difficult it

616
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:35,639
is to have a sensible discussion about

617
00:27:33,398 --> 00:27:40,319
these types of topics in the in the

618
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:43,519
media these days it's uh it's yeah it's

619
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:45,519
very tricky you know yeah for sure yeah

620
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:48,519
I mean there's people in the USA that

621
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:50,240
you know applied for licenses and

622
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:52,519
because and didn't end up getting it for

623
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,759
whatever reason and then now they're on

624
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:57,599
paper and now they get rated like it's

625
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:59,440
yeah it's it's been wild to watch it

626
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:02,079
happen over the past you know however

627
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,919
many years and uh I can't imagine it's

628
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:06,759
going to get any better anywhere after

629
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,960
people have watched the rich sort of

630
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:13,960
take over the whole

631
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:17,079
industry yes I mean I I don't know like

632
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:19,640
um I I was very not optimistic but I was

633
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:21,759
kind of cautiously optimistic that like

634
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:24,840
even if it wasn't for the right reasons

635
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:26,200
we might end up with legalization sure

636
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:29,038
um

637
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:31,240
because you know and and and the quirks

638
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:32,839
of the political system in the states

639
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,558
where you can have these sort of

640
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:37,119
referenda and stuff referendums in

641
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:39,519
places like Oregon or whatever

642
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:43,038
that we don't have anything like that in

643
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:44,640
the UK equivalent to that so I was sort

644
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:46,079
of watching somewhat enviously and

645
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,480
thinking yeah well it's only a matter of

646
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:49,798
time before you've got Federal

647
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,440
legalization and I noticed Harris has

648
00:28:49,798 --> 00:28:53,519
been saying she's going to do that and

649
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,360
things who knows you know I mean maybe

650
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:58,880
they will but it does require like some

651
00:28:55,359 --> 00:29:02,079
courage on the part of

652
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:04,600
um people in power to actually do what

653
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:07,918
they know I mean talk to any of these

654
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:10,240
people they all know what they should do

655
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:13,080
and but they'll always do sort of some

656
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:15,519
sort of half-hearted fudge in the end

657
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:17,879
you know I mean you know the chance of

658
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:20,720
like having sensible laws about actually

659
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:23,200
kind of properly dangerous drugs is is

660
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,919
very unlikely anytime soon and

661
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,679
particularly given that even the sort of

662
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:28,480
more enlightened discourse around these

663
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:30,360
things

664
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,480
is so

665
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:34,798
um incapable of you know like I'm

666
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,319
thinking like you see all this talk

667
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:38,918
about psychedelics these days and

668
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:41,480
psychic this Andy that and it's like

669
00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:42,759
yeah okay but you know are we gonna just

670
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,079
we're gonna go we're gonna go and legal

671
00:29:42,759 --> 00:29:45,200
these things legalize all these things

672
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:47,879
and then we're going to leave like the

673
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:50,080
actual [ __ ] like fentel and heroin and

674
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:52,880
meth or whatever that right actually is

675
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:55,199
really where you need to change the law

676
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,760
yeah if you're actually concerned about

677
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,840
not having all these people dying and

678
00:29:56,759 --> 00:30:03,759
stuff uh but yeah it's like uh you

679
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:06,480
know cannabis ex exceptionalism

680
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:09,558
psychedelic exceptionalism and all this

681
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,558
stuff it's like

682
00:30:09,798 --> 00:30:14,639
uh is a whole is a whole other

683
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,159
conversation but um I don't see it's

684
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:20,360
going to feature anytime soon in the

685
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:23,039
sort of any any any any serious

686
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:25,319
discussions basically you know I I just

687
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:28,000
recently learned that in Oregon um

688
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:30,278
because someone got busted there um

689
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,919
seeds seed cells and stuff is is a

690
00:30:30,278 --> 00:30:36,278
serious felony if you you're not like

691
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:39,000
you know fully legal with paperwork and

692
00:30:36,278 --> 00:30:42,398
everything and they yeah dude went to

693
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,720
jail still in there yeah kind of blew my

694
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:46,599
mind because when I think of Oregon like

695
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,319
when I visited um it's it's very open

696
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:52,158
cannabis wise much more open than where

697
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:55,839
I'm at in California obviously

698
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:58,840
like I'm not up to speed but yeah like

699
00:30:55,839 --> 00:31:02,079
it it it seemed pretty I know normalize

700
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:04,158
there but uh the seeds if you're not

701
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:06,879
legal you know you don't have all your

702
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:11,799
paperwork in it's a lot more serious

703
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:14,840
penalties uh I no idea mind yeah yeah

704
00:31:11,798 --> 00:31:16,879
it's very tricky it's so sort of So like

705
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:19,918
um there's such a big gray area with all

706
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:23,200
of this stuff it's uh you know in the UK

707
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,720
itself totally uncontrolled in terms of

708
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,519
moving the seeds in and out of the

709
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,600
country yeah it's not there's zero

710
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:32,798
regulation on it like literally none you

711
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:35,879
know yeah it's

712
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:38,319
um as in to to leave the borders of the

713
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:40,519
UK and come into the UK you know sure

714
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:43,000
but itly for the destination countries

715
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:46,359
it's becomes infinitely more complicated

716
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,880
but absolutely it's it's so um it's it's

717
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:51,879
so uh it's so so sort of surreal this is

718
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:54,679
the thing though I mean and I I tend to

719
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:56,080
repeat myself so just steer me onto

720
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:58,559
something else if I'm getting boring

721
00:31:56,079 --> 00:32:00,599
sure go ahead the weird thing with the

722
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:05,119
the UK is it's not historically actually

723
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:08,158
been a country that has tended to to to

724
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:09,599
prohibit stuff you know yeah like Narco

725
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,639
colonialism was one of the most

726
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:14,038
controversial aspects of our history in

727
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:16,278
terms of things like opium and and all

728
00:32:14,038 --> 00:32:18,319
of that so yeah Colonial history

729
00:32:16,278 --> 00:32:21,440
imperialist history of the UK was drugs

730
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:23,398
were a huge part of it the the elite

731
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,759
discourse of this establishment figures

732
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:29,158
you know the sort of liberal old school

733
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:31,278
liberal kind of 19 Century 18th century

734
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:32,600
liberals for the most part just like in

735
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:33,960
so far as they knew about these things

736
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:35,719
just didn't give a [ __ ] it was like well

737
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:38,360
that's something they do there can we

738
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:42,240
make money out of it yes can we tax it

739
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:45,479
yes great you know ex subject you know

740
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:48,480
and then um in in in the UK itself like

741
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:52,399
uh you know heroin was available on

742
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:55,720
prescription as late as the the 19 19

743
00:32:52,398 --> 00:33:00,479
late 1960s you know you could still yeah

744
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:02,720
yeah and um it was Ed as a as a opiate

745
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,960
addiction was a medical thing the notion

746
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,200
that it should even be considered

747
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:10,840
criminal was completely just anathema to

748
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:12,840
the whole way it was with you know um so

749
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:15,278
you know people like William Burrows and

750
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:17,278
all these kind of beat type characters

751
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:19,798
would come to the UK and stuff you know

752
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:21,919
because it was so because it was such a

753
00:33:19,798 --> 00:33:24,158
common sense culture towards these

754
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:27,480
things you know yeah but then obviously

755
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:32,278
went like off the rails dramatically by

756
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:35,759
the 70s uh yeah and um partly

757
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:37,638
for actually kind of historical reasons

758
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:39,480
not necessarily to do with America per

759
00:33:37,638 --> 00:33:42,638
se but it was you know largely sort of

760
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:46,319
American leg the the the move towards a

761
00:33:42,638 --> 00:33:49,158
more aggressive Pro prohibitionist

762
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:54,638
stance yeah but it it

763
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:56,000
um yeah I mean uh you know even our sort

764
00:33:54,638 --> 00:33:58,839
of I think it's probably the same in the

765
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,960
States now like doesn't matter how far

766
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:02,240
right you go really most people in in

767
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,519
the

768
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:07,319
conservative politics in the UK will if

769
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,878
you talk to them on a personal basis

770
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:10,319
even publicly now would be like yeah of

771
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:12,639
course it shouldn't be criminalized you

772
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,919
know should be yeah legal you know

773
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:17,800
everything you know but um that's wild

774
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:20,118
so much different than the US I mean I

775
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:23,320
maybe maybe politicians on the right

776
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:24,358
would say that privately but definitely

777
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:27,760
not

778
00:34:24,358 --> 00:34:30,159
publicly definely I don't know if it's a

779
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,839
a religious thing because our country

780
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,599
religious sorry sorry what was that I'm

781
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:35,918
not sure if it's a religious thing

782
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:38,320
because our country is so religious

783
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:40,358
based or or what the difference is

784
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:43,320
there I mean it was definitely one of

785
00:34:40,358 --> 00:34:47,719
the major

786
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:51,359
um dividing lines between the US and the

787
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:55,959
UK was that there was a strong

788
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:58,440
disapproval of of uh British imperialism

789
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:01,920
particularly in Asia yeah you know in

790
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:05,200
World War II the Americans were just

791
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,559
very openly like why the [ __ ] should we

792
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:09,199
even be helping you guys keep control of

793
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:11,759
your colonies you know ignoring the

794
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:15,559
hypocrisy of the Philippines and

795
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:20,160
whatever but but um the attitude was

796
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:21,880
that and and and and and it was uh even

797
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:23,399
before then the League of Nations when

798
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:25,599
the first kind of international attempts

799
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:28,160
of prohibition happened we're talking

800
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:29,480
kind of 1920s and stuff

801
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:31,719
um it was the Americans and the

802
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:34,599
Egyptians who led the move to kind of

803
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:36,879
include cannabis on all of the um

804
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:38,200
antiopi laws which were the real driver

805
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,400
of the first attempt to like

806
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:44,639
internationally prohibit drugs through

807
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:47,280
the League of Nations to preu type idea

808
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:48,960
the it was the Americans and Egyptians

809
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,839
who would really led the charge

810
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,679
especially to get cannabis included on

811
00:35:50,838 --> 00:35:57,639
the on the laws and that ironically that

812
00:35:53,679 --> 00:36:00,239
was using data from the um quotes Luna

813
00:35:57,639 --> 00:36:01,679
IC asylums of of Egypt that the British

814
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:04,039
had actually put together because there

815
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:07,519
were kind of doctors and stuff within

816
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:09,239
the imperialist Machinery who were

817
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:11,000
focused on this idea that cannabis

818
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:14,239
caused insanity and that it was

819
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,920
associated with criminality and stuff so

820
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:21,719
it was partly British material like that

821
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:24,599
research that supported the idea was was

822
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:27,559
used to support the idea that cannabis

823
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:30,119
might somehow make you insane or was a

824
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:31,838
associated with violence and criminality

825
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:33,200
yeah basically because the British even

826
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:36,519
though they didn't want to ban these

827
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:39,480
things in in India were we still quite

828
00:36:36,519 --> 00:36:41,440
happy to use the association between

829
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,838
cannabis and like marginal

830
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,599
groups you know groups of men hanging

831
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:48,599
out on Street in in parks and in urban

832
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:50,760
centers like laborers and stuff smoking

833
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:52,880
cannabis oh what are you doing uh you

834
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:55,079
know they were quite happy to kind of

835
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:59,160
police these groups

836
00:36:55,079 --> 00:37:02,318
using um well you know to control these

837
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:05,039
groups using cannabis you know so some

838
00:37:02,318 --> 00:37:08,759
kind of radical dervish gets conscripted

839
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:10,719
into some army unit and it's causing

840
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:13,119
problems in the Barrack so he smokes

841
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:14,719
hash he's insane put him in the lunatic

842
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,400
asylum you know what I mean so they were

843
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:19,719
still it was still exploiting it to

844
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,960
control undesirable people you know yeah

845
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:25,358
so there was this kind of paper trail

846
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:28,039
associating cannabis with um mental

847
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:31,480
illness that was used as early as the

848
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:36,759
1920s to to kind of Sho horn cannabis

849
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:39,199
into the antiopi Opium laws um wild

850
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:42,000
yeah I could dig into this with you

851
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:43,960
forever but I I definitely want to make

852
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,559
sure that we go over some of what you

853
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:50,280
have in stock because oh yeah sure yeah

854
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:52,039
please yeah yeah yeah I mean yeah I'd

855
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:54,240
love to have you on you know whenever

856
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:56,239
you have more time too because I like I

857
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:58,199
said there each one of these topics like

858
00:37:56,239 --> 00:38:00,439
you you could really open it up and talk

859
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:02,639
about it forever and this is uh what

860
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:06,318
fascinates me

861
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:06,318
uh I know least

862
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:10,200
about yeah far away like because it's

863
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,318
better if

864
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:14,279
you give me some questions so that I

865
00:38:12,318 --> 00:38:15,719
don't just drift back onto stuff that

866
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:20,599
some people would have heard me talk

867
00:38:15,719 --> 00:38:22,519
about before so so the um let's start

868
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:24,880
with uh one of the ones I had experience

869
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:26,800
with was from uh the Highland Thai

870
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,480
Burmese I think it was called when it

871
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,400
was first released

872
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:33,400
yeah that one's I thought that was an

873
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:35,358
amazing like uh plant that could be done

874
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:38,160
well indoor I don't know how it would

875
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:41,400
compare to you know point of origin but

876
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:43,759
it could be done well indoor in the USA

877
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,800
um what can you tell me about that

878
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:50,599
line um

879
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:51,519
so that um has been through a couple of

880
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:58,000
like

881
00:38:51,519 --> 00:39:01,800
exitu maintenance grows now um so

882
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:04,318
it's gonna I and I haven't directly been

883
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:07,200
involved with that since I originally

884
00:39:04,318 --> 00:39:10,039
collected the seeds so any there may

885
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:14,039
have been inevitably going have been

886
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:16,119
some possible shifts in what it actually

887
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:18,880
is now just from the fact that you know

888
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:21,240
we can't do more than like double digits

889
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:25,640
in terms of plant numbers of maintaining

890
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:30,399
it realistically so

891
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:32,519
um I got it from uh in in mongon from a

892
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:36,358
guy who

893
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:38,079
um uh an exat guy who was based up sort

894
00:39:36,358 --> 00:39:41,199
of you know very near the border with

895
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:45,160
Burma and there were Hill tribe groups

896
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:49,279
um uh who had got a hold of seeds and

897
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:51,920
yeah it's difficult to know like I I

898
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:54,720
hopefully will be finding out soon based

899
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:57,800
on genomics analysis of it what exactly

900
00:39:54,719 --> 00:40:00,399
is in the mix but I suspect it may have

901
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:04,119
a bit of hybridization with more like

902
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:07,519
kind of East Asian hemp lines in there

903
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:10,920
not just a a pure

904
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:15,679
um it's not like a simple kind of

905
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:19,760
pristine ganja uh land race

906
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:21,519
um but there's taii like Shan is another

907
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,000
name for them kind of groups up in those

908
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:25,559
areas who definitely have a culture of

909
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,079
of growing cannabis for themselves

910
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:30,440
sometimes like it was a real problem for

911
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:32,640
uh this friend of mine or rather you

912
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:37,960
know not friend of mine but guy I I met

913
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:41,159
who was um growing up there he he would

914
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:42,838
do these kind of gorilla grows yeah with

915
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:44,480
tropical you know really nice like

916
00:40:42,838 --> 00:40:48,159
tropical lines like kind of a carola

917
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:51,079
Hayes and stuff and then they the plants

918
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:53,440
would get to like you know within like a

919
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:54,920
couple of days just being just right you

920
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,039
know and he goes out to cut them down

921
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:58,000
and he just finds some Shang come and

922
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:00,880
just

923
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,119
Tak a whole lot you like exactly when

924
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:06,160
it's just like a you know he like [ __ ]

925
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:08,280
that's so brutal because they already

926
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:11,039
know exactly how to grow it themselves

927
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:13,010
so they're like um they're waiting for

928
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:14,639
the the perfect

929
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:17,440
[Music]

930
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:20,960
moment the day before he goes out to to

931
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:23,920
get them take the whole [ __ ] lck

932
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:26,318
scared me about gorilla grows is is yeah

933
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,159
like here they say plant one for you

934
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:31,000
plant one for the cop plant one for the

935
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:34,679
thieves you

936
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:39,119
yeah yeah thieving is is not great but

937
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:41,399
it's what it is just the the um but yeah

938
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,119
so I think they were lahu the actual

939
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,519
guys he got the seed from that lahu kind

940
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:47,119
of like a Musa is another name for them

941
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:50,679
they're like kind of a minority group

942
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:52,240
who uh around those border regions a lot

943
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:54,919
they like you know Hill tribe would be

944
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:57,239
the kind of people would use they and

945
00:41:54,920 --> 00:42:00,440
they move across the borders between

946
00:41:57,239 --> 00:42:05,118
China and Burma and L places quite

947
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:08,159
readily uh and uh I think they were

948
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:10,079
growing and got a hold of some seeds but

949
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:14,719
the thing is around there there's quite

950
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:17,760
a lot of um cultivation of uh fiber

951
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:18,759
types land races as well in those areas

952
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,960
particularly because it's been

953
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:23,319
encouraged by the Thai government so

954
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:25,079
there's just quite a high chance that

955
00:42:23,318 --> 00:42:27,358
there's been hybrid hybridization

956
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:31,280
between them like my experience of was

957
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:34,799
it was not like a highly potent compared

958
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:37,960
to what you can have in land races yeah

959
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:40,440
and then the very tall plants as well

960
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:43,838
plus the hollow stem tendency made me

961
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:45,639
think like quite possibly there's some

962
00:42:43,838 --> 00:42:47,719
hybridization

963
00:42:45,639 --> 00:42:49,960
happened and there's certainly other

964
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:51,959
lines where that's plausible that that's

965
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:55,639
happened because they are grown on the

966
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:58,119
same grow Cycles as the hemp hemp and

967
00:42:55,639 --> 00:43:00,480
and and and gander gr on the same grow

968
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:02,318
Cycles quite often in those areas so

969
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,400
there's possibility of

970
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:07,558
pollen Crossing

971
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:10,200
between populations it's so and I was

972
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:12,079
just thinking about it like um asking

973
00:43:10,199 --> 00:43:13,399
you to explain any of the scent profiles

974
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,839
and stuff like that but it really

975
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:19,680
doesn't translate like because like you

976
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:21,838
said it's a very plastic you know um I

977
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:22,919
wouldn't want to that in the sense that

978
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:25,599
like

979
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:28,519
um the Nuance is so hard to get right I

980
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:30,960
mean yeah um

981
00:43:28,519 --> 00:43:34,880
when I saw them like he deliberately had

982
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:38,280
brought down like two the two kind of

983
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:40,358
main expressions of that high high land

984
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:42,119
race that I mean it may be something

985
00:43:40,358 --> 00:43:44,480
totally different from what the Highland

986
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:46,280
High that goes around in America under

987
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,318
the same name by the way probably I

988
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,680
shouldn't have used that name for it

989
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:51,279
just adds to the confusion but he

990
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:53,719
brought down like a a very much more

991
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:56,359
kind of light green and the light green

992
00:43:53,719 --> 00:43:59,078
and the purple batch yeah of the same

993
00:43:56,358 --> 00:44:02,199
land race and the purple batch was much

994
00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:05,119
more kind of down the mango koty end MH

995
00:44:02,199 --> 00:44:07,358
of the smell smell types and then the

996
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,400
light green I much preferred was more

997
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:11,119
kind of like it's really hard to

998
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,400
describe but it was sort of citrus but

999
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:14,800
not like straightforwardly it was like

1000
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,480
very kind of

1001
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:19,480
musky

1002
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:21,119
um uh it's very hard to describe smells

1003
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:24,559
but it was a much more compelling smell

1004
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:27,318
for me and I'm sure would be the

1005
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:30,480
preference if I was working the line was

1006
00:44:27,318 --> 00:44:34,318
that that side of it sure

1007
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:36,480
um uh but you know um the other thing

1008
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:39,039
the reason I suspect some Chinese hemp

1009
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:44,960
type East Asian hemp type is the the

1010
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:48,000
leaves um could be very um broad not not

1011
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:51,280
like not like with the the indicia shape

1012
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,920
per se necessarily although you not I

1013
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:55,200
need I I need to actually look at them

1014
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:57,838
again to see where the broadest point is

1015
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:59,519
on them but the but the they just anyway

1016
00:44:57,838 --> 00:45:01,719
look like something quite distinct from

1017
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:07,318
the real kind of classic La isan Thai

1018
00:45:01,719 --> 00:45:07,318
type um je pool you know
