Matthew owner of Riot seeds and this

5
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,359
started as a one-man mission for strain

history and breeding science over time

7
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,559
it's evolved into something bigger

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,960
better and more of a team effort we will

9
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:22,640
be joined by members of the can

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,880
Illuminati and other friends throughout

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,039
the seasons to hear their takes on grow

combat the Nar the corporate cannabis

Syndicate welcome to reader Syndicate

20
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,520
I'm Matthew here with thousandfold and

21
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:54,280
today we are going to be talking

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:56,559
about thousand jel jel that's right one

23
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:59,320
of my favorite plants one of my favorite

24
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:01,238
uh clones it's been kept over the years

25
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,878
and we're going to give you a I don't

26
00:01:01,238 --> 00:01:04,759
know how short or long it's going to be

27
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:07,719
but we're going to give you a thorough

28
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:10,080
rundown of the Clone uh more about it

29
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:13,118
where it came from Etc and with that

30
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:16,519
thousand you want to um Kick It

31
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:19,438
Off yeah well I think I was wondering

32
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:22,959
whether or not you want to start with uh

33
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:27,239
the kind of who did who said you know

34
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:28,839
who said what um when uh versus trits

35
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:30,359
what do you yeah we'll start with the

36
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,359
we'll start with the back history on

37
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:36,920
just kind of where it popped up from

38
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:40,399
yeah sounds good so jel came from the

39
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:44,960
chem dog crew originally now uh The

40
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:46,879
Story Goes that it was Kim dog Greg who

41
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:50,280
I believe his first quotes were that it

42
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:52,158
was the chem dog D herming onto the mass

43
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,640
Super Skunk clone which is different

44
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:58,240
than the VA Super Skunk clone different

45
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:01,039
than the mom of sour as best we know and

46
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:03,399
um we don't know what year I've asked

47
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:05,560
him several times but it's uh not it's

48
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:08,840
inconclusive as of yet unless he finds

49
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:11,080
his journal can I year yeah yeah when

50
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,719
you say it's different from the VA SS is

51
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,040
this do you think that it was just like

52
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:18,800
a Sensei SS like from yeah yeah so after

53
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:21,120
talking to Gabby um like we've always

54
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,480
had this assumption and knowledge a

55
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,599
little bit just from different people in

56
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:27,560
the group saying yeah we went we went

57
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:28,919
and bought more centy Seed Super Skunk

58
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,959
whether they went there to get it or

59
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:32,639
ordered it don't know but they had more

60
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,878
sensey Seed Super skun that they popped

61
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:37,399
at some point we know that for sure but

62
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:39,239
after talking to Gabby um he readily

63
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,360
confirmed that there was more CTI seeds

64
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:44,640
Super Skunk popped all over the place

65
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,360
between all those Crews so I'm not sure

66
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:50,039
if um they did that because the VA Super

67
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,480
Skunk was known as a super skunk even

68
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:54,439
though it was probably a hybrid

69
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:58,878
according to the guy who uh made it or

70
00:02:54,439 --> 00:03:01,840
accidentally made it um M I'll call him

71
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:03,598
um but I don't know if because they knew

72
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,280
that super skunk was somewhat in that

73
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:07,399
first one from VA that was really dank

74
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,239
that they decided they were going to

75
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,120
start chasing super skunks up and down

76
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,840
there or if they just had smoked other

77
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,280
super skunks and said wow this is really

78
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,158
dank and we're going to go for it that

79
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:20,000
way but at some point they acquired more

80
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:21,959
um super skunk seeds um let's see what

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,598
else uh

82
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:28,360
so Kim dog said that he made it again we

83
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:32,639
don't know what year I'm assuming early

84
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:35,920
2000s to Mid mid maybe 2004 to 2006

85
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:39,279
sounds more accurate but I do think it

86
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:41,839
was around before 2006 pretty sure on

87
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,199
the chem timeline where is this relative

88
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,120
to

89
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:48,399
the

90
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,480
uh you know the the different seed pops

91
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,920
do you

92
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:55,438
know kind very fuzzy right yeah yeah I

93
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:57,479
mean it's a hard question because it all

94
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:59,120
depends on whose point of view you take

95
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:01,318
when it comes to the chem seed lines

96
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,640
like it is Kim d one of the original

97
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:07,438
seeds if not is it 91 Super Skunk which

98
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:10,798
Super Skunk was it the one from ceny

99
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:13,120
which I think it was if that's the case

100
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,239
according to to Greg that D was in the

101
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,918
room at least when Jesus was made so it

102
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,560
has to be later if we are going by what

103
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,639
he says and that's my friend I'm not

104
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,959
going to call him a liar or anything

105
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,800
crazy um if we believe that's what he

106
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:27,959
says then it would have had to have been

107
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:32,400
at least a later pop than whatever was

108
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:33,560
made to po if that makes sense um and

109
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:35,439
I'm sure it's going to confuse the [ __ ]

110
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,399
out of people who have but you just go

111
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,879
back and listen to our chem dog episodes

112
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:42,359
it it really goes into detail about

113
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:43,879
which one we think it is and again we'll

114
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,400
we'll reference the Codex later the

115
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:48,759
Codex also talks deeply about the chem

116
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:50,399
dog situation and what was what so

117
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:51,720
definitely check out our codex and we'll

118
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,439
link you in the

119
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,840
description but yeah I think uh yeah

120
00:04:54,439 --> 00:05:00,360
that covers it with what was said um

121
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:03,198
there was another person in involved in

122
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,720
in Greg's close crew um in chem dog

123
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,680
Greg's close crew named Bundy and we

124
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:12,280
know that he was a uh a good friend of

125
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:15,000
Greg um and he was doing a lot of the

126
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:16,719
library keeping he was very into making

127
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,160
crosses he

128
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:23,360
was I would say probably more of the

129
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,360
strain nerd in the group trying to keep

130
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,080
um tabs on that kind of stuff and

131
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,639
there's some other sister lines that

132
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:31,159
I've been able to get a hold of I would

133
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,439
say not sister but maybe tangential

134
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:37,520
sister if that makes sense um like like

135
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:40,319
snow dog snow dog looks very similar to

136
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:42,439
jel it smokes very similar to jel um

137
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:46,039
it's much more resinous a little bit

138
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:48,680
more sweet um but I would gather it was

139
00:05:46,038 --> 00:05:51,038
probably made around a similar time to

140
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:54,038
the uh gel they both kind of pop up

141
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:56,120
around the same time and in my opinion

142
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:57,519
Bundy probably had something more to do

143
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,160
with it because it seems like some of

144
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:01,519
the work that he was doing um

145
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,199
I had a question here because I don't

146
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:07,839
know that much about snow dog um is it

147
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:11,319
also considered a chemam quote unquote

148
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:12,560
okay yeah snow dog um what was it or

149
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:15,680
snow

150
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,680
bubbleberry cam snow Bubble cam I think

151
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,400
it was

152
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,160
called other yeah there are these other

153
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:23,918
Cuts around chemam that I don't doesn't

154
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,360
seem like it's very clear that it's from

155
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:29,719
them like I don't know snow dog jel

156
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,400
these are lesser known obviously Kim and

157
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,919
and I think also because like even

158
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:35,079
though some of them had like dog in the

159
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:37,719
name like snow dog snow dog was passed

160
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:40,038
around quite a bit because it had dog in

161
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,599
the name but jel kind of dropped to the

162
00:06:40,038 --> 00:06:44,800
side it was one of the there was never

163
00:06:42,598 --> 00:06:46,360
any hype for jel over all the years like

164
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,879
when I first got the cut there wasn't

165
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,319
jel hype nobody was chasing jel most

166
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:53,240
people never heard of it didn't know

167
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:55,360
what it was that's an interesting thing

168
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,840
to talk about as well like I know in the

169
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,960
past you've said you think that's partly

170
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:00,959
because of the name yes in my mind I'm

171
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,478
like but but don't people like diesel so

172
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,959
wouldn't they have thought oh gel is

173
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:08,120
like a diesel thing that sounds cool um

174
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:12,000
even based on but there was also another

175
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:14,120
line called chel out and most people

176
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
when you said jel were assuming you were

177
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:19,240
talking about chel so that was also

178
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,560
another issue you know the UK cheese

179
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,960
diesel by someone else I think uh maybe

180
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,759
that's a heath Robinson thing if I

181
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:29,560
remember correctly the cheel but um it

182
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:32,400
had nothing to do with the gel uh as

183
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,240
Greg told it to me it was G's diesel is

184
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:35,959
where the name came from Greg's diesel

185
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,439
yeah

186
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:41,079
so as he explained it it was his

187
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:43,160
favorite version of the chems and

188
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:46,158
diesels and that's why it was called G's

189
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:48,439
Diesel and as uh Manny from the sour

190
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:50,719
crew explained it to me as well they

191
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:52,079
used the term diesel to describe

192
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,400
everything and he thought it was more

193
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:56,680
like and since he was one of the people

194
00:07:53,399 --> 00:08:00,198
that named the cam bag seed the our chem

195
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,439
bag seed that became diesel um he was I

196
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:03,560
asked him like where did you get the

197
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:06,478
name like he's like well Diesel jeans

198
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,399
were popular things like that diesel gas

199
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,038
like it all kind of came in at the same

200
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:13,399
time and that's kind of why the term

201
00:08:10,038 --> 00:08:15,399
diesel popped up and plus chem weed

202
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:17,560
didn't really flow well with Organic

203
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:20,279
Growers they didn't like that term chem

204
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,598
weed so they preferred to call it diesel

205
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:24,959
instead and it makes sense you know like

206
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:26,959
the organic Growers can get real

207
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:29,359
studious about that you know what I mean

208
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:31,239
like even the name would bother him so

209
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,918
so funny enough I guess what you were

210
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:36,120
implying is that if he called it like

211
00:08:32,918 --> 00:08:39,319
Kim F it probably would have sold Kim G

212
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:41,719
been chased forever I think I I say that

213
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,719
but then Kim one is not really chased

214
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:45,920
but it was also held back so tight that

215
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:48,200
nobody really got to grow it for so long

216
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:49,559
you know but yeah yeah chem1 isn't

217
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,959
really chased either so it kind of

218
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:54,399
shoots somewhat of a hole in my thing

219
00:08:51,958 --> 00:08:56,399
but it's it's the best I can gather I

220
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,399
mean it it was available it was not

221
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,839
really hoarded the diesel clone like

222
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,839
people would pass it I passed it a lot

223
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:06,360
but um most people would just drop it

224
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:09,680
it's a hard plant to grow um now we

225
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,399
talked about what it's supposed to be um

226
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:13,519
we'll talk about what it is in a little

227
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:15,039
bit do we want to go into any of other

228
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,399
history stuff there any other questions

229
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:19,199
we have there is there any other context

230
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:21,720
that you think is interesting I guess is

231
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,920
maybe another way of you know um we

232
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,879
talked about the name we talked about

233
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:27,838
the

234
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:29,919
crew um it's it's been really it's been

235
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,880
really interesting uh most trying to

236
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:35,000
track down the dates because knowing the

237
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:37,838
dates would help this make a lot more

238
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,600
sense um of what it was what else was in

239
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:43,040
the room that was made um it would give

240
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,000
us more of a clue oh if if Kim dogd was

241
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:49,000
the the pollen contributor what else did

242
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,879
Kim dog time what else was made you know

243
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,958
um things like that would really help us

244
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:56,439
pin down um I have my own opinions of

245
00:09:53,958 --> 00:10:00,278
course on what it is after running it

246
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:04,240
for over 15 years and uh running through

247
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:06,039
a lot of the s1s uh sold a ton of them

248
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,240
watched a ton of them grown too by other

249
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:11,480
people I have my own theory on what it

250
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,720
is um and just based on knowing a lot

251
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:17,360
about the D how it reverses and

252
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:20,320
whatnot I think that it was probably the

253
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,759
pure Super Skunk herming on itself one

254
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,800
thing we know about Chim dogd is that it

255
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:27,759
doesn't tend to throw live pollen when

256
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:28,879
it hers it just doesn't like that was a

257
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:30,679
big problem with it a lot of people want

258
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:32,078
to MDS ones over the years so they

259
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:35,559
torture hermit it just wouldn't make

260
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:37,439
seeds it just it's not a it's a sterile

261
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:39,799
pollen thrower for the most part unless

262
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,880
you use like STS or something like that

263
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:45,278
to reverse

264
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:47,200
it so looking at it the way the plants

265
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:51,879
come out it tends to stay true to all

266
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:54,519
the super skunk traits types TPS all of

267
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:57,679
it okay maybe we should just go into the

268
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:59,759
traits then yeah I mean kind of have to

269
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:03,519
um yeah

270
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:05,519
so the traits of gel jel is a long leny

271
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,159
plant a lot like the Diesels a lot like

272
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,639
you would see in OG kushes um it

273
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,319
stretches quite a bit in flour and even

274
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:15,120
as a veg plant it does need some

275
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:18,920
sticking because it's it's very very

276
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,360
lanky very lanky plant um it's not the

277
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:22,639
heaviest resin producer which I think is

278
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,959
another reason a lot of people didn't

279
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:26,440
keep it um it has a very old school look

280
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:27,958
to it and I wish we could show pictures

281
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,399
of it but that's how our videos get

282
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:31,838
flagged and stuff and hidden so

283
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,360
unfortunately we can't show the pictures

284
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,240
but you can go reference any of this in

285
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,440
the Codex under the jel um and and see

286
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,079
some pictures of old original pictures I

287
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,040
think OG Rascal's pictures are up there

288
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:44,239
so shout out to OG Rascal he had some of

289
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:45,679
the best original some of the first

290
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,039
pictures people were putting up online

291
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:49,479
of it that were decent grows um

292
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:51,919
currently there only a couple but I

293
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,278
imagine you have more oh yeah yeah we

294
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:58,679
have more I need to get more up in there

295
00:11:54,278 --> 00:12:01,439
um what else do we got uh it's got very

296
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:03,239
very bubbly bra that's something that a

297
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,839
lot of people notice with it the the big

298
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,278
bubbly bra it almost looks like it's

299
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:10,639
holding monster seeds in it even if it's

300
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:13,958
not um they're very dense bubbly bracks

301
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:16,600
but the bud the bud density how the

302
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:18,719
bracks form isn't super dense it's it's

303
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,240
not Airy but it's right in between it

304
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,320
looks like it'd be super dense but it's

305
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,360
just not as dense as it looks which I

306
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,079
think is another reason people weren't

307
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:29,399
super chasing it you know it's not as

308
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:32,159
dense as 91 not as dense as d

309
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:35,159
um but the main trait the main reason

310
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:38,319
that I kept it was because it has this

311
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:40,159
wonderful buttery skunk and that's

312
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,199
quoting pip because I could never place

313
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,519
it always just said skunky like I always

314
00:12:42,198 --> 00:12:45,719
said it's skunky I don't know how to

315
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,919
explain it you know but pip nailed it

316
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:51,800
down to buttery skunk creamy buttery

317
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:55,278
skunk like Savory skunk and I think that

318
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:57,599
is the most accurate term um you I would

319
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:59,958
say gassy but it's not necessarily gassy

320
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,680
but some of that like like the the non-h

321
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:06,518
harsh tones of gasoline like when at the

322
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:09,759
pump petrol um that smell minus the

323
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:13,240
harsh notes they're kind of too loud is

324
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:16,879
in there but with skunk um true to the

325
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:19,120
term skunk just uh you mentioned the the

326
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:20,958
kind of swollen bra earlier how would

327
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,959
you compare the flower structure in

328
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:26,198
general to like a

329
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:27,759
diesel which also has some of that I I

330
00:13:26,198 --> 00:13:30,240
mean they they both have that super

331
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:31,919
skunk trait of the the bubbly bra like

332
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,919
that's one of those the the traits that

333
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:36,000
runs through and true through all super

334
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:37,799
stuns the other am I am I right in in

335
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,679
thinking that the jesel flowers don't

336
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:42,519
they don't seem to end up being quite as

337
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:43,958
big uh they seem almost but I don't know

338
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:45,919
I've only seen a few pictures yeah no

339
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:49,518
they're they're delicate like when I

340
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:53,439
grow it it's delicate small buds I've

341
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:56,480
seen people blow it up and blow it out

342
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,120
and get large yelds from it but I didn't

343
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,839
like it that way I felt it was always

344
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:04,078
more midy that that way and it liked to

345
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:06,480
be a certain um a certain look like it

346
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:08,278
it liked to be smaller to produce better

347
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,079
resin and the high was almost always

348
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:11,480
better if you didn't push it too hard

349
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:13,439
and when you push this thing too hard

350
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,240
she absolutely will Herm just like the

351
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,560
old Super Skunk um that was one of the

352
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,560
other things like in in my theory with

353
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:24,399
the the chmd versus the super skunk the

354
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:26,119
mass Super Skunk was a notorious Herm

355
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,440
like that was its reputation oh it's a

356
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,799
great plant smells great [ __ ] Herms

357
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:33,040
every everywhere and and loads up aruma

358
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:35,758
seeds like that was its reputation ever

359
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:38,838
since I've been around um so the

360
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:41,240
likelihood that a a chem dog D that

361
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:42,680
throws sterile pollen is in a room with

362
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,639
the mass Super Skunk that's already

363
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:49,239
going to throw live pollen on it like I

364
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:51,480
mean it it one is more likely than the

365
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,399
other and with how it breeds I would

366
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,399
have to say that it's more likely just

367
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:58,399
super skunk but to this day uh you know

368
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,879
Kem dog Greg definitely stands by his

369
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,039
story on that it was the chem D I don't

370
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:06,198
know how he's come to that conclusion

371
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:08,000
but um I I I tend to disagree on that

372
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:10,958
but he was there I wasn't so it's it's a

373
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,559
really hard one to disagree on and have

374
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:15,039
any kind

375
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:16,679
of standing on it it's it's one of those

376
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:19,399
situations and and we've run into this a

377
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:22,000
lot with Kim F and yeah that's with all

378
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:26,000
respect it's just really how it goes

379
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:29,480
what would you say about its effects

380
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,318
potency for you um for me

381
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,680
because like like we always talk about

382
00:15:31,318 --> 00:15:36,120
effects are very subjective like it

383
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:39,559
depends on the person smoking it their

384
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:41,959
brain chemistry um set and setting like

385
00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:43,879
they talk about when you're um dropping

386
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:46,078
acid or mushroom set and setting is just

387
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:49,439
as important with Canabis to me um if

388
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:51,599
you're in a bad mood have a bad bad day

389
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,079
it doesn't always like cannabis will not

390
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,759
always like decrease your anxiety not

391
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,318
every strain not every Grove every

392
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,919
strain will decrease your anxiety some

393
00:15:57,318 --> 00:16:02,479
will amplify it especially for me yeah

394
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:04,240
um yeah jel just doesn't do that I I

395
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,199
talk about how blueberry I can smoke it

396
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,600
it has some anti-anxiety effects jel has

397
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:12,078
the same effect for me it doesn't have

398
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,199
the ass kicking potency of chem dog D

399
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:16,318
that can make you wi out or feel like

400
00:16:14,198 --> 00:16:17,639
you're dumb speaking where like you know

401
00:16:16,318 --> 00:16:18,919
when you're speaking and everything you

402
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:20,879
hear coming out of your mouth sounds

403
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:22,879
stupid nonsensical it doesn't really

404
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:26,039
have that effect for me but it does have

405
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:28,879
a lot of the um the well-being effect

406
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:30,958
you know uh super important reason why

407
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:33,159
you like it yeah yeah yeah it's it's

408
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:36,278
it's the main reason I smoke is for ante

409
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:38,198
anxiety I I get amped up too easy and

410
00:16:36,278 --> 00:16:40,360
when I find something like that that's

411
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:43,000
very special you know and even when when

412
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,278
I was first given the cut by bod um he's

413
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,480
the first person to pass it to me back

414
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:48,519
in the day it was the first person I saw

415
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:52,839
actually growing it and making crosses

416
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:55,039
with it um it it wasn't the skunk part

417
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:56,839
that really made me hold on to it it was

418
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:59,039
the the actual high from it that made me

419
00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:00,279
hold on to it uh during dur that time I

420
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:03,439
don't remember a bunch of people

421
00:17:00,278 --> 00:17:05,798
actually actively chasing skunks skunky

422
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,798
smelling stuff uh when he passed it to

423
00:17:05,798 --> 00:17:10,519
me but you know in a few years that

424
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:12,000
became very important and it always

425
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:14,879
baffled me that people had trouble

426
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,919
finding it I'm like it's right here like

427
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,319
it's been passed around it's still alive

428
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:22,600
it's not hard to find to this day people

429
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:24,199
still don't get that but um I think

430
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:27,159
they're starting to a little bit

431
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:30,279
unfortunately there are a lot of um

432
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:33,080
really bad Faith individuals selling

433
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:35,200
fake clones of it right now on Instagram

434
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:37,038
and wherever else online so a lot of

435
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,160
people's idea of what jel is is very

436
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:41,879
skewed very very skewed um which is why

437
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,200
it's important to talk about the trades

438
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,799
you

439
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,558
know um one of the other main traits in

440
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:50,679
all super skunk that I talk about are

441
00:17:47,558 --> 00:17:54,038
the dog tongue traits and this it's

442
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:55,960
basically a the small I don't know what

443
00:17:54,038 --> 00:17:57,599
you call those leaves sucker leaves a

444
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,840
lot of people call them but they are

445
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:02,319
rounded on the tip they're kind of

446
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:04,839
slightly like bent like this like you'll

447
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:06,639
see it in sour pictures yeah you'll see

448
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:09,918
it in 91 pictures you'll see in all

449
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,679
kinds of different shots and it's not

450
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,600
just that it has those it's the

451
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:17,480
Distribution on the bud in a pattern

452
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:19,519
that specifically leaves the look of

453
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,159
super skunk and that's like one of the

454
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:25,000
quickest identifiers for Super Skunk

455
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:26,840
stuff rarely rarely have ever seen

456
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,599
pictures of another plant that has that

457
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:33,079
trait uh that spefic specific trait I

458
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:37,359
have seen it on um oh I want to say it

459
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:40,158
was like a early girl clone from a High

460
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:42,279
Times magazine but as we know like High

461
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:45,280
Times use stock pictures and would call

462
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:47,240
them certain things so that's being as

463
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:48,960
that's the only one anomalous picture

464
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,000
I've ever seen I tend to think it was

465
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,400
probably a super skunk hybrid just being

466
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,319
pushed in the magazine is that that one

467
00:18:53,400 --> 00:19:00,798
picture but I can't say for sure

468
00:18:57,319 --> 00:19:03,279
obviously um historically Matt maybe now

469
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:05,720
is a good time to talk about what kind

470
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:07,798
of crosses did you think of well what

471
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,400
kind of crosses did you make with it and

472
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:12,079
what else have you seen other people

473
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:14,960
make with it that you feel you know has

474
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:16,960
stood up or has been interesting or so

475
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:20,000
some of the first crosses I saw with it

476
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:22,759
were um bod's um I think it was called

477
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,240
Isaac Hayes and now yo Sami has released

478
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:26,879
a line called Isaac Hayes but um I don't

479
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,679
know which one came first I mean it's

480
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,200
two different continents you know like

481
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,759
it could have been simultaneous for all

482
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:37,519
we know but the Isaac ha release by bod

483
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:38,839
was a jel cross to a seeds bangy Haze I

484
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:40,240
can't remember off the top of my head it

485
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:43,359
was like a meow

486
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:46,798
Thai Haze of some old's Haze maybe bangy

487
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:48,079
Haze was but um that was the first Cross

488
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:51,440
I'd ever seen of it you can see a lot of

489
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:53,079
Super Skunk types in that and everybody

490
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,200
that grew it absolutely loved it and

491
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:57,720
that's kind of what made me ask him for

492
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,400
the Clone in the first place was seeing

493
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:02,519
him make that cross seen pictures of it

494
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,640
it was absolutely gorgeous um when I got

495
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:06,200
a hold of it one of the other things I

496
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,679
was chasing at the time was a clone

497
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:11,880
called super dog um the first time I'd

498
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:13,759
ever seen pictures of jel wasn't the

499
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,480
rasal pictures it was actually in the

500
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:19,558
canab Bible from Jason King and along

501
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:23,038
with the jel there was also Snow Dog in

502
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:25,319
there there was super dog um and super

503
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:28,480
dog was supposedly a chem 91 Mass Super

504
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:30,119
Skunk which sounds very similar to me to

505
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,038
chem dog D so I'd assume it would be

506
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:33,599
something like that so one of my first

507
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:35,960
goals with the jel since it was very

508
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,359
similar was to recreate something like

509
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,120
the super dog because it wasn't

510
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:43,599
available anywhere in my city or anyone

511
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:45,678
I knew had the super dog um Bud would

512
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:48,359
come down of the Maui super dog to San

513
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,400
Diego but that was rarely and it was

514
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:51,959
pretty dank so I was like I I want to

515
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,840
recreate this with this this is what we

516
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,720
have this is the closest it gets so my

517
00:20:53,839 --> 00:21:01,038
first seed line with it I believe was

518
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:04,038
the the the super dog 2010 I think it

519
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:05,919
was called maybe that was my first real

520
00:21:04,038 --> 00:21:08,480
release with it and I was really stoked

521
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,759
with it it was in Skunk magazine um

522
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:15,919
another one that I did was the

523
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:18,240
uh jel cross to shite oh no it was jel

524
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:22,559
West Coast dog which is not related to

525
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:25,720
chem dog it was a scam cut line from

526
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:27,038
Paradise seeds mod uh tk1 he's had a

527
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,720
million names guy's probably still

528
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:32,679
around um

529
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,159
and that that's like a Bubba type but a

530
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:35,919
little bit different but it's a really

531
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,960
nice plant and that it was the West

532
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,799
Coast dog cross to the sug Knight OG

533
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:42,679
gbx1 I know again the sug Knight's been

534
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:44,319
really popular to talk about on

535
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:47,278
Instagram the other day I saw someone

536
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:50,678
telling a story that the sug Knight was

537
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:53,119
some clone that the rapper went to Nepal

538
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:55,640
to go get to bring back and it became OG

539
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:58,359
which is totally wrong sug Knight was a

540
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:00,759
forum member um he was making like nor

541
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:03,839
lights leopard Kush things like this and

542
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:07,240
uh the sug Knight Kush was a Bubba the

543
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:10,079
sug Knight OG was probably the OG Bubba

544
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,558
OG type back Cross of some sort if if he

545
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:14,480
even went that far with it I'm not sure

546
00:22:11,558 --> 00:22:17,119
I didn't know Suge to know um how much

547
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,440
work he was actually doing or not doing

548
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:21,558
you

549
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:24,038
know so yeah that's I'm trying to think

550
00:22:21,558 --> 00:22:26,000
of what else I've made with it um of

551
00:22:24,038 --> 00:22:28,519
course have the blooper skunk the jel

552
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,400
cross to the blue bonnet Which is my by

553
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:37,879
far my favorite J cologne up until

554
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:39,880
current time and it's very very skunky

555
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,960
they they merge really well together

556
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,400
it's very true to keeping that beautiful

557
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:47,480
beautiful jel super skunk look but with

558
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,320
a lot more resin too um yeah that's

559
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,759
probably one of my favorite lines to

560
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:54,158
smoke with the gel in it trying to think

561
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:55,879
of what else I made with jel I I I tried

562
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,679
to whap it with everything every year

563
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,000
that I had it but um I think your the

564
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:02,798
other one I can think of is the triangle

565
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,558
choke right yes thank you the triangle

566
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,879
choke so that was during one of our jel

567
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:09,240
reversal uh jel reversals back in the

568
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,720
day we did oh yeah and there was also um

569
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,919
sour dub jel that my buddy Racer X made

570
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,480
and released with us that's one of my

571
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:19,440
favorites of all time too the skunk

572
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:22,278
spray cam just it has to do with the

573
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,919
theory that super skunk that skunk smell

574
00:23:22,278 --> 00:23:26,919
is a double recessive so when you cross

575
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:28,799
two double recessives which would be two

576
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:31,480
super skunk types displaying that types

577
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:34,319
so like a sour to a gel it will almost

578
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:37,960
always just constantly throw that smell

579
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:40,399
and and skunkin and gas and it it locks

580
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,720
that in and it's it's it's one of my

581
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,440
favorite crosses for doing that um I

582
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,200
mean I can see why right it's if you've

583
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,919
got your blue locked in and you've got

584
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,480
the jel you know super skunk locked in

585
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:53,559
yeah it's nice and we had the triangle

586
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,759
choke jeel that was something I released

587
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:58,240
with chem dog Greg as a collab but

588
00:23:55,759 --> 00:24:01,200
didn't sell nobody bought it I don't

589
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,880
know why triangle Kush was kind of

590
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:07,319
popular at the time but not as well

591
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:09,200
known maybe so like trying to trying to

592
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:11,278
hit a hike that wasn't there at the time

593
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,400
didn't really work so I popped them

594
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:15,240
myself and I found a keeper and that's

595
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,080
what we hit with the blue bonnet and I

596
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:20,079
was already doing some Sour Diesel Blue

597
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:22,000
Bonnet gel Blue Bonnet um there were all

598
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:24,480
sorts of different super skunks in there

599
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,759
uh motor breath 15 Blue Bonnet the K

600
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,240
sister S1 Blue Bonnet so I wanted to

601
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:30,000
throw in another one just to kind of see

602
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,880
how that distribution worked Crossing it

603
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:36,200
to Super Skunk and that's probably like

604
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,720
one of the most beautiful Frosty crazy

605
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,319
potent lines that came out of the blue

606
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,880
Bonet crosses and I think everybody

607
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:43,000
pretty much universally likes it and

608
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,760
finds something that they find to be a

609
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,480
keeper somewhere in that

610
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:50,278
line we have a bunch of pictures popular

611
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,120
recently yeah on our Discord there's

612
00:24:50,278 --> 00:24:54,759
tons of pictures of it scrutin and and

613
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:57,359
Blu gr got beautiful pictures of it one

614
00:24:54,759 --> 00:25:00,038
of my favorite looking cuts of it yeah

615
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:03,599
char as well yeah yeah

616
00:25:00,038 --> 00:25:05,519
yep where are we at let's see um you did

617
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:06,918
mention s1's but I was kind of curious

618
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:10,679
what else you might have seen when you

619
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:13,960
did that where with in the s1's yeah in

620
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:16,519
the s1s so in the s1's there is there is

621
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,120
some heavy variation um I didn't think

622
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:21,000
there would be as much variation as

623
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:25,158
there was because if it is an S2 I would

624
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:27,079
expect it to breed more true to type but

625
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:28,600
in saying that there was like mango

626
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:30,319
versions of it popping out sweet

627
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:32,038
versions popping out it tended to keep

628
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:34,278
the same structure and look for the most

629
00:25:32,038 --> 00:25:36,759
part but some of them did have more of a

630
00:25:34,278 --> 00:25:39,480
a more conical skunk one type bud

631
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:42,200
structure um so it definitely showed

632
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:44,599
more of this recessive skunk one in the

633
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:48,558
S2s while

634
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:51,319
also or I'm sorry the s1s if it's a mass

635
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:53,759
Super Skunk S2 it's still showing the

636
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:58,119
variation of the super skunk or of the

637
00:25:53,759 --> 00:26:00,398
skunk one inside of it um yeah I mean it

638
00:25:58,119 --> 00:26:02,359
it stuck mostly to the the Savory skunk

639
00:26:00,398 --> 00:26:05,199
The Buttery skunk and there was also

640
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:07,359
some mango types um but that's mostly

641
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,399
the the range it stuck around uh and in

642
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:12,278
Skunk one hybrids I tend to see a lot of

643
00:26:09,398 --> 00:26:14,038
that sweet uh generic you say mango it's

644
00:26:12,278 --> 00:26:16,159
not really mango mango but it's like a

645
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:18,480
sweet fruit tropical yeah it's it's a

646
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:21,720
generic sweet fruit

647
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:24,319
tropical yep yep no that's

648
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,440
cool um you did talk already about what

649
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:28,119
you what you thought it it is obviously

650
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,759
so I don't know if we

651
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:34,519
I mean yeah I I I still think it's a

652
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:36,000
super skunk um S2 I really do despite

653
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:37,798
everything that was said about it in

654
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,240
history it

655
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:42,079
just you know I could be wrong I could

656
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,240
be wrong but um and there's always going

657
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:46,960
to be some doubt there because I wasn't

658
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,640
there you know but I do think it is pure

659
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,558
super

660
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,480
scum well it's probably not a bad time

661
00:26:51,558 --> 00:26:58,480
to actually just go into the into the

662
00:26:53,480 --> 00:27:01,240
drop ah so yeah yeah so

663
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:05,159
uh CSI humble first got the jel cut in

664
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:06,960
2006 and ran it um we'd spoken about it

665
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:08,679
over the years he dropped it after and

666
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,000
and he was like yeah I don't know man I

667
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:11,679
I remember running it I don't remember

668
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,919
much about it probably you know I'm not

669
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,200
that interested in it he doesn't really

670
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:17,240
like diesels in the first place so it

671
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,600
was a hard sell to get the homie to run

672
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:23,319
jesel I was like dude you like skunky

673
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:26,639
stuff stop stop playing got to grow it

674
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:28,439
and eventually he did and that was a few

675
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,320
years ago and he hit me up like dude

676
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,960
just jel tell me more about it you know

677
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:34,918
and that's that that felt really good

678
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,200
because I like when when I I tell

679
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:39,720
someone something that I think is really

680
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,360
special and someone as experienced as

681
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,399
him agrees I mean he sees more stuff

682
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:46,439
than probably anyone else I know like

683
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:49,038
more different variations of everything

684
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:51,360
by doing massive seed pops making tons

685
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:53,720
of hybrids and he interested him enough

686
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:56,119
to to work with it and we decided we're

687
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:58,120
going to do a collab on it and he wanted

688
00:27:56,119 --> 00:28:00,479
to make some more S1 since I was all out

689
00:27:58,119 --> 00:28:03,239
of them and I don't know of any with

690
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,200
great provenant out there that exist

691
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,519
other than the ones that I did so it was

692
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,360
time to bang some out and we decided to

693
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,200
make some hybrids as well so we spent

694
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:15,558
some months talking about what would be

695
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:17,840
good pairings for the gel crosses and uh

696
00:28:15,558 --> 00:28:21,240
yeah I think uh should I go through the

697
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:22,918
list of what was hit or what's available

698
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,798
probably what's available probably

699
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:26,960
what's available I mean we can go into

700
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:29,278
what was hit just to generate more hype

701
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:33,759
later but yeah it's true with what's

702
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:35,519
available okay so we had the bubus and I

703
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:37,319
think the reasoning behind that was one

704
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:38,919
of csi's favorite plants was a sour

705
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:41,558
Bubba one of my favorite plants was a

706
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:44,080
sour Bubba um and this is going to be

707
00:28:41,558 --> 00:28:45,319
very close but I like jel more than sour

708
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:47,278
so I thought that this would be a good

709
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:50,439
direction for it so we wanted to do the

710
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:52,798
chmd gel just to have an idea um on my

711
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:55,080
theory if KD's in this plant it'll

712
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:59,480
either look like a chmd a feminized chmd

713
00:28:55,079 --> 00:29:02,439
BX or it'll look like the first CHD

714
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:04,240
superum um and will we be I mean will we

715
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,840
be able to tell just by running a large

716
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,000
population I don't know but it was

717
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:10,079
something that we both liked the idea of

718
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,960
and wanted to see is it possible can we

719
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:14,119
tell is there any way to define this so

720
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,399
that's why that was thrown in there um

721
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:17,959
dog [ __ ] is one of the dog [ __ ] electric

722
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:20,558
bugaloo I should say it original name

723
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:22,200
was electric bugaloo but for all intents

724
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:23,960
and purposes we're calling it dog [ __ ]

725
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,558
because that's how it's colloquial mod

726
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:28,038
you know everybody knows it it's dog

727
00:29:25,558 --> 00:29:30,278
[ __ ] so that's what we're going with um

728
00:29:28,038 --> 00:29:32,440
dog shit's one of the most famous clones

729
00:29:30,278 --> 00:29:35,558
that pretty much everyone universally

730
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:38,278
loves uh when they try it so that had to

731
00:29:35,558 --> 00:29:41,720
be in the room it's a you know some sort

732
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:43,759
of probably nl5 Haze type maybe not

733
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:48,120
skunk Haze I I don't really know enough

734
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:50,000
about it but um like it's history or

735
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:52,518
it's it's a hard plant to nail down as

736
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,960
far as turps on what it could be but it

737
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:57,440
seemed like a good pairing for the gel

738
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,079
um what else do we have in there we have

739
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,720
before you go on like what do you have

740
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:03,278
any sense of what to expect from that

741
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,679
one or no it seems like a wild card

742
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:05,919
right a little bit that's a wild card

743
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:07,640
that's something that's more of a

744
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,080
question for CSI I don't have as much

745
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,399
experience with dog [ __ ] I've only done

746
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:13,278
one cross with

747
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:14,759
it it didn't I haven't run it a bunch

748
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:17,759
it's more of an older clone that took a

749
00:30:14,759 --> 00:30:19,000
long time to get to me and maybe sorry

750
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:21,038
while we're on this note what do you

751
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,599
hope for from the Bubba jel you kind of

752
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:28,720
mentioned the uh what was the comparison

753
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:31,278
you had s sour Bubba yeah okay I mean

754
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,519
Bubba Bubba in itself is already like

755
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:35,599
when you grow it certain ways and nail

756
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:37,759
it it's you can see expressions of OG

757
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:39,599
cush in it you can see some of the Bubba

758
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:41,960
Expressions there's all kinds of stuff

759
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:44,439
in in Bubba when it's nailed it can be

760
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:47,240
super turpy and because jel is also

761
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:49,120
super super trippy itself it's just the

762
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:53,640
sour Bubbas that we've smoked before are

763
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:55,719
just Stellar absolutely Stellar High TS

764
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,720
and because I like jel more than sour

765
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:01,120
and I think it's more turpy and less L

766
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:03,319
noxious offensive I think it'll it'll be

767
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:04,959
pretty insane it'll be absolutely insane

768
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:06,519
so that's that's one of the Reas do with

769
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,360
that it's it's also the same reason we

770
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:11,599
went with Iran

771
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:14,519
Kush large large turp percents coming

772
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:18,038
out of it very turpy uh seems to merge

773
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:21,599
well with other plants and gel in the

774
00:31:18,038 --> 00:31:24,000
s1s you can find OG Kush smelling is

775
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:26,079
plants not not identical but in that

776
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,679
direction so we wanted to see if we can

777
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:30,398
push Irene more in that direction of

778
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:33,399
find a more turpy skunky version of OG

779
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:35,719
Kush by doing it um in my mind that's

780
00:31:33,398 --> 00:31:37,599
why I wanted to do it so I can only

781
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:41,919
speak for myself on that and it made it

782
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:43,918
through stoked um the pineapple gel I do

783
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,720
not know anything about pineapple that's

784
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:49,038
a humble NorCal type thing that's

785
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:52,319
something that inspector wanted to use

786
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:54,839
CSI um it's a large yielding outdoor

787
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:56,599
plant that smells pineapple I do have no

788
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:59,158
clue how that's going to combine we're

789
00:31:56,599 --> 00:32:01,558
about to find out you know like I love

790
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:04,240
pineapple tur like the c99 pineapple was

791
00:32:01,558 --> 00:32:05,918
like a tpine pineapple type thing um I

792
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,558
don't know if this is I don't think it's

793
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,600
a tendine pineapple I think it's just

794
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:12,038
pineapple uh I'm not sure if it's the

795
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:15,599
pineapple tie from Shaw if it's the same

796
00:32:12,038 --> 00:32:17,200
cut or not it maybe may not be um I do

797
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:20,359
need to find out more about that one but

798
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,519
it is available and uh we of course did

799
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:24,319
the sour

800
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:27,120
jel the super skunk recessive double up

801
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:29,720
that I talked about earlier easy easy

802
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:31,558
money right there just bam easy you know

803
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:34,120
it's going to come out dank as hell

804
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:36,678
almost every time you mix uh two super

805
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:38,359
skunk types it happens and we wanted

806
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:40,399
something readily available for people

807
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:42,759
to find Keepers in in very small amounts

808
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:44,000
of seed pops we don't have room if

809
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:46,960
someone wants Super Skunk that's going

810
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,880
to be their ticket you know Sour Diesel

811
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,240
s1s have been very hard to make very

812
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,039
hard to come across this is really close

813
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:56,759
to what you would expect

814
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:58,519
that and um oh good can I ask you one

815
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:00,200
thing uh even though it's not on the

816
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:04,798
list and I don't I don't know if it was

817
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:07,080
even I did he did you guys not do an URL

818
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:09,558
I don't think kco was ready at the

819
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:11,199
time for the room and only reason it

820
00:33:09,558 --> 00:33:13,480
wasn't in there a lot of that had to do

821
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,159
with what do we have available what's

822
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,960
you know what's in Cuts what's rooted

823
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:18,519
what do we want to throw in and of

824
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,159
course it was his first time reversing

825
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:22,599
jel so like he wasn't sure if it was

826
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:24,720
going to always it was going to be a

827
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:26,240
successful reversal too so now that we

828
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,440
know that you know he's capable of

829
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,399
reversing it in it really easy like I

830
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,080
did it it's probably going to be the

831
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:34,199
next round or a future round but yeah

832
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:37,918
that's kind of one that needs to happen

833
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:39,960
um R makes beautiful hybrids yeah I mean

834
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:41,480
I do see that he I mean I again I don't

835
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,240
know if this one is one of the actual

836
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:46,360
ones that's released yet but there's a

837
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:47,599
T1000 which I oh yeah that's you know I

838
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:49,079
I remember talking about it now that you

839
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:50,719
bring that up and that was going to be

840
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:53,798
our closest to heral because it was

841
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,759
disgust and we're like H 2000s in there

842
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:59,038
might as well you know run with that see

843
00:33:55,759 --> 00:34:01,440
how it does makes sense and I think the

844
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:03,720
the last one on the list is the 5150

845
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:06,519
which is his select cut of the triangle

846
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:09,398
kushes ones big yelder super potent

847
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:10,358
super chirpy and again along the ideas

848
00:34:09,398 --> 00:34:13,039
of the

849
00:34:10,358 --> 00:34:15,679
Irene we wanted a large but this is more

850
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:18,679
like a larger yielding commercial jeel

851
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:21,358
that anybody who loves OG Kush loves

852
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:24,079
triangle will love this plant so that

853
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:27,000
was our idea behind that one and uh yeah

854
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:29,119
we just dropped these Christmas I think

855
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,159
it was we decided to drop them and

856
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:33,720
tonight I'm going to be packing and

857
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:35,000
doing all kinds of shipping so yeah so

858
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:37,158
to make it really clear they're

859
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,719
available on your on your website too

860
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:41,398
yes they're available on Riot seats.com

861
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:44,759
they're also available on CSI or Humbolt

862
00:34:41,398 --> 00:34:46,878
csi.com so either place is great to grab

863
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,200
them from check it out um all the

864
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:50,759
freebies that are going to be with it

865
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:53,039
are the sour diesel jel or you can buy

866
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,919
it as well those are available to buy

867
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:58,559
but I'm be sending out Sour Diesel jel

868
00:34:54,918 --> 00:35:00,400
with these first orders

869
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:06,039
very nice

870
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:09,519
yeah um so for outdoor people I would

871
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:12,000
probably recommend um the pineapple jel

872
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:14,199
because it's a proven outdoor plant the

873
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,400
dog [ __ ] jel another proven outdoor

874
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:19,319
plant Irene does pretty well Outdoors as

875
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,559
long as it's not too humid um Bubba

876
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:23,640
don't have

877
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:25,639
humid Outdoors again camd does really

878
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:27,199
well Outdoors too so all of those are

879
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:29,159
going to be good Outdoors Jesus does

880
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:31,519
well Outdoors too jel does Great

881
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:34,199
Outdoors it's not too dense it doesn't

882
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:35,719
mold too readily it's fast flowering I

883
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:37,199
mean we're talking eight weeks flowering

884
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:39,799
time we're not pushing it any longer

885
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:42,118
than that um she will Herm if if you

886
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,839
push her longer than that so it's like

887
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:45,640
it's the the gift that keeps on giving

888
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:48,838
from the mass Super Skunk is the uh

889
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:52,318
interex traits but when you get to this

890
00:35:48,838 --> 00:35:53,880
point in growing like you learn to watch

891
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:55,960
your plants take care of and they're

892
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,680
easily remedied you know what I mean so

893
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:01,280
it's it's not not anything I take into

894
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:03,399
consideration and she does breed more um

895
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,560
consistently non-inner sex than the

896
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:08,160
actual plant is when you push her

897
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:10,119
heart um I did want to Pro you about one

898
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:12,559
more of the crosses that Caleb mentioned

899
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:13,440
but again probably not in the release uh

900
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:15,920
the

901
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,679
cookies times jel what what do you think

902
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,680
is gonna come out of

903
00:36:20,358 --> 00:36:25,920
that um I mean it'd probably be along

904
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,760
the urle type and OG type you know you

905
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:31,079
probably see a little SE

906
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:34,560
po yeah but yeah there's also the like

907
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:37,480
the F1 der was in there or no no FL it

908
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:40,799
was the flow R OG in there there we had

909
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:45,199
the the the la Kush in there we had the

910
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:47,119
56 day headband in there Maui wow his

911
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:50,318
pure OG which is the first cut of OG

912
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:52,519
Kush that he ever got um from Elk Slayer

913
00:36:50,318 --> 00:36:54,400
so like we actually have like the old

914
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:56,239
one of his older OG Cuts in there we

915
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,200
have the snow different kind of hash

916
00:36:56,239 --> 00:37:01,479
plants sweet kind of hash plant across

917
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:04,439
it too uh chem 1's also in there which

918
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:06,280
is more of an nl5 Haze type of chem so

919
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:08,159
yeah there those definitely coming too

920
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:09,680
right yeah they'll eventually be some of

921
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:11,078
them we didn't get a ton of seeds from

922
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:13,358
so they may not be released and we're

923
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:15,560
just going to run them to look and see

924
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:17,318
um yeah but some yeah eventually will be

925
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:18,119
released like the bubblegum gel stuff

926
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:22,400
like

927
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:22,400
that cool very

928
00:37:23,838 --> 00:37:29,039
nice uh I mean we've cover most of I

929
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:31,199
think of the information that we wanted

930
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:34,318
to cover uh was anything you wanted to

931
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:37,879
say about the Codex do we want to add

932
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:39,880
more stuff to it yes so I really wanted

933
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,160
to get to it over Christmas but like

934
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,640
some people know I've been dealing with

935
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:44,799
like some health stuff and I've been

936
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:46,159
figuring it out kind of what it is and

937
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,560
it kept hitting a little bit during

938
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:50,838
Christmas so I didn't get to do as much

939
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:53,119
as I wanted to with adding to the codec

940
00:37:50,838 --> 00:37:55,078
but it's going to be a Non-Stop project

941
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,160
um if you want to hear some more in

942
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:58,560
detail about what what we're talking

943
00:37:57,159 --> 00:38:00,799
about with like the different versions

944
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:03,039
of the chem stories what we think versus

945
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,920
what's been established the Codex is a

946
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:06,440
great place to go codex. the Breeders

947
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:10,280
syndicate.com

948
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:12,920
um our our goal is this to be the best

949
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:15,200
resource for historical clowns and

950
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:17,159
historical lines so you can go look at

951
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:20,118
it and it's not going to

952
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:22,480
be just my take on it it's going to be

953
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:24,280
several different takes on each thing we

954
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,639
Market as speculative it's if it's

955
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:28,920
speculative we mark it if it's for sure

956
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:31,078
and there's no argument about what it is

957
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:33,119
that's there you know like we tried to

958
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:35,160
think of all the variables that we could

959
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,400
to cover all the bases so people

960
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:39,960
understand the information that they're

961
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:42,920
reading and how reliable it is isn't or

962
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:44,720
could possibly be and um yeah I mean

963
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:47,599
between between both of us we've put a

964
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:49,199
lot of time and energy into it and I I

965
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:50,400
I'm really stoked about it I think it's

966
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:52,480
gonna be one of the most important

967
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:55,079
things that we do as The Syndicate

968
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:58,599
together I really do and I hope everyone

969
00:38:55,079 --> 00:39:00,599
else don't I will say that uh this

970
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:02,200
episode is also I think the first

971
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:05,480
episode for the new year so happy New

972
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:08,078
Year everyone happy New Year and also I

973
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:10,400
was kind of doing like a recap of 2023

974
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:11,960
with my girlfriend last night and uh it

975
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:16,440
actually kind of blows my mind that the

976
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:19,000
Codex was just earlier last year um

977
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:20,559
yeah yeah last year went really quickly

978
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,960
and that was one of the big things that

979
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:25,599
happened last year um look how much the

980
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,599
the the show has changed and grown just

981
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:30,318
the last year just the last year and

982
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:33,480
just the last year I took it back

983
00:39:30,318 --> 00:39:35,279
started producing it myself you know

984
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:38,358
like all that happened within a year

985
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:40,800
like it it just it went crazy in a year

986
00:39:38,358 --> 00:39:44,279
and and where it's at versus where it's

987
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:46,240
at Now versus where it's at before I

988
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:51,599
really really am proud of how far it's

989
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:53,959
come and yeah it's it's a big

990
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:57,000
relief I think we've doubled the number

991
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:59,440
of subscribers in the last six months

992
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I am pissed that my gamble of hitting

993
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:05,079
10,000 didn't happen but but it's still

994
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,079
the first week of January so we're not

995

to have them on and to be able to

1057
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:33,679
discuss something that was so secret and

1058
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:35,880
private for so long out in the open is

1059

forward to that so go check it out go

1062
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:46,239
there lots of old data pictures um

1063
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:48,599
strain

1064
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:50,879
info the the what was it the

1065
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:52,640
free-for-all FFA is on there which is an

1066
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,440
old Mass Super skun Cross it was really

1067
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:56,440
dank um that most people don't know

1068
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,559
about pictures of that are on there too

1069
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,760
and it was called freefor all because

1070
00:42:57,559 --> 00:43:01,280
everybody would pass it around it was

1071
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:02,800
freefor all but then it got locked so

1072
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:06,920
there is

1073
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:08,839
that I just wanted to add as well that

1074
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:11,318
it might seem odd

1075
00:43:08,838 --> 00:43:15,119
to uh I don't know talk about forums in

1076
00:43:11,318 --> 00:43:18,639
2023 but at the same time they are so

1077
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:20,920
Superior when it comes to information

1078
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:24,239
than you know over social media there's

1079
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:25,480
just no there's no comparison also the

1080
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:28,000
ways in which people can actually

1081
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:30,838
discuss things you just don't get in

1082
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,559
like an Instagram post or yeah so you

1083
00:43:30,838 --> 00:43:34,440
know I mean we have our Discord that we

1084
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:37,559
talk about our patreon Discord where we

1085
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:39,159
do stuff like that but the one thing I

1086
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:41,119
want to say is a lot of people that

1087
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:43,440
weren't around for the Forum era and

1088
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,400
weren't a part of the Forum culture this

1089
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,559
is your way to understand that kind of

1090
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:49,480
culture that we talk about a lot like

1091
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:53,119
how we interact with each other how we

1092
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:55,920
build relationships and share clones as

1093
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:58,119
opposed to like always trading or you

1094
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,079
know selling clones I mean a lot of you

1095
00:43:58,119 --> 00:44:01,760
guys hear me I don't like selling clones

1096
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,359
I don't like I don't like when people

1097
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,920
have to go buy them because I know how

1098
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:09,119
many people are out there scamming right

1099
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:12,800
now versus even five years ago um a lot

1100
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:15,838
of that stuff was given in past as Merit

1101
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:17,880
to show I trust you you're my friend you

1102
00:44:15,838 --> 00:44:19,960
trust me this is how we're going to show

1103
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:21,559
our trust and that kind of culture is

1104
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,679
still alive there and if you want to

1105
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:25,559
want to learn about it you want to

1106
00:44:22,679 --> 00:44:26,679
experience it um it's very alive there

1107
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:29,640
and I can't

1108
00:44:26,679 --> 00:44:31,399
I can't give a stronger wreck to a place

1109
00:44:29,639 --> 00:44:33,679
than the

1110
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,800
can and with that I mean do do you have

1111
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:38,318
anything

1112
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:42,160
else no that was that was it for me damn

1113
00:44:38,318 --> 00:44:43,599
smashed it out right um so with that we

1114
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:46,838
have our breeder Syndicate patreon that

1115
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:49,160
I just mentioned go to patreon.com

1116
00:44:46,838 --> 00:44:51,078
breeders Syndicate it's $5 a month and

1117
00:44:49,159 --> 00:44:53,519
basically that keeps most of the trolls

1118
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:56,960
out if they make it in we still boot

1119
00:44:53,519 --> 00:45:00,079
them um we're being more aggressive

1120
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:03,639
about uh making sure that it's a fun

1121
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:05,119
environment and not and not depressing

1122
00:45:03,639 --> 00:45:07,759
because you know sometimes some people

1123
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:10,720
can can take it there and we're we're

1124
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:13,040
trying to to keep that that Vibe really

1125
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:14,838
really really good and a part of that is

1126
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:17,159
by keeping out trolls a lot of people
