00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,878
verie valley of Arizona which is about

59

there are Jerome Cottonwood Camp birdie

61
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:36,159
in Sedona and I lived in Cottonwood but

62
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,639
I got to know a lot of people in Jerome

63
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:42,400
because it was the hippie capital of

64
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:45,238
Arizona from 19 late 60s to present more

65
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,239
or less although it's got gotten a lot

66
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:53,039

68
00:02:53,039 --> 00:03:00,639

69
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:03,359
this store and met this lady she had her

70
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:07,598

71
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,959

73
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,920
know each other a little bit but many

74
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,080
many years went beyond that because

75
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:22,079
shortly thereafter I got married had two

76
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:26,040
kids whole world changed and um but she

77
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,799
kept her store going for over 30 years

78
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:32,039
and

79
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:34,920

80
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:38,679
tragic events in our Lives four years

81
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:41,000
ago roughly four and a half and I was

82
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,360
going through all this stuff in my shed

83
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,158
and I found this huge drawing it was

84
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,280
about two and a half feet wide by four

85
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:52,000
feet tall all pencil drawing of a early

86
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:56,280
girlfriend I had in Jerome named Linda

87
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:00,079
[Â __Â ] she'd be happy to be famous so

88
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:02,039
there's her next one minute of fame um

89
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:04,400
and it's a photo of her from this a

90
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:06,679
drawing of her from the side nursing her

91
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,840
daughter um

92
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:12,159
and I I've been carrying it around for

93
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,438
years and years I got it from another

94
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:16,639
friend who had died and I inherited it

95
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:20,159
so I said I'm going to take this back to

96
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:22,759
D to this lady and um I called her up on

97
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,800
the phone and said hey you know is it

98
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:27,120
all right if I stop by I have a surprise

99
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,000
so I stopped by gave it to her and she

100
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,280
was so happy because she didn't have it

101
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,360
was from 19 19 73 72 when she drew it

102
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:37,439
she had no artwork of that magnitude

103
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:40,840
from back then so it was a she was very

104
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:44,600
happy to get it back and we talked for

105
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:45,918
three hours hadn't seen her in roughly

106
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,199
35

107
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:50,599
years

108
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:53,478
so we

109
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,840
exchanged histories and talked about all

110
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:58,839
the people she's been in Jerome since

111
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:02,198
1973 she's still there she's never lived

112
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:05,198
anywhere else she is the she knows every

113
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:06,840
human's history there all the people

114
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,360
that I knew and some of them that aren't

115
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:14,359
around anymore um one famous guy who was

116
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:17,400
a grower in one of the Canyons not far

117
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,960
from magad Canyon that's funny he was

118
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:22,000
walking home from the spirit room or

119
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:23,879
Paul and Jerry's the two bars and he had

120
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,199
a six-pack and he tripped and fell on it

121
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:30,000
and it pierced his his liver and he died

122
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:32,199
on the street Jesus

123
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,918
so she filled me in all these details

124
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:38,919
and I was like Wow and and I said well

125
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:40,799
do you smoke still and she said well I

126
00:05:38,918 --> 00:05:43,680
didn't for many years but I started a

127
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,240
couple years ago went cool and she was

128
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:50,439
growing on a rooftop in in some

129
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:53,240
containers but she was still paranoid

130
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:56,240
even though it was legal in Arizona now

131
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,199
but she so she she said it's just an old

132
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,879
habit because she got busted in college

133
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:03,120
and and swore that she would never ever

134
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:06,159
get busted again yeah and I well you

135
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,240
don't have to worry anymore yeah and she

136
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:12,759
told me that when she closed her store

137
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:16,199
about three years ago she moved her

138
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:18,280
giant safe to her home and she was going

139
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:20,720
through it and she found this

140
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:23,719
baggie the old style baggie that you had

141
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,440
to lick to roll it in

142
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,639
clothes way before zip locks or press

143
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:33,560
locks and yeah said there was a bunch of

144
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:37,160
seeds in it and she she remembered her

145
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:40,439
friend um who this lady friend of hers

146
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:43,319
who was kind of a low-level dealer you

147
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:45,959
know when a some good herb would come

148
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:47,680
into Jerome she would get you know like

149
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:51,198
five ounces or something like that for

150
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:54,680
her friends and such yeah and it was

151
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:57,680
1984 roughly and that's when

152
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,800
CIA everything suddenly became CIA there

153
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,240
was no more no more seeded weed coming

154
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:05,400
from Mexico cuz they suddenly realized

155
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,879
where the money was yeah like 10 20

156
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:10,679
times more expensive than than brick

157
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:13,319
weed yeah absolutely I think and she

158
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,759
believes she remembers that they would

159
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:17,598
take Whenever there was some Cincy that

160
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,560
came through there'd always be a few

161
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:23,279
seeds that someone would find and they

162
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,399
they'd keep them treasure them and

163
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:28,000
judging by the look of the seeds when I

164
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:30,598
looked at them I would say there is

165
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,639
three varieties here so probably three

166
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:35,878
different loads that hit town and found

167
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:38,560
five seeds in this load and 15 in that

168
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:41,560
load and not in loads but like in what

169
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:45,038
they got maybe just ounces so they kept

170
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:46,360
them and they went into this baggie some

171
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:49,240
of the seeds

172
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:52,598
were you know typical like we see today

173
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,879
marbled with nice design there was these

174
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:56,878
really tiny seeds that were the size of

175
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:00,280
sesame seeds and they were perfectly

176
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,360
dark black yeah round round

177
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:04,918
and I'm like wow I haven't seen many

178
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:08,720
seeds like that before and then there

179
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:11,158
was some immature seeds kind of tan or

180
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,599
couple that were white too yeah I don't

181
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:20,959
think they knew better to doubt

182
00:08:14,598 --> 00:08:23,079
it you know seeds 83 so they uh she

183
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:25,079
found this baggy and she went wow I

184
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:28,198
wonder if any of these would grow so she

185
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:30,158
took five of the marbled seeds planted

186
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:32,959
them and

187
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:35,838
to her surprise they came up and they

188
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:37,918
grew up on her rooftop and then when she

189
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,479
went up to check and she knew about how

190
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:43,000
to you know sex males and females she

191
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,519
saw m was a male and she pulled it I

192
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,480
hadn't met her at this point because it

193
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:50,039
was

194
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:52,879
2022 and um when I met her it was late

195
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:55,240
2022 and we got together and she pulled

196
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:58,000
out this herb for me I still have two

197
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:01,480
ounces of it in the fridge oh wow she

198
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,480
was a little too early she took it too

199
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:07,159
early it still had nice you know

200
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:09,159
crystals and and but it wasn't I said

201
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:12,078
what were the percent of the you know

202
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:14,799
pistols were that turn red or brownish

203
00:09:12,078 --> 00:09:19,000
and she said about 50% oh okay yeah she

204
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:22,278
took it real early yeah and anyway

205
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
that's how that started and she said um

206
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:27,559
are you a grower still and I said oh

207
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,600
yeah but it's been in my backyard mostly

208
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:33,078
in recent times or in New Mexico this

209
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:35,000
other place and she said oh well I have

210
00:09:33,078 --> 00:09:36,759
some seeds and she pulled them out we

211
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,679
looked at them and she said you can have

212
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:42,519
the rest of these and I got about 30

213
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:45,359
seeds from her um as you know five I

214
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:47,120
sent 10 I sent to you five for you and

215
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,278
five for your friend who is the germ

216
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:53,360
cell germ specialist

217
00:09:50,278 --> 00:09:57,919
and I didn't plant that year but last

218
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,879
year I did and I decided since the wet

219
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:01,519
paper towel method didn't work

220
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:03,879
and whatever the gym specialist was

221
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,600
doing didn't work I thought I have

222
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:10,000
nothing to lose so I didn't keep track

223
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,639
carefully of the ratio of which were the

224
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
little tiny black ones and which were

225
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:18,639
the model ones but I planted them both

226
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:23,480
and six seeds came up the first seed it

227
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:26,078
took nine days in March W in Arizona

228
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:29,079
when it was in the 80s in the day yeah

229
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:30,078
to nine days just to poke up and the

230
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:32,639
other

231
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:35,479
five it took two or three more days up

232
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:38,039
to 11 days which I had given up

233
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,920
basically at about a week I went you

234
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:43,399
know I don't know but I I kept waiting

235
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:47,599
watered them yeah and I ended up with

236
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:50,958
six that's crazy two females and four

237
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:54,278
males the one that came up first must

238
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:57,638
have been one of those separate loads

239
00:10:54,278 --> 00:11:00,240
because it has super it was really

240
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:03,399
strong and grew nice and it turned out

241
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:06,480
to be a female well it was a female oh

242
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:08,639
let's let's segue here farmer Freeman is

243
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,720
this company in Washington DC that yeah

244
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:14,200
that's right yeah I sent one of a little

245
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:18,600
clipping off a leaf today and I I bought

246
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:21,240
10 more um tests for this season and

247
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,759
they sent back that I had two females

248
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,360
and four males so the one with the most

249
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:28,240
Vigor and that was growing the fastest

250
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,560
and came up first was a female oh that's

251
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,039
interesting that's a mail and all right

252
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:36,958
I had them in one

253
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:38,120
gon root maker pots hard plastic yeah

254
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:41,239
and

255
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,679
eventually um they were put into five

256
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:48,839
gallon roof root makers I didn't put

257
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:52,319
them into the big uh 100 gallon soft

258
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:55,160
yeah I had 100 gallons and 230 gallons

259
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,320
two years ago in New Mexico but I sat

260
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:59,679
them on top of the old soil in all these

261
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,720
pots let them out and if looked like a

262
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:03,958
bad storm or something was weird going

263
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:06,040
on I just carry him into the green room

264
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:09,359
inside set him in the window and they'd

265
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:11,519
be fine I did that all the way till I

266
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:15,320
moved back to Arizona in November and

267
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:17,679
then I brought all six of them home but

268
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,959
during the summer when I had my annual

269
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:22,919
party on Labor Day weekend my friend

270
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:25,679
from Germany came over for a month and

271
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:28,278
another friend dread 420 he came over

272
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:33,359
for two weeks he lives in Monaco of all

273
00:12:28,278 --> 00:12:38,159
places and we met in person at spanis in

274
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:41,560
2019 in Barcelona um I met 10 people in

275
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:43,120
person one in fact is dread he just goes

276
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:45,039
by dread and he's an American I think

277
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,198
he's from New York he's lived in Spain

278
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:52,319
for like over 20 years he worked with

279
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:56,120
Charlie Garcia oh W all the Legends erom

280
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:58,839
grower who went by Musta

281
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:03,078
Funk yeah had all these people it was

282
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:05,160
really cool and he came for a month and

283
00:13:03,078 --> 00:13:10,120
I had never cloned anything before I've

284
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:13,198
never grown indoors either so I I had

285
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:16,159
him show me how we bought one of those

286
00:13:13,198 --> 00:13:20,479
little boxes you know they would hold I

287
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:23,799
think 20 20 slots for clones and I

288
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:27,440
cloned um a bunch of cuting off the

289
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:31,559
female that was so vigorous MH and

290
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:34,920
that's what I ultimately seated with the

291
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:37,599
last flowering of the four males um and

292
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:40,759
I seated it just in time to get seven

293
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,399
weeks for the seeds to mature and almost

294
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:45,600
all the M seeds matured some are just a

295
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:48,839
little lighter color which I separated

296
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,560
from the the perfectly yeah mature but

297
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:53,440
I'm sure the lighter ones none of them

298
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:57,039
were white or tan um they had plenty of

299
00:13:53,440 --> 00:14:00,560
time and then I

300
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:05,519
took two clones that or four clones that

301
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:08,479
are females and since I had other two

302
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,919
other male three other males I took

303
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,560
their pollen they each kind of

304
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:15,919
pollinated about a week apart it was it

305
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:18,399
was very handy and I separated their

306
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:22,078
pollen took one of the Clones pollinated

307
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:26,039
it and these clones were were basically

308
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:29,319
one one bud this long one C out of the

309
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:31,399
ground they didn't even have time to get

310
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:34,600
or anything but they were females from

311
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:38,360
the mother and I thought you know here's

312
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:41,159
three different pollin so why not po 81

313
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:43,639
and each one of those yielded about 40

314
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:45,559
seeds yeah they're only this long yeah

315
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:49,039
they're just tiny I think the big female

316
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:51,879
which grew to about 2 feet tall two feet

317
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:54,198
wide I think it had I haven't counted

318
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:56,000
them but 200 seats

319
00:14:54,198 --> 00:14:59,319
yeah

320
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
and well but let's let's talk talk about

321
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,720
some of the taxonomy of these things

322
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,078
like did you see were there some that

323
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,320
were more broad than the others that

324
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:12,519
finished way earlier that you could

325
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:14,839
tell um well the Clones were all

326
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:17,560
clones of course if you're talking about

327
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:20,480
the the two females they were entirely

328
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:22,518
different and the one smaller female

329
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,639
that was half the size of the large one

330
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:28,679
that I used I gave to my friend SATA in

331
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:31,680
Boulder area he's been growing for I

332
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:33,559
don't know four decades he knows more

333
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:36,399
about Mexican strains and Colombian

334
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:39,638
strains than anyone I've ever seen on

335
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:42,440
any Forum that's awesome he he loves

336
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:45,839
ptoa and that's his favorite and he

337
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:48,399
won't smoke anything that has um indicaa

338
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:51,519
it's purely sativa everything he does is

339
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:56,440
sativa fact my favorite fudge that I

340
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:59,519
indulge in now is he made with Cambodian

341
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:01,040
cross with Colombian he calls it

342
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:05,360
lumbo

343
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:09,240
yeah aome so wonderful man it is so

344
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:12,800
beautiful pure sativa two old strains

345
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:15,519
yeah so they all what did he have to say

346
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:17,679
about his experience with this he took

347
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,679
the one he took he said this one is

348
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:22,758
talking to me which is good because I I

349
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:25,838
wanted to keep the larger one for C and

350
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:29,360
it was starting to get purple stems was

351
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:31,040
only 10 inches tall maybe maybe 12 and

352
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,879
he he said this one's talking to me I

353
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:35,278
said well then you should take it he

354
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:38,919
crossed it with Colombian I mean

355
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:42,439
Cambodian I don't know the results right

356
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:45,439
now he went to Argentina for like three

357
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:48,240
weeks with his wife he's he travels

358
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,279
someplace new every year in the world oh

359
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:55,839
that's nice a year younger than I am so

360
00:16:50,278 --> 00:16:59,480
he's been around a while and his wife is

361
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:02,399
she's um a widower a widow

362
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:05,279
and has kids so he's like a stepfather

363
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:09,078
now and and but he's such a scientist

364
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:12,160
holy [Â __Â ] and Stoner and Stoner that's

365
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:15,159
awesome and the plant he took was very

366
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,160
similar looking to the one I kept they

367
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:20,679
they thin leaves there was no broader

368
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:24,679
leaves on the two females that's

369
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:29,038
awes now that I've taken the pollen from

370
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:32,360
the last um the last pollinating male of

371
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:34,319
the three and and pollinated the female

372
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:37,439
I have a seed growing right now that's 5

373
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:40,558
weeks old and it has broader leaves and

374
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:44,720
I've asked a couple people have you had

375
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:46,720
the experience I'm using um T5 LEDs yeah

376
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,440
not not foressence I bought one of those

377
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:52,160
fixtures that holds three and three so

378
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,919
six and it's four feet wide two feet by

379
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,360
four feet and I have these the four

380
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:59,360
phone letters under it right now and the

381
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:01,918
one plant growing in the middle

382
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:06,279
and it's Brer leav and I asked friends

383
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:10,480
on forums is it your experience that the

384
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:14,480
that under close LEDs like this it's

385
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:17,919
6500k so it's the vegging yeah light

386
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,960
span it's not the um flowering light

387
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:23,320
span and they said oh yeah they're

388
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,400
always wider at first and I'm going oh

389
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:27,678
so we'll

390
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:30,600
see because they're not indicia looking

391
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:34,600
but they're that in between

392
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:38,158
kind of South American Central American

393
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:40,719
a little bit broader leaves so did any

394
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:43,400
of the males have broad leaves at all

395
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,240
you saw or they all pretty narrow too

396
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:49,280
hold on a second I'm gonna look at a

397
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:52,000
photo you want and not record it or no

398
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:55,599
we can put it up [Â __Â ] it I

399
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,279
mean so so you had you said you had four

400
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:59,599
and then you had three clones of a

401
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:01,639
female

402
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:03,879
or you had a mother and then three

403
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:06,520
clones of her right that you that you

404
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:09,640
hit individually with each male I had

405
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:14,240
more than three clones but I gave them

406
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:17,000
to SATA and a few others just because I

407
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,000
didn't have a use for that many but

408
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,079
right initially I had two females and

409
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,119
four males I started with one big pot

410
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:28,119
which I didn't know anyway I had a male

411
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:29,959
right in with both females and my at the

412
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:31,918
parties people said you know you should

413
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:35,279
probably take that mail out and get rid

414
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:38,520
of it so did which I wish I hadn't but

415
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:41,720
did and but I had three males after that

416
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:43,960
and each one flowered like a week to 10

417
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,440
days later than the next and the last

418
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:49,640
flowering one is the one I used on the

419
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:52,759
mother herself okay gotcha the earlier

420
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:55,038
two I used on two clones and each of

421
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:57,200
those clones were like stocks I'll I'll

422
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:59,240
find them right here for you um

423
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,640
excellent have have you a chance to

424
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:06,240
smoke uh any of this stuff or or sample

425
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:09,960
any of it I have I especially the uh

426
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:13,919
ones that my lady friend grew

427
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:17,440
um which there's a person involving Ivy

428
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:20,840
so I just called it Ivy's mother and

429
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,840
it's um I had a a question from high and

430
00:20:20,839 --> 00:20:24,279
Lonesome uh he's one of the the main

431
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:26,519
dudes from our Discord I don't know if

432
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:28,440
you know anything about him but uh he

433
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:31,440
was just asking and kind of curious you

434
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:34,080
know how does that how does I guess the

435
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,080
ivy or how does how does the Mexicans

436
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:37,519
that uh the Mexican stuff that you're

437
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:40,079
working with now compared to the stuff

438
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:44,200
you were growing back in the

439
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:47,000
canyon um I guess go ahead except for

440
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:50,000
the very first year of growing I didn't

441
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,119
have anything identified as Mexican per

442
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:57,880
se right we we had well no that's not

443
00:20:53,119 --> 00:21:01,479
true we had wakin which was sold to us

444
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,720
brought well okay let's step back I'm

445
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:06,839
High

446
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:09,440
um the earliest Hawaiian was wakan

447
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:12,359
brought to Hawaii that most people

448
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:15,720
believe got crossed with Tai that was

449
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:18,240
brought to Hawaii yeah and we had some

450
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:22,759
of that and my friends in Hawaii sent me

451
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:26,440
the seeds so indirectly I think was wak

452
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:29,919
at least half wakan the rest of our um

453
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,480
plants were we planted a shitload of

454
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,679
Colombian because my best friend back

455
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,240
then was Colombian and we had no idea

456
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,679
that it wasn't going to be ready till

457
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:40,519
like Christmas yeah it was it was

458
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:42,519
snowing on the rim above us on

459
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:44,200
Thanksgiving and these they weren't

460
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:46,679
ready the buds were the size of my

461
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:51,278
little fingertip oh

462
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:55,240
no 10 feet huge plants but they it

463
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:57,919
wasn't very good smoke and we we sold it

464
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:01,200
but it was sad because it needed to go

465
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:03,278
to to Christmas if more it was true

466
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,759
equatorial you know

467
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:12,038
Colombian the wakan mix the quian they

468
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:14,038
called it grew to 12 to 14 feet tall wow

469
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:17,359
that's why we were also speculating

470
00:22:14,038 --> 00:22:21,278
possibly Tai yeah because Ty grows so

471
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:24,119
tall reach for the sky and that was just

472
00:22:21,278 --> 00:22:26,519
a very that's the second year I crew but

473
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:29,558
that was the very first year in Magi

474
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:32,319
Canyon then after that

475
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:34,480
we had some seeds left over but that's

476
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:37,759
about the time I met Robert Clark and

477
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:40,400
bought a bunch of skunk number one

478
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:43,839
1979 for the

479
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:47,559
1980 well 1980s when we had two gardens

480
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:49,480
goting and it was virtually all skunk

481
00:22:47,558 --> 00:22:53,038
number one it's a good thing I bought a

482
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:59,000
lot because I wish I saved a lot but

483
00:22:53,038 --> 00:23:02,359
yeah I bought a lot because um it was

484
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,359
we had foot tall plants and we came back

485
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:07,119
in a week the first week of June and

486
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:09,519
they were all gone and we had a plague

487
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:11,918
of grasshoppers that year and they ate

488
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:14,038
hundreds and hundreds of plants down to

489
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:16,440
the ground but the roots were still

490
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:19,480
there and we kept watering and most of

491
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:22,360
them came up but we replanted also and

492
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,759
oddly enough by by flowering time they

493
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:27,519
the ones we replanted the first week of

494
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:31,240
June caught up with the ones the others

495
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:33,839
so wild it was a lucky deal but yeah I

496
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:37,440
had bought 3,000 seeds and we started a

497
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:39,278
little seedy seed area like four feet by

498
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:43,480
five and just filled it with seeds and

499
00:23:39,278 --> 00:23:46,079
we had mesh over it like um scream so

500
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:48,200
that no bugs could get it and once they

501
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:51,480
started growing up we just stick our

502
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:53,319
hands in the mud and pull one out stick

503
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,919
it over here in the mud walk across the

504
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:57,879
garden stick in there and they all

505
00:23:54,919 --> 00:24:00,000
survive they're such a Hardy plant yeah

506
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:02,960
they truly

507
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,880
people we said they truly are weed

508
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:09,720
because it's hard to get rid of weeds

509
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:13,720
and and yeah but they they had

510
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:15,278
um they were leaning more towards sativa

511
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,759
I would say the skunk number one the

512
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:21,919
width of the leaves they we had none

513
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:24,798
that were like Maple Leaf uh you know

514
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:28,240
Tom Hills Maple

515
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:32,558
Leaf yeah that looks big and fat none of

516
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:35,359
them like that so I did get a few seeds

517
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:39,079
of Afghan number one Afghani number one

518
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:40,839
yeah they were fat as heck um but I they

519
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:42,720
just gave me a gift of 50 of them I

520
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:44,798
think um because we bought so many of

521
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,880
the skunk and I would have been

522
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:49,918
interested in those just to see how they

523
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:54,200
were I don't remember actually even

524
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:56,799
planting those 50 that sucks

525
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:59,640
yeah we ended up with

526
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:03,359
275 females

527
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:06,000
and um over across two

528
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:08,240
gardens it took a lot of work every week

529
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,359
we went in for three days I can't even

530
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:16,038
imagine how much work that would be I

531
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:20,599
like yeah I was 28 and my partner was 29

532
00:25:16,038 --> 00:25:23,519
and but we were like so fit that oh I it

533
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:26,839
wasn't a problem we drink tequila by the

534
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:29,240
fire at night and go get up and hike to

535
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:31,720
the next Garden a mile away and then w

536
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:34,079
we would only water after the sunet yeah

537
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,399
we never watered when sun was in the

538
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:38,798
canyon because we did all kinds of tests

539
00:25:36,398 --> 00:25:41,759
one of them was go up to the rim while

540
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:44,639
the other person started watering before

541
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:49,038
the sunset and it was like mirrors or

542
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:52,520
the water was mirrors we no can't do

543
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:55,240
can't do that and then the next thing

544
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:58,519
when because we had open little

545
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:00,240
plots we did a test it looked like it

546
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:03,278
was shining in the morning you know the

547
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,880
mud so one of us went up to the top sat

548
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:08,679
up there I know I did and looked down

549
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:12,960
and it was like like mud

550
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:16,038
mirrors so we started piling up huge

551
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:19,000
piles of oak leaves and every time we

552
00:26:16,038 --> 00:26:21,640
watered before the sun came up we spread

553
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,960
the oak leaves over the mud perfect

554
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:26,679
couldn't see a thing and once they grew

555
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:28,840
up into big plants they were touching

556
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:31,278
you know I mean you couldn't see any

557
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:33,398
watering so we actually pulled off one

558
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:36,000
or two waterings at the end of the year

559
00:26:33,398 --> 00:26:39,398
you know just like the hour before the

560
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:43,440
sun went down we started to get yeah a

561
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:45,398
little chilly over back then I mean

562
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,558
growing up you know doing stuff in the

563
00:26:45,398 --> 00:26:50,839
black market myself there was always

564
00:26:47,558 --> 00:26:52,519
like a edge of uh you know nervousness

565
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:54,119
or a little bit always a healthy a

566
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:56,759
little bit whenever I was up to

567
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:58,959
something so I couldn't imagine back you

568
00:26:56,759 --> 00:27:00,919
know in the 70s or the ' 80s doing this

569
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,840
so I mean did you did you ever get

570
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:04,640
comfortable with that kind of you know

571
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:07,519
doing what you were doing that lifestyle

572
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,038
or or whatever or do did you did you it

573
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:10,359
was it every day you were just like this

574
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:14,278
could be the

575
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:18,038
day um that was always there that was

576
00:27:14,278 --> 00:27:21,798
always present but part of it my I had

577
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:24,558
two I had a partner who would smoke when

578
00:27:21,798 --> 00:27:27,119
in the garden and I had we had a third

579
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:28,599
partner who just helped us here and

580
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:30,719
there like prepping it the beginning of

581
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:32,719
the year he was from Switzerland and he

582
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,558
lived in the verie valley for two years

583
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,880
but at the end of the year he he lived

584
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:40,119
in the garden for three weeks straight

585
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:43,960
and he get high all the time I never got

586
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:46,678
high at all ever until Harvest and then

587
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,600
I would have one puff by the Fireside

588
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:51,720
and just to see what it was like what

589
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:53,918
skunk like you know right but I always

590
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:57,278
wanted to be straight enough so that I

591
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:59,519
could hear and not be too high and I

592
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:02,359
would let them it would it didn't matter

593
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:05,839
yeah but one time we were asleep in our

594
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:09,278
tent and I Heard a Voice and I was up

595
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:11,678
and Dr in less than 10 seconds honestly

596
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:13,640
I didn't have my boots on yet but I went

597
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:16,120
out the tent and it was coming from up

598
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:18,240
on the rim above us it was hunters and

599
00:28:16,119 --> 00:28:21,639
they and then we heard a rifle shot and

600
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:24,159
they were after a deer and um that was

601
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:26,919
the closest and the scariest call of all

602
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:29,919
that one you bet and you guys didn't

603

okay Bing this is this the stuff that

697
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:08,000
she took too early and you see the

698
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:10,518
shriveled leaves are really small

699
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,159
yeah really thin you could definitely

700
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:14,919
tell it was a bit early but yeah I know

701
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:19,039
it still developed and the little little

702
00:33:14,919 --> 00:33:21,880
color on the branches um not purple

703
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:25,119
purple but it's not green yeah and you

704
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:28,039
can see there's plenty of resin on these

705
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:30,439
and I took I did a one toe test and then

706
00:33:28,038 --> 00:33:34,558
I did a three to test which is how I do

707
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:38,120
it and yeah one to I didn't feel much so

708
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:42,119
I went huh so but I I didn't calculate

709
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:46,719
in my mind that hey THC was 5 to 7% back

710
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:49,599
then on on good weed so I took two more

711
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:51,960
Puffs and about 15 minutes later when I

712
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:54,959
was going gosh I guess it's not even

713
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:57,360
that strong it hit me and it's we used

714
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,639
to call creeper weed where you you take

715
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:01,798
a bunch of hits and then you go huh and

716
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:03,959
then all of a sudden it just creeps up

717
00:34:01,798 --> 00:34:07,278
on you and I got a nice little buzz it

718
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:11,240
was very smooth and it really reminded

719
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:15,000
me of Mexican from the old days um the

720
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:17,838
very first year I grew in 1976 was with

721
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,960
seeds and my friend who was a dealer in

722
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:22,799
Temp and for two years he took the best

723
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,199
he kept seeds from the best loads that

724
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:30,879
he sent through and he sold a lot of

725
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:34,598
weed to the campus area and temp

726
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:37,480
and what more pictures you found

727
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:39,399
them what flavors did you get on that or

728
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,480
you know profiles as far as like the

729
00:34:39,398 --> 00:34:42,440
smoke I know you said it's a little

730
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,679
early probably wasn't super developed

731
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:47,440
but uh is there anything you can

732
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:52,280
describe about the way it tasted

733
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:56,838
uh no um I've never been that good with

734
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:59,440
Aromas um the flavor it was mild it was

735
00:34:56,838 --> 00:35:00,400
it didn't make cough or gag or anything

736
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,039
so

737
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,599
whatever whatever she did the way she

738
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:09,119
she said she put it in paper

739
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:10,838
bags she cut it so it was fairly slow it

740
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,039
wasn't just sitting out in the sun like

741
00:35:10,838 --> 00:35:15,679
some people yeah

742
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:18,119
right these are these aren't my photos

743
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:22,159
these are comparison photos of

744
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:25,000
Zach um plants that were posted on icy

745
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:28,519
mag I think um how do you how do you

746
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:31,119
think it fared uh in comparison to zakas

747
00:35:28,519 --> 00:35:33,039
this looks a lot more narrow leaf and

748
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:36,200
yeah it does it looks a lot more narrow

749
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:36,199
Leaf um than the

750
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:41,800
zakas it reminds me yeah just even

751
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,599
growing some of h&amp; L's manga like the

752
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:46,000

754
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,559
anything but that kind of narrow leaf

755
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:55,480
look like there was also an email that

756
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:59,639
came with it that talked

757
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:59,639
about the primary Aromas

758
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:10,359

759
00:36:04,838 --> 00:36:15,199
Pine hops wood from the tur yeah yeah

760

00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:26,318
oxide beta trans aamine terpinolene and

763
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:28,078
beta mercine wonder if that would end up

764
00:36:26,318 --> 00:36:32,800
smelling like

765
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:36,920

791
00:37:54,039 --> 00:38:00,039
um this is the first week in November

792
00:37:57,199 --> 00:38:02,799
when I brought them back the four female

793
00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:06,079
clones that I'm I was grooming to be

794
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:08,480
mothers and there'll be plenty of um

795
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:10,960
clones able to come off these this was

796
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:13,280
at the beginning of November but I'm

797
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:16,000
going to show you a pH photo from two

798
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:18,760
days ago and

799
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,400
uh I took two of the bulbs out so

800
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,599
there's only four bulbs because they're

801
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,440
just growing too much for one gallon

802
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:27,880
pots I took them out of the pots three

803
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,838
weeks ago and trimmed one inch off the

804
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:35,119
root ball put them back in with build a

805
00:38:30,838 --> 00:38:37,759
soil 3.0 fresh yeah and they love that

806
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:41,480
but it's just making them grow faster

807
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:43,000
yeah um I don't need them bigger I need

808
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:46,920
them in your

809
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,880
hands yeah keep the lights right and

810
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,159
touching

811
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:52,200
them it's about the best you can do and

812
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:55,318
keep cutting off the tops high above

813
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:58,480
them the light oh yeah yeah I

814
00:38:55,318 --> 00:39:01,239
mean so let's see

815
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:04,119
let them get all root bound all kinds of

816
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:06,159
things you can do all right you if you

817
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:08,559
ever got time mag you got to come to one

818
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:10,639
of the events that Matt and the guys put

819
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:14,440
on dude it'd be

820
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:17,199
awesome we'll get him there one year yep

821
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:20,800
all right so

822
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:22,879
there's what they look like now well a

823
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,839
week ago the little guy in the little

824
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,960
girl in the middle I hope it's a girl

825
00:39:24,838 --> 00:39:29,358
that's how broad the Le are oh

826
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,358
interesting

827
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:37,119
H yeah but the the mothers two of them

828
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:40,279
are very kind of yellowish green they're

829
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:44,160
all in the exact same soil and these two

830
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:46,000
are deep green and huge and because I I

831
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:48,559
pruned them all back when I did the uh

832
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,239
root pruning too they just have tons of

833
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:55,519
little fresh man this plant right here

834
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:59,159
could probably create 40 clones right

835
00:39:55,519 --> 00:40:01,639
now without even I I am terrified of

836
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:03,679
root pruning that's one thing I I like

837
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:06,118
I've tried it a few times and really

838
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:08,239
really like chewed up the the big main

839
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:09,480
tap route didn't know what I was doing

840
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,799
after that I was like I'm not cutting

841
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:15,400
out Ro this is how the leaves the actual

842
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:16,960
width of them yeah and that's the one

843
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:20,280
yellow look at the stock it's the size

844
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,358
of my index finger yeah and that's only

845
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,359
since

846
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:26,318
September and these are all clones of

847
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:28,679
each other these are all clones off that

848
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:31,239
mother yep and that one's just not

849
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:34,679
liking the soil for whatever reason yeah

850
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:39,679
or the light or something something yeah

851
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:42,358
identical soil build of soil 3.0 um is

852
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:43,838
is the mom directly in the center or

853
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:45,960
more in the center than the other ones

854
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:48,358
cuz you know with H&amp;L some of his hazes

855
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:49,760
I think the am it it doesn't like that

856
00:40:48,358 --> 00:40:52,078
direct light it likes to be on like the

857
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,599
outskirts it's kind of weird the

858
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:56,880
mother's long gone that from the Six

859
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:57,960
Original plants I seated her with the

860
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,838
last

861
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:03,199
and but I took clones off her before I

862
00:41:00,838 --> 00:41:05,039
seated her and these are her clones

863
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:06,960
these are her babies so these are

864
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:10,039
identical plants to the mother

865
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:12,199
genetically got but I don't know why

866
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:14,239
phenotypically the way they're growing

867
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:17,439
they look slightly different but that's

868
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:19,358
why cannabis is a [Â __Â ] sometimes

869
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,800
because that's the the more the more you

870
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:23,078
grow clones of each other the more you

871
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,400
grow clones in volume you'll see that

872
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:27,400
happen all the time it's like and and

873
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:30,160
it's it's what we run into when making

874
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:33,639
feminite seeds too you can have you know

875
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:36,358
20 clones of the same thing spray all of

876
00:41:33,639 --> 00:41:38,118
them to reverse the same exact way and

877
00:41:36,358 --> 00:41:41,719
eight of them will reverse and 12 of

878
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:44,519
them won't that happens very very

879
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:47,439
commonly okay

880
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:50,480
here's this is the little clone box this

881
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:53,240
is from this is from September and

882
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:56,039
that's what they all look I did it looks

883
00:41:53,239 --> 00:41:57,959
like here one two three four five like

884
00:41:56,039 --> 00:41:59,599
six clones

885
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:03,480
Yeah

886
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:07,280
couple I gave to satva and others and I

887
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:09,440
kept the four of these and these These

888
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,560
are the big plants we just looked at so

889
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,240
each of them is a potential mother you

890
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:15,559
know easy for

891
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:20,000
cloning there you go a nice little clone

892
00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:22,599
Dome I didn't fill it because a nice one

893
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,199
though never seen one looked like that

894
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:28,318
only had like nine branches um and I

895
00:42:26,199 --> 00:42:31,480
didn't want to

896
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:33,199
take away too much from her because I

897
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,639
was planning on seeding her within the

898
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:38,919
next week or two after that so I could

899
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:43,598
get at least six to eight weeks of um

900
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:46,880
seeds maturing yeah I didn't want to do

901
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:50,880
all this work and end up with a bunch of

902
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:52,160
unmature immature um seeds but anyway

903
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:56,318
and we've been talking about releasing

904
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:58,639
some of these seeds right um on the site

905
00:42:56,318 --> 00:43:01,480
or through the Discord somehow making

906
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:01,480
them available to

907
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:06,199
people so we'll see how that goes I I

908
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,359
think it I think there'll be big

909
00:43:06,199 --> 00:43:10,199
interest in it I just hope credit card

910
00:43:08,358 --> 00:43:14,159
processing goes back up soon that's

911
00:43:10,199 --> 00:43:17,078
really yeah really you know you don't

912
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:20,078
have credit card processing oh it just

913
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:23,000
went down this last week oh it's the

914
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:25,400
same one most see people use and uh yeah

915
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:29,119
they went out for everyone all right

916
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:29,119
here I'm going to show you

917
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:40,960
no [Â __Â ]

918
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,519
sorry it's all

919
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,000
good

920
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:49,719
well you I

921
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:51,079
know just I can always edit I know it's

922
00:43:49,719 --> 00:43:53,480
a lot of

923
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:55,280
editing you got leave that one in there

924
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:58,159
that's that's that's

925
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:02,319
comedy leaving the edit

926
00:43:58,159 --> 00:44:02,318
yeah true all

927
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:10,719
right hey uh do you think do you think

928
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:12,760
Rob Clark's a a he more heavier partyer

929
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:14,598
than you madjack you think he parties

930
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:16,760
harder than

931
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:19,318
you oh

932
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:22,480
yeah this is just you want you need to

933
00:44:19,318 --> 00:44:26,119
open those first and then you link to

934
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:27,880
that I know I just opened can you see

935
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:30,400
one I just opened

936
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:35,760
what can you see the one I just opened

937
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:35,760
no no you have to reshow the file

938
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,240
yeah okay In fairness I I did just drop

939
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:45,440
this on him last second as far as like

940
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:47,719
him sharing the file so well we used it

941
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:51,480
a year and a half ago but I don't

942
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:54,919
remember it from them yeah

943
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:58,119
fortunately it's all good dude all right

944
00:44:54,920 --> 00:45:01,920
that's the female that yielded the seeds

945
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:01,920
okay there we go and

946
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:07,160
this this is what she looked up close

947
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:10,200
she was just starting the flower you can

948
00:45:07,159 --> 00:45:10,199
see just a little

949
00:45:10,519 --> 00:45:17,719
bit just starting and these are two

950
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:23,720
males or are they let me see that's the

951
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:30,960
female I think this is the other female

952
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:34,759
that SAA ended

953
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:40,039
getting and they're sitting on top of

954
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:44,160
a 100 gallon tank yeah it held 12 one

955
00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:46,199
gallon one cubic foot bags so it was

956
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:48,879
kind of expensive but I had two of those

957
00:45:46,199 --> 00:45:52,078
and those yeah that's expensive for seed

958
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:55,358
making they created these monsters but I

959
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:58,119
I set these out every day in the Sun and

960
00:45:55,358 --> 00:46:01,480
and until it got to the point where we

961
00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:03,720
were going to get some cold rain in um

962
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:05,440
late September in New Mexico so then I

963
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:08,838
just brought him

964
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:12,960
in but they're narrow narrow enough

965
00:46:08,838 --> 00:46:12,960
leaves definitely

966
00:46:14,318 --> 00:46:19,639
yeah you know what's interesting is

967
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:21,719
there's a lot of uh similar looks too

968
00:46:19,639 --> 00:46:25,199
with that and blueberry like EJ's

969
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:29,480
blueberry which also has some Mexican in

970
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:32,558
it supposedly it's better knows yeah DJ

971
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,559
Short was us in

972
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:43,000
Mexican you know I won't tell the whole

973
00:46:38,358 --> 00:46:47,159
story but um I introduced Rob Clark to a

974
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:49,199
friend of mine that owned land in the

975

internet so oh he's on a phone

999
00:47:57,199 --> 00:48:02,399
this

1000
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:05,599
is these are the results of my sample I

1001
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:08,440
I put in okay from from that female that

1002
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:12,838
two- foot female yeah not my

1003
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:16,760
girlfriend's and I will share the screen

1004
00:48:12,838 --> 00:48:22,199
here IV number two and it was a little

1005
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:25,520
bit different it was 6.7% THC yeah and

1006
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:28,519
and also the tarpine profile compared to

1007
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:30,960
the other one is different so that's how

1008
00:48:28,519 --> 00:48:34,920
that corroborated that there's more than

1009
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:37,880
one load from Jerome from

1010
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:39,200
6465 involved in this she stopped

1011
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:43,200
smoking in

1012
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:44,799
19 um 85 sorry she stopped smoking in 85

1013
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:47,519
because she was pregnant with her her

1014
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:50,519
daughter and that's when she put the

1015
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:52,519
seeds in the safe in 85 so they came

1016
00:48:50,519 --> 00:48:56,159
from 84

1017
00:48:52,519 --> 00:48:57,440
85 but now when I got this test done it

1018
00:48:56,159 --> 00:48:59,719
showed that

1019
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:03,358
yeah there's definitely two strains or

1020
00:48:59,719 --> 00:49:06,358
varieties at least if not three

1021
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:10,480
yeah I'm interested to see now that I'm

1022
00:49:06,358 --> 00:49:12,279
growing one of the seeds to see um I

1023
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:14,838
have to get it to flowering and I don't

1024
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:18,119
know how to do that actually under the

1025
00:49:14,838 --> 00:49:19,920
lights unless I get the mothers to you

1026
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:22,240
and then I can just use the lights I can

1027
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:24,720
turn it to yeah that makes sense light

1028
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:26,439
dep and yeah just so I can get a couple

1029
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:30,480
flowers and then I can have them tested

1030
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:32,599
and see how they compare to this yeah I

1031
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,679
wonder I wonder if the the THC Remains

1032
00:49:32,599 --> 00:49:37,559
the Same a lot of people that that are

1033
00:49:34,679 --> 00:49:40,118
newer to cannabis think that THC is and

1034
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:42,680
all be all like that that go shopping at

1035
00:49:40,119 --> 00:49:46,680
dispens you know number one was

1036
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:50,719
something like 12% yeah or 14% And it

1037
00:49:46,679 --> 00:49:53,279
was mindboggling po yeah I I saw a woman

1038
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:55,519
walk out of a bathroom after two toes

1039
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:58,280
into a table do a front flip knock all

1040
00:49:55,519 --> 00:50:00,838
the drinks over the table

1041
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:03,319
cancer and we went in the bathroom my

1042
00:50:00,838 --> 00:50:05,838
best friend and I and two ladies and we

1043
00:50:03,318 --> 00:50:08,079
we got caught by the head dancer and we

1044
00:50:05,838 --> 00:50:11,719
had to leave the room but they finished

1045
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:14,160
the maybe they had three toes but she

1046
00:50:11,719 --> 00:50:16,480
she couldn't even

1047
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:17,318
walk that would suck trying to dance

1048
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,519
after

1049
00:50:17,318 --> 00:50:23,279
that we were sitting there they went

1050
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:23,280
right past us and into the table

1051
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:30,318
and yeah I just mainly wanted to point

1052
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:32,598
out that um L THC isn't the end all be

1053
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:35,239
all this is more of a breeding tool

1054
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:40,000
something something to have U the

1055
00:50:35,239 --> 00:50:42,358
building block exactly it's the it's the

1056
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:46,960
beautiful Turing that that's what I

1057
00:50:42,358 --> 00:50:49,558
can't the aroma of these plants now is

1058
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:53,280
right back to the 80s I mean it's like

1059
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:57,240
someone just took me to an early Garden

1060
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:59,760
it's so it's this just beautiful Aroma I

1061
00:50:57,239 --> 00:51:03,159
don't know what to compare it to but

1062
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:06,920
it's definitely high in the lemon limey

1063
00:51:03,159 --> 00:51:09,719
um tpol leine side yeah and I need to

1064
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:12,559

00:52:24,358 --> 00:52:29,798
chance so uh I don't know if you even be

1091

1094
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:39,000
out to us said I don't didn't know if

1095
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,639
you knew anything about these they're

1096
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:44,280
basically the lab

1097
00:52:41,639 --> 00:52:48,118
quit

1098
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:48,119
well there was a brief

1099
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:55,798
period no it was after I grew um you

1100
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:56,960
know Sam skunkman Dave Watson he

1101
00:52:55,798 --> 00:53:00,719
collects lab

1102
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:03,798
he collected collected and I sent him

1103
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:07,519
madag labels but when we got five loads

1104
00:53:03,798 --> 00:53:11,519
of of 500 kilos a th000 pound we got

1105
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:14,960
5,000 pound loads from Mexico in 1984

1106
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:19,719
roughly and the first one we got had

1107
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:22,400
labels on every 25 pound cellophane

1108
00:53:19,719 --> 00:53:24,759
wrapped and we were like what the [Â __Â ]

1109
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,559
and it turns out that the guys it was

1110
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:30,119
meant for were in California but they

1111
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:32,760
didn't pay in from the last load so they

1112
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:35,039
gave that load to us oh

1113
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:37,839
interesting cool there was loose labels

1114
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:41,838
too and I sent some of those to

1115
00:53:37,838 --> 00:53:45,920
Amsterdam to um Dave and he was very

1116
00:53:41,838 --> 00:53:49,440
happy to get them there he was him on IC

1117
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:51,880
mag in his media collection yeah if it's

1118
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:54,079
still there you can see his label

1119
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:56,119
collection he has he had a hundred

1120
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:59,079
different labels I think you know that

1121
00:53:56,119 --> 00:54:01,440
he just passed away last week

1122
00:53:59,079 --> 00:54:04,240
yeah and the

1123
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:06,318
uh one was they weren't beavers they

1124
00:54:04,239 --> 00:54:08,598
were they were they weren't skunks

1125
00:54:06,318 --> 00:54:11,400
either the raccoons there were raccoons

1126
00:54:08,599 --> 00:54:14,079
in a wagon yeah I remember seeing those

1127
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:16,440
on the on the icy mag a load of weed in

1128
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:18,280
the back of the wagon and there's

1129
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:20,960
another label too I can't think of it

1130
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:23,400
right now but I sent I did I knew he

1131
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:25,559
loved them so I sent them to Amsterdam

1132
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:28,000
so cool I still never been over there

1133
00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:30,119
Rob Clark invited me every year because

1134
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,519
he would go to Amsterdam for Christmas

1135
00:54:30,119 --> 00:54:37,760
but I just um last time I was there was

1136
00:54:33,519 --> 00:54:42,480
1969 and that Wow first place at Club

1137
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:44,000
par Paradisio in Adam I tried to smoke

1138
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:49,000
hash I didn't smoke cigarettes so I

1139
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:50,798
couldn't I took a hidden cough Gad and

1140
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,838
some guy came up and he had a shoe box

1141
00:54:50,798 --> 00:54:55,639
full of Turkish weed for

1142
00:54:52,838 --> 00:55:00,199
$15 and I looked at it and I just went

1143
00:54:55,639 --> 00:55:02,759
no thanks but I did buy a a sugar cube

1144
00:55:00,199 --> 00:55:03,798
size chunk of hash and I I brought it

1145
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:07,559
back to the

1146
00:55:03,798 --> 00:55:10,199
US I didn't smoke it till the um few

1147
00:55:07,559 --> 00:55:11,400
months later my first two joints I

1148
00:55:10,199 --> 00:55:15,199
bought in

1149
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:18,920
1966 from the only hippie in our Chicago

1150
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:21,798
Suburban high school and he um I stashed

1151
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:24,159
him for two years I I was still not

1152
00:55:21,798 --> 00:55:27,038
quite sure if I wanted to smoke them yet

1153
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:27,920
so I really didn't get high till 196

1154
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:30,079
so that probably would have been

1155
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:34,000
Colombian yeah something Colombian I

1156
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:36,119
don't know in Chicago then yeah I don't

1157
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,400
know 66

1158
00:55:36,119 --> 00:55:42,039
well my my grandfather was getting weed

1159
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:46,440
from Mexican or Mexican brick weed from

1160
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:49,359
down there I guess around that time so

1161
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:51,480
uh and he's in up Northern Kentucky so

1162
00:55:49,358 --> 00:55:53,639
it could be possible probably right it's

1163
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:55,880
not too too far from Chicago I'd say

1164
00:55:53,639 --> 00:55:56,759
it's more likely Mexican than it is

1165
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:59,920
Columbia

1166
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:02,039
just because the Columbo connection I

1167
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:05,400
think came after Mexico Mexico was

1168
00:56:02,039 --> 00:56:07,319
sending weed in the 40s to the US okay

1169
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,480
people were sneaking it in and that's

1170
00:56:07,318 --> 00:56:12,000
when that

1171
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:15,079
whole deal the the freaky movies about

1172
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:18,280
you know it'll make women get raped and

1173
00:56:15,079 --> 00:56:20,920
just silly stuff um what was the name of

1174
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:23,599
that famous movie Reaper Madness is that

1175
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:27,440
what you're talking Madness yeah that

1176
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:30,880
was the 30s 40s wasn't it yeah yeah

1177
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:33,000
there yeah Reaper was in inner cities

1178
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:36,599
definitely and probably out west in the

1179
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:38,280
Hills too because you could just hop on

1180
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:40,440
a horse and ride across the border back

1181
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:42,920
then there was no yeah that's a good

1182
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:46,639
point there was no walls or fences even

1183
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:47,880
you know yeah and if they if if you had

1184
00:56:46,639 --> 00:56:49,719
to prove you're an American they' just

1185
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:53,838
ask you and if you could speak English

1186
00:56:49,719 --> 00:56:53,838
say yeah I'm from Tucson they'd say

1187
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:59,880
okay when I started going to Jamaica all

1188
00:56:56,519 --> 00:57:01,960
I had to have is a uh birth certificate

1189
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:03,880
and I had my original birth certificate

1190
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:06,880
but it was almost tattered from folding

1191
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:11,519
so many times and oh I bet but that they

1192
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:14,440
would accept that and um yeah and Rob

1193
00:57:11,519 --> 00:57:16,480
Clark met me in the grill and for two or

1194
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:20,599
three days we were going to go on a seed

1195
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:23,400
hunt um it didn't really ever happen

1196
00:57:20,599 --> 00:57:25,079
because other ex extenuating

1197
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:26,720
circumstances but we had a good time

1198
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:28,559
together in a

1199
00:57:26,719 --> 00:57:30,798
he was married then and I met his wife

1200
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:33,559
who was just this really cool hippie

1201
00:57:30,798 --> 00:57:36,038
lady um can't remember her name right

1202
00:57:33,559 --> 00:57:37,599
off hand he just got remarried again I

1203
00:57:36,039 --> 00:57:39,720
think last time we talked to him he said

1204
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:44,119
he was getting married uh or something

1205
00:57:39,719 --> 00:57:46,679
like that I think so he got REM y i i

1206
00:57:44,119 --> 00:57:50,240
see like in hash church I think or some

1207
00:57:46,679 --> 00:57:52,480
different interviews on YouTube I've

1208
00:57:50,239 --> 00:57:55,479
caught him over the last 10 years on a

1209
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:56,639
couple yeah different people

1210

1218
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:20,279
with him the first time he came to see

1219
00:58:17,798 --> 00:58:23,400
skunk number one in our garden we hiked

1220
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:25,798
him in and he was blown away he said you

1221
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:26,760
growing it out of dirt and I said what

1222
00:58:25,798 --> 00:58:29,038
do you mean

1223
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:30,880
and he said well where we grow this in

1224
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:35,799
Northern California it's fluffy black

1225
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:38,599
soil and ours was hard packed brown dirt

1226
00:58:35,798 --> 00:58:42,239
yeah that we had turned and then planted

1227
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:44,960
and then watered and it compressed and

1228
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:47,199
he had this little zip case when we were

1229
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:50,358
in Cottonwood and he zipped it open and

1230
00:58:47,199 --> 00:58:52,519
he had Tai he had Colombian he had

1231
00:58:50,358 --> 00:58:55,318
Mexican he had all these separate little

1232
00:58:52,519 --> 00:58:57,519
vials with pre-made joints in them and

1233
00:58:55,318 --> 00:58:59,558
he one

1234
00:58:57,519 --> 00:59:01,280
it I took one hit off it and I was

1235
00:58:59,559 --> 00:59:04,160
laying on the

1236
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:08,359
floor room and he smoked the whole rest

1237
00:59:04,159 --> 00:59:11,960
of the joint by himself I bet yeah I was

1238
00:59:08,358 --> 00:59:15,519
never in that League no well

1239
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:17,798
he he he partied we there was one night

1240
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:19,719
I think all of us maybe slept a total of

1241
00:59:17,798 --> 00:59:21,519
like two hours and then we got on a boat

1242
00:59:19,719 --> 00:59:23,399
at like 600 a.m. and fished for eight

1243
00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:25,280
hours and then did it again the same

1244
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:29,480
night and he was just he was like the

1245
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:31,240
Energizer but dude yeah that's cool my

1246
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:36,280
friend from columia I saw him smokeing

1247
00:59:31,239 --> 00:59:39,318
ounce in a day um Jesus I've never seen

1248
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:41,839
except for a Rastafarian or two um do

1249
00:59:39,318 --> 00:59:46,558
that just basically chain smoke all day

1250
00:59:41,838 --> 00:59:46,558
yeah join after join after join Chucky

1251
00:59:48,838 --> 00:59:57,119
Style no that's cool all right well I'm

1252
00:59:53,519 --> 01:00:00,079
excited to see people plant this and

1253
00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:02,200
cross it with various plants because

1254
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:07,318
this is these are going to be all

1255
01:00:02,199 --> 01:00:11,038
new um hybrids yeah this is like a a

1256
01:00:07,318 --> 01:00:13,519
missing link for 40 years um that has a

1257
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:15,799
chance now and we didn't mention this

1258
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:18,679
but I'm pretty sure the reason why my

1259
01:00:15,798 --> 01:00:21,920
lady friend succeeded and I did in

1260
01:00:18,679 --> 01:00:24,838
germinating these was micro rizy because

1261
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:27,480
we both use really good quality soil

1262
01:00:24,838 --> 01:00:29,480
that has lots of mic rizy in it and when

1263
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:32,318
you do the wet paper towel method or The

1264
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:36,119
Germ method there's no micro rizy

1265
01:00:32,318 --> 01:00:39,440
involved and it took nine days for that

1266
01:00:36,119 --> 01:00:42,960
one to first come up because older seed

1267
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:46,400
coats are thicker yeah it was kind of in

1268
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:49,599
stasis over all those 40 some years in

1269
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:52,000
the safe because um was never touched

1270
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:54,960
never got any human germs on

1271
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,719
it and she pulled them out and then she

1272
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:58,280
put the baggie back in

1273
01:00:56,719 --> 01:01:02,399
next year when I met her she gave it to

1274
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:05,079
me and I was I oh my gosh a baggie

1275
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:06,720
baggie that's crazy yeah that's that's

1276
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:09,798
the wild part is I think the missing

1277
01:01:06,719 --> 01:01:12,558
link in germinating old seeds is micro

1278
01:01:09,798 --> 01:01:15,838
rizy you have to put it in real soil I

1279
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:18,640
used build of soil 3.0 she used

1280
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:21,279
something she bought on the internet

1281
01:01:18,639 --> 01:01:23,358
that was it said it had micro isy that's

1282
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:27,680
the only thing that made it unusual it

1283
01:01:23,358 --> 01:01:31,239
was cheap um but it it worked

1284
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:33,519
promix I don't know she I've got the

1285
01:01:31,239 --> 01:01:35,038
name of it somewhere because she she

1286
01:01:33,519 --> 01:01:37,440
kept the records

1287
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:39,119
but I really like the guys that build a

1288
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:43,920
soil I've gotten to know them over the

1289
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:47,760
years I bought 40 bags at $3 a b $30 a

1290
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:50,960
bag um in Colorado Springs two years ago

1291
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:54,079
because Albuquerque had run out uh Santa

the phone um it's really cool and it has

1489

a browser but the browser is this big

1490
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:13,640
yeah tiny little thing so I've tried

1491
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:16,239
using it once for Google Maps and it was

1492
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:17,800
worthless yeah it doesn't have a Cy

1493

board you have to press three times to

1494
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:26,640
get a c two one and to just do a text

1495
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:28,119
it's a pain in the ass oh I bet that T9

1496
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:29,440
is what it I think they call it or

1497
01:11:28,119 --> 01:11:30,399
something like that whatever they call

1498

1578
01:15:07,319 --> 01:15:14,840
and he but boy the story is I bet yeah

1579
01:15:12,319 --> 01:15:18,000
kicking kicking pipes out of a

1580
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:20,039
helicopter down a canyon we took the

1581
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,719
airplane it's a cessa and we took the

1582
01:15:20,039 --> 01:15:25,719
door off and we had I was in the back

1583
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:29,079
seat we took the front seat out yeah see

1584
01:15:25,719 --> 01:15:30,920
and I had these bags piled up with we

1585
01:15:29,079 --> 01:15:32,639
wrapped rope around them we mummified

1586
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:38,000
them because the first time we dropped

1587
01:15:32,639 --> 01:15:39,400
them just with um lots of tape and stuff

1588
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:43,679
the bone meal

1589
01:15:39,399 --> 01:15:46,399
exploded no problem but the uh blood the

1590
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:49,880
bone meal when it exploded made a giant

1591
01:15:46,399 --> 01:15:53,079
white circle about 30 feet oh [Â __Â ] and

1592
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:55,119
we were oh my God we when we got back to

1593
01:15:53,079 --> 01:15:57,079
we raced out there and cl went down in

1594
01:15:55,119 --> 01:16:00,639
the canyon and spread dirt over it and

1595
01:15:57,079 --> 01:16:03,600
stuff but um we mummified them with

1596
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:05,039
cheap sisle rope so that when they hit

1597
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:07,560
the most they could do is break a hole

1598
01:16:05,039 --> 01:16:09,960
maybe this big yeah and a little would

1599
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:13,159
squirt out the side no problem we

1600
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:17,399
dropped probably 600 pounds of between

1601
01:16:13,158 --> 01:16:19,638
300 of each and it took three flights

1602
01:16:17,399 --> 01:16:22,399
and I would hold I got good where I

1603
01:16:19,639 --> 01:16:24,159
could hold the rope and push it just at

1604
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:26,839
the last minute and hold it in the air

1605
01:16:24,158 --> 01:16:30,198
50 pounds and and he'd say no I just

1606
01:16:26,840 --> 01:16:34,239
open my open my fingers

1607
01:16:30,198 --> 01:16:37,399
and but we lost one roll of 100 foot

1608
01:16:34,238 --> 01:16:40,119
roll of 2in Hose it pretty expensive we

1609
01:16:37,399 --> 01:16:41,920
found it two years later in a juniper

1610
01:16:40,119 --> 01:16:45,599
tree on the oh

1611
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:47,279
no where it landed and we even hiked up

1612
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:49,159
there but we never looked up in the

1613
01:16:47,279 --> 01:16:52,399
trees yeah thought would be on the

1614
01:16:49,158 --> 01:16:55,000
ground it wasn't there it's fun were you

1615
01:16:52,399 --> 01:16:56,238
doing this all in your robe up in the in

1616
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,079
the plane did you have your robe on

1617
01:16:56,238 --> 01:17:00,799
while you're dropping them out the back

1618
01:16:58,079 --> 01:17:03,158
no that our

1619
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:06,719
future thought that we would do a movie

1620
01:17:03,158 --> 01:17:09,920
or a book and um that was fun my first

1621
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:11,719
wife made all those costumes she used to

1622
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:15,158
make costumes for

1623
01:17:11,719 --> 01:17:17,760
bands and stuff so she made those long

1624
01:17:15,158 --> 01:17:20,479
robes and we became the Wizards of the

1625
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:22,400
rim yep yeah that those those are what

1626
01:17:20,479 --> 01:17:23,839

the guys is from Chicago he and his wife

1737

drive all the way from Chicago they've

1738
01:22:43,439 --> 01:22:48,479
come every year for four years now

1739
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:50,440
that's cool they bring the bong and the

1740
01:22:48,479 --> 01:22:54,559
bong is active from 7 in the morning

1741
01:22:50,439 --> 01:22:56,919
till midnight in The Green Room

1742
01:22:54,560 --> 01:23:00,120
one's testing each others and oh well

1743
01:22:56,920 --> 01:23:01,600
you should try this and it's really fun

1744
01:23:00,119 --> 01:23:05,079
and I take them on little four-wheel

1745
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:08,079
drive um excursions in the area up to

1746
01:23:05,079 --> 01:23:09,719
we're 12 miles from Colorado border so

1747
01:23:08,079 --> 01:23:12,639
there's several passes that go through

1748
01:23:09,719 --> 01:23:15,439
to Colorado into really remote areas and

1749
01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:18,159
we go to um Trinidad which is the first

1750
01:23:15,439 --> 01:23:22,479
town in southern Southeastern they have

1751
01:23:18,158 --> 01:23:25,238
30 Rex stores in a town of 7,000 people

1752
01:23:22,479 --> 01:23:27,839
because it's closest to Texas H that

1753
01:23:25,238 --> 01:23:30,158
makes sense and but now that New

1754
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:33,760
Mexico's legal and they're popping up

1755
01:23:30,158 --> 01:23:35,198
like weekly um they've lost I bet

1756
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:38,199
they've lost 10 of their stores already

1757
01:23:35,198 --> 01:23:39,799
in Trinidad I'm sure yeah because all

1758
01:23:38,198 --> 01:23:44,119
you have to do is drive across from New

1759
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:48,159
Me from El Paso and there's 10

1760
01:23:44,119 --> 01:23:51,719
stores yeah that's big and you can buy

1761
01:23:48,158 --> 01:23:54,719
two ounces a day in that's in Colorado

literally buy two pounds from one store

1767
01:24:06,039 --> 01:24:10,439
