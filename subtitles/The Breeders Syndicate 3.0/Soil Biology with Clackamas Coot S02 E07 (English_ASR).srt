1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,759
ready go

2

[Music]

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,510
[Music]

4
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:35,479
welcome to breeder syndicate

5
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:47,280
[Music]

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,359
how you doing

7
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,399
good how are you doing everybody

8
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:54,719
so-called liquid silica product is made

9
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,239
from potassium silicate and that's where

10
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,879
your ph issues come into play uh

11
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:03,839
problems with raising the ph

12
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:05,920
so uh we it

13
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,880
we can get it from other sources a

14
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,118
couple of the posters here mentioned

15
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:13,280
rice halls and that's true there's even

16
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:15,759
a powdered rice hole product that build

17
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,759
a soil carries i can't remember the name

18
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:21,840
but i've used it and it did well

19
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,040
one person asked a very legitimate

20
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,600
question

21
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,560
is it even necessary

22
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:27,759
and

23
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,640
um

24
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:33,359
it depends like in my worm bins i run a

25
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,560
lot of uh rice holes as an aeration

26
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,118
material

27
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,719
so when that deconstruct is releasing

28
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:41,438
the uh

29
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:42,478
silica oxide i believe that's the form

30
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:46,398
it's in

31
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:47,359
so would i add it to my soil no

32
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,519
but

33
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:52,078
you know so that question isn't

34
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:55,118
you need some silicon in your soil

35
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:58,559
and if you use it judiciously

36
00:01:55,118 --> 00:02:00,078
and get like the uh egg sale product

37
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,920
because that's what all the other ones

38
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:04,319
like the silly one from

39
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,359
oh the guy advanced nutrients wet betty

40
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:10,000
or something so yeah um

41
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:12,878
even a sillier label but uh

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,759
it's made from axil i mean all those

43
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:18,159
products that you see in the grow store

44
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:18,959
or what i call the house of perdition

45
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:22,239
um

46
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,719
they're all made with eggs so get exile

47
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,719
yeah you know and then cut the chase

48
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:28,959
and it's in a powder form so you mix on

49
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:31,359
an as need basis

50
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,360
um and it's good for emulsifying

51
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,560
horticultural oils i don't want to get

52
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,080
into that mess uh neem or karate oils or

53
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,080
whatever but uh

54
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,800
yeah and i still use them and they're

55
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,599
full of crap the people you know

56
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,800
yeah

57
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:46,318
you gotta learn the difference between

58
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,480
an extract

59
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,159
and oppressing but you know that's like

60
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:53,199
trying to explain why is it called

61
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,878
unsulfured and not desulford

62
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:56,479
molasses and if you can't wrap your

63
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:58,158
brain around that one

64
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:00,719
then i don't want to talk to you about

65
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:03,199
the differences between an extraction

66
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:05,680
and using solvents

67
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:08,079
a pressing that goes back at least 3 000

68
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,519
years you know whatever

69
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,640
i'll get off myself how do you feel

70
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,560
about

71
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:14,719
uh how do you feel about um like like

72
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,039
power side the the ortho silicic acids

73
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:19,439
and and and monolithic acids stuff

74
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,959
that's not from potassium silicate

75
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,719
you know to be honest with you i'm a

76
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,439
real minimalist

77
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,560
um if you looked at my recipe

78
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,479
uh

79
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,400
the biggest criticism is well there's no

80
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,158
there there well it's all in the worm

81
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,439
castings

82
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:35,840
you know i don't

83
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:38,079
look i think everybody should

84
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,920
recycle their kitchen waste if you don't

85
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,840
do that you should have to be forced to

86
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:43,839
listen to some tv show that's really

87
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,120
horrible or something

88
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,439
but it's not going to give you a worm

89
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,680
casting it's too much water and as much

90
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:52,400
as those worms are they can't turn water

91
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,080
into castings yeah so you need bulk and

92
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,039
that comes from either

93
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,640
aged manure and by that we mean five to

94
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:00,959
six weeks

95
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,919
to allow the

96
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,158
um

97
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:06,479
vermicides that are given livestock for

98
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:09,039
like we do dogs you worm them right yeah

99
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,878
well those vermicides kill

100
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,798
the good guys in our worm bins you need

101
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:14,639
to let that sit for about five to six

102
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,720
weeks and they'll degrade

103
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,959
into a form

104
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,759
into its basic uh

105
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,160
ionic structure if that makes sense

106
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,319
yeah so it's no longer a verbicide it's

107
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,680
carbon and hydrogen and oxygen and all

108
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:29,599
those good things

109
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,199
so we want to use that that gives us

110
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,680
bulk

111
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,919
and that's how you make good castings

112
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,959
it's it's through bulking yeah without

113
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:40,959
the stuff that had there's some

114
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:43,680
i'll leave it at that yes

115
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,799
good good cat a good uh bedding that's

116
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,759
been

117
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,879
uh

118
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,319
elevated with uh nutrient dense

119
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:52,719
materials like

120
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:55,599
small amounts of alfalfa meal

121
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,880
uh kelp meal i like to run neem and

122
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,560
karanja

123
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,399
this might you might find interesting

124
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,560
karanja is actually

125
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:07,120
a legume it's it's closer to a uh

126
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,038
alfalfa plant than it is the neem tree

127
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,800
which is a mahogany

128
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:12,800
and the properties in those two

129
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,639
materials couldn't be more different

130
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,400
there's no shared

131
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,319
constituents as a directon comes from

132
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:22,079
neem and

133
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:25,038
hungamia oil

134
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:27,519
comes from karanja i'm not familiar with

135
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:29,680
karaja what what what is that used for

136
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:31,839
well in india it's the preferred one for

137
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,800
medicines for uh

138
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:34,959
uh

139
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,960
skin products uh

140
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:39,839
and india has some of its own race

141
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:42,159
issues the beliefs that lighter colored

142
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,399
citizens are more intelligent than

143
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,360
darkerness said to be used to lighten

144
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:48,638
the skin tone i know that it can

145
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,840
uh

146
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,600
but if you if you went into an indian

147
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:55,198
market and went to the haba section

148
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,720
everything would have either neem or

149
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:01,199
quarantine you know shampoo toothpaste

150
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,800
um but over here if you get touched with

151
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,720
dean you're gonna fall over dead or

152
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,720
something or

153
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,080
you know you can't go to the rose parade

154
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,440
or something i don't know

155
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:10,879
but um

156
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:11,759
yeah i mean

157
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:13,839
uh

158
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,160
means but if you looked at the ayurvedic

159
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:18,239
medical system you know you have the tcm

160
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,039
traditional chinese india has the

161
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,840
ayurvedic and 72

162
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:24,800
of the uh

163
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:27,279
bottled

164
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,000
compounds you know um

165
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:32,399
elixirs and stuff 72

166
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,360
have some part of the neem tree root

167
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:34,478
bark

168
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,919
leaf

169
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,680
oil

170
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:40,639
um

171
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,800
and it's behind the tulsi

172
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,639
basil which is a forerunner of all

173
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,478
basils like the

174
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:50,478
wolf is to the our canine friends

175
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:53,839
well this one okay it's the most holy

176
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:56,639
plant in india is the tulsi

177
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:57,598
and then neem is the second one

178
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,160
so

179
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:01,598
anyway there you go at all

180
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,280
look up there

181
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:04,478
research.ca

182
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:06,959
uh

183
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:09,038
is nothing to do with gardening nothing

184
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:11,918
okay it's all about human health uh

185
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:15,120
diabetes uh

186
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:17,839
uh viruses uh all kinds of things you

187
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,879
can rub the oil on your feet

188
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:21,279
as a

189
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,079
cure or a prevention of athlete's foot

190
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:24,478
if you

191
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:26,079
do a lot of uh running or you know

192
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:28,639
whatever

193
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:32,800
so yeah it's been around for 5 000 years

194
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:34,800
but suddenly 18 months ago became a

195
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:40,160
you know point of discussion at uh

196
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:43,280
canacon and uh yeah endo expo you know

197
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,720
it's just silly you know whatever

198
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:46,719
all this is appreciated there's people

199
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,280
asking all kinds of questions uh go

200
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,440
ahead i don't mean to dominate there but

201
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:52,799
oh no worries no worries i'm enjoying it

202
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:55,680
um let's see

203
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,478
why my why is my worm casting running

204
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,400
hot and sodium and then uh and you think

205
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,240
i can push out sodium with calcium

206
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:05,918
gypsum

207
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:09,120
no because uh gypsum is simply uh

208
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:11,279
oh calcium sulfate and it's calcium in

209
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,680
its elemental form whereas the calcium

210
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:17,758
we get in say limestone

211
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,759
or uh oyster shell that's calcium

212
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,598
calcium carbonate

213
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,280
so there's one

214
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:26,399
calcium ion

215
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:28,318
there's one carbon ion and then three

216
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:31,038
oxygen ions

217
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,038
and calcium carbonate but in this

218
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:34,399
in gypsum you're getting calcium by

219
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:37,519
itself

220
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,120
and then you get sulfur oxide which is

221
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:43,200
water soluble

222
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:45,120
yeah and so what and like let's say

223
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,480
you're using core

224
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,320
uh

225
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,240
one thing that has to be

226
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,278
you know acknowledged is that it's an

227
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,120
inert

228
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:54,958
medium that's why it's

229
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,080
preferred if you're going to use salts

230
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:57,359
but

231
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,080
in a uh

232
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,919
organic soil it's a nightmare

233
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,160
yes what you want to do the big one

234
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:05,838
that's missing is sulfur and without

235
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:08,000
sulfur

236
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,080
the sulfur is at the base of almost

237
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,679
every metabolical function on this

238
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,320
planet including the production of

239
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:16,159
terpenes terpenoids and ketones so it'd

240
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,959
be a really good idea

241
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:21,360
i'm using corn i can't get any of flavor

242
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:25,359
and i don't get any aroma

243
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:27,600
okay put a half a cup of uh gypsum

244
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,519
you know and say a cubic foot and there

245
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,200
you go you're dancing

246
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,320
yeah yeah that's something i had to

247
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,000
learn on my own too to add add sulfur

248
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,399
some kind of sulfur too too because i

249
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,399
use core that's all i use right so i

250
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,799
like a mix i like to add in a calcium

251
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,720
carbonate like limestone or oyster shell

252
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:47,120
it doesn't matter the same thing

253
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,440
and then a little bit of gypsum so i'm

254
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,759
getting my elemental calcium along with

255
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,959
my calcium carbonate and then i'm also

256
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:55,039
picking up

257
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:56,879
uh some gypsum

258
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:58,799
so i think that's that's a good balance

259
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:00,799
if you i don't like using this term but

260
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:03,120
a liming agent if you will

261
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:05,359
yeah for like a better one

262
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,759
okay we have a request here on um the

263
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,278
history of the strain the one which is

264
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:13,679
one i've been fascinated with for a long

265
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:16,159
time myself okay uh pretty simple um

266
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:19,359
in laguna beach in the late 60s and

267
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:21,278
early 70s before

268
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,639
the whole lsd thor and sunshine thing

269
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:23,519
took them apart

270
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:25,919
you know

271
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,679
it's one thing to taunt a dog behind the

272
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,000
fence with a stick but you don't want to

273
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:31,599
do that with the federal government yeah

274
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,958
that's especially when listening in

275
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,000
containers

276
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:38,399
contains like a patch

277
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,759
okay those are like 48 000 you know i

278
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,759
mean

279
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:43,439
these guys weren't just a dude

280
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:46,639
we got to see the dude and get some

281
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,480
stash tonight you know this is like

282
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:50,000
you know you gotta bite even then 10

283
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,079
kilos to even

284
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,480
communicate but anyway

285
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:58,399
so the seeds came a lot of the guys

286
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:00,879
because they're in the bl there was like

287
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,240
it had to be 13 right 13 original

288
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:04,240
founding members

289
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,560
yeah that was a good one okay yeah and

290
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,399
so seven were part of this ragtag

291
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:10,159
motorcycle club

292
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,839
that used to hang out this really weird

293
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:16,319
bar not far from disneyland

294
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:20,399
uh they were just you know

295
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:23,200
drinkers and you know like rowdy bikers

296
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:26,480
it was the 60s man so

297
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,640
there was also this group of surfers

298
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,560
in the mid 60s that were traveling

299
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,879
around the world as

300
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:35,679
it was easy to do

301
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:38,159
maybe easier than today and when surfing

302
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:40,319
in the surfing spots all had

303
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:41,919
somebody there with good wheat so they

304
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,120
started bringing some good weed back

305
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:44,159
because they knew how to pass their

306
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,919
boards

307
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:48,319
so they could make a hole in the board

308
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:50,879
and stash in a pound or two

309
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,959
and so that's then the two got together

310
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:56,439
and then the whole thing so

311
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:59,359
the seed that i had were from kandahar

312
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:01,040
1970. and i don't know exactly who

313
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,320
brought him in

314
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:03,519
the whole

315
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,680
story

316
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,959
okay so then i went off to the army and

317
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:08,799
got drafted

318
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:10,559
kicking and screaming to send the women

319
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:12,799
and children first

320
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,879
um but off to save the world and make it

321
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:18,399
safer democracy

322
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,399
so it came back and uh

323
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:25,278
in the december of 1976 the first

324
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,519
thai stakes came in okay and they came

325
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:30,480
in uh 10 kilo

326
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,600
bales 20 of those pounds were

327
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,480
sticks

328
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,159
and

329
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,278
since emilia was still two or three

330
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:38,480
years away

331
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:40,480
so they were seedy is all get out

332
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,159
and uh there was then two pounds of

333
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,480
loose buds that of course had to be

334
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:47,360
renamed the buddha buds

335
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:50,240
yeah yeah i've heard of that yeah okay

336
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,680
so those seeds became the first crop i

337
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,839
ever did that summer in 77

338
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:57,679
and there was no growth stores there was

339
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,519
no new program

340
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:01,278
i don't not even sure

341
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,759
i even would know what to do if i had a

342
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:05,519
bottle of maxi or miracle grow or

343
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:07,519
whatever you know

344
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,759
yeah but i understood that you had to

345
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:12,078
water plants and that was it for the

346
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:14,480
banking loss you could walk into a car

347
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:16,879
dealer and buy four

348
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,759
celicas if you want and

349
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:21,759
pay cash and it was no big deal yeah

350
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:22,720
later in the reagan administration you

351
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,439
know

352
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,759
yeah

353
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,120
just saying no that crowd

354
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:31,039
so uh

355
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,039
so that was a female and

356
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,399
there were 10 plants that were selected

357
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,399
out of this mass

358
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:44,240
i'm not a breeder so if i told you you

359
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:46,240
guys be laughing so this was like

360
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,079
climbed by the seat of my pants just be

361
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,399
reliant about it you know well that's

362
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:52,000
early on though no one was really

363
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,399
well there were no companies and the

364
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,799
guys in california were still dinking

365
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,679
around with goofy names you know

366
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:02,240
yeah um i had a couple but

367
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,359
i would have named that's another story

368
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,039
um

369
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,560
so

370
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:09,919
that one uh the way it got the name was

371
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:11,838
that

372
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:15,039
they were all against the wall and they

373
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:17,040
went from sativa over to

374
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:19,599
afghani dominant

375
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:21,679
which i had no interest in at all

376
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,399
so i just said okay the one over here is

377
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:26,719
mine and so oh so it's like the one huh

378
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,720
no it's like the one over here is mine

379
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,240
okay and that became a running joke you

380
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,600
know he still does the one yeah still

381
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,000
got the one

382
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,600
and uh

383
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,278
so that's just like you know it has

384
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,759
nothing to do with i thought it was like

385
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:42,320
oh yeah it's like the one no i've had

386
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:43,519
the one that came from sri lanka and i

387
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,440
didn't want to

388
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,519
ever smoke weed again

389
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,720
it was like that far out you know it was

390
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,600
like yeah

391
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,360
some hindus i mean real hindu not

392
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,720
you know he picked it up in new delhi i

393
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,959
mean like in the cush valley or

394
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,440
something you know from the saudis yeah

395
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:02,399
so that's all they you know no big deal

396
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,240
and um but ironic is

397
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,919
that i've given that way i've never sold

398
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,839
a clone in my life

399
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:13,519
the last time i sold a seed was 77

400
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:15,360
uh that's early that is early yeah i

401
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,078
take ty seeds you know because i had

402
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,680
them

403
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:19,519
yeah because

404
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:21,679
i learned early on that if i was going

405
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,679
to take the risk of

406
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:26,399
being a

407
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:28,559
serious consumer cannabis that you might

408
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,759
as well do the good stuff

409
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:34,078
so i would sell like

410
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:37,039
i know you think i'm not but say i would

411
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:38,958
get fronted like a ton or two of uh

412
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:41,278
colombia

413
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:42,958
from guys in uh

414
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:45,759
detroit with way too many vowels in

415
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,758
their last name

416
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,639
they'd give you like two months to turn

417
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,879
it

418
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,278
yes so our motto was i don't want to own

419
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:56,720
it i just want to fingerprint it meaning

420
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:58,639
you know bump it 25 30 bucks

421
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,240
yep and just keeps it you know so then i

422
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,799
would turn around and go buy like

423
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:06,079
premium mishma khan

424
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:08,639
or yahaka o'hakan spears were personal

425
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:10,399
and he went to sears got a deep freezer

426
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,680
so i could freeze it

427
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,198
you know so i could buy three or four

428
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,758
pounds you know that kind of stuff

429
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:18,000
that's [ __ ] awesome yeah so that was

430
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,919
yeah you know can i just say one thing

431
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,078
about skunk number one

432
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:24,078
sure i mean going back to the like

433
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:27,039
original mid 80s

434
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:29,278
yeah i don't get it

435
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:30,799
what do you mean

436
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:32,399
as far as like why it's called skunk in

437
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:34,319
the first place i

438
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,799
you know it's like

439
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,320
i just don't get the whole thing about

440
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:41,519
it

441
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:44,000
i mean why like it's that desirable

442
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,078
oh okay now i understand that one okay

443
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,399
okay i can i can understand that one

444
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:50,559
okay it's like yeah

445
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,240
yeah one of my favorites somebody will

446
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:54,719
give me a

447
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,360
bud to try what do you think

448
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:01,360
now it says

449
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,360
so did you clone this more than twice

450
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,519
why

451
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:07,919
yeah it's made it through three rounds

452
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:09,599
but yeah i mean yeah come on

453
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,199
uh

454
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,279
one nice thing about growing an old

455
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,919
strain

456
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:17,918
is that you really can test the soil

457
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,000
because you can't test this off oh this

458
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,600
time i'm gonna do

459
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,199
i don't know skittles or piddles or

460
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,678
whatever it's called right

461
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,279
um yeah yeah okay and then you over here

462
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,960
well i'm gonna try this syrup but i'm

463
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:31,759
gonna use

464
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,679
i know cookies or whatever the thing is

465
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:35,279
you know whatever the hot button is

466
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,679
but with me

467
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:38,558
i mean i can tell you by day 24

468
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,080
uh

469
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:41,440
i'm not going to finish this i

470
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:43,678
appreciate

471
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,080
you let me try it but you know

472
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,519
best wishes uh go back to the drawing

473
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:49,759
board

474
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:52,720
so

475
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:53,919
that and so in my opinion which means

476
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,319
nothing

477
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:59,679
is that at least if i test something for

478
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:03,200
you i can give you a an accurate

479
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:06,480
comparison analysis of one

480
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,440
uh that i've you know grown like forever

481
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,120
yeah

482
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,880
the main reason people don't like mine

483
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:13,359
is that if you really want to get the

484
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,840
full you know

485
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:17,038
twilight zone theme comes on right here

486
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:19,519
um

487
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:20,879
you got to do at least 12 if not 14

488
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,319
weeks

489
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,240
and here's the best part this is the

490
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:26,720
part i love the best

491
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,679
i've taken at 18 weeks just to see what

492
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,200
it would take to get the trikes to turn

493
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,080
even cloudy

494
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,240
it doesn't ever happen never

495
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,759
so you're never going to get the amber

496
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,880
forget that one

497
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:40,480
all right yeah

498
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,120
let alone cloudy

499
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,038
no never goes cloudy even outdoors like

500
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:46,959
seven months where you like southern

501
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:49,519
california where you can take it through

502
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:52,240
november into december

503
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:55,279
yeah it never no it never goes cloudy

504
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,558
that has to be the highland tie that has

505
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:59,038
to be

506
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:01,119
i would think so maybe if you tried like

507
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:03,599
way less light hours like six hours like

508
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:05,678
oh yeah oh yeah i still didn't do it

509
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:08,319
over the years i've done every

510
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,759
i've never when i was uh ignorant

511
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:12,480
got into that well you know you need

512
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:13,279
this bulb okay

513
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,919
uh

514
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,918
yeah right

515
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,720
this bulb will make it finish yeah

516
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:22,319
this bulb will make it faster yeah yeah

517
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,600
right there yeah you need this magic

518
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:25,918
stuff what's in i can't say it's

519
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:28,159
proprietary

520
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,679
excuse me you know

521
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,558
so

522
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,960
but anyway that's

523
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:36,960
that's my you know just a guy that

524
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,640
decided to get into soil real serious

525
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,400
and figure out

526
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,559
i have post on my uh ig feed

527
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,080
of a soil test that i mixed five years

528
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:48,879
ago

529
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:51,678
and it has all the npk it has all the

530
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,960
macro and micro nutrients

531
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,720
and you know we're a little weak in the

532
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,240
microsoft throw some kelp in there

533
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,160
that's why kelp is the perfect one

534
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,200
because it's a plant right

535
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,640
and it accumulates all 83 elements more

536
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,880
importantly in the right value if we

537
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,440
don't go nuts

538
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:11,440
that's adding some kelp will take care

539
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:14,080
of all our micronutrient issues

540
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,159
wow i see i didn't even know that

541
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:18,839
it's the only brown kill makes sense not

542
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:22,000
not blue marine algae not

543
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:25,599
red but a green i mean green red but

544
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,679
brown only brown is the only

545
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:30,079
organism on this planet that creates

546
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,080
algenic acid

547
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:35,759
and i'll just i'll leave you for

548
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:38,240
research on that but you can see why

549
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:41,119
brown kelp has algenic acid seaweed

550
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,880
extract is created by by law under

551
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:45,199
federal

552
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,200
usda regulations has to be created with

553
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,159
either sodium

554
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,960
uh hydroxide or potassium hydroxide the

555
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,080
stuff they use in drano to clean out

556
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,679
your uh

557
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:57,359
drain so they use that and they burn

558
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,280
everything off so what are you left with

559
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:01,038
you're left with powder

560
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:03,200
you got your elements you might as well

561
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:05,599
just do salts see what i mean

562
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,080
yeah all the life force is gone

563
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:10,558
yeah but it's convenient

564
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:12,879
but a convenience that

565
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:14,798
is detrimental to your soil in my

566
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,280
opinion

567
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:20,000
i don't want to put a fungicide

568
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:22,319
in my soil after i've spent

569
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,880
several months building up the nutrient

570
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:27,759
yeah and fungal profile in my compost

571
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,919
before i ever hit a warm bin

572
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:31,839
um can i ask you

573
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,919
are you self-researched and you just you

574
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:36,319
just delved into it hardcore and learned

575
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:39,360
it all on your own are you are you

576
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:40,879
oh no no no no i'm academically yeah i

577
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:43,199
was going to say this is pretty pretty

578
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,760
heavy academic stuff yeah but the real

579
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,159
stuff is that you have to do it

580
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:51,279
you have to get your hands dirty there's

581
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,799
no bottle solution there's hey it's it's

582
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:55,759
hard work and if you want to have

583
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:57,679
scratch in the game

584
00:21:55,759 --> 00:22:00,240
you got to do it

585
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,720
and be consistent don't

586
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,159
don't be my phone because we released my

587
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,240
product today

588
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:09,200
oh good hey there it's patty the one

589
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:12,400
with uh how you doing malted barley

590
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,798
malted or heirloom corn and uh hemp

591
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,480
seeds and where can people get this oh

592
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:18,480
build a soil it's called don't laugh

593
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,279
like this i named it so i don't know i

594
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,679
want to sound cool uh gnarly barley

595
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:26,158
gnarly barley yes fifty percent uh

596
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,960
barley and it's uh thirty 30

597
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,919
corn that's for the cytokinins

598
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,480
yeah

599
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,640
and then the hemp

600
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,360
which i can spend a couple days

601
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,280
explaining all the enzymes and compounds

602
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:40,879
well you know from

603
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:42,639
it kind of goes like this if it works

604
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,880
good on a plant it's probably good for

605
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,799
you and vice versa

606
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,880
that's interesting

607
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:51,119
ouch

608
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,080
the benefits from the hemp seed

609
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:55,918
and all all multi means means nothing

610
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:56,798
more than this it means that you took a

611
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,480
seed

612
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:01,038
and you germinated it

613
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,038
and then you arrested it about 116

614
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:05,279
fahrenheit but that does

615
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:08,240
it leaves the uh

616
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:09,839
enzymes intact so we call that diastatic

617
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,440
mold

618
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:13,678
now if we take that

619
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,600
mold after it's dried and ready to store

620
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,919
you give you a shout out and we uh

621
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:19,519
caramelize it

622
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,759
for flavor

623
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:23,759
or aroma for ales and what have you

624
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:26,158
that's great

625
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:29,279
but it kills all the enzymes so now we

626
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:31,760
call that non-diastatic malt and if you

627
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:33,519
use non-diastatic malt in your beer

628
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:36,640
formula

629
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:38,558
then you need to add

630
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,960
the diastatic mold because you can't

631
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:42,558
make beer without amylase is the main

632
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,840
player

633
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:48,960
uh enzyme in the barley but that's not

634
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:50,399
what we benefit from

635
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,640
can i explain this because this is

636
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,600
really important

637
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,520
so all plants produce chitinase

638
00:23:55,599 --> 00:24:01,678
and chitin

639
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:04,879
itself is an acetyl form of glucosamine

640
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:07,440
okay all seashells contain

641
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:10,320
are made up from limestone

642
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:13,278
or calcium carbonate okay okay but the

643
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:14,319
crustaceans the the crab the lobster the

644
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:15,759
shrimp

645
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:19,359
and i guess that would also include the

646
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:21,519
one in the south uh crawdads yeah have

647
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:23,759
chitin

648
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:26,319
and kyden for example you had surgery

649
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:28,640
either oral or external they probably

650
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:32,639
showed you up with kite and string

651
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,919
okay um that goes back to like the 1880s

652
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,038
this has really got an instant

653
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:39,600
connection so in 1922 this young man by

654
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:42,960
the name of albert hoffman graduates

655
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:48,240
from cologne university and his paper is

656
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:50,000
on the molecular structure of chitin

657
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,599
and then

658
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:57,200
21 years later he would introduce

659
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:59,038
or find lsd 25 and then 15 years after

660
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,798
that he was commissioned to do the

661
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:02,798
research on these

662
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:04,240
mushrooms out of uh

663
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:06,079
oaxaca

664
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,278
and he's the one that gave the name to

665
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:12,240
the two compounds psilocybin and silicon

666
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:13,599
so in a 15-year period here he does lsd

667
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,960
25

668
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:19,599
read his book lsd my problem child

669
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:22,640
there you go write it down right book

670
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:25,359
and then anyway so

671
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:28,720
the only thing that can deconstruct

672
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:31,678
microbially that can deconstruct

673
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,440
a polysaccharide uh

674
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,080
is fungi

675
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:38,640
bacteria in their weak attempt to try to

676
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:39,839
deconstruct it create an enzyme called

677
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,720
chitinase

678
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:45,359
and chitinase deconstructs eggshells in

679
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,038
the soil

680
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:49,519
so that's kind of cool you don't have to

681
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:51,919
get a poison yeah yeah

682
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:54,079
and then equally important

683
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,600
animal kingdom and plant kingdom have

684
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:58,798
immune systems

685
00:25:55,599 --> 00:26:01,839
and in plants you have like har hormonal

686
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:04,558
acquired resistance and sars

687
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:06,639
systemic acquired resistance and some of

688
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:08,798
them are called pathways the most

689
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:12,240
important pathway in a plant's defense

690
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:15,679
system uh is um

691
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,200
the chitinaya salicylic acid pathway

692
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,400
okay and

693
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,038
every plant

694
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,720
produces uh

695
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:24,798
salicylic gas feeling like an

696
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,440
interaction some plants produce copious

697
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:29,759
amounts like the aloe vera plant

698
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,919
you've probably heard in your career oh

699
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:34,798
you can use willow shoots

700
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,320
oh yeah okay well that's salicylic acid

701
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:38,798
okay and so that's why people would use

702
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:40,879
aloe vera for that's why i know i

703
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:43,679
started that i said look man i'm not

704
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,679
climbing a tree

705
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:48,399
i can go to a mexican market and get a

706
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,880
fresh aloe vera leaf

707
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,679
and you just cut off the spiny stuff on

708
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,480
the sides and you stick your stems in

709
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,480
there

710
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,679
inside the gel let's sit overnight and

711
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,200
the next day

712
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,038
put them in how are we i don't want to

713
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,080
get into that one but how you do your

714
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:07,278
cuts yeah and that salicylic acid

715
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:10,000
creates a barrier uh against pathogenic

716
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:13,440
fungi your molds and all that

717
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,640
i average seriously over 98

718
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:18,399
success using just that and i don't

719
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,559
but that's actually the best one is you

720
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:22,158
can find true

721
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:24,158
like the sign on the side of the road

722
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,080
that says honey so it's never been

723
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,399
touched yeah it's just you straight

724
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:28,398
hunting

725
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,720
yeah

726
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:31,839
wow

727
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,079
yeah

728
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:36,558
i had no clue about that yeah it's

729
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:37,599
really cool but you got to get organic

730
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:39,359
because

731
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:41,119
what they do to honey from the time they

732
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:43,199
pull it from the beehive so i guess in

733
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:45,359
that jar with a little bear you know all

734
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,919
that stuff yeah um

735
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:50,479
it's a sad story you know it's not like

736
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:53,038
the real deal you know yeah

737
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,679
but anyway so that's why if we use

738
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:57,759
malted grains in our soil

739
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,960
the kitinis you don't have to go through

740
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:02,480
the expense of using crab meal

741
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,399
because what you're really after is the

742
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:08,399
chitinase not the chitin

743
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:11,599
yeah so here you get it right in the uh

744
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:13,759
malted grains along with uranus urea

745
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:16,000
protease protein

746
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:18,079
phosphatase what cannabis grower doesn't

747
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,359
obsess about phosphorus right

748
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:22,000
yeah uh

749
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:24,158
much of their arrow usually um yeah

750
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,319
right yeah but you get the idea i mean

751
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:29,120
so there's like 360

752
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:32,398
enzymes in a malted grain

753
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:34,719
so what i can do and have done is i can

754
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:36,158
document okay here are the ends

755
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,440
you could take something out from under

756
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,679
your fingernail and put it in water and

757
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,159
say it's got enzymes

758
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:44,880
oh yeah okay

759
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:47,360
but i can explain each one and how they

760
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,600
work and i'm only taking like 10 out of

761
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:51,918
the 360

762
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:54,000
that are in barley so

763
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:57,520
and then you add corn to the cytokinins

764
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,519
and what that does to

765
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:02,398
between the tip of the root system and

766
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,880
then the uh mary stem

767
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:08,239
at the end of the branches is quite a

768
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,840
phenomenal uh study and the first uh

769
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:15,200
cytokinin was discovered in corn in

770
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:18,319
1937 and the latin name for corn is zia

771
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:20,798
so they named this enzyme zeatin

772
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:23,599
um makes sense yeah so that's and

773
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:25,759
there's other uh there's other pgrs and

774
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:28,558
other things in the corn besides

775
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:32,000
that one enzyme excuse me hormone

776
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:32,000
yeah so anyway

777
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:36,639
i was just thinking botany 101 probably

778
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:38,240
bored your audience there but uh no no i

779
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,720
think everybody's [ __ ] loving it to

780
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,359
be honest with you um i love it

781
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,839
i'd love to have you on anytime you are

782
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:47,519
bored want to come on i i know it's a

783
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:49,038
real treat for me and everyone else so i

784
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,359
really appreciate it because i like

785
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:55,679
talking to uh gardeners

786
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:56,879
instead of a salesman you know yeah man

787
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,960
it's a pleasure

788
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,278
have you ever looked at my feed

789
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,960
your what my feed yeah okay you've seen

790
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:05,119
some of the plants

791
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,159
yes okay i wanted a ten and a half

792
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:08,398
pounder

793
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,480
yes yes don't you think it's a little

794
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:12,239
disingenuous to come on my feet and tell

795
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,038
me what i should be doing

796
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,480
oh my good lord yeah yeah that's

797
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:18,000
everybody's uh everybody knowing that

798
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,880
i'm gonna scholarly

799
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,679
right

800
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,520
yeah sometimes i wanna say is maybe like

801
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,880
do more reading and

802
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:27,119
not so much

803
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,840
editorial stuff you know until you kind

804
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:28,798
of

805
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:31,199
uh

806
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:33,119
i figured i've been involved in at least

807
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,960
yeah at least 300

808
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:37,439
325

809
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,159
serious gardens in my career

810
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,600
yeah i can imagine so dude

811
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,840
hey the first slice they ever bought was

812
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:46,719
some jor oh yeah he was called george

813
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:48,879
cervantes then before he became jorge

814
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,038
so uh yeah he had a place here in

815
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,440
portland it was one of three grow stores

816
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:55,278
in portland at the time that was it

817
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,840
and uh

818
00:30:55,278 --> 00:31:00,398
we went and bought these uh dutch lights

819
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:02,798
from pl light systems

820
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:04,479
okay i mean the professional stuff i was

821
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:06,798
gonna burn down my house in orange

822
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,798
county california

823
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:10,079
you know trying to grow some weed so we

824
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:12,639
decided

825
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:14,319
there was you know

826
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,960
funding was available i'll leave it at

827
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:20,319
that so uh yeah we decided to set it up

828
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:23,240
first cabin and uh i was using uh what

829
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:25,678
do you call them oh dosatrons

830
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:28,319
30 years ago

831
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:30,720
that's funny yeah and buying like full

832
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:32,960
jugs i think they were five gallons

833
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,120
you have dyna girl and dinah bloom uh

834
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,960
we'd ride down to uh

835
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:38,719
there was some in the bay area like san

836
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,600
jose something like that

837
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,839
yeah and uh so we just put the dosatron

838
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:46,398
inside the jugs

839
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:47,439
and then i had i did the drip system i

840
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:49,599
mean

841
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,840
by today's standard you guys got it made

842
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:55,038
i mean it's all off the shelf and

843
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:57,199
plugging play for the most part you know

844
00:31:55,038 --> 00:32:00,079
we had to kind of like huh

845
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:04,080
so how are we going to do this

846
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:06,639
one time pulling stuff out of the field

847
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:08,639
and staging it next to the pickup trucks

848
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,720
and uh

849
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,840
the guy that was like our leader i

850
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,839
called him op8 our personal

851
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:17,199
hero and in this case i just said some

852
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:20,079
dick have you given a thought where

853
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,519
you're gonna dry this

854
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:22,798
and everybody just looks down at the

855
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:25,599
ground like

856
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:25,599
oh man

857
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:31,519
and we're using bull tacos to go back

858
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,960
into the forest to get the

859
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:36,079
the plants where i can bring them back

860
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,960
and stage them you know

861
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:39,359
so

862
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,480
uh the horizon

863
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:41,918
i know he's friends with some of the

864
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,759
northern lights period did you interact

865
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:45,919
with those guys at all

866
00:32:43,759 --> 00:32:47,759
no not at all because that came out of

867
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,080
what they called the

868
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:51,839
bcga the british columbia growers

869
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:53,918
association

870
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:56,959
and uh

871
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:59,919
the nl came out of canada

872
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,919
on a guy that broke you see the bcga

873
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,679
wasn't going to do business with any of

874
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,320
the two groups that came out of holland

875
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:09,200
the what is now called scentsy seeds

876
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:12,558
then it was called the sssc

877
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,640
and then uh neville and uh his partner

878
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:16,000
uh david yeah

879
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,159
so yeah

880
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,398
they wandered around and everybody had

881
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:22,559
cash you know

882
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:25,599
yeah a briefcase is full of cash and

883
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:26,558
they were buying seeds and cuts

884
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:29,359
so

885
00:33:26,558 --> 00:33:32,319
i think northern light came out from a

886
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:33,678
grower in in canada

887
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:35,439
that

888
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:37,600
said hey man you know you

889
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:40,000
you cut hay when the sun shines you got

890
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:42,158
money i'm selling so uh

891
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,240
that's how the nl thing

892
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,120
went over to uh

893
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,278
uh

894
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:49,038
neville's deal the seed bank that was

895
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:50,880
the only time everybody sees in my life

896
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:53,679
i bought them one time

897
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,519
uh hayes northern lights

898
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,200
and did you find any keepers in it did

899
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,038
you find good stuff in it

900
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,240
i never bought another seat again in my

901
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:01,759
life

902
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,679
that i've you know

903
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:04,960
every story i hear about old older

904
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,120
growers that we're growing the northern

905
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,800
lights hays in its heyday they all have

906
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:11,279
very very fond memories and they talk

907
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,280
about how many keepers were found that

908
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,919
became like one clone only that are

909
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,320
still around nowadays well there is a

910
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:20,239
caveat to my comment i want to make this

911
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,399
is really important here's where you're

912
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:25,918
getting conflicting things

913
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:28,559
in a case that i was indirectly

914
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:31,118
i wasn't involved but

915
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:33,358
i was on the possible list of uh come

916
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:35,119
talk to us

917
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:36,960
back in boston

918
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,358
and

919
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,119
in discovery it came out that the dea

920
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:43,119
and the u.s postal service was

921
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,440
intercepting letters

922
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:47,760
from the seed banks to customers here

923
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,960
and they were switching it out with uh

924
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,960
ditch weed seeds

925
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:57,039
this was in discovery this is what they

926
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,559
came to the you know here's our evidence

927
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:00,400
evidence whatever they call it i'm not

928
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:02,320
an attorney but yeah they'll sit around

929
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,160
before they do lunch or something and

930
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,920

00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,519
and this thing that we know because we

954
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,639
know who brought him into the united

955
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:56,880
states

956
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:58,960

and who who had possession of them and

958
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,358
everything else so

959
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,519
i don't have a lot of confidence

960
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:08,159
one breeder here

961
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:10,480

963
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,719
in those little jars with you know uh

964
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,560

965
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:19,118
gram or half an ounce

970
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,639
they were going to hire me as a

971
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,639
consultant and uh

972
00:36:28,639 --> 00:36:33,039

industry is like that too the whole hemp

1029
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:27,599
industry i i just made my my entrance

1030
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,838
into the hemp industry last year and i

1031
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:32,320
was shocked at how many people

1032
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:34,239
are playing grower in that i really

1033
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,680
thought i never [ __ ] with it i figured

1034
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:36,559
there are people that are that are

1035
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:37,838
better

1036
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:39,519
than i would be at doing it because

1037
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:41,119
they've been studying specifically hemp

1038
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:43,119
longer working with it longer i figured

1039
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:45,200
they had that [ __ ] [ __ ] dialed in and

1040
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,640
boy was i confused when i got in there

1041
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:48,799
and saw the people were just playing

1042
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:50,480
constantly playing

1043
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,039
okay i don't know

1044
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,159
oh i know yeah why not wild world

1045
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:56,639

tell you that and you know i mean

1049
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:06,560
