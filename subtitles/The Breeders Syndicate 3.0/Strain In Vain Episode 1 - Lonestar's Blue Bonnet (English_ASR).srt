scene through the eyes of the folks who

5
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:18,320
lived it i'm matthew owner of riot seeds

11
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,719
hey what's up everyone i'm going to

12
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:38,799
record a short here um one of the

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,480
questions i get asked

14
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:42,839
the most often

15
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,959
is what is blue

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,640
bonnet so

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,039
to talk about blue bonnet i have to go

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,359
back quite a few years before to when i

19
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,359
was in san diego and i was working at a

20
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,479
collective called bcc as their grower

21
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,479
there

22
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,398
whenever bud would come in and it had

23
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:59,119
seeds i always told the owner to let me

24
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,120
know

25
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,640
so someone brought in some bud and i

26
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:05,039
looked at it and smelled it and it

27
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,280
smelled like like sweet peanut butter it

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,320
was beautiful um

29
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,478
i it was super frosty had seeds in it so

30
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:15,438
i was like hey i'm gonna you know snake

31
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,879
some of these seeds out and uh

32
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:18,319
what did they bring this in as and he's

33
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,399
like well we haven't labeled strawberry

34
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:21,839
cough but he brought it in as blueberry

35
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,600
and i remember putting that in the back

36
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,359
of my head thinking there's no way this

37
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:26,879
is blueberry this is this is peanut

38
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:28,799
butter this is silly

39
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,719
so anyways um

40
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,159
cut to a few months later i'm going

41
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:33,759
through my stuff and i'm like oh maybe

42
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,439
i'll pop some of those peanut buttery

43
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,840
seeds see what comes out

44
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:40,959
so i pop a bunch of them and out comes

45
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,719
one in one of them the most beautiful

46
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:44,879
purple

47
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:47,359
blueberry smelling

48
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:49,280
plant i'd ever seen

49
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:51,280
this is what i referred to as the riot

50
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,599
berry from then on out and i worked this

51
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,079
line for several generations

52
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:57,599
sold every single seed i had of it it

53
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:00,239
bred true for purple traits and the

54
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:02,798
blueberry uh it was like blueberry jam

55
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,959
blueberry compo terps but the problem

56
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,840
was is the resin production was kind of

57
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,159
low

58
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,560
and the potency wasn't really

59
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,878
recreationally viable

60
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,400
so like if people were smoking it for

61
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:16,079
nerve pain and stuff it was it was

62
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,680
killer it was the only thing that helped

63
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,160
like a tooth abscess for me back in the

64
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,400
day when nothing helped

65
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,159
um yeah so i had great pain relieving

66
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,840
qualities but it just

67
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,120
was pretty worthless for recreational

68
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,280
potency

69
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,280
um cut to several years later i lose my

70
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,878
clone that i've selected from this i

71
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,000
lose everything

72
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:37,598
i sell everything you know it just it it

73
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,360
occurs that i end up with nothing but

74
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:43,199
the bx1 seeds left and the bx1 seeds

75
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,280
unfortunately

76
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,719
weren't a success in the way that i

77
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,400
would have liked them to be if

78
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,560
something's a bx1 i'm usually back

79
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,039
crossing for a specific trade the goal

80
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,318
in that was to back cross just for the

81
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,639
blueberry

82
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:56,639
and

83
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,000
and

84
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,158
yeah the blueberry traits and the purple

85
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,680
but it didn't happen

86
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:04,400
you can get a lot of different berries

87
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,000
in there

88
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,879
in the vx1

89
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,479
um

90
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:10,878
but you can't

91
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,158
it's it's a hit or miss on the the berry

92
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:14,719
and it should have been it should have

93
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:17,280
been better so what i chose to outcross

94
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:18,959
was not ideal

95
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,318
so i decided you know what like i have a

96
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,239
massive blueberry collection i've

97
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:23,839
collected blueberry over all the years

98
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,439
um even while i was working the wright

99
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,280
berry stuff i was still collecting every

100
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,919
blueberry line i saw buying every

101
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,280
blueberry line i saw no matter how old

102
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:35,759
or from when or from where i bought it

103
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,598
so i decided to run a bunch of these uh

104
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:39,199
to look for a good blueberry breeding

105
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:41,439
female

106
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:43,039
and what i ended up finding was

107
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:45,919
the most amazing

108
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:47,359
breeding male that i've encountered in

109
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:49,439
my whole career

110
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,599
i genuinely think right now

111
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:54,000
looking back pre

112
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:56,158
me using the blue bonnet

113
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,400
like i i don't think anything came close

114
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,399
to to what was achieved with this now

115
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,920
blue bonnet itself

116
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,799
i had heard about

117
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,919
um

118
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,599
while i was doing my right berry

119
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:08,000
projects so i wasn't really paying much

120
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:09,679
attention to to what was going on um

121
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,519
with other people's blueberry you know

122
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,560
because i was like my shit's the best

123
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,360
what the [ __ ] do i need another

124
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,839
blueberry for whatever you know like i

125
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,079
had uh blue clones come by like the the

126
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,239
dabney blue um

127
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,800
different different dj short blueberry

128
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,759
selections um

129
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,680
but yeah no bluebonnet

130
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,120
bluebonnet i i had just heard all this

131
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,439
stuff about that it was a great

132
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,879
blueberry muffin string you know for

133
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,959
those terps and it was it was pretty

134
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:39,680
true for that so i kept that in my

135
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:42,000
memory bank and um

136
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,240
yeah when i went to go pop seeds bodhi

137
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,879
passed it to me now it was made by lone

138
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,280
star lone star is no longer with us uh

139
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:50,319
rest in peace he owned texas resin

140
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,478
company

141
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:54,560
uh the original name for it was the

142
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:55,680
texas super blue

143
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,160
um

144
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,240
and it later became blue bonnet because

145
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,960
you know he's from texas it's the state

146
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,079
flower this is a beautiful flower you

147
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:05,519
know

148
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:06,879
that's i guess that's where he was going

149
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:09,918
with it

150
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:11,439
what i could find um from him talking

151
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:15,198
about it he said that he had gotten an

152
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:17,680
already worked line of dj shorts

153
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,080
blueberry so someone had taken dj

154
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,160
short's work worked it and then lone

155
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:24,000
star worked it further he didn't really

156
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,240
see how many generations was in between

157
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,720
there and there

158
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,280
and it's so it's supposed to be a pure

159
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,560
dj blueberry selected for those traits

160
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,000
however

161
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,160
however

162
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,918
after crossing it to many things running

163
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,880
out every single line that we crossed it

164
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:41,758
to

165
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:43,759
i am fully convinced that that this blue

166
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,680
bonnet plant is

167
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,439
it's either an anomaly

168
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,240
of all all blueberry that exists

169
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,319
or

170
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,199
it was outcrossed at some point to

171
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:58,159
something very potent and very resinous

172
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,478
and somehow still true breeding for the

173
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,800
blueberry terps it doesn't have a lot of

174
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:04,000
the mutations that blueberry passes and

175
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,840
if it were

176
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,319
just a worked on outcrossed blueberry

177
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:13,279
several generations in past djs it would

178
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:16,800
be more inbred and you'd see a lot more

179
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:19,279
of the nasty recesses pop up

180
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,079
yeah i don't see any of that it breeds

181
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:25,679
true for potency for high terpene

182
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:27,839
content like the terpene percentage

183
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,000
the blueberry terps are very very

184
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,918
dominant in almost everything it crosses

185
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,639
to except for super skunk for some

186
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:37,120
reason super skunk stuff is is is

187
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,720
resistant to it a little bit um

188
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,720
with that said everything i crossed it

189
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,199
to that had super skunk in it did show

190
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,680
some modicum of berry it's just almost

191
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,439
all the other lines you'd find only

192
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,280
berry phenos in them even if it was an

193
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:50,719
outcross to you know

194
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:53,038
something else

195
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,240
like like our cherry aka blue bonnet you

196
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:58,399
could find only blueberry phenos um

197
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,160
yeah so that that's the the short

198
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,389
history on the blue bonnet it's supposed

199
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,919
to be a worked dj line

200
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:06,719
[Music]

201
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:08,159
i think it's a worked out crossed and

202
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,080
worked further

203
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,599
which actually means that they did more

204
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:15,120
work

205
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:16,959
than they're even intimating

206
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,160
and it took more talent

207
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:20,879
than their

208
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,319
intimating so it's an odd situation and

209
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,319
i'm not sure

210
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,280
if it's just

211
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,680
just that one anomaly that happens to

212
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:31,038
be the sport that breeds true for all

213
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,800
these traits

214
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:33,839
doesn't breed true for any of the inbred

215
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,759
traits

216
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:39,598
i just don't know

217
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:41,598
but what i did find was the best male

218
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:42,879
cannabis plant that i have ever worked

219
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:45,519
with in my life

220
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:48,560
it was incredibly true breeding so i

221
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:50,399
could easily predict how each plant

222
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,399
each plant that i was familiar with as

223
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:55,038
far as the clone mothers that i was

224
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:57,359
crossing it to i could easily predict

225
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:59,680
what the outcomes would be i almost

226
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,639
always knew visually everything it was

227
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,519
it was

228
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,519
um

229
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:04,878
it was pretty uncanny the one that i

230
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:07,120
didn't

231
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,919
i didn't predict would be probably one

232
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,918
of the best in the whole thing was a um

233
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:14,639
a banana punch cut i had that skunk deck

234
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:17,359
selected from symbiotic genetics work

235
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,478
and it was banana og purple punch and it

236
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,680
was like a a grape now a later

237
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:24,959
kind of smell

238
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,038
um big yield super frosty and you know i

239
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:28,560
wasn't i wasn't very well versed with

240
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:30,478
purple punch at the time so i was just

241
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,759
like oh that's supposed to be that weak

242
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:33,199
plant you know like the one that's not

243
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,320
very potent that people like well i have

244
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,120
this clone i'll just stick it in the

245
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,120
[ __ ] corner whatever

246
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,519
whatever happened with the blue bonnet

247
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:47,039
and the purple punch

248
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:48,159
the tests the th ranges are all 22 to 35

249
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,439
now

250
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:52,319
we all know that labs differ and range

251
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,440
on

252
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,920
what they'll

253
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,720
tell you percentage-wise you know you're

254
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:00,479
buying a service the higher percentage

255
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,720
more likely to come back whatever it

256
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,480
still tests very high much higher than

257
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,480
purple punch and much higher than

258
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,560
blueberry

259
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,399
so that's another thing that showed me

260
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:13,119
there's probably an outcross in there

261
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,600
you know packing on resin production too

262
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,440
um but yeah this is this combination of

263
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,040
blueberry and grape

264
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,240
just turned out to be one of the most

265
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:23,278
beautiful

266
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,240
mouth-watering fruity

267
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:25,679
uh

268
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,120
flavors that

269
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:28,719
it's one of the craziest things i've

270
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,120
ever i've ever had

271
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,278
so um yeah i think in the future i'll

272
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,360
probably be doing more work on the line

273
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:38,159
we call punchy bluester which is the

274
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,000
purple punch banana og blue bonnet

275
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,600
um

276
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,600
yeah that will probably be doing more

277
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,240
work on that one the bubble berry which

278
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,120
was the indiana bubble gum blue bonnet

279
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,200
and

280
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,919
um there's a few more we'll probably

281
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,320
touch on in the near future uh if i if i

282
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:58,240
had my druthers i would only ever work

283
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:01,120
on the bluebonnet stuff because

284
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,959
it was just that predictable to breed

285
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,159
with and everything that i'm seeing i

286
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:07,838
love but realistically a lot of people

287
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:10,000
have had a lot of bad experiences with

288
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:13,519
blueberry over the years

289
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,679
and trying to explain to someone how

290
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,679
i

291
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,159
with the assistance of everyone that

292
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,360
came before me lone star

293
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:23,600
dj

294
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,560
we improved the whole blueberry line

295
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,240
together and

296
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,319
it's something that

297
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,159
people who've been soured on blueberry

298
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,360
need to try if you really haven't

299
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:37,838
experienced true blueberry jam

300
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,399
jelly terps it's uh

301
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,920
it's it's wild and i think the more

302
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,440
places that are growing it the more

303
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:45,199
you're going to see it pop up because

304
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,680
these are spitting keepers left and

305
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,040
right so yeah that's that's the blue

306
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,159
bonnet story

307
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:51,599
