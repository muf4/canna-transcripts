up for my beauty rest indeed that i so

13
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,399
desperately need

14
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,558
yeah

15
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:04,000
time to do your hair and everything yeah

16
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:05,438
yeah i had to do my hair as you can see

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,599
oh good people are getting their nl

18
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,519
seeds finally from the shipment all

19
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:10,839
right good deal

20
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:13,759
so

21
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,840
today i i figured we could talk somewhat

22
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,799
i mean i made a post earlier this week

23
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,400
um about certain breeder etiquettes and

24
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:22,400
try to get an idea for where people's

25
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,478
minds are at in our community currently

26
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,759
because i mean back in the day

27
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:27,200
there are always a lot of roles but

28
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,519
everybody kind of knew the rules you

29
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,520
know and if you didn't you you'd find

30
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:33,200
out real fast you know

31
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:33,920
several people would be there to correct

32
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,079
you

33
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:40,079
uh if you broke said rules so um it's a

34
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:42,239
little different now i mean you know

35
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:44,639
things are acceptable now that weren't

36
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:48,399
once acceptable at all so i figured we

37
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,478
could go over the old school rules of uh

38
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,280
of breeding and how it's changed over

39
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:53,280
the years a little bit

40
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:59,599
yeah i think some of it too is just

41
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,840
i think uh whatever like the norms are

42
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:03,280
in whatever subculture that you come up

43
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,200
in at the time

44
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,079
you accept those as like the way they

45
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,039
should be

46
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:10,959
yeah and and always should be yeah yeah

47
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,039
and if it's a small enough subculture

48
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,680
like the older people in that subculture

49
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:17,359
will enforce it like you said yeah and

50
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,680
let you know when you're out of line

51
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,400
about something yeah you know so it

52
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,560
there becomes a situation where you know

53
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,640
as as times change i think you know i've

54
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,199
said it before but we we'd sort of

55
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,719
reinvent itself every five or ten years

56
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:33,039
yeah

57
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:35,199
the scene changes not just with seeds

58
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:36,719
obviously but like the whole like what

59
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,238
drives what

60
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:39,439
the whole shebang and so it's almost

61
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,680
like

62
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:44,318
people have to learn it all over again

63
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,200
yeah or what parts of it survive in a

64
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:47,280
way

65
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:48,560
yeah it's the most common question i'm

66
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,519
asked um

67
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,759
when i do the the live solo is like hey

68
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,439
is this allowed is this okay because i

69
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,598
think generally speaking most people

70
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,719
don't want to step on toes but not

71
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:03,518
everybody it's not it's not common sense

72
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:05,359
a lot of it isn't common sense at all

73
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,599
and to some degree it's like one it's

74
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,519
kind of like uh

75
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:11,039
i don't know you know it's kind of like

76
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,560
you know putting the putting the

77
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,000
shopping cart back

78
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,680
in the parking lot

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,800
yeah there's no you don't get in trouble

80
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,879
if you don't

81
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,680
yeah it's true there's no there's no

82
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:23,120
enforcement mechanism

83
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,360
it might be the right thing to do and it

84
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,959
might make that teenage kid's job easier

85
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,159
going out there and pushing carts or

86
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,400
whatever but you can like leave it

87
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:32,239
wherever the [ __ ] you want and so yeah

88
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,920
that's what happens in weed too is

89
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,200
because there is no enforcement

90
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:39,359
mechanism yeah the black market is you

91
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:41,199
know or the traditional market or

92
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,200
whatever you might want to call weed you

93
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,598
know it's in various states in various

94
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,119
conditions in various places

95
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:48,959
you know um

96
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,719
but there is not really an enforcement

97
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,719
mechanism no

98
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,878
other than public shame

99
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:57,759
which only works on some people

100
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:59,518
it used to be more effective too

101
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,759
yeah but there's some people that they

102
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,200
don't feel guilt or shame either so yeah

103
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:04,878
that's right it's it's never going to

104
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:06,079
work on them anyway

105
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:07,598
yeah

106
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,040
you know

107
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:11,039
and so i don't know i mean there's

108
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:13,280
there's an aspect to it where i

109
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,959
you know matt can talk a bunch about

110
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,199
about this stuff because there's

111
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,759
definitely a lot of etiquette but really

112
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,160
maybe just at the start is like we are

113
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,720
sort of like a small subculture

114
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,520
yeah and we're growing and we're growing

115
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,560
you know

116
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:28,799
and

117
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,478
you know like the subcultures kind of

118
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,720
were all very

119
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:35,279
like very evident on like where you grew

120
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,479
up even before like the internet and

121
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:38,478
communication

122
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:39,839
yeah and then you know once the forums

123
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:41,918
came about which

124
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,599
you know there was a bunch of rules that

125
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:45,359
were established

126
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,840
on how to communicate with one another

127
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,080
and how to act with one another and like

128
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:52,079
if it was self-policing in the way matt

129
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:54,319
said because if someone started doing

130
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:56,159
something super silly a bunch of dms

131
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:57,759
would start shooting around between the

132
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,360
powers that be

133
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,759
and like the culture would sort of

134
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,560
self-regulate yeah the person would be

135
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,919
called out either privately or publicly

136
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,759
you know there would be various things

137
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:09,839
that would happen and

138
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,240
yeah i mean it it would happen very

139
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:13,519
quickly too for the most part

140
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,079
and the other thing i think it's

141
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:18,879
important to say too is that back then

142
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:20,959
there was more like uh gate gate what

143
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:21,839
well how he would you say gatekeepers

144
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:23,519
yeah

145
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:25,839
where like you really couldn't you

146
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,680
couldn't buy cuts back then really

147
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,758
you had to like gain people's trust and

148
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,120
you had to trade and getting seeds and

149
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,479
all that you had to do all this

150
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,639
different stuff so

151
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:36,079
like if you got ostracized by something

152
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,439
or the word spread around that you are

153
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:39,680
unreliable

154
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:42,000
like it made your life a lot harder yeah

155
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,160
it was hard to get good weed hard to get

156
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,478
cuts when you [ __ ] people over it used

157
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,639
to be yeah i mean i just saw archive

158
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:50,159
talking about localized culture i could

159
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,280
this is not about breeding but i'll do

160
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,039
like a quick aside so like in

161
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,599
chicago where i grew up

162
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:59,360
um good weed was really expensive

163
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,360
and so typically like when you smoked a

164
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,720
bong like you would only smoke part of

165
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,000
the green

166
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,520
yeah and then you would turn it and you

167
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
would pass it to your friend and it was

168
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:09,918
like really rude to like burn the whole

169
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,478
top and make it all black each person

170
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:14,318
would try to like carefully only as much

171
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:16,079
as as much as they needed to and you

172
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,520
would rotate that kind butt around and

173
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:19,279
everyone would take three or four hits

174
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:20,478
you know yeah and you get out to

175
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:22,159
california

176
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:23,680
like i did in the late 90s and the

177
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,160
culture out here

178
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,840
you didn't share bong hits you took like

179
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,479
little snappers

180
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:33,038
and that was it nobody turned it where i

181
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:35,120
like i kept like taking a partial hit

182
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:36,639
and like handing the bomb

183
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,038
and nobody nobody

184
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,879
did the same thing no nobody did the

185
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:42,240
same thing you know and then even when i

186
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:44,240
first moved here

187
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,478
uh people didn't use the word dank to

188
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,240
describe weed right around here

189
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:50,800
yeah people thought when i called it

190
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,879
dank that it was like musty

191
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,560
or like i was accusing them of curing it

192
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,079
wrong yeah yeah

193
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,759
right so we don't need to go into all

194
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:59,439
that but but i just mean in the sense

195
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,439
there was these localized things that

196
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:02,399
were normal in your group

197
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:04,319
yeah

198
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,918
and forums and the internet and all that

199
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,759
was like what archive was saying it's

200
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:08,959
like it's sort of like nationalized that

201
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,000
a bit

202
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:13,198
but it also makes it like not in person

203
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,800
yeah

204
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,919
you know which i think is like

205
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,840
it's very impersonal now you know and so

206
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:21,598
i don't know i thought one of the things

207
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:24,638
that's interesting is when matt and i

208
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:26,478
were talking about this subject i sort

209
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,280
of asked a number of our good friends

210
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:28,719
like

211
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:30,318
how many people

212
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,319
that are breeding now do you think

213
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,199
started within the last five to seven

214
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,000
years

215
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,160
yeah

216
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,160
and the answer came back 95

217
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,478
so what that means is that there's just

218
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:44,478
this

219
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:46,000
you know tsunami

220
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:47,918
of new

221
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,598
yeah and so how can the five percent

222
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:52,399
that was doing it before

223
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:53,680
or whatever like how can they train the

224
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:55,758
95

225
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,680
you don't yeah on etiquette and like

226
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,400
what's normal and what's acceptable and

227
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,478
what's cool and what's honorable

228
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,719
yeah right it's a tsunami of [ __ ]

229
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:04,719
[ __ ]

230
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:11,198
sorry i was just reading the chat no

231
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,038
so i mean maybe if you maybe you want

232
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,360
maybe you should i try to not focus on

233
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:17,918
that because i can't like i don't read

234
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,520
it's really [ __ ] hard yeah but maybe

235
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:22,079
you should talk about like some of the

236
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:24,159
etiquette on the forums when you first

237
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:26,800
started getting involved with breeding

238
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,000
and trading and what those norms were

239
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,319
well like

240
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,918
back in the forum days um

241
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,200
i mean it was always obvious to me that

242
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:34,958
you would look for

243
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,399
i mean i think it's a natural thing for

244
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,879
people when you first get into something

245
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,958
first get into a subculture you look for

246
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:42,080
to who the community jen

247
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,199
generally

248
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,480
looks to

249
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,399
to

250
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,159
find direction you know

251
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,120
who do people in the community trust who

252
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:50,559
are the

253
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,039
the the people at the head of the

254
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:55,518
community that when they write everybody

255
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:57,599
responds or pays attention to or

256
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,440
finds finds truth in what they're saying

257
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,040
and that's usually the first step to the

258
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,760
forums and a lot of people learn really

259
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:05,679
quick that it was a lot better too

260
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:08,480
and i ran into this one really quick

261
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:10,399
it's a lot better to listen and learn

262
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,839
than to just start talking and think you

263
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,440
know what you're [ __ ] talking about

264
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,320
and that was that was my biggest step

265
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,440
one uh brick wall was

266
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,959
you learn really quick that you don't

267
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,480
know what the [ __ ] you're talking about

268
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,679
when you when you start getting around

269
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,600
people who have been doing it a long

270
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:24,799
time and i think that's what the forum

271
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,200
offered there were a lot of dudes that

272
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:29,599
were you know been doing it [ __ ] 40

273
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,480
years at that point you know um didn't

274
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,720
necessarily mean they were doing it

275
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,480
right for those 40 years but they at

276
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,399
least had that experience in the

277
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,839
community lasting that long and they

278
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,679
were the ones writing the rules and

279
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,399
that's what we all looked up to from a

280
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:44,479
kid it sounded good yeah i mean going on

281
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,278
the on over girl going going on the

282
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,278
breeders forum and reading arguments

283
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:51,519
going back and forth between sam skunk

284
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:53,278
man and chimera and some different

285
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,278
people that were on there yeah i

286
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:56,958
definitely knew in my early 20s that

287
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:59,039
like boy these people know a lot more

288
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:00,159
than i do right now yeah

289
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:03,120
yeah

290
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:05,439
right like yeah whoa okay now know that

291
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,120
no no not all that was right you know

292
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,680
everyone was arguing different opinions

293
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,720
and stuff but you know it it was a start

294
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:13,679
at least

295
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,839
yeah it was a start to see who is who is

296
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:17,519
kind of knew their [ __ ] and breeding too

297
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,360
because a lot of people you know there

298
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,200
there were there weren't as many people

299
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,120
making seeds and i know people that have

300
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,959
like jumped jumped into this in the past

301
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,039
five years it would be kind of hard to

302
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,719
understand it but like at one point

303
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:32,958
there was you know maybe 50 people

304
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:35,040
worldwide that were doing it to any

305
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:36,239
to any degree that's worth noting you

306
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:38,319
know like

307
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,480
there were always people you know making

308
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,399
random pollen chucks in their tents

309
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,920
trying to sell it through dms but people

310
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,559
that were actually selling it in the

311
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:48,319
marketplace there there's about 50 you

312
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:51,039
know and that's that wasn't that long

313
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:54,320
ago that's you know 10 15 years ago

314
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:56,958
um it's it's way different now the the

315
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,120
options that you have are abundant it's

316
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:01,679
hard to tell who knows what when where

317
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,159
while what hi but you know all of it

318
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:06,799
you can't tell who knows who um it's a

319
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:08,399
lot more confusing the forums aren't as

320
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:11,359
abundant it's not it's not a really

321
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,278
popular medium anymore um

322
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,440
instagram is obviously the way of the

323
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:17,759
land so i mean

324
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,160
yeah anybody can have a big podium now

325
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:22,559
and bark loud enough to make you think

326
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:25,120
they know this [ __ ] there used to be

327
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:25,838
a a much better process for it and it

328
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,839
was

329
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,440
again back then it was a quick way to be

330
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,880
able to [ __ ] blacklist people if

331
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,640
people are stupid you could blacklist

332
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:34,399
them from the community pretty easily

333
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,639
and that's gone

334
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,399
i mean one thing i think that is pretty

335
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,720
massive that

336
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,440
has changed a bunch is that

337
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,320
um you know other than like holland and

338
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,399
canada and maybe a few select people

339
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,760
yeah there really wasn't money in seeds

340
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,240
for a long time

341
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:55,439
yeah so people trading seeds tended to

342
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,200
be breeders or tended to be enthusiasts

343
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,399
or different people that wanted to mess

344
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,639
with them

345
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,799
and like it wasn't it wasn't very easy

346
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:05,278
to buy it wasn't like a marketplace with

347
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:06,958
dms and stuff like that all the time

348
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:09,838
it was more like you had to gain

349
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:11,278
people's trust to get seeds or cuts yeah

350
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,120
and so i think there was sort of like a

351
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:14,240
little bit more of like a slower vetting

352
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,480
process

353
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,879
yeah you know and i think today

354
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,800
um you know people of uh people have

355
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:22,799
monetized it to the point

356
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:24,799
where it's like that's that's the era

357
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:26,958
that most of these people have started

358
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:28,958
yeah you can get your work out there and

359
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:32,078
i think like ig came along at the

360
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:34,000
perfect time to really explode

361
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:36,159
people's ability to get in touch with

362
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,120
other people and even offer up seeds for

363
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:40,958
sale yeah i mean you know you're you

364
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,879
know like even just figuring out how to

365
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:44,799
sell seeds to the public was sketchy

366
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,559
when you started yeah i mean on the

367
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:48,399
forums too like there was pretty strict

368
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:51,199
rules about selling seeds on most of

369
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,039
these forum sites uh through dms and we

370
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,360
all kind of knew like

371
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:57,759
especially those of us who who

372
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,200
ran forums ran some of the forums and

373
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:01,278
admin them

374
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,680
we all kind of knew that everybody had

375
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:05,759
an ability to see those dms and a lot of

376
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:07,759
times people would get shut down you

377
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:09,838
know for selling seeds and dms on these

378
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:12,240
sites because they didn't want the legal

379
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,000
recourse that could come from it so that

380
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,919
was also an issue right because

381
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,519
information exchange is one thing but

382
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:19,120
when you start exchanging money and

383
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,278
illegal things then it's a whole

384
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,360
different movie yeah talking is they're

385
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:25,919
typing and talking is different than

386
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,159
sending and exchanging yeah

387
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:30,719
you know and we should say too that like

388
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:32,078
the you know the first two big forums

389
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,720
that really connected people were

390
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:37,359
overgrown in cannabis world yeah and

391
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,199
they got shut down when a canadian seed

392
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,240
bank that was tied into both of them got

393
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:42,319
raided

394
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,759
yeah

395
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,760
yeah

396
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:48,799
they combined you know

397
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:52,240
you know economic seed activity with

398
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:54,078
people talking [ __ ] on the internet yeah

399
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,799
yeah that was a big epic fail for the

400
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:58,399
forums was when uh

401
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:00,240
uh heaven's stairway went down with

402
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,120
richard calrissian and all that i think

403
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,759
that would be a really good um history

404
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,839
episode to do one day too

405
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:09,360
just on that but we could talk the whole

406
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,199
thing on just that subject because

407
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,480
heaven's stairway was like a big seat

408
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:14,639
people are asking about it heaven

409
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,278
stairway was one of the was a canadian

410
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,198
seed bank yeah and they were selling a

411
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:21,439
lot of seeds in america and they were

412
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:23,838
tied into the first two big forums where

413
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,600
everyone gathered which was overgrow

414
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,639
and cannabis world starting in the late

415
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,480
90s

416
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,480
and then in about i can't remember when

417
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,720
it was it was was it oh four or

418
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,320
something like that or five i don't know

419
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,160
maybe fletcher will say he knows he was

420
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,480
around that

421
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:40,958
you know uh and it scared a lot it

422
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:44,240
scared actually a lot of people uh back

423
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:45,759
into being quiet for a long time yeah i

424
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,480
was one of those people i never really

425
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,078
messed around with the you know

426
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,000
international canon graphic or some of

427
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:54,239
the later ones because i was so sketched

428
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,399
out about what matt had said there there

429
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,600
he is he said archive said oh five yeah

430
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,919
there you go that's what i thought oh

431
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,759
405 something like that because

432
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:04,000
you know nobody knew

433
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:06,240
are cops reading your dms

434
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,839
yeah you know do they have my ip address

435
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,039
like it was sketchy enough back then

436
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,920
you're worried

437
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:11,679
yeah

438
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:13,278
you know and so

439
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:15,120
you know there's an aspect there where

440
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:16,159
it was like the reason why we bring all

441
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,000
that up

442
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:19,679
per the subject is

443
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,639
it really wasn't easy

444
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:22,399
to

445
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,159
sell seeds

446
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,320
it really wasn't easy even to build a

447
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:28,799
marketplace or to build a fan base to

448
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,399
sell seeds too like the whole time when

449
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:33,758
i talk about like most of the breeding

450
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:35,120
that i did it was all way pre

451
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,919
this era

452
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,919
so

453
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:39,519
like we didn't even if you know the only

454
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:41,679
people we knew who to sell seeds to or

455
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,120
our friends

456
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:45,519
there wasn't really like unless you

457
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,240
wanted to like basically give your lines

458
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:50,560
away like dj short did to [ __ ]

459
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,159
uh canada or holland

460
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:54,159
that was the only way you could sell

461
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,919
your seeds you had to basically partner

462
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:58,559
with one of those groups

463
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:01,519
yeah the seed the seed the seed banks

464
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:02,479
hadn't opened up at that point to to

465
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,480
england

466
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,480
where the british and the european seed

467
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,560
banks came in super heavy they hadn't

468
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,680
quite opened up quite yet when that had

469
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:12,078
happened

470
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:13,838
right so it was so basically

471
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:14,879
you know there wasn't that many seed

472
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,560
breeders

473
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:18,639
because there wasn't that many there

474
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,679
wasn't really a way to monetize it very

475
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,839
easily

476
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:24,078
and that left it to people that were

477
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,199
interested in it you know and cared

478
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:27,439
about it

479
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:30,078
and the way that the way that it's

480
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:33,839
exploded now with ig and especially with

481
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:35,758
reversals and not needing males

482
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,199
the vast majority of people just started

483
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,399
breeding

484
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:39,919
yeah

485
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,278
and you know they just jump right into

486
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:42,958
it they don't think there are any rules

487
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:44,399
they can do whatever they want

488
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:46,559
and you know that's where a lot of these

489
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:49,360
battles come from that you know maybe

490
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:51,518
you've seen matt get into a time or two

491
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,199
maybe once or twice because he's because

492
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,120
he's trying you know because people he's

493
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:57,758
trying to us like there's some generally

494
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,159
accepted norm that's getting stomped on

495
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,360
and he mentions it and you know he's an

496
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,639
[ __ ]

497
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,640
very big

498
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,480
big [ __ ] he might be what he might be

499
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,400
talking about like all the old-timers

500
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,439
that were around totally agree with that

501
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,880
viewpoint

502
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,798
yeah you know that that is the way you

503
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,319
should conduct yourself on all that

504
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,078
right but all the new people are like

505
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:18,720
who is this [ __ ] idiot you know

506
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:20,480
pissed off i'm doing whatever i want

507
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,959
the idea here's i mean here's a

508
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,439
different thing like in the forum days

509
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:28,640
if somebody would have put up a clone

510
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:30,720
list with with prices next to each clone

511
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,559
on how much you could buy them from

512
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,279
nobody would send that person cuts ever

513
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:36,720
again no that would be [ __ ] done you

514
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:38,319
would it would be like an immediate i

515
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,679
mean not that some people wouldn't buy

516
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:41,599
them off them because people have always

517
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:45,840
been desperate for access

518
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:47,759
yeah right but like that person couldn't

519
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:50,159
yeah that'd be the last time that person

520
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:51,919
ever got those clones to sell you know

521
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,279
yeah like it yeah it just was like it

522
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,480
was so unheard of no one even tried yeah

523
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:58,079
right

524
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,519
and now and i'm not even saying it's

525
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:01,519
wrong but i'm just saying like now it's

526
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:03,599
super common now it's like a business

527
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:05,038
you can advertise like hey i've got a

528
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:07,199
clone collection

529
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:09,359
and every 10 days i can take cuts off

530
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,240
these moms and this is how much they are

531
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:12,159
yeah

532
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,960
and it's normal

533
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,679
but when we came up it wasn't normal

534
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,640
yeah that was not how you got things

535
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,038
no

536
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,960
whatsoever it wasn't monetized and you

537
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:24,558
know i mean people

538
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,880
we're talking generally speaking here

539
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:28,480
because yes people could sell their own

540
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,840
cuts of [ __ ] and like nobody would get

541
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,519
upset about that but we're talking about

542
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:33,439
like things like you would never see

543
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:35,599
chem 91 on a [ __ ] list you would

544
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,919
never see chem d on a [ __ ] list for

545
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:39,279
sale because if you got that cut you

546
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,240
knew the rules with those cuts and you

547
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:41,440
knew that they weren't supposed to be

548
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,120
passed and if you're the first one

549
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,320
person to [ __ ] do that you're going

550
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:48,159
to be in a world of [ __ ] like i can i

551
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:50,399
the person who's responsible for passing

552
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,360
chem 91 over there still has that around

553
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,160
their neck

554
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:53,759
you know

555
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:57,279
yeah i do

556
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:59,279
and i mean even like even with seeds

557
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:00,639
it was like you couldn't you couldn't

558
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:02,480
take

559
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,520
you know like it you couldn't take like

560
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,360
someone like dj's work of blueberry and

561
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:09,679
cross it to a bunch of things and then

562
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:12,558
start just marketing it yeah no only

563
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,480
[ __ ] would ever do that

564
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:16,319
now it's different yeah no it's

565
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,919
different now now it's different and you

566
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:19,200
know people did that but it was like

567
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,160
because because they didn't make blue

568
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,440
widow

569
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,360
yeah they didn't make a bunch of the

570
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,200
blue hybrids that were sweeping around

571
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:26,959
in that forum era but that was honestly

572
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,600
mostly people doing it for themselves

573
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,440
and trading it yeah

574
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:34,079
and how are you going to stop like free

575
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,160
exchange of people hobbyists making

576
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:37,119
beans and exchanging

577
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,440
and and

578
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:41,678
to some degree they blew rhino you know

579
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,558
yeah so to some degree the shorts or the

580
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,080
short

581
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:48,960
dj did try to stop that um i remember

582
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:51,119
there was talks of contracts

583
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,480
that that he felt like people signed

584
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:55,918
when they bought seeds and they weren't

585
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:58,319
allowed to you know make hybrids

586
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,480
using the word blueberry or anything of

587
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:01,759
the sort yeah and so and this is

588
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,000
frustrated

589
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:07,038
uh seed breeders uh

590
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,319
from neville on from the 80s on

591
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:10,558
which is

592
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,240
like what do you do when you start

593
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:14,000
selling seeds and then someone takes

594
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,519
your stuff and uses it and does whatever

595
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,279
they want with it and steals your

596
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:19,038
lineage and information and doesn't give

597
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,960
you [ __ ] yeah

598
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:22,480
once you let it out there is no once you

599
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,319
let it out once you share it once

600
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,720
whatever there is no proprietary

601
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:29,200
anything there's an honor code yeah and

602
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,759
all it takes is somebody who's who's got

603
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,360
more financial wherewithal than money

604
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:35,200
and honor

605
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:38,719
you know there's a lot of stories about

606
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,720
how one cut or this cut slipped out

607
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,759
of a pretty small circle

608
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,759
yeah

609
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:45,759
right we have a lot of that we have a

610
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:49,119
lot of that and and people that used to

611
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:51,038
have seeds it's like you kind of had uh

612
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:52,798
i mean matt maybe you should talk about

613
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:55,119
the fact that like

614
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:56,960
you know back in the day uh if you

615
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:58,798
wanted to work with somebody's known

616
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,880
clone or something they were responsible

617
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:02,720
for a lot of old seed breeders would

618
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,919
give that person a big percentage of

619
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,200
those seeds

620
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,360
yeah

621
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,200
yeah i mean you would kick down for

622
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:10,959
using the cut right and you had i mean

623
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,038
arrangements with people

624
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,798
we still do that a lot i mean some of us

625
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:16,240
still do that like if we use someone's

626
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:18,079
cut they're always going to get seeds

627
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,599
from it you know

628
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:21,678
that's another norm

629
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:25,519
yeah that was normal then

630
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:28,798
it's not super normal now though no

631
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:30,480
and and per archive's point i 100 agree

632
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:32,158
just with what's going on in chat like

633
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,240
uh someone mentioned you know copycat

634
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,400
does the s-ones he doesn't even go as

635
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,120
far as making the s-ones he just puts

636
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,600
seeds in a bag and people grow them you

637
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:44,000
know a lot of times they have you know

638
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:45,839
more males than females and they still

639
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,038
don't get it it's not some people just

640
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:48,959
still kind of hope that they're getting

641
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:50,720
what they're paying for but that doesn't

642
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,600
always happen and and things like that

643
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,759
would have been shake shook out so fast

644
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:57,519
in the forums but like i said these are

645
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:59,359
different days

646
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:01,839
well yeah because so many people have

647
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:04,319
joined now it's such a wave

648
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:06,959
yeah that it's like there's a few like

649
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:09,119
older people trying to like establish

650
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,000
norms and decency and stuff like that

651
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,000
you know

652
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,440
yeah and even respect to people and some

653
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,720
people you know humans are human so

654
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,120
there are people abused i've always

655
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,798
abused it on different sides

656
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:21,279
you know i don't i honestly don't think

657
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:23,839
dj has a right to all that blue stuff

658
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:26,000
since he's been selling it for 25 years

659
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:28,879
yeah i'd like to see someone put out

660
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,038
some uh s-ones or some of the blue

661
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,720
clones too you know but i just mean in

662
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:33,839
this so but you know there's an aspect

663
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,360
to it where

664
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:37,678
you know we

665
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:39,199
you know because ig and these other

666
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:42,240
forums allowed

667
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,919
aspects of people to monetize breeding

668
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,200
way more people got into breeding than

669
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,080
it was before

670
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,080
yeah

671
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:50,000
and i really wonder as like as like the

672
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:51,678
market shifts and people's desire for

673
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,558
different seeds shift

674
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,240
like how many people will stick it out

675
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:57,839
when you know

676
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,200
i mean because it's it's different you

677
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:01,439
know i think a lot of people think it's

678
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,200
easy and fast and it's easy it's easy to

679
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,480
like it's easier to make a bunch of

680
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,558
seeds than it is to grow a bunch of

681
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,038
fireweed yeah

682
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:11,359
in their mind darby looks like he's

683
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:13,038
gonna throw up hold on one second i

684
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:15,359
might have to rush him out he's doing

685
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:18,000
that lick thing

686
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:19,678
okay we're good we're good yeah so i

687
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,759
mean there's a there's an aspect to that

688
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,480
where it's like you know it

689
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:26,879
it uh the reason why so few people bred

690
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,720
back in the day was mostly because there

691
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,559
wasn't any profit in it

692
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,240
yeah and you you had to do it because

693
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:33,759
you wanted to make better wheat

694
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,960
or you wanted to trade some seeds with

695
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:36,240
your friends or you had some other

696
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,480
friends and you were trading back and

697
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,000
forth but it was fairly small and that's

698
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,640
why to some degree

699
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,640
like so much modern stuff is based on

700
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,440
like the farther you go back it gets

701
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,720
into a narrower narrower pool yeah

702
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,558
because there's only so many people

703
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,960
messing with it

704
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:54,879
you know um and

705
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,120
you know like and it's the same thing

706
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,799
with cuts how they go from like super

707
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:00,639
common to super rare

708
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:02,558
yeah as soon as the finances get pulled

709
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,640
out from under it

710
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:06,960
all of a sudden only four people have it

711
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,799
yeah like we saw earlier green crack or

712
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,798
any number of them

713
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:13,759
or whatever the case may be and like i

714
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:15,519
mean you know i uh you know when i was

715
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:18,640
talking about the superdog project or

716
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:20,480
whatever my my buddy who i did it with

717
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,840
he was actually like ahead of his time

718
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,000
and he was like dude we could take this

719
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:26,558
whole eight lighter

720
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,480
and think about how many seeds that is

721
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:30,079
yeah and we made an enormous amount of

722
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,720
seeds but like

723
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:36,399
there was nowhere for them to go yeah in

724
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,919
2000 and 2001 or two or three yeah like

725
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,759
three there was nowhere for them to go

726
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,278
like i traded them to other people and i

727
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:42,720
gave them out to a bunch of friends all

728
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:44,798
over the place

729
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,720
but it was like you know we had tens of

730
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:47,679
thousands of beans

731
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,960
and

732
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,720
what are you doing

733
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,880
yeah it wasn't like today where i can

734
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,880
come up with 50 different names

735
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,880
and make some cool packaging

736
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,960
and get a hold of thousands of people

737
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,200
that might like my [ __ ] and find a home

738
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,679
for all of it yeah have direct marketing

739
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,440
to to buyers right away yeah yeah there

740
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,600
was like unless i wanted to go on like

741
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,919
when did even like breed bay and like

742
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:10,879
those little auction places start two

743
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,038
thousand

744
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,840
uh breedman's probably

745
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:15,519
two 2007

746
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:18,240
eight yeah so what i was just talking

747
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:20,960
about was like four or five years before

748
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,558
even like the first online sort of like

749
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,640
little breeders could pop on there and

750
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:27,038
try yeah

751
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,400
but it was still sketch

752
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:30,240
in my opinion

753
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,559
you know yeah it was it was still kind

754
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,519
of sketchy you know

755
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:35,278
hold on

756
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:38,000
you keep going i gotta i gotta walk him

757
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:39,919
out real quick everybody claims to have

758
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,079
i'll answer some questions everybody

759
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:45,840
claims to have archives sour because uh

760
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:48,639
archive is a collector and has a good

761
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:51,519
sour and people want to tie sour

762
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,520
to some legitimate name just like the

763
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:55,359
rest of it like people want to tie cuts

764
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:56,879
to like oh it's this legit cut from this

765
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:59,278
person

766
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,960
you know so that's kind of why that's

767
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:02,960
kind of why i see it

768
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,480
so

769
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,400
i don't know i mean

770
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,480
it uh

771
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,038
cut etiquette really has changed seed

772
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:14,079
etiquette has changed like how

773
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:16,000
i mean when we bred back there um

774
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:16,879
there was only males so it took some

775
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,640
effort

776
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,480
you know and

777
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,320
you know the the sts thing and the

778
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,319
reversals thing and all that is really

779
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:25,599
like you didn't even need to keep males

780
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:27,599
you didn't really need to do anything

781
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:30,319
like that you just need to take two

782
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:31,839
elite cuts and and try to see if you can

783
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:34,319
get some pollen

784
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:35,278
and so that 9g kind of revolutionized

785
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:38,158
things

786
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:39,919
a bit um maybe for the better in some

787
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,880
ways but maybe not

788
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,759
yeah um i don't know about

789
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,520
i

790
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:47,679
it definitely revolutionized things and

791
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:49,038
it made people be able to get into

792
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,798
markets they normally wouldn't have been

793
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:52,879
able to get into so for a lot of people

794
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:54,558
it would be for the better i don't know

795
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,799
about where it's going to end up for

796
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:58,798
cannabis as a whole though you know

797
00:26:56,798 --> 00:27:00,639
maybe i should maybe i should say this

798
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:02,879
and i'm not gonna i won't name names

799
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,520
because i'm not big on that but what i

800
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,600
should say is that when me and friends

801
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:10,079
of mine like matt or

802
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:11,359
csi or different people chat that know

803
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:13,678
about reading

804
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:16,000
the gulf between what

805
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:18,159
most people think their breeders are up

806
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,398
to and what those breeders are actually

807
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,520
up to is pretty vast

808
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:23,199
yeah

809
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:24,720
you know there are people out there

810
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,558
doing real work

811
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,839
growing out their own seeds making

812
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:30,079
selections

813
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:32,480
um you know keeping females for future

814
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:34,879
use and stuff like that but for the most

815
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,200
part a lot of these newest seed

816
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,200
companies do very little of that

817
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,759
yeah it's very much make the cross

818
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,679
package the cross market the cross make

819
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:45,759
the next cross

820
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,399
so they're more like one-off

821
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:50,398
crosses than they are doing breeding

822
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:51,918
to me when i talk about breeding i'm not

823
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:54,000
even i'm not even trying to get who's a

824
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,919
real breeder and not but generally

825
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,839
speaking breeding is like i think in its

826
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,240
most understood concept is you're

827
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:02,319
breeding towards a goal yeah

828
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,558
yeah you're crossing two things you're

829
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:06,079
hoping to find things you like about

830
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:08,158
both and the kids

831
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:10,000
you grow them up you see what happens

832
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,159
either you're happy as hell

833
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,480
or you start doing more work because you

834
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:17,039
want to take it in some direction yeah

835
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,558
and i think that's with all breeding

836
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:19,919
you know you're messing around until you

837
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:21,278
get to where you want to go and i think

838
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,679
these days

839
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:26,558
um back in the day most people had some

840
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,798
kind of goal of what they wanted to do

841
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:31,278
they were breeding plants for a reason

842
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:32,879
you know um and now i think it's more

843
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:34,398
like well i'm going to take skittles and

844
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,840
i'm going to take gelato and it's

845
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:37,678
probably going to throw some color and

846
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,959
i'll probably have good terps and that's

847
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,240
what the market wants so i'm going to

848
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,079
mash it together

849
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,798
if they even think that far in a lot of

850
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:47,278
times it's just named a name and that's

851
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:48,079
and since and since you know i mean we

852
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:50,720
could

853
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:53,038
we could talk about widow i suppose

854
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,360
you know um but you know widow was one

855
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:57,038
of those things that that came out and

856
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:59,519
got crossed to everything

857
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:00,960
yeah widow males especially got crossed

858
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:02,639
we were talking about blueberry blue

859
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,120
widow was one of my favorites because it

860
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,880
had terps from the blue and it had frost

861
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:09,038
and density from the white

862
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,919
and it was pretty amazing in that regard

863
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:11,839
but

864
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:15,520
you know the these things have their

865
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:16,959
time in the sun and the last 10 years

866
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:19,119
since

867
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,360
95 or so of breeders have gotten

868
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:22,798
involved in the last five or ten years

869
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:25,678
that means they're breeding with what's

870
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:28,158
easily accessible to them at the time

871
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,798
yeah so there's there's breeders like

872
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,720
csi or archive or matter various friends

873
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:34,639
of ours that have collections that date

874
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,319
back quite far and so they make lots of

875
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,399
different mixes

876
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:41,519
but a lot of modern seed breeding right

877
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:42,879
now is some combination of cookies og

878
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:44,720
skittles

879
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,679
cookies kush

880
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,519
you know it's the same 15 to 35 cuts

881
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:52,320
yeah blended every which way because

882
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:54,000
that's what they had access to yeah

883
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:57,359
and then people are trying to make

884
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,278
variations on an already popular theme

885
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:01,278
so they sell their seats

886
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:03,839
and people find good [ __ ]

887
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:05,599
you know there's real gems and neville's

888
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:07,359
work but i think neville would have a

889
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:09,918
hard time today

890
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:11,599
oh there was a lot of junk in there yeah

891
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,360
he'd have a real hard time you know

892
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:16,240
there was a lot of junk in the in that

893
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:18,398
90s weed some of the stuff i mean i

894
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:21,679
bought like probably

895
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:25,359
seven or eight packs of nl5 haze in that

896
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:27,440
like 94 95 era right yeah and i didn't

897
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:28,319
find anything that i liked that much

898
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,480
yeah

899
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:32,720
but then other people have keepers that

900
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,000
are from that era still today

901
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,000
yeah

902
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,759
you know that's kind of how seeds work

903
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,359
so now it's like

904
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:41,278
now we've got this thing where like

905
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:42,719
everybody needs to have like high floor

906
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:44,000
seeds all your seeds need to be

907
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,679
attractive

908
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,038
and people get so angry it seems like

909
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,360
the one thing

910
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:50,960
that people hold breeders to the fire

911
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:53,278
for is herms

912
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,519
yeah breeders get a pass on everything

913
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:57,679
else but bananas yeah that's one thing

914
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:59,839
nobody gets a pass on anymore

915
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,759
yeah every everybody gets attacked

916
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:04,798
viciously not not even for like is the

917
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:06,158
weed good yeah but there was nanners

918
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:08,240
yeah

919
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:10,399
you know and so i think now it's like

920
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,000
you can breed and you can go buy some

921
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:13,119
cuts and you can trade with some cuts

922
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,359
and you can get these different things

923
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:17,678
and reverse them and you there's no and

924
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:19,278
you make packaging and call it names and

925
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,798
i think people put more effort into the

926
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:22,640
name sometimes than they do into like

927
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:23,918
what the breeding is going to be

928
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,480
yep

929
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,080
yeah you know i was having a discussion

930
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,880
with bitter the other day

931
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:33,199
about um there's a cup called the soul

932
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,960
assassin actually there were three cuts

933
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,720
the soul assassin one two and three and

934
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,120
they're old og cuts they're not the

935
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,440
oldest but they were considered you know

936
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:42,319
like in the

937
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,360
first

938
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:48,960
decade of og being around as as some of

939
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:50,959
the first ones well known and they never

940
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,640
got popular and and i think a lot of it

941
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,798
was because of the name

942
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,880
and i kept telling everyone in our crew

943
00:31:54,798 --> 00:31:59,200
like hey this is the [ __ ] grow it i'm

944
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,039
telling you this this [ __ ] is the [ __ ]

945
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,278
but everybody was just kind of like

946
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:05,519
saying you know because it didn't

947
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:07,440
even to us people that are that

948
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,440
realize you know names are nothing it's

949
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,600
still because it didn't have a catchy

950
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,038
name for an og it just didn't catch on

951
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:15,678
and he messaged me yesterday he's like

952
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:17,759
bro what the [ __ ] is this you know

953
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,519
freaking out and he's like why doesn't

954
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:21,759
why didn't this catch on why didn't i

955
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,759
get this and it's like tell the [ __ ]

956
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:25,359
name because the name

957
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:27,200
yeah i mean so

958
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:29,359
there's i could talk about a couple of

959
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,519
things real quick on that

960
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:32,798
there was this cut up here called big

961
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,599
wreck

962
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:35,519
okay

963
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:37,119
big bud train wreck

964
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,278
you know the classic way to name a

965
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:41,599
strain you smash half the name from each

966
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:43,440
together it's big wreck right it's big

967
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:45,199
it's frosty it's crazy looking it

968
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,519
finishes in september

969
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,798
nobody [ __ ] wanted it

970
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:53,440
right yeah so the the uh these guys i

971
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:54,480
know are out there and mendo and kovalev

972
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,159
and they're looking at it and they can't

973
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,200
believe how beautiful it is but nobody

974
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,519
wants it

975
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,319
and big wreck isn't working and so they

976
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:04,558
decide to name it the barry white

977
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:07,439
oh is that is that the first iteration

978
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:09,359
of barry white and yeah and barry wright

979
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,120
is big wreck when it was named big rack

980
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:13,439
[ __ ] it's nobody wanted it when it

981
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:14,959
was named the berry berry white you've

982
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,480

983
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,399
it flew like hot cakes and all of a

984
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,919
sudden they're getting a premium they're

985
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:21,918
getting a buck or two more than other

986
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:22,960
people because they have the berry white

987
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,559
yeah

988
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,798
just all based you know big wreck was a

989
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:29,119
shitty name nobody wanted big rec yeah

990
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:31,278
but barry white everybody wanted barry

991
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:32,558
right and i saw a bunch of things so

992
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:33,919
i'll answer this too there was a bunch

993
00:33:32,558 --> 00:33:36,798
of people right after i talked about

994
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,720
nanner's back and forthing about about

995

998
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,839
like the reason why everyone has sour is

999
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,559
nanners

1000
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:52,558
that super skunk had crazy nanners all

1001
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:56,158
over it uh the og kush was bag seed yep

1002
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:58,720
the trinity is bag seed there's a lot of

1003
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:01,200
amazing weed that we have right now

1004
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:04,240
that wouldn't be here if that plant they

1005
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,480
were working with didn't have nanners

1006
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,719
and it's really humbling as a breeder to

1007
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,639
have some accidents in somebody's four

1008
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:13,199
lighter in the 90s

1009
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,838
outpace anything you've ever tried to do

1010
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:17,678
yeah that's for sure you know like you

1011
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:19,838
know some 19 year old kid makes an

1012
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,119
accident and those beans are like white

1013
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:22,878
hot fire

1014
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,559
yeah still hold the test of time and

1015
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:27,358
you're out there like trying to plan

1016
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:29,119
[ __ ] and doing pops and punnett squares

1017
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:31,440
and various [ __ ]

1018
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:33,519
and it's not as good as that accident

1019
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,358
yeah that accident that that is one

1020
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:37,838
accident that takes precedence over a

1021
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:40,799
lot yeah so a lot of people's most

1022
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:43,199
famous cookies is a bag seed

1023
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,119
yeah cookies is a backseat og is a bag

1024
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:48,480
seed sour is a bag seed they all came

1025
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:51,599
from herm yeah so be careful before

1026
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:54,000
you want to breed out all these herbs

1027
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:57,599
are herms a problem when it comes to

1028
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:00,159
seedless and and sales and all that sure

1029
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:02,079
it can be a problem when i used to grow

1030
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:04,000
so many people dropped that old super

1031
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:06,480
skunk that everyone's hunting for

1032
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
because it hurt like a [ __ ] yeah

1033
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,159
and all of a sudden you got eight lights

1034
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,400
a herm

1035
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:14,719
it's like a [ __ ] seed yeah it's a

1036
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,480
problem you know and so i'm not saying

1037
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:18,000
that herms aren't an issue

1038
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,559
but i'm also saying that they're not a

1039
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,039
total negative

1040
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:26,078
you know um the the weed that the sour

1041
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:28,000
came out of that room lightly herbed

1042
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,039
and they found a few phenos that became

1043
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,440
sour

1044
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:34,079
you know the you know the og was some

1045
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,639
lightly seeded weed

1046
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:38,640
right yeah or so we think so we think

1047
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:41,440
yeah you know the cookies was definitely

1048
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:43,358
some seeded wheat the trinity was seeded

1049
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,679
weed that came out of a sack of weed

1050
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:47,440
that the grower grew in trinity

1051
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:49,519
yeah

1052
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,920
so a lot of cases of that

1053
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:54,079
you know and so that that level of uh

1054
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,920
that level of plant selfing

1055
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,400
or plant crossing

1056
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,680
uh really is kind of the bedrock of what

1057
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,800
we got

1058
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:03,199
yeah

1059
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,359
you know um and no herm seeds don't

1060
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:07,439
necessarily produce herm plants

1061
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:09,920
they don't have to but sometimes they do

1062
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,320
i mean i think sour what sour sounds

1063
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:16,639
like as far as we can determine sour was

1064
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:18,800
a multi-stage herm accident yeah

1065
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:21,838
you know and i think so was cookie

1066
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:24,240
cookie was you know maybe three or four

1067
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:25,358
over a course of a number of years

1068
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:28,239
yeah

1069
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:30,400
we're barely just being able to

1070
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:32,639
get the the general consensus in the

1071
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,760
cannabis community to understand that

1072
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:37,920
not all femme seeds harm so we're we're

1073
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,960
we're trying to work on that with uh the

1074
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:43,599
public's take on what what is intersex

1075
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:45,519
traits why do they occur but we're in

1076
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:47,359
the stone ages when it comes to that

1077
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:49,519
[ __ ] as far as so this is this is this

1078
00:36:47,358 --> 00:36:51,838
is a norm we should talk about

1079
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:53,679
right bringing that up

1080
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:56,159
so the norm was

1081
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:57,919
up until about 2008 or nine

1082
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:59,920
uh that this is the way you bread you

1083
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,240
bred the way god intended you took males

1084
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,320
and females you did your thing there's

1085
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:06,959
all this breeding knowledge and work and

1086
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:09,440
it's all based on that yeah and then

1087
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,599
people started spreading these tales of

1088
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,599
sex reversal

1089
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,920
and it was not received warmly in the

1090
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:19,280
community not at all uh now it's the

1091
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:21,519
norm but people like uh rascal or matt

1092
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:24,079
or various others matt can talk about

1093
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:26,480
this they were kind of scorned

1094
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:29,119
yeah they were you were cheating

1095
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:32,559
making fem seeds you're a cheater

1096
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:34,800
ruining ruining the gene pool for good

1097
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:36,559
yeah i mean i'm sure he's hurt i'm sure

1098
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,480
he heard at all what else did you hear i

1099
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:40,719
mean that was kind of like people even

1100
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:44,400
accepting that reversals were an

1101
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:46,399
acceptable way to breed yeah took years

1102
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,838
and and the the other big one was it's

1103
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,559
just cheating it's [ __ ]

1104
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:52,639
cheating be what's the easiest way to

1105
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:54,559
get it done it's gonna make herbs you're

1106
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:56,879
just breeding herbs you're a herm

1107
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:59,838
breeder yeah everybody knows that making

1108
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,358
femme seeds is [ __ ] easy it's cheap

1109
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:03,440
they're not gonna be as vigorous as a

1110
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:05,358
male and a female breeder yes they're

1111
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,599
talking of this they're knocking out the

1112
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:09,598
bus they're not as potent they're gonna

1113
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:11,838
they're gonna genetic drift within a few

1114
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:13,680
clonings they're not gonna be as sturdy

1115
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:15,759
that's right the genetic drift of the

1116
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:18,239
the do you remember that was a big deal

1117
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,760
where it was like oh femme seeds them

1118
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:21,039
seeds they're not going to be as strong

1119
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,480
they're not going to hold up over the

1120
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:24,559
years like those

1121
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:27,519
dna

1122
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:30,480
dna you're feeling the dna for future

1123
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:32,800
generations to come yeah

1124
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,679
all those things were like like

1125
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:39,280
typed into the forums like crazy

1126
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:41,440
yeah just asked if if kim og and sauer

1127
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:44,400
if breeding with those is weakening the

1128
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:46,800
gene pool i mean it's like i we've had

1129
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,960
enough time to see i think it's uh you

1130
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,200
know people can overdo things but as far

1131
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,599
as kim og and sauer i think they tend to

1132
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:55,519
be some of the the most loved

1133
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:58,160
and it's you know it's a plant survival

1134
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:59,920
trait that it has in itself

1135
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:01,519
yeah because it's evolutionary there

1136
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,440
because it was very useful to the

1137
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:05,519
survival of the species

1138
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,760
yeah that's i mean that's evolution

1139
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:10,079
right is yeah but now it's like

1140
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,760
everybody does fem seeds no one's ever

1141
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:14,400
but they're still here and there there's

1142
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,400
some like uh csi and i joke about it

1143
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,240
there's still some lingering like oh

1144
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,160
you're a [ __ ]

1145
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:21,598
you're a femme reversal guy yeah yeah

1146
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:23,039
they're still there yeah it's still

1147
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,960
there it's it's it's almost like a

1148
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:27,119
running joke now but it still exists

1149
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,480
you're a femme guy you know you're not

1150
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,599
doing real work

1151
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,639
yeah

1152
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,640
yeah but that was a norm

1153
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:36,480
yeah and honestly like

1154
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:38,559
really i think one of the things that

1155
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,639
changed it too was like since there was

1156
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:42,320
only a few people doing it

1157
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:44,480
and the crosses they were making like

1158
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,359
rascal stuff was so fire

1159
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,960
yeah

1160
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:49,920
how do you say this wheat sucks when it

1161
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,760
doesn't suck yeah i think i i genuinely

1162
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,760
think rascal might have been the one who

1163
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,040
really flipped it on its head

1164
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,520
where he was putting out stuff that was

1165
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:59,679
so nice like white fire and some of the

1166
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:02,079
the wi-fi and wi-fi crosses and some of

1167
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:04,000
the white crosses in itself white oracle

1168
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,680
there was it was just like okay now this

1169
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,599
is so [ __ ] fire how are we not gonna

1170
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:09,358
grow this [ __ ] like i think he really

1171
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:11,680
started changing [ __ ] he had a nice

1172
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:13,920
stable of afghans

1173
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:16,719
that he crossed together and and there

1174
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,240
was a lot of fire that came out of those

1175
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:19,679
first things and so it was like all of a

1176
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:22,479
sudden people are like

1177
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:24,799
oh my god wi-fi buy strawberry cough

1178
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,119
yeah this is unbelievable

1179
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,480
yeah so then how does it suck

1180
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:30,720
yeah

1181
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,880
right it pretty well proved the point

1182
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:35,519
that things weren't being weakened

1183
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,200
um and that it wasn't all herm [ __ ] you

1184
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:38,719
know no and then you start going and

1185
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:39,759
then you start going and you start

1186
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:42,239
studying

1187
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,760
you know um other plant breeding and

1188
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:47,358
it's a technique that's used all the

1189
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:50,560
time yeah in in normal agriculture uh

1190
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:52,000
reversals selfing is is a it's more

1191
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:54,239
common than regular breeding in many

1192
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,480
cases because it gets you to uniformity

1193
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:59,358
which is ideal in agricultural

1194
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,039
production but talking about norms

1195
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:02,880
i mean you can't really blame but you

1196
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:04,239
could say like you you could blame rob

1197
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,440
clark

1198
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:09,838
right because rob clark wrote this bible

1199
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,599
that i still recommend today on breeding

1200
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:15,119
and laid out how you're supposed to do

1201
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:17,119
it yeah and matt and rascal's shitty way

1202
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,480
of reversing plants like that that

1203
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,400
wasn't in the book

1204
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,159
no it wasn't in the book that's not why

1205
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,920
that's it's not in the bible bro you're

1206
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:25,920
doing some outer bible [ __ ]

1207
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,760
yeah yeah you got some like you've got

1208
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,760
some like some weird [ __ ] you've got

1209
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,520
going on over there yeah because it just

1210
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,520
wasn't the norm

1211
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:35,599
yeah you know but now it is now it's the

1212
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:37,358
norm now it's the opposite and one thing

1213
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:39,440
i noticed over time too that a lot of

1214
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:40,239
people that were spreading the rumors

1215
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,720
that

1216
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:45,358
uh or profligating the rumors that you

1217
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:46,959
know all femzy term all this it usually

1218
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:49,598
tended to come from

1219
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:52,720
the creators of regular seeds from these

1220
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:54,880
companies and 99 of the time we'd all

1221
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:56,318
catch them you know doing a project

1222
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,240
trying to do it and then they fail at

1223
00:41:56,318 --> 00:42:00,480
reversing and all of a sudden [ __ ] those

1224
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:02,479
[ __ ] things you know and there's a

1225
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,358
lot of that it's hard to do it wasn't it

1226
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:08,480
wasn't what they said it wasn't a cheap

1227
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:11,279
um quick route to making seeds in fact

1228
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:13,599
it's more expensive it takes more time

1229
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,839
the pollen's less viable there's a lot

1230
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:17,519
more there's failure involved you don't

1231
00:42:15,838 --> 00:42:19,599
have failure with regular seeds very

1232
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:22,159
often it's not a thing we run into i

1233
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:24,640
can't even remember having a failed seed

1234
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:26,239
run when i used males from seed yeah i

1235
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:28,318
can't think of one i can't think of a

1236
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:30,719
single time i didn't get a bountiful

1237
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:32,960
amount of seed yeah i mean sometimes you

1238
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:34,559
know we have friends that do reversals

1239
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,079
um and

1240
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:36,880
they don't even get enough seeds for

1241
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:39,599
sale

1242
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:42,160
yeah maybe it doesn't fail

1243
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:44,318
um but you know our i mean i remember

1244
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:47,679
our buddy pip tried to reverse his sour

1245
00:42:44,318 --> 00:42:48,559
cut and i think he got like 18 seeds

1246
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:50,639
yeah

1247
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:53,199
it's miserable and so yeah it was

1248
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:55,519
literally like you got a small handful

1249
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:57,519
it costs a lot of money i mean and you

1250
00:42:55,519 --> 00:43:00,239
know like even with the spray i tell

1251
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:02,960
people like everything reverses

1252
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:05,118
not everything drops pollen so yes we

1253
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:07,358
can reverse your plant that reversing

1254
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:09,440
the plant is is the easy part getting it

1255
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:10,960
to produce viable pollen is not the easy

1256
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,559
part you have to know your plant very

1257
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,199
well and sometimes it's luck of the draw

1258
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:16,880
on that we do a lot of numbers now one

1259
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:18,799
thing that's interesting that we should

1260
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,039
throw in there is when the reversal tech

1261
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,839
came around a few breeders

1262
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:24,960
uh like our buddy shaw and a couple

1263
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:27,519
other people

1264
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,760
they actually started reversing males

1265
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:30,800
yes to try to get some terps and to try

1266
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,960
to see

1267
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,039
what was like what the what the male

1268
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:37,119
would look like as a female

1269
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:39,039
to inform what breeding they would use i

1270
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:40,640
don't know how effective it was

1271
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:43,599
but they were something that was they

1272
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:44,559
were curious about i first ran into that

1273
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:47,440
um

1274
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:48,880
on i see mag forums and it was sam skunk

1275
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,159
man someone else talking about it i

1276
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,240
thought it was so fascinating and i went

1277
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:54,239
to try it and i started using that

1278
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:55,679
method for uh the males that i would

1279
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:57,118
select to see what kind of terps they

1280
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:58,078
might have even though it doesn't

1281
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,640
necessarily mean that they're going to

1282
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:02,720
pass them down you just get an idea for

1283
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:04,078
okay i'm seeing this in my in my crosses

1284
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:05,838
now i know it's coming from the male

1285
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:08,160
side not something hidden back in the

1286
00:44:05,838 --> 00:44:11,039
female side so you get that aspect from

1287
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:13,920
it but i remember on those forums

1288
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:14,719
sam skunk man saying that all seeds made

1289
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,519
from

1290
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:19,358
males reverse males were unviable so i

1291
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:20,880
never tried it out of all the male

1292
00:44:19,358 --> 00:44:23,199
reversals i just didn't try it because i

1293
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,760
just assumed he was preaching gospel

1294
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:27,919
like that's yeah what he said

1295
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,079
turned out not to be the case not three

1296
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:32,240
years definitely not to be the case so

1297
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:34,160
yeah it makes regular seats when you do

1298
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:35,838
uh mail reversal runs

1299
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:38,078
because it was just it was just another

1300
00:44:35,838 --> 00:44:40,239
technique for people to try to see get a

1301
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:42,318
hint of what the male might do

1302
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:44,000
without going through all of like the

1303
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:45,199
will i have to cross it to something and

1304
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,639
then grow that

1305
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:48,078
yeah

1306
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:49,759
yeah

1307
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:52,318
you know and so

1308
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,520
i mean yeah basically like act like the

1309
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:55,599
amount of people that have come in

1310
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:58,239
recently and then how people get access

1311
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:00,240
to seeds and how people get access to

1312
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:02,959
cuts and stuff has totally changed the

1313
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:04,399
norms yeah i think a lot of people i

1314
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,079
think it's going to change soon but i

1315
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,838
think a lot of people jumped in because

1316
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:09,599
for the last five or six or seven years

1317
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:11,838
it looked like a pretty easy way to make

1318
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,280
some money and do some cool [ __ ]

1319
00:45:11,838 --> 00:45:14,960
yeah and i think it's going to get a lot

1320
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,800
harder

1321
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:19,199
and i think most of the people maybe

1322
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,318
maybe the charitable way to put it is

1323
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:22,480
they didn't really know the work

1324
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:24,400
required and the more work you put in

1325
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,838
the less money you make yeah so there's

1326
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,440
definitely plenty of people out there

1327
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:29,759
that are just trying to maximize their

1328
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:32,079
return

1329
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,920
and they and this has almost flipped the

1330
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:35,440
market i mean this is something that me

1331
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,760
and other breeders talk about all the

1332
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,760
time

1333
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,480
for a longest time we are all expected

1334
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:43,519
to test your seeds because you want to

1335
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,119
know what's in your seeds if you're

1336
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:46,318
serious about it you'd like to know what

1337
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:49,519
happened in the cross that you made

1338
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:49,519
you'd like to see it firsthand

1339
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:54,239
that's almost gone in this market it's

1340
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:56,639
almost gone

1341
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:58,719
because things move so fast and because

1342
00:45:56,639 --> 00:46:00,078
when you say when you show your work

1343
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:02,959
that you're doing something it's going

1344
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:05,039
to take you know x amount of months to a

1345
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,440
year and a half till it's done

1346
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:09,358
if you show that work before it's done

1347
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:12,159
you can guarantee someone's going to say

1348
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:14,639
they did it just recently better and

1349
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:17,279
they have it for sale right now you know

1350
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:19,440
so the whole testing aspect is kind of

1351
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,319
getting phased out because

1352
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:22,400
one

1353
00:46:20,318 --> 00:46:24,400
it's not rewarded in the marketplace no

1354
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,559
you know people won't pay more for seeds

1355
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,680
that are tested it's just it's not

1356
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:29,358
happening

1357
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:30,960
two

1358
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:32,559
it's just not the norm anymore most

1359
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,079
people don't test so if you're going to

1360
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:36,960
be the one testing you're the one losing

1361
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:38,720
money you're going to be late to market

1362
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:41,519
losing money when matt and i were

1363
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:42,480
collecting like 90s seed catalogs and

1364
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:44,159
stuff

1365
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,318
like some of those they would go three

1366
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:47,759
or four years and only have one change

1367
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:50,000
in the whole catalog

1368
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,520
yeah they would just offer lines and

1369
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,199
that was acceptable now you have a

1370
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:54,318
situation where

1371
00:46:53,199 --> 00:46:55,759
um

1372
00:46:54,318 --> 00:46:58,079
you know people essentially make

1373
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:59,599
one-offs they don't really have lines

1374
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:01,440
they're repeatedly making they make

1375
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:03,519
one-offs they have x amount of seeds of

1376
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,358
it and they have it until it's gone

1377
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:07,519
and maybe i'll call out one thing just

1378
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:08,318
because it's super famous right yeah

1379
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:11,280
where

1380
00:47:08,318 --> 00:47:14,400
uh the candy rain fiasco

1381
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:16,400
okay oh yeah yeah there's one thing okay

1382
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,079
it's one thing where you have to test

1383
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,480
and you have to grow up a room of your

1384
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:22,079
own seeds like you see our buddy csi do

1385
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,000
all the time or archive or somebody

1386
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:25,760
where they're growing out a room of of

1387
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,679
their work and they show you a bunch of

1388
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,680
pictures of what's in it yeah that's

1389
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:32,078
very time consuming yeah but there's a

1390
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:33,919
simpler test you can do which doesn't

1391
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:35,680
tell you nearly as much but certainly

1392
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,960
prevents problems and what we call a

1393
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:39,039
germ test

1394
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,079
yes where you take 50 or 100 of the

1395
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:42,480
seeds

1396
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:44,079
and you attempt to germinate them

1397
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,599
and you make sure

1398
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:47,680
that they're healthy and there's no

1399
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:50,079
issues and they pop right

1400
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:51,519
yeah right and that's the most basic

1401
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:54,318
that's the most basic [ __ ] you could

1402
00:47:51,519 --> 00:47:56,880
ever [ __ ] do yeah it's yeah and most

1403
00:47:54,318 --> 00:47:58,480
people don't even do that yeah no and so

1404
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,559
occasionally people get burned where

1405
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,920
they offer up a selection like candy

1406
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:03,680
rain they're not it's not the only time

1407
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,400
it's happened but no and all of a sudden

1408
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:10,078
people get their seeds don't pop only a

1409
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:12,160
few pop there's mutants they die

1410
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:15,200
and they just didn't even do a germ test

1411
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:16,719
yeah sometimes people will come up

1412
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:18,719
and they'll be like they'll open up a

1413
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:22,078
wet paper towel and you'll see like

1414
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:24,480
tails of of you know of fresh roots this

1415
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:26,720
long yeah because it's healthy it takes

1416
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,240
two or three four days

1417
00:48:26,719 --> 00:48:29,759
you know that's it just to make sure

1418
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:31,519
there's not an issue it's the one of the

1419
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:34,400
most basic things you can get to not

1420
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:36,239
piss your customers off yeah for sure

1421
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,240
but you know most people just want to

1422
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:39,919
get it to market and maybe somebody

1423
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:42,239
didn't even teach them that a germ test

1424
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,200
was normal i don't think they even had a

1425
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:45,118
clue

1426
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:46,639
you know maybe maybe so maybe it's not

1427
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:48,318
even malicious

1428
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:50,159
maybe it's just one of those norms like

1429
00:48:48,318 --> 00:48:51,599
we were talking about where like we know

1430
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:52,480
these there's these various steps that

1431
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:54,318
you do

1432
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,639
yeah to make sure that they're viable

1433
00:48:54,318 --> 00:48:58,558
and people don't even know yeah why

1434
00:48:56,639 --> 00:48:59,838
bother

1435
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:02,079
you know

1436
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:04,000
um and then you know every once in a

1437
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:05,760
while if you don't test your stuff

1438
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,559
you're going to put out something that

1439
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:11,599
that's funky really funky yeah it'll

1440
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:12,720
backfire it all eventually backfires it

1441
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:14,800
does

1442
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:16,480
but since weed reinvents itself every

1443
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,440
five or ten years are people even gonna

1444
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,358
remember

1445
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:22,400
no they already forgot the candy rain

1446
00:49:19,358 --> 00:49:23,440
thing i even forgot the candy rain thing

1447
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,800
you know

1448
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,159
it just sticks out because it was one of

1449
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,318
those things where you had to pay like

1450
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:30,799
eight or nine hundred dollars a pack and

1451
00:49:28,318 --> 00:49:33,358
there was so much yeah and there was so

1452
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:35,440
much build up to it but even still 500 a

1453
00:49:33,358 --> 00:49:37,679
pack is 50 bucks a season yeah it's it's

1454
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:39,519
insane to have it all just imagine you

1455
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:41,279
pay 50 bucks a seed and then seven of

1456
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:44,559
them don't don't pop

1457
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:47,119
i wonder i know there was a big hubbub

1458
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:49,200
about them not sending replacements and

1459
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:51,039
then eventually they were i don't think

1460
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:52,318
most people ever got the replacements on

1461
00:49:51,039 --> 00:49:54,558
them either

1462
00:49:52,318 --> 00:49:56,159
and yet they're still around still

1463
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:58,720
operating like we were talking about

1464
00:49:56,159 --> 00:50:00,239
earlier back in the day never would have

1465
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:03,358
flown they would have been kicked out

1466
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:05,439
the community blacklisted i mean uh you

1467
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:07,920
know i can only think of one person in

1468
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:10,639
the past

1469
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:13,200
15 years that's been blacklisted and and

1470
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:15,039
it's finally coming down was res he was

1471
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:16,719
legit blacklisted you couldn't say his

1472
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:19,599
name without people jumping all over you

1473
00:50:16,719 --> 00:50:23,358
on the forums at one point but nowadays

1474
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:25,760
he's got fans again you know so

1475
00:50:23,358 --> 00:50:27,679
i mean america likes a redemption story

1476
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:29,440
and yeah it's been reinvented long

1477
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:31,199
enough most people don't even know that

1478
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:33,599
like despite

1479
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:35,838
uh despite all those shenanigans that we

1480
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:37,200
won't talk about like on the forums res

1481
00:50:35,838 --> 00:50:39,440
was a dick

1482
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:41,279
yeah even before then you know yeah even

1483
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:43,358
before the the nasty [ __ ] that happened

1484
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:45,280
even before that he was kind of a jerk

1485
00:50:43,358 --> 00:50:46,558
so i mean there's there's a part of it

1486
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,000
where it's like

1487
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:50,400
you know like you don't want to be like

1488
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,079
that like you know famous like simpsons

1489
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,960
thing where it's like old man yells at

1490
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:54,800
cloud

1491
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,240
yeah you know but there's an aspect

1492
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,680
where it's like in the community if you

1493
00:50:56,239 --> 00:50:59,838
want to have a community communities

1494
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:02,399
have norms and rules and stuff that like

1495
00:50:59,838 --> 00:51:03,440
people generally abide by to be polite

1496
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,200
yeah

1497
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,280
and in cannabis if you don't talk about

1498
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:09,199
that kind of stuff how would you ever

1499
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,640
know exactly

1500
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:12,318
so that's really why we wanted to kind

1501
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:14,400
of to chat about it back and forth about

1502
00:51:12,318 --> 00:51:16,719
different aspects of it because there's

1503
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:19,119
so many new people that like if there's

1504
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:20,000
people listening like to what the norms

1505
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:21,519
would be

1506
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,480
you know people get into arguments about

1507
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:25,039
this [ __ ]

1508
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:26,880
yeah because they're voluntary norms

1509
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:28,558
yeah

1510
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,000
they're voluntary norms so some people

1511
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:31,680
are just like [ __ ] you and [ __ ] your

1512
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,000
norm you know and i'm gonna do whatever

1513
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:36,159
i want joint breath it

1514
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,559
yeah i mean you know i feel bad he

1515
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:40,719
tricked peabud you know he turned around

1516
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:42,240
and just started selling chem cuts

1517
00:51:40,719 --> 00:51:44,239
because he knew he could

1518
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:46,959
yeah and told everybody

1519
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:48,558
and told everybody to eat a dick

1520
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:50,000
and i'm making three to five hundred a

1521
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:51,280
pop and there's people that want them

1522
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,199
that can't get them and i'm going to be

1523
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:57,280
the bridge that gets them to them yep

1524
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:59,838
so you know i mean

1525
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:02,880
it it's one of those things but with

1526
00:51:59,838 --> 00:52:05,358
breeding it's it it

1527
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,440
to me like breeding is like intention

1528
00:52:05,358 --> 00:52:09,358
and there's a lot of failure in it

1529
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:11,920
um and people have these crazy

1530
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:13,358
expectations of like what their breeders

1531
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,280
are actually doing

1532
00:52:13,358 --> 00:52:17,039
yeah they're germ testing and they're

1533
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,720
and they're pheno hunting and they're

1534
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:20,079
testing their own stuff and they're

1535
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:21,838
making sure

1536
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:23,440
and like we know people that do that but

1537
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:25,519
then it's like you have to sell seeds

1538
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,720
that are like a year or two years old

1539
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:28,400
yeah

1540
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:30,719
because it takes you that long to figure

1541
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,680
it out

1542
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:34,399
you know

1543
00:52:31,679 --> 00:52:35,679
another another big change is the name

1544
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,920
game

1545
00:52:35,679 --> 00:52:39,838
uh in the past several years i know like

1546
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,358
back in the day we all had to do due

1547
00:52:39,838 --> 00:52:43,920
diligence of making sure when we're

1548
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:45,598
choosing names you better have [ __ ]

1549
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,440
went and searched online to make sure

1550
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:49,039
nobody else used that [ __ ] name or

1551
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:51,760
you're gonna have some problems you know

1552
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:53,519
yeah even i took it super serious at one

1553
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:56,640
point like where people took our name we

1554
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:58,318
like yo bro we put time energy

1555
00:52:56,639 --> 00:52:59,679
you know [ __ ]

1556
00:52:58,318 --> 00:53:01,838
testing

1557
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:03,838
marketing into that name and you just

1558
00:53:01,838 --> 00:53:05,759
branding with it yeah it's our branding

1559
00:53:03,838 --> 00:53:08,239
with our branding yeah yeah and there

1560
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:09,520
was no legal recourse and nobody most of

1561
00:53:08,239 --> 00:53:11,759
us don't give a [ __ ] about legal

1562
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:13,759
recourse even if there was so it's more

1563
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,960
like you know you're stepping on toes

1564
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,359
you know we're going to lock you out of

1565
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,880
this xyz if you [ __ ] with us like that

1566
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:20,719
it's not pressure

1567
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,559
yeah nowadays i've gotten to the point

1568
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:24,318
where i don't even really google names

1569
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:26,640
anymore because there's so many [ __ ]

1570
00:53:24,318 --> 00:53:28,079
companies with so many [ __ ] names

1571
00:53:26,639 --> 00:53:29,598
that i just look at it like dude if you

1572
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,720
came in after me

1573
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:32,400
and

1574
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:34,959
you haven't put a lot of time into this

1575
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,480
name i don't give a [ __ ] what you say

1576
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,480
it's just really where it's gone because

1577
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,599
there's the the written rules have just

1578
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,119
been out the window there's too many

1579
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:44,480
people there's too many names well i

1580
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:46,480
mean it's not one-offs if 95 of the seed

1581
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:48,079
if the seed groups are in the last five

1582
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:50,000
or six seven years

1583
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:53,039
and every time they make crosses they

1584
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,159
give a new name to those 20 things yes

1585
00:53:53,039 --> 00:53:56,318
then all of a sudden you've got

1586
00:53:54,159 --> 00:53:58,159
thousands upon thousands of new names

1587
00:53:56,318 --> 00:53:59,759
and you can't even keep track

1588
00:53:58,159 --> 00:54:00,799
exactly you used to be able to keep

1589
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,640
track

1590
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,800
yes there was only so many people doing

1591
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:06,960
it and so many established companies and

1592
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:09,280
you could kind of keep an eye on it

1593
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,800
yeah now i mean jesus christ

1594
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,079
yeah me and caleb were talking last

1595
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,240
night and we couldn't even keep track of

1596
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:15,920
each other's names like we sometimes

1597
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:17,679
we'll ask like hey did you use this name

1598
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:20,240
anymore before because we both kind of

1599
00:54:17,679 --> 00:54:21,598
think the same way on names and uh i

1600
00:54:20,239 --> 00:54:23,679
don't know i'll have to go look i mean

1601
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:25,680
we don't even know what we've made

1602
00:54:23,679 --> 00:54:26,480
with him i just i always just ask him

1603
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:29,118
like

1604
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:30,960
remind me what the parents are yeah yeah

1605
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:32,800
that's the best way to do it

1606
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,480
you know yeah well i mean he's so

1607
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:36,880
prolific by himself

1608
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,400
yeah exactly there's a lot of names you

1609
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:41,280
know he's that remember he used to have

1610
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:43,200
those name auctions yeah not auctions

1611
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:45,280
but like you know like crowdsourcing

1612
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:47,279
names yeah because he has to come up

1613
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:48,880
with some of them yep you have to come

1614
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,960
up with hundreds of names

1615
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,640
what am i gonna call this i used to do

1616
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:54,240
that until every [ __ ] name i got was

1617
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:55,920
dumbs [ __ ]

1618
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:57,439
and i was like oh i'm not gonna use this

1619
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:00,880
there's no way

1620
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,880
hey he got some good names out of it

1621
00:55:02,318 --> 00:55:06,079
i just lost you there for a second can

1622
00:55:03,838 --> 00:55:07,519
you hear me oh okay yeah i can hear you

1623
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:08,960
it probably was me

1624
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:10,880
yeah but

1625
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:12,960
[ __ ] mendo service

1626
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:15,119
it's actually not too bad for hill life

1627
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:18,000
you know it isn't too bad out there no

1628
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:20,318
it's not too bad on that no but

1629
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,280
i mean i uh i am in a dark corner for

1630
00:55:20,318 --> 00:55:24,400
quiet

1631
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:25,680
yeah so yeah that's working it is

1632
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,920
but yeah i mean i

1633
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:29,679
so i think i don't even think that like

1634
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:31,440
i would say within the last 10 years

1635
00:55:29,679 --> 00:55:33,919
just about everything that was common

1636
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:36,240
with seeds is now flipped on its head

1637
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:38,639
yes everything's feminized

1638
00:55:36,239 --> 00:55:40,479
there's no males to be had there's no

1639
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:42,480
rules anymore really

00:57:55,838 --> 00:58:00,719
the circles you know we talked about a

1712
00:57:57,519 --> 00:58:02,880

1717
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:12,798

1718
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:14,639
patreon i tell them just chill just

1719
00:58:12,798 --> 00:58:16,559
chill because when we say we are

1720
00:58:14,639 --> 00:58:18,480
watching we're not just watching people

1721
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:20,000
that are bad we're not just watching for

1722
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:21,519
people to [ __ ] up and call them out on

1723
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,559
it we're watching for people with

1724
00:58:21,519 --> 00:58:25,358
passion

1725
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:27,680
you know like we want we want to find

1726
00:58:25,358 --> 00:58:29,519
these people that are

1727
00:58:27,679 --> 00:58:31,279
passionate about cannabis like we are

1728
00:58:29,519 --> 00:58:33,358
that are [ __ ] nerds for the genetics

1729
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,798
like we are and we're watching and we'll

1730
00:58:33,358 --> 00:58:37,119
yank you into our circle if we think

1731
00:58:34,798 --> 00:58:38,318
you're [ __ ] serious we will you know

1732
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:40,000
um

1733
00:58:38,318 --> 00:58:41,599
i think a lot of people don't have a lot

1734
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,280
of patience or don't think that any of

1735
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:44,880
that is actively going on still but

1736
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:47,359
there are places it's still actively

1737
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,960
going on to bring people into circles so

1738
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:50,719
yeah and because that's because the the

1739
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,000
whole preservation i guess you could

1740
00:58:50,719 --> 00:58:53,759
call like the whole preservation

1741
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,639
community whether it's history

1742
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:59,119
preservation or clone preservation or

1743
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:00,798
seed preservation there's only so many

1744
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:02,480
of us and so when you find someone

1745
00:59:00,798 --> 00:59:05,759
that's willing to take the time and the

1746
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:07,599
effort and spend the money and care

1747
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:09,040
yeah you know well okay now i got like

1748
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:10,960
another now we have another crew member

1749
00:59:09,039 --> 00:59:12,558
that has similar interests and they're

1750
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:14,000
actually willing to it

1751
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:16,160
um there's a bunch of people that want

1752
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,599
to gain trust real fast because they

1753
00:59:16,159 --> 00:59:19,199
want access to these things and they

1754
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:21,280
want to flip it and monetize it and they

1755
00:59:19,199 --> 00:59:22,798
have dreams for themselves and like

1756
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:25,760
i feel for them

1757
00:59:22,798 --> 00:59:28,159
because honestly like most of the famous

1758
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:30,720
cuts that i got i just got because i was

1759
00:59:28,159 --> 00:59:32,639
around the right people

1760
00:59:30,719 --> 00:59:34,239
you know yeah there wasn't like you know

1761
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:35,838
i don't want you to say the forrest gump

1762
00:59:34,239 --> 00:59:37,279
of wheat but it you know there wasn't

1763
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:39,119
anything special

1764
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,720
it was just how you acted and how you

1765
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:42,079
were and where you were around and who

1766
00:59:40,719 --> 00:59:43,519
you were friends with and it's kind of

1767
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:46,000
spread from there

1768
00:59:43,519 --> 00:59:47,838
and most of the trading that i've done

1769
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,079
with people that i'm personally friends

1770
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:52,639
with in real life and i see their face

1771
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:54,480
has been positive yeah

1772
00:59:52,639 --> 00:59:56,480
when i got on ig i didn't realize how

1773
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:58,159
many scammers there were

1774
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:00,079
no you didn't i don't know

1775
00:59:58,159 --> 01:00:01,440
and how many people would run months

1776
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:03,760
game

1777
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:05,838
yeah try to get access to certain things

1778
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:07,760
i remember when i first talked to natso

1779
01:00:05,838 --> 01:00:10,719
he was so bright-eyed and bushy-tailed

1780
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:12,880
and just he did not see the the negative

1781
01:00:10,719 --> 01:00:15,199
in people yet and he's had a crash

1782
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:17,039
course in it like we all have you know

1783
01:00:15,199 --> 01:00:19,199
well you know

1784
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:20,960
i crawled out of my rock and mendo or

1785
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:23,039
whatever and i got on ig and started

1786
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:25,280
looking around after a long hiatus of

1787
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:27,039
internet action and

1788
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:28,880
you know there's all these people where

1789
01:00:27,039 --> 01:00:30,558
did these different cuts survive where

1790
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:32,559
did these different things survive all

1791
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:34,960
of a sudden people are chatting again

1792
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:35,760
and so i was looking for people like me

1793
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,519
yeah

1794
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:39,200
you know i mean there's maybe we should

1795
01:00:37,519 --> 01:00:41,119
say this too where it's like there's

1796
01:00:39,199 --> 01:00:43,279
various people that have given that have

1797
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:45,760
given like given flack thinking that

1798
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:47,680
like i'm about to like release like some

1799
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:49,839
expensive seeds or something like that

1800
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:52,480
because there's this aspect which is

1801
01:00:49,838 --> 01:00:53,920
hilarious if you know me

1802
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:55,358
because good friends of mine have been

1803
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,559
trying to get me to do this for years

1804
01:00:55,358 --> 01:00:57,598
and i just don't

1805
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:59,359
but

1806
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:01,039
but it's like this is it's more like

1807
01:00:59,358 --> 01:01:02,159
talking about historical things that

1808
01:01:01,039 --> 01:01:03,119
interest us

1809
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:05,358
yeah

1810
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:08,000
and everyone in in like a lot of these

1811
01:01:05,358 --> 01:01:09,838
weed podcasts it's also infomercially

1812
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,599
and it's also promoting and you could

1813
01:01:09,838 --> 01:01:13,679
gotta do some promotion

1814
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:16,160
to it's not like it's all bad by any

1815
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:19,118
means but the fact that we do so much

1816
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:21,358
that doesn't even isn't even about us

1817
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:23,358
people trip out yeah i think it [ __ ]

1818
01:01:21,358 --> 01:01:24,880
people up because there's like well

1819
01:01:23,358 --> 01:01:26,480
where is the angle

1820
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:28,240
yeah where's the motive why are they

1821
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:30,880
taking two hours on a friday night it's

1822
01:01:28,239 --> 01:01:32,399
a [ __ ] because they're [ __ ] nerds

1823
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:34,798
well it might be that we're nerds but

1824
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:36,639
it's also the same thing where

1825
01:01:34,798 --> 01:01:38,318
you know i realized when matt and i were

1826
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:40,318
talking about doing something like this

1827
01:01:38,318 --> 01:01:42,719
it's more like if we don't get a chance

1828
01:01:40,318 --> 01:01:44,960
to chat back and forth about how things

1829
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:47,199
are and how we'd like them to be or how

1830
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:49,519
they were and why they were that way

1831
01:01:47,199 --> 01:01:52,078
then you can just watch it all go away

1832
01:01:49,519 --> 01:01:54,000
yeah yeah you know and maybe there's you

1833
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:55,599
know maybe there's you know there's a

1834
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,119
few there's a few people listening

1835
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:58,480
that'll go away from that be like man i

1836
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:00,318
liked what i heard

1837
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:02,400
yeah i'm gonna take that and apply it my

1838
01:02:00,318 --> 01:02:04,400
own life i like that etiquette with cuts

1839
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:06,000
i like that etiquette with seeds

1840
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:09,200
yeah i like trading with people that

1841
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,559
have the the similar vibe or heart to me

1842
01:02:09,199 --> 01:02:14,239
yeah

1843
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:16,240
you know and uh you know and so

1844
01:02:14,239 --> 01:02:17,838
you know and then you you learn like all

1845
01:02:16,239 --> 01:02:19,279
this stuff is kind of underground so if

1846
01:02:17,838 --> 01:02:21,440
you weren't there

1847
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:24,319
um you uh

1848
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:25,920
you know you just wouldn't know

1849
01:02:24,318 --> 01:02:28,000
yeah in that regard

1850
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:29,280
i we also tried to bring back something

1851
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,639
like that a long time ago a lot of

1852
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:33,280
people don't know about it but the nugs

1853
01:02:30,639 --> 01:02:35,440
and jugs like the meetups the the

1854
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:37,359
harvest cups that you guys would throw

1855
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:38,880
up in mendo

1856
01:02:37,358 --> 01:02:41,358
we tried to bring that back for a little

1857
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:42,000
bit until um covet obviously got a hold

1858
01:02:41,358 --> 01:02:43,119
of

1859
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,280
the culture

1860
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:48,079
but yeah hopefully we'll be keeping that

1861
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:50,240
alive as well which i mean

1862
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:52,318
those kind of like gatherings where it's

1863
01:02:50,239 --> 01:02:54,719
a few hundred people of like-minded

1864
01:02:52,318 --> 01:02:55,599
heads yeah i mean honestly like that's

1865
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:58,399

1908
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:21,280
tell

1909
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:23,680
that was really cool that made me go

1910
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:25,359
like dude this guy's [ __ ] legit but

1911
01:04:23,679 --> 01:04:26,879
he's like he's you know he's

1912
01:04:25,358 --> 01:04:28,000
he was a breeder for a long time who

1913
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:29,920
cares yeah

1914
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,920
i mean i have i have a bubba cut that i

1915
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:33,838
still have shaw baba on

1916
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:36,000
yeah that's still every says on my tag

1917
01:04:33,838 --> 01:04:37,920
too you know it still says shaw bubba

1918
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,318
because you know so

1919
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:41,838
he's just one of those guys you know um

1920
01:04:40,318 --> 01:04:44,000
but you know we could we could speak

1921
01:04:41,838 --> 01:04:46,400
about this too to people that don't know

1922
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:48,000
like there was an aspect when forums

1923
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:49,519
first started

1924
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,679
where all of a sudden

1925
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:53,280
um people could get on there and start

1926
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:56,159
pushing the narrative that they wanted

1927
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:57,599
to yeah about who they were right and so

1928
01:04:56,159 --> 01:04:58,960
maybe we should touch on this for a

1929
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:01,760
minute because there's a lot of people

1930
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:03,358
now with social media that have these

1931
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:05,200
personas

1932
01:05:03,358 --> 01:05:07,679
and some of these people have like small

1933
01:05:05,199 --> 01:05:09,838
armies of people that defend the person

1934
01:05:07,679 --> 01:05:11,279
oh yeah yeah they've never met them in

1935
01:05:09,838 --> 01:05:13,759
real life and don't know any of the

1936
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:14,880
backstory but they're in love with the

1937
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:16,799
persona

1938
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:19,760
it's it's something i've noticed and you

1939
01:05:16,798 --> 01:05:22,559
know i i'm a nerd for the ufo field

1940
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:24,799
so i see it in that community too

1941
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:27,519
and it's

1942
01:05:24,798 --> 01:05:29,358
it's an aspect of humans that i think

1943
01:05:27,519 --> 01:05:31,519
that we don't recognize but it's a

1944
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:34,558
religious aspect to us some some form of

1945
01:05:31,519 --> 01:05:35,838
religiosity where we we see someone we

1946
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:37,200
have this

1947
01:05:35,838 --> 01:05:39,279
idea of them

1948
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:41,759
and no one can change that no matter

1949
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:44,319
what and if anybody says anything that

1950
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:47,119
counters that narrative it

1951
01:05:44,318 --> 01:05:49,679
we get defensive and i see that in in

1952
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:51,519
ufology i see it in politics and of

1953
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:53,679
course it's in the seed world you know

1954
01:05:51,519 --> 01:05:55,599
people like people do love a good story

1955
01:05:53,679 --> 01:05:57,358
people love a good story and so there's

1956
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:59,920
and so in the wheat community especially

1957
01:05:57,358 --> 01:06:01,038
with ig right now there's heroes and

1958
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:05,039
heels

1959
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:05,039
yes i'm a heel that would be called

1960
01:06:05,838 --> 01:06:09,679
matt's the bad guy yes you know matt's

1961
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:12,079

1962
01:06:09,679 --> 01:06:14,399
suplexed you know like i have a very

1963
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:15,920
punchable face and all that stuff

1964
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:18,480
but people have people have heroes and

1965
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:20,559
then there's backstory and like even

1966
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:22,798
talking about the backstory gets hard

1967
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:24,559
because so many people jump in

1968
01:06:22,798 --> 01:06:26,159
and people have like some people have

1969
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:28,480
like 15 accounts

1970
01:06:26,159 --> 01:06:30,318
you know but yeah even 20 years ago this

1971
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:32,480
happened because there was only so many

1972
01:06:30,318 --> 01:06:33,519
new things so like when the forum

1973
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:36,079
started

1974
01:06:33,519 --> 01:06:39,440
who got famous dude you know like uh

1975
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:42,160
brothers grimm got famous yeah right uh

1976
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:44,480
dj short blueberry stuff got famous

1977
01:06:42,159 --> 01:06:47,118
there was half a dozen breeders

1978
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:49,280
that people had grow threads on forums

1979
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:50,480
of beautiful weed and they got super

1980
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:51,839
well known

1981
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:53,519
and then they had clout and people

1982
01:06:51,838 --> 01:06:55,599
wanted their seeds and people were

1983
01:06:53,519 --> 01:06:57,119
buying and trading and selling

1984
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:59,039
amongst each other and doing a bunch of

1985
01:06:57,119 --> 01:07:00,559
crosses and that happens today in the

1986
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:02,880
last four or five years there's people

1987
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:04,798
that have come on ig

1988
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:05,920
made a backstory out of smoke and

1989
01:07:04,798 --> 01:07:07,838
mirrors

1990
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:09,599
and five years later they have hundreds

1991
01:07:07,838 --> 01:07:11,358
of people that'll defend them

1992
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:12,960
they came out of nowhere and they made

1993
01:07:11,358 --> 01:07:14,318
up their little path

1994
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:16,880
and they don't even care because they

1995
01:07:14,318 --> 01:07:19,358
know 95 percent of people won't won't

1996
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:21,599
ever hear the truth

1997
01:07:19,358 --> 01:07:22,960
or will we or will would reject it

1998
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:26,318
because their buddy the guy did

1999
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:28,960
something nice for him once yeah yeah

2000
01:07:26,318 --> 01:07:31,440
yeah they'll never be able to ask

2001
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:33,199
for example some guy hey is this dude

2002
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:34,639
your uncle like because they don't even

2003
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:36,159
have access to ask the guy that they're

2004
01:07:34,639 --> 01:07:37,920
just going to take it on faith you know

2005
01:07:36,159 --> 01:07:39,920
and some some people people talk about

2006
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:41,599
eventually these people do like res or

2007
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:43,039
swerve or different people they don't

2008
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:45,119
last forever

2009
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:46,640
because humans like aren't invulnerable

2010
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:48,318
to new information

2011
01:07:46,639 --> 01:07:51,598
eventually you can act enough like an

2012
01:07:48,318 --> 01:07:53,519
idiot over time that enough bubbles up

2013
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:55,200
right and that it's or that you just

2014
01:07:53,519 --> 01:07:57,679
lose interest and you can't keep the

2015
01:07:55,199 --> 01:07:59,439
scam going for that long yeah you know

2016
01:07:57,679 --> 01:08:02,078
the people that have been that have been

2017
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:03,679
breeding for a long time and and caring

2018
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:05,119
you know there's a lot of people where

2019
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:06,639
it's like if they won the lottery they

2020
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:07,920
wouldn't grow anymore

2021
01:08:06,639 --> 01:08:09,440
yeah

2022
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:11,440
the people were sure the people that

2023
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:13,039
were talking about like if if they won

2024
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:15,039
the lottery they would just be stoked to

2025
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:17,520
do these weird projects that they

2026
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:18,880
couldn't afford before yeah

2027
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,960
because now they don't even have to rely

2028
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:22,880
on it financially and somebody said

2029
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:25,520
somebody said dave watson sam the skunk

2030
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:27,199
man i mean people can he's like one of

2031
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:29,040
the most controversial characters in

2032
01:08:27,198 --> 01:08:29,759
cannabis probably

2033
01:08:29,039 --> 01:08:31,439
but

2034
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:33,920
that [ __ ] has been on every

2035
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:36,000
forum since the beginning

2036
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:38,000
pitching his version of events and the

2037
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,838
version of events that he wants people

2038
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,960
to know

2039
01:08:39,838 --> 01:08:45,920
sure and there's not a bunch of

2040
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:47,439
opposing viewpoints from that same era

2041
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:49,600
no there isn't

2042
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:51,358
you know so i i just brought him up

2043
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:53,199
because people were talking about him

2044
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:55,920
but he was i'm pretty sure he was know

2045
01:08:53,198 --> 01:08:57,039
it all for sure on cannabis world yeah

2046
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:59,039
and he would get on there and he would

2047
01:08:57,039 --> 01:09:01,838
argue about skunk one and hayes and

2048
01:08:59,039 --> 01:09:03,519
origins and he knew and people have been

2049
01:09:01,838 --> 01:09:06,399
debating this stuff forever

2050
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:07,920
yeah and people would get on teams

2051
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:09,358
there's team i believe him and there's

2052
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:11,679
team i don't

2053
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:14,640
i was on team neville there's

2054
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:16,239
team dea and there's team misunderstood

2055
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:17,838
yeah and right now there's a bunch of

2056
01:09:16,238 --> 01:09:21,439
that there's a bunch of people where

2057
01:09:17,838 --> 01:09:22,798
like you know the the group of breeders

2058
01:09:21,439 --> 01:09:24,559
and the group of collectors and stuff

2059
01:09:22,798 --> 01:09:26,719
who share a bunch of information like we

2060
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:29,199
basically know reasonably speaking who's

2061
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:30,719
legit and who's not yeah

2062
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:32,960
you know and it's and it's not so much

2063
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:34,640
about like their work or this or that

2064
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:36,079
it's basically whether or not like are

2065
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:38,319
they a decent human being are they

2066
01:09:36,079 --> 01:09:39,759
honestly trying yeah that's really how

2067
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:41,600
it shakes out it's not like there's some

2068
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:43,520
like huge behavioral

2069
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:45,440
like thing but it's like

2070
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:47,440
are you generally honest

2071
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:50,719
and what you know and then

2072
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:52,559
yeah and i spawned a wave of dishonest

2073
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:54,319
there's there's there's people like who

2074
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:56,000
whose work like i would not do the same

2075
01:09:54,319 --> 01:09:57,359
kind of work they're doing necessarily

2076
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,439
or i wouldn't make the same choices

2077
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:00,960
they're making but generally speaking

2078
01:09:59,439 --> 01:10:02,879
they're they're good human beings and

2079
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:04,000
they're doing what they love and they

2080
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:06,159
don't lie

2081
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,079
so those are the people that that i

2082
01:10:06,158 --> 01:10:10,319
think are cool you know but then there's

2083
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:12,640
people who like maybe they maybe they

2084
01:10:10,319 --> 01:10:14,799
did make a cross but they suck at life

2085
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:17,360

01:11:35,198 --> 01:11:39,839
is the ad instrument out of tune

2126
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,920
why can't they ever harmonize you

2127
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:43,199
knowings for [ __ ] everybody knows

2128
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:44,000
this

2129
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:45,759
so

2130
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:48,479
but yeah i mean it's it's it's the same

2131
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:50,079
thing like you can you cannot like a

2132
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:52,479
breeder's work

2133
01:11:50,079 --> 01:11:54,559
and still respect their process

2134
01:11:52,479 --> 01:11:56,718
yeah like they do it right i just don't

2135
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:58,159
prefer it yeah exactly exactly you know

2136
01:11:56,719 --> 01:12:00,640
what i mean like the stuff that they

2137
01:11:58,158 --> 01:12:03,039
love i don't love as much i prefer to

2138
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:04,400
work with different stuff

2139
01:12:03,039 --> 01:12:06,880
you know that's kind of that's kind of

2140
01:12:04,399 --> 01:12:08,719
where it is in that regard you know yeah

2141
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:09,679
and so you know they

2142
01:12:08,719 --> 01:12:11,520
um

2143
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:12,319
but there's a lot of fraud out there and

2144
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:14,000
so

2145
01:12:12,319 --> 01:12:16,799
where matt has gotten in trouble and

2146
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:19,439
part of the reason why he's a heel

2147
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:22,079
and a villain is because he's been

2148
01:12:19,439 --> 01:12:24,639
calling out [ __ ] since the forums

2149
01:12:22,079 --> 01:12:26,880
yeah and he tries to let people know

2150
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:28,480
that like hey this might not be legit or

2151
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:29,760
you should know about this or this or

2152
01:12:28,479 --> 01:12:30,799
that or whatever and sometimes it's

2153
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:33,520
abrasive

2154
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:35,199
or whatever but you get enemies and not

2155
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:37,199
only do you get the enemy of the person

2156
01:12:35,198 --> 01:12:39,439
that you're outing their [ __ ] but

2157
01:12:37,198 --> 01:12:40,799
maybe their little fan base too

2158
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:43,039
yeah because these people have all

2159
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:44,800
invested in their seeds and and

2160
01:12:43,039 --> 01:12:47,359
basically they have a financial

2161
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:49,119
incentive to want this to be true yeah

2162
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:50,880
and then or they have a financial

2163
01:12:49,119 --> 01:12:53,840
incentive to make sure they didn't waste

2164
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:55,760
their money yeah and when they believed

2165
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:57,840
you know that i believed i dropped this

2166
01:12:55,760 --> 01:13:00,480
much money on whoever's

2167
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:02,319
yeah there can't be a fraud yeah you

2168
01:13:00,479 --> 01:13:03,519
know this stuff can't be for these this

2169
01:13:02,319 --> 01:13:05,840
what do you what do you mean they

2170
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:07,600
outsource their seeds to dinafem from

2171
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:09,360
spain yeah they don't even make them

2172
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:11,039
themselves that can't be true i just

2173
01:13:09,359 --> 01:13:12,559
spent a thousand bucks

2174
01:13:11,039 --> 01:13:14,880
yeah i mean there was a person i can't

2175
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:16,480
remember who it was but like you know uh

2176
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:18,079
there's this you know there's all these

2177
01:13:16,479 --> 01:13:19,519
people that are selling ancient skunk

2178
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:21,439
one now

2179
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:23,040
right remember that guy that there was

2180
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:25,678
some guy that spent like five thousand

2181
01:13:23,039 --> 01:13:28,800
bucks on blue or skies vienna's

2182
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:30,480
fake skunk one roadkill yeah yeah and he

2183
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,679
created like a whole page because he was

2184
01:13:30,479 --> 01:13:33,678
so pissed

2185
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:34,560
yeah because he went through all these

2186
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:36,158
seeds

2187
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:38,000
yeah i'm going to find what i want to

2188
01:13:36,158 --> 01:13:39,759
find it's in there

2189
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,279
you know and then you get scammed and

2190
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:42,800
you're like god damn it but some people

2191
01:13:41,279 --> 01:13:44,960
are embarrassed and instead of and they

2192
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:47,600
just they defend whatever person

2193
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:50,000
yeah yeah and we all don't have to get

2194
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:51,920
along either yeah no that'll never

2195
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,920
happen you know i mean i'm not saying

2196
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:55,679
kumbaya like some people just naturally

2197
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:57,520
aren't going to be friends or see eye to

2198
01:13:55,679 --> 01:14:01,119
eye or their behaviors aren't going to

2199
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:02,640
be meshed that's cool too yeah you know

2200
01:14:01,119 --> 01:14:04,559
but there's a difference between like i

2201
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:07,360
don't really like you as a person and i

2202
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:07,360
think you're like a

2203
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:15,760
yeah you know because there's some

2204
01:14:12,319 --> 01:14:17,359
shitty ass people uh that um

2205
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:18,239
that made great seeds

2206
01:14:17,359 --> 01:14:20,158
yeah

2207
01:14:18,238 --> 01:14:22,238
or that source great seeds that's

2208
01:14:20,158 --> 01:14:23,599
happened too that's happened too there's

2209
01:14:22,238 --> 01:14:25,359
there's people that aren't the most

2210
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:28,640
exemplary human beings

2211
01:14:25,359 --> 01:14:31,359
um that amazing stuff came from stuff

2212
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:33,119
they hunted or stuff they were given or

2213
01:14:31,359 --> 01:14:35,679
stuff they stumbled into

2214
01:14:33,119 --> 01:14:37,359
and it probably wouldn't exist if if

2215
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:39,600
if they didn't do it

2216
01:14:37,359 --> 01:14:42,880
yeah they're a total scumbag and [ __ ]

2217
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:43,679
but they uh you know the seeds are still

2218
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:46,000
good

2219
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:48,239
and it's not the seeds fault

2220
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,600
it's not like there's original sin if

2221
01:14:48,238 --> 01:14:51,359
you're into that you know there's not

2222
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:53,840
like they're not tainted

2223
01:14:51,359 --> 01:14:54,880
by anything like that you know

2224
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:57,440
so

2225
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:58,960
um but yeah you try to so that's part of

2226
01:14:57,439 --> 01:15:00,559
it it's like you try to establish to

2227
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:02,719
bring it all back you try to establish

2228
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:04,159
norms you try to talk about what's

2229
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:05,600
acceptable and the reason why there's

2230
01:15:04,158 --> 01:15:07,839
norms

2231
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:10,480
most norms get set up because people

2232
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:12,000
decide this [ __ ] can't stand

2233
01:15:10,479 --> 01:15:13,599
we need some [ __ ] rules up in this

2234
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,359
piece

2235
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,880
right yeah like humans

2236
01:15:15,359 --> 01:15:19,198
yeah we need some we need some like we

2237
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:21,279
need some like rules of engagement to

2238
01:15:19,198 --> 01:15:23,039
talk to people yeah and that's how all

2239
01:15:21,279 --> 01:15:25,119
these norms got created because back in

2240
01:15:23,039 --> 01:15:26,560
the day people on forums would [ __ ] each

2241
01:15:25,119 --> 01:15:28,880
other over

2242
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:30,800
and then it would get it would get outed

2243
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:32,560
and then behavioral things would change

2244
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:34,320
and then and then they'd be ostracized

2245
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:36,320
and you couldn't get stuff and then

2246
01:15:34,319 --> 01:15:37,359
people would self-regulate their own

2247
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:38,479
behavior

2248
01:15:37,359 --> 01:15:40,399
yeah

2249
01:15:38,479 --> 01:15:41,919
to stay within the norms of their little

2250
01:15:40,399 --> 01:15:43,759
community

2251
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:45,920
some of them tried some of them tried

2252
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:47,679
some would just go way off the deep end

2253
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:49,039
pulling a bsv

2254
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:50,480
yeah you know

2255
01:15:49,039 --> 01:15:53,039
i mean on some level even like in a

2256
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:55,919
music level it's like at some point you

2257
01:15:53,039 --> 01:15:58,640
stop the mosh pit and you help people up

2258
01:15:55,920 --> 01:16:00,239
yeah instead of stomping on the girl's

2259
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:02,880
head who fell over

2260
01:16:00,238 --> 01:16:04,839
yeah that became a norm yeah you know we

2261
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:07,440
can't have we can't have that we can get

2262
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:09,279
crazy yeah we can't have murders yeah we

2263
01:16:07,439 --> 01:16:11,198
can get crazy but we can't have like

2264
01:16:09,279 --> 01:16:13,119
hospital injuries and stuff like that

2265
01:16:11,198 --> 01:16:14,960
like and yeah and you know all that and

2266
01:16:13,119 --> 01:16:16,559
so that's another that's just the norm

2267
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:18,880
like people see things that develop and

2268
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:19,760
a norm develops around it

2269
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,520
and

2270
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:24,239
now with the speed of the internet and

2271
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:25,760
the speed of ig and the speed of changes

2272
01:16:24,238 --> 01:16:26,718
all those norms are sort of out the

2273
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:29,039
window

2274
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:33,279
yeah they're voluntary but you can be a

2275
01:16:29,039 --> 01:16:34,880
cool dude or or chick and a bam

2276
01:16:33,279 --> 01:16:37,039
because it like helps you get along with

2277
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:38,880
people you know yeah and it helps you

2278
01:16:37,039 --> 01:16:41,519
build a good reputation

2279
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:43,039
and it helps you you know it helps you

2280
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:44,880
like you know because that's what it is

2281
01:16:43,039 --> 01:16:46,319
it's like are you in weed for longevity

2282
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:47,840
or you just end it because it's popular

2283
01:16:46,319 --> 01:16:50,158
for a minute it was easy

2284
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:51,840
yeah we're going to see a lot of fallout

2285
01:16:50,158 --> 01:16:53,839
coming soon

2286
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:56,800
there's a lot less money in seeds than

2287
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:59,199
there's ever been since day one

2288
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:01,920
a lot less money and weed in production

2289
01:16:59,198 --> 01:17:03,359
especially in california and it's gonna

2290
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:05,520
it's gonna really hit the nation hard

2291
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:06,639
and and with the newest house resolution

2292
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:08,560
bill and i think it's gonna go through

2293
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:10,719
the senate if

2294
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:12,239
uh it's decriminalized we're gonna see a

2295
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:14,158
big change we don't know necessarily

2296
01:17:12,238 --> 01:17:16,559
what that change will be

2297
01:17:14,158 --> 01:17:19,359
but i'm i'm guessing there'll be um

2298
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:21,600
either a mass influx of more people

2299
01:17:19,359 --> 01:17:23,439
and the and the ones that weren't going

2300
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:25,520
to make it anyways that that were in for

2301
01:17:23,439 --> 01:17:27,039
the quick money are going to bounce and

2302
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:28,800
we'll see some more in it thinking

2303
01:17:27,039 --> 01:17:31,600
there's going to be quick money and have

2304
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:33,679
another quick bounce so i mean

2305
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:36,239
i always used to back in the day what

2306
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:39,359
made seed breeding feasible for me was

2307
01:17:36,238 --> 01:17:41,599
that uh flower prices were nice

2308
01:17:39,359 --> 01:17:43,359
yeah when flower prices were good

2309
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:45,120
i didn't care honestly about i was

2310
01:17:43,359 --> 01:17:47,198
trying to make better weed for myself

2311
01:17:45,119 --> 01:17:48,079
and my friends that was literally the

2312
01:17:47,198 --> 01:17:48,960
goal

2313
01:17:48,079 --> 01:17:50,800
um

2314
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:52,000
you know like i we made plenty of money

2315
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:54,000
off flower

2316
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,760
yeah i could have a four lighter i could

2317
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,679
have a couple of different things popped

2318
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:59,360
around i could have part of the hill

2319
01:17:57,679 --> 01:18:00,960
that i could breed on

2320
01:17:59,359 --> 01:18:03,279
yeah you know a little corner here and

2321
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:05,840
there and it was just fine

2322
01:18:03,279 --> 01:18:07,920
you know and so it it's going to be it's

2323
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:09,440
going to be less marketable because in

2324
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:11,359
order for all these seed breeders to

2325
01:18:09,439 --> 01:18:12,799
survive all these seed breeders came up

2326
01:18:11,359 --> 01:18:15,759
in an era where there was a ton of

2327
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:18,960
garage grows there was a ton of 215

2328
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:20,719
style small 25 to 100 plant grows all

2329
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:22,560
over the place there was a lot of

2330
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:24,560
individuals and they would come

2331
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:26,560
loaded down with harvest money to

2332
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:28,960
emerald cup in these different events

2333
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:31,520
looking to buy seeds for the next year

2334
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:33,600
yeah and as the money tightens up and

2335
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:35,280
all those small players get turned into

2336
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:37,039
much larger players

2337
01:18:35,279 --> 01:18:38,479
there's not going to be lines at every

2338
01:18:37,039 --> 01:18:41,679
seed company

2339
01:18:38,479 --> 01:18:43,678
at these shows but with money burning a

2340
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:45,520
hole in their pocket to buy seeds that

2341
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:46,960
may be bunk and maybe not

2342
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:48,880
yeah

2343
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:50,480
it's going to change the dynamic and so

2344
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:53,199
you know

2345
01:18:50,479 --> 01:18:55,678
yeah and so as that as that like as that

2346
01:18:53,198 --> 01:18:58,399
monetary reason goes out of it

2347
01:18:55,679 --> 01:19:00,158
i mean there was an era where in the 25

2348
01:18:58,399 --> 01:19:02,479
50 plant era when you were trying to

2349
01:19:00,158 --> 01:19:04,960
grow monsters a lot of people believed

2350
01:19:02,479 --> 01:19:06,799
that seed plants get bigger

2351
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:09,600
yeah and more vigorous so they would

2352
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:12,320
want to grow from seed stock

2353
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:14,159
and maybe they're going to grow 200 250

2354
01:19:12,319 --> 01:19:17,920
seeds and then select down to their

2355
01:19:14,158 --> 01:19:19,599
favorite 50 females yeah and grow those

2356
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,960
so they don't even care that half of

2357
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:22,480
them get tossed

2358
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:25,439
yeah

2359
01:19:22,479 --> 01:19:26,639
you know and that fueled a lot of seed

2360
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:28,639
sales

2361
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:30,560
and so if i had to if i was going to

2362
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:32,800
give advice to people

2363
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:34,719
that like you know as we get towards the

2364
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:36,480
end of this thing tonight or whatever

2365
01:19:34,719 --> 01:19:38,560
it's like if you have

2366
01:19:36,479 --> 01:19:40,479
if you want to breed the best way to

2367
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:42,880
breed and not be disappointed is just to

2368
01:19:40,479 --> 01:19:44,238
breed for yourself and your friends

2369
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:46,480
and to try to

2370
01:19:44,238 --> 01:19:47,279
put weed together that you like

2371
01:19:46,479 --> 01:19:49,119
yeah

2372
01:19:47,279 --> 01:19:51,039
i like these things i wonder what would

2373
01:19:49,119 --> 01:19:52,800
happen if i combine the two of them i

2374
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:54,319
wish i could get these traits from this

2375
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:56,480
side of the plant and these traits from

2376
01:19:54,319 --> 01:19:58,158
this plant into the same plant yeah

2377
01:19:56,479 --> 01:20:00,238
because then if no money ever comes from

2378
01:19:58,158 --> 01:20:02,399
it or anything like that or no fame or

2379
01:20:00,238 --> 01:20:05,599
no named cut or anything and nobody

2380
01:20:02,399 --> 01:20:07,119
gives a [ __ ] at least you cared

2381
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:09,360
it was good for you

2382
01:20:07,119 --> 01:20:12,319
yeah i mean if you smash jealousy and

2383
01:20:09,359 --> 01:20:13,679
gelato 41 by biscotti and you put all

2384
01:20:12,319 --> 01:20:15,439
this effort into it and then nobody

2385
01:20:13,679 --> 01:20:16,960
cares and you don't even like it then

2386
01:20:15,439 --> 01:20:19,519
maybe you're bummed

2387
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:20,880
yeah but if you like it and you're

2388
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:22,639
trying to do for something you like at

2389
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:24,319
least it's something you like

2390
01:20:22,639 --> 01:20:26,800
i hope people start breeding more for

2391
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:28,639
high again that's what i mean for stuff

2392
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:31,360
you like because

2393
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:33,359
because honestly like in the 90s

2394
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:35,519
the way we got famous was people had to

2395
01:20:33,359 --> 01:20:37,920
like it yeah

2396
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:40,159
it didn't really get famous on looks

2397
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:42,560
there was no testing there was no

2398
01:20:40,158 --> 01:20:45,039
terpene numbers or thc numbers or

2399
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:46,800
anything to go by it was like in a bag

2400
01:20:45,039 --> 01:20:49,920
or in a jar does it smell good does it

2401
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:51,440
burn good do i like the effect yeah and

2402
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:53,440
if it did those things it kind of got

2403
01:20:51,439 --> 01:20:55,198
famous and spread

2404
01:20:53,439 --> 01:20:56,960
and that's how all elites kind of got

2405
01:20:55,198 --> 01:20:58,719
developed was enough people like to

2406
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:00,560
smoke it

2407
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:02,158
right and so and it doesn't even it

2408
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:03,679
doesn't even mean that like everybody

2409
01:21:02,158 --> 01:21:05,759
has the same taste

2410
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:07,119
um you know matt doesn't like i've said

2411
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:09,280
it before matt doesn't like smoking the

2412
01:21:07,119 --> 01:21:11,760
chem 91 very much the dog

2413
01:21:09,279 --> 01:21:14,479
neither does caleb i love it

2414
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:15,600
you know um you know so breed for what

2415
01:21:14,479 --> 01:21:16,959
you like

2416
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:19,039
yeah

2417
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:21,279
you know what you want to smoke after

2418
01:21:19,039 --> 01:21:22,960
being pissed off during the daytime

2419
01:21:21,279 --> 01:21:24,319
or like you're putting on a comedy with

2420
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:27,039
your lady or whatever and you want to

2421
01:21:24,319 --> 01:21:29,198
like smoke a joint and have a good time

2422
01:21:27,039 --> 01:21:30,880
you know but i'm growing you like

2423
01:21:29,198 --> 01:21:33,198
yeah that's how i ended up with so much

2424
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:34,639
blueberry yeah

2425
01:21:33,198 --> 01:21:35,678
i love cool because people should have

2426
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:37,440
passions

2427
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:38,880
yeah and every and then everybody's

2428
01:21:37,439 --> 01:21:40,399
putting their own kind of flavor on

2429
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:43,199
things yeah

2430
01:21:40,399 --> 01:21:45,759
you know i mean there's a reason the i

2431
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:47,919
i've told matt this a bunch but like the

2432
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:50,480
the person most responsible for making

2433
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:52,800
sure that mendo p never disappears

2434
01:21:50,479 --> 01:21:54,959
is caleb yeah

2435
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:57,440
um because he's so prolific at crossing

2436
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:59,198
it into things even if i traded it to

2437
01:21:57,439 --> 01:22:02,079
different friends or whatever gave it

2438
01:21:59,198 --> 01:22:04,319
out freely it's still more people have

2439
01:22:02,079 --> 01:22:06,238
it because he bred it yeah and why did

2440
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:08,319
he breed it because he liked it

2441
01:22:06,238 --> 01:22:10,559
he personally liked it

2442
01:22:08,319 --> 01:22:12,079
yeah you know and so you personally

2443
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:14,159
liking something i think is like the

2444
01:22:12,079 --> 01:22:16,319
most important part of breeding

2445
01:22:14,158 --> 01:22:17,599
yeah you should give a [ __ ] yeah you

2446
01:22:16,319 --> 01:22:18,799
should give a [ __ ] you should give a

2447
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:21,199
[ __ ] about your own seats you should

2448
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:23,360
give a [ __ ] but then a lot of people and

2449
01:22:21,198 --> 01:22:25,839
i'm not going to name any names you know

2450
01:22:23,359 --> 01:22:27,679
don't even smoke i mean i smoke i

2451
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:29,199
probably smoke less than a lot of other

2452
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:30,800
breeders because i'm not a heavy heavy

2453
01:22:29,198 --> 01:22:32,399
smoker i smoke you know several times a

2454
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:35,039
day but i'm not like trying to get laid

2455
01:22:32,399 --> 01:22:36,399
out but there are people who don't smoke

2456
01:22:35,039 --> 01:22:38,158
at all

2457
01:22:36,399 --> 01:22:40,399
making their seeds like you have no

2458
01:22:38,158 --> 01:22:42,719
interest at all in smoking they could

2459
01:22:40,399 --> 01:22:44,399
care less and and it's i think it's

2460
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:45,920
really hard unless you have like someone

2461
01:22:44,399 --> 01:22:48,319
that you really trust and you trust

2462
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:50,800
their opinion on high to to breathe that

2463
01:22:48,319 --> 01:22:51,679
way you know i mean it's being it's it's

2464
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,480
like

2465
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:54,639
you know

2466
01:22:52,479 --> 01:22:56,079
um being a chef but you don't eat most

2467
01:22:54,639 --> 01:22:57,840
of the food you cook

2468
01:22:56,079 --> 01:22:59,519
yeah exactly

2469
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:01,440
if you if you're not into tasting your

2470
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:03,120
own work how really are you gonna like

2471
01:23:01,439 --> 01:23:04,399
make yourself i mean

2472
01:23:03,119 --> 01:23:06,079
we're not gonna chat about it tonight

2473
01:23:04,399 --> 01:23:08,079
but like the way that i the way that i

2474
01:23:06,079 --> 01:23:10,238
grow and the way that i cure the way

2475
01:23:08,079 --> 01:23:12,319
that i dry my weed and how i treat it

2476
01:23:10,238 --> 01:23:14,718
and all that yeah there's like crop

2477
01:23:12,319 --> 01:23:16,880
after crop after crop of like learning

2478
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:18,639
about like oh this [ __ ] it up

2479
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:20,319
yeah this made it better

2480
01:23:18,639 --> 01:23:22,480
oh this is this is definitely and so it

2481
01:23:20,319 --> 01:23:24,000
gets refined over time

2482
01:23:22,479 --> 01:23:25,439
yeah because you're giving yourself

2483
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,840
feedback

2484
01:23:25,439 --> 01:23:30,638
right yourself feedback

2485
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:32,960
and so you know like if how are you

2486
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:34,400
gonna know if if the seeds you make are

2487
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:37,198
special if you don't even pop any of

2488
01:23:34,399 --> 01:23:39,359
them yeah you'll never know you'll never

2489
01:23:37,198 --> 01:23:41,198
truly know you'll never truly know and

2490
01:23:39,359 --> 01:23:43,039
you know any prolific breeder ends up

2491
01:23:41,198 --> 01:23:43,919
making way more seeds than they can ever

2492
01:23:43,039 --> 01:23:45,039
test

2493
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:46,880
yeah

2494
01:23:45,039 --> 01:23:48,880
um you know

2495
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:51,039
caleb's crazy unique and that he has

2496
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:53,440
multiple rooms that he can regularly pop

2497
01:23:51,039 --> 01:23:55,359
off phenol hunts in all the time

2498
01:23:53,439 --> 01:23:58,158
yeah most breeders don't even have that

2499
01:23:55,359 --> 01:24:01,119
luxury no of having that much space to

2500
01:23:58,158 --> 01:24:03,198
not only pheno hunt but also to breed

2501
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:05,359
yeah you need a lot of separate

2502
01:24:03,198 --> 01:24:07,119
locations in order to do stuff like that

2503
01:24:05,359 --> 01:24:09,279
yeah especially if you're doing if

2504
01:24:07,119 --> 01:24:11,519
you're doing seedless and seeded yeah

2505
01:24:09,279 --> 01:24:12,399
exactly that [ __ ] drifts

2506
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:13,679
yeah

2507
01:24:12,399 --> 01:24:14,799
sure does

2508
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:17,920
you know

2509
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:19,679
so i mean i don't know seeds seeds

2510
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:21,440
basically they're i used to call it all

2511
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:23,359
the time a labor of love

2512
01:24:21,439 --> 01:24:25,839
yeah it's a lot of failure

2513
01:24:23,359 --> 01:24:26,880
um you know it's time it's money it's

2514
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:27,840
energy

2515
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:29,760
um

2516
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:32,159
maybe nobody will like it

2517
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:34,000
you know so it's like it it really is

2518
01:24:32,158 --> 01:24:35,279
like it's it's

2519
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,840
do what you love

2520
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:40,559
yeah and if you start selling them

2521
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:43,119
people [ __ ] hate you immediately

2522
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:44,800
instantly you become a [ __ ] [ __ ]

2523
01:24:43,119 --> 01:24:45,920
it's just part of what it's part of it

2524
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:48,159
well yeah because then you have to deal

2525
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:50,158
with the public yep this many didn't

2526
01:24:48,158 --> 01:24:51,119
germ now you have to put a price on

2527
01:24:50,158 --> 01:24:52,879
something

2528
01:24:51,119 --> 01:24:54,238
this this many you know and how many

2529
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:57,039
times are you going to believe everyone

2530
01:24:54,238 --> 01:24:59,039
and just send them nothing and and just

2531
01:24:57,039 --> 01:25:01,039
you know uh people are talking about

2532
01:24:59,039 --> 01:25:02,319
popping old seeds on there i mean

2533
01:25:01,039 --> 01:25:04,158
there's a bunch of stuff you can look up

2534
01:25:02,319 --> 01:25:06,158
on popping old seeds some people like to

2535
01:25:04,158 --> 01:25:07,599
soak them in an enzyme or a little

2536
01:25:06,158 --> 01:25:09,759
bleach or something like that super

2537
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:12,239
light acid number three is great for old

2538
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:14,880
seeds yeah some people like to to scuff

2539
01:25:12,238 --> 01:25:17,119
them like on a like how on on what you

2540

2543
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:24,400
there's there's you can buy crackers

01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:26,239
that are like little screws to where you

2545
01:25:24,399 --> 01:25:28,879
can like very lightly there's a lot of

2546
01:25:26,238 --> 01:25:31,279
work depends on how they're stored

2547
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:33,359
uh i mean we had with the with the

2548
01:25:31,279 --> 01:25:36,559
superdog project my partner who i did it

2549
01:25:33,359 --> 01:25:39,519
with um the way we really lost it after

2550
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:40,719
i lost mine was that he was on vacation

2551
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:43,440
and it was the middle of summer and he

2552
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:45,359
had a breaker flip in his garage

2553
01:25:43,439 --> 01:25:46,238
and his seed freezer turned into a seed

2554
01:25:45,359 --> 01:25:47,519
oven

2555
01:25:46,238 --> 01:25:49,359
oh no

2556
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:52,560
oh yeah 100

2557
01:25:49,359 --> 01:25:54,158
oh that sucks yeah breaker flipped

2558
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:55,920
and he was gone and it was the middle of

2559
01:25:54,158 --> 01:25:57,599
july and he was gone in the caribbean

2560
01:25:55,920 --> 01:26:00,000
for a couple of weeks and it just sat

2561
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:02,400
there at 120 degrees in his garage for a

2562
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,158
couple weeks that's all it takes and we

2563
01:26:02,399 --> 01:26:06,158
took we've tried we i mean we had

2564
01:26:04,158 --> 01:26:07,920
hundreds of those things yeah

2565
01:26:06,158 --> 01:26:10,000
you know thousands and we had all kinds

2566
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:11,920
of friends try we tried every single

2567
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,279
method

2568
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:15,119
couldn't get them to pop

2569
01:26:13,279 --> 01:26:17,198
yeah that's all it takes it doesn't take

2570
01:26:15,119 --> 01:26:18,960
long for uh for a good heat flash to

2571
01:26:17,198 --> 01:26:20,879
ring your whole collection so definitely

2572
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:22,719
so i mean there's there's times when

2573
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:25,199
it's like that there was literally like

2574
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:28,000
i mean there was there was you know big

2575
01:26:25,198 --> 01:26:29,678
ziploc bags just chock full of different

2576
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,319
different things and they're all good

2577
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:34,480
your seed freezer goes it's bad

2578
01:26:32,319 --> 01:26:36,479
yeah i had i had a similar thing

2579
01:26:34,479 --> 01:26:38,638
happened in san diego during one of the

2580
01:26:36,479 --> 01:26:41,919
real hot summers in 2008 my whole

2581
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:43,600
collection got just [ __ ] toasted

2582
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:45,840
because there's no air air conditioners

2583
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:47,600
in san diego right you know i didn't

2584
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:49,440
have a big i was in an apartment i

2585
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:51,840
didn't have a big seed fridge i had a

2586
01:26:49,439 --> 01:26:53,599
little fridge you know for food

2587
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:55,840
so i i didn't understand the full

2588
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:58,239
mechanics of it and it [ __ ] everything

2589
01:26:55,840 --> 01:27:00,079
up everything yeah i mean it's hard too

2590
01:26:58,238 --> 01:27:02,158
so that's why i like and that

2591
01:27:00,079 --> 01:27:05,279
that's the other thing is you see people

2592
01:27:02,158 --> 01:27:06,399
are like oh i got these 68 whatever

2593
01:27:05,279 --> 01:27:08,319
seeds

2594
01:27:06,399 --> 01:27:10,879
yeah and then they pop them and they

2595
01:27:08,319 --> 01:27:13,198
have like 30 seeds and 28 of them pop

2596
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:15,359
yeah yeah they're like no

2597
01:27:13,198 --> 01:27:17,919
even if they were stored perfectly in

2598
01:27:15,359 --> 01:27:20,639
the best conditions imaginable yeah

2599
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:22,319
you're not going to get 28 out of 30. no

2600
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:23,840
it's not it's not probably going to

2601
01:27:22,319 --> 01:27:25,679
happen it's probably not going to happen

2602
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:28,000
they lose they lose over i think even

2603
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:30,079
like dave what sam skunk man was talking

2604
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:33,520
about he's got kilos

2605
01:27:30,079 --> 01:27:35,198
of old seed yeah but he thinks the

2606
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:37,600
germination rate even on that stuff

2607
01:27:35,198 --> 01:27:39,439
that's been perfectly stored is still

2608
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:41,840
like less than ten percent

2609
01:27:39,439 --> 01:27:43,759
yeah it's still a substantial amount for

2610
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:45,600
the amount of seed that he has of it

2611
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:47,760
yeah you know but he's still it's going

2612
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:49,440
to be like four eight or seven percent

2613
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:51,199
or something like that germ

2614
01:27:49,439 --> 01:27:52,479
yeah in perfect conditions and they're

2615
01:27:51,198 --> 01:27:55,039
30 years old

2616
01:27:52,479 --> 01:27:56,959
yeah and for trying to i could say

2617
01:27:55,039 --> 01:27:58,560
firsthand like going into a collection

2618
01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:00,800
where you know a lot's been ruined and

2619
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:02,719
trying to pop them is [ __ ] miserable

2620
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:05,039
because you'll see something oh [ __ ] i

2621
01:28:02,719 --> 01:28:06,719
forgot i had that oh i'll give it a try

2622
01:28:05,039 --> 01:28:08,719
and it never works it's [ __ ]

2623
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:10,239
miserable

2624
01:28:08,719 --> 01:28:12,800
i mean yeah somebody said the french

2625
01:28:10,238 --> 01:28:14,638
skunk connection

2626
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:16,719
i don't i don't like homie i'll you know

2627
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:18,719
i just think i think he

2628
01:28:16,719 --> 01:28:22,079
i mean they claim they found skunk in

2629
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:23,840
the 70 and 71 or 72 out of a brick

2630
01:28:22,079 --> 01:28:25,760
which probably means they maybe you know

2631
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:28,239
like at best they found some skunky

2632
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:28,239
mexican

2633
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:34,239
that whole thing is a lie and it's like

2634
01:28:32,238 --> 01:28:36,638
all these different people want to say

2635
01:28:34,238 --> 01:28:39,359
no we have some skunk that can't comes

2636
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:41,520
from not sam skunk man yeah

2637
01:28:39,359 --> 01:28:42,799
and it's rank and it's real and it's

2638
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:44,800
from here

2639
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:46,960
um i know it's a joke i'm not even

2640
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:49,039
calling out on it i get it believe me

2641
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:51,279
but but it's just like that's the thing

2642
01:28:49,039 --> 01:28:53,039
is it's like now

2643
01:28:51,279 --> 01:28:55,439
there's there's a there's another

2644
01:28:53,039 --> 01:28:57,198
tsunami of all these famous strains from

2645
01:28:55,439 --> 01:28:58,638
the 80s and 90s that are old enough

2646
01:28:57,198 --> 01:29:00,079
they're legendary

2647
01:28:58,639 --> 01:29:02,239
yeah and that's why we had to do a whole

2648
01:29:00,079 --> 01:29:04,238
show on nl on nl

2649
01:29:02,238 --> 01:29:06,479
yeah yeah because it's like it's more of

2650
01:29:04,238 --> 01:29:08,158
a legendary name and people don't know

2651
01:29:06,479 --> 01:29:09,839
anything about it and people are like oh

2652
01:29:08,158 --> 01:29:12,319
well what's the earliest that existed i

2653
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:14,239
have it from two years before

2654
01:29:12,319 --> 01:29:16,319
yeah and somehow that's that's how

2655
01:29:14,238 --> 01:29:17,678
scammers out themselves

2656
01:29:16,319 --> 01:29:20,399
yeah just

2657
01:29:17,679 --> 01:29:22,480
i just want people to realize that it

2658
01:29:20,399 --> 01:29:24,479
every five it used to be like every five

2659
01:29:22,479 --> 01:29:27,759
to ten years someone would pop up and

2660
01:29:24,479 --> 01:29:30,319
say we've got the whole sssc collection

2661
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:32,079
a whole collection in jars just pulled

2662
01:29:30,319 --> 01:29:34,079
out of the freezer and this happened so

2663
01:29:32,079 --> 01:29:36,399
many [ __ ] times over the years and

2664
01:29:34,079 --> 01:29:38,399
every time it would all be [ __ ] and

2665
01:29:36,399 --> 01:29:40,158
so if you see people just all of a

2666
01:29:38,399 --> 01:29:43,119
sudden they've got this magical freezer

2667
01:29:40,158 --> 01:29:44,479
to narnia be very very very selective

2668
01:29:43,119 --> 01:29:45,439
and think about it use some critical

2669
01:29:44,479 --> 01:29:47,599
thinking

2670
01:29:45,439 --> 01:29:49,198
um if these things were still around

2671
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:51,360
they'd still be around

2672
01:29:49,198 --> 01:29:53,678
you know it's not and i had this i have

2673
01:29:51,359 --> 01:29:54,960
this running joke too where it's like

2674
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:56,239
that'd be like give me your old and

2675
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:58,319
unpopular

2676
01:29:56,238 --> 01:30:00,559
right and when this [ __ ] was old and

2677
01:29:58,319 --> 01:30:02,719
unpopular like i live in mendocino

2678
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:04,800
county okay so i have tons of friends in

2679
01:30:02,719 --> 01:30:06,319
humboldt and trinity and mendo and sort

2680
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:08,719
of like the heart of cannabis i know a

2681
01:30:06,319 --> 01:30:11,198
lot of cannabis people i would hunt and

2682
01:30:08,719 --> 01:30:13,039
hunt and hunt and hunt for this old [ __ ]

2683
01:30:11,198 --> 01:30:14,319
and it was almost impossible to find

2684
01:30:13,039 --> 01:30:16,238
anywhere

2685
01:30:14,319 --> 01:30:17,519
yeah and then as soon as there's money

2686
01:30:16,238 --> 01:30:19,039
involved

2687
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:21,199
it's everywhere

2688
01:30:19,039 --> 01:30:22,880
everywhere everywhere i could spend 15

2689
01:30:21,198 --> 01:30:25,039
years looking for this [ __ ] and find it

2690
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:27,679
nowhere and now in the last four years

2691
01:30:25,039 --> 01:30:29,359
it's like out of the [ __ ] woodwork

2692
01:30:27,679 --> 01:30:31,840
hundreds of sources

2693
01:30:29,359 --> 01:30:33,439
and well and one person has everything

2694
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:35,760
from every company you could have ever

2695
01:30:33,439 --> 01:30:37,839
imagined from the [ __ ] 80s through

2696
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:40,000
the 90s you know and it's like nobody

2697
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:42,719
wants it to be real more than me

2698
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:44,880
yeah oh my god because if we were if we

2699
01:30:42,719 --> 01:30:47,679
were a normal industry

2700
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:50,079
right yeah all this seed stock from

2701
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:52,319
neville and ssse and all those guys in

2702
01:30:50,079 --> 01:30:53,519
the 90s and all that work would still be

2703
01:30:52,319 --> 01:30:56,559
accessible

2704
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:58,159
yeah it'd be maybe not for sale but like

2705
01:30:56,560 --> 01:31:00,159
they would have a vault

2706
01:30:58,158 --> 01:31:02,158
you know they would have like any kind

2707
01:31:00,158 --> 01:31:03,839
of agriculture they have seed stock

2708
01:31:02,158 --> 01:31:05,920
going back decades

2709
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:07,520
yeah maybe they're not even using it but

2710
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:10,560
it's like every cultivar they've ever

2711
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:12,320
had they keep seed stock

2712
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:13,440
oh okay i need to print more then real

2713
01:31:12,319 --> 01:31:15,439
good

2714
01:31:13,439 --> 01:31:17,039
and so you know

2715
01:31:15,439 --> 01:31:19,119
we talked about this too before but we

2716
01:31:17,039 --> 01:31:20,880
have a we have a buddy that that bought

2717
01:31:19,119 --> 01:31:22,000
somebody's freezer that was getting out

2718
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:24,400
of

2719
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:26,079
um that was getting out of the scene

2720
01:31:24,399 --> 01:31:27,759
right you remember that i showed i

2721
01:31:26,079 --> 01:31:28,960
showed that to you and crybaby and some

2722
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:31,760
other friends

2723
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:33,279
and uh big old [ __ ] blue balls and

2724
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:36,639
you know and all that [ __ ] it's all

2725
01:31:33,279 --> 01:31:38,319
legit it's all from like 08 to 12. yeah

2726
01:31:36,639 --> 01:31:40,480
yeah most of it so it's not even really

2727
01:31:38,319 --> 01:31:42,719
all that old it's all this and it's all

2728
01:31:40,479 --> 01:31:44,559
like what you could get in that era yeah

2729
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:46,480
right common stuff during that era yeah

2730
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:48,880
and i had matt vibet because honestly

2731
01:31:46,479 --> 01:31:51,198
that was more his era than mine in terms

2732
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:54,000
of being deeply involved in what was out

2733
01:31:51,198 --> 01:31:55,759
and it's all legit you know and

2734
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,760
almost none of it could you buy today if

2735
01:31:55,760 --> 01:32:00,079
you wanted to yeah

2736
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:02,320
and it's from 10 or 12 years ago yeah

2737
01:32:00,079 --> 01:32:03,600
it's all gone i mean it's even stuff a

2738
01:32:02,319 --> 01:32:05,279
lot of that was stuff i didn't even see

2739
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:06,800
in other people see collections yeah and

2740
01:32:05,279 --> 01:32:08,639
like even if even if you were doing it

2741
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:11,360
for research purposes or whatever they

2742
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:13,359
don't even have a problem yeah

2743
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:14,158
so it's just gone

2744
01:32:13,359 --> 01:32:16,319
yeah

2745
01:32:14,158 --> 01:32:18,559
you know in a way and that's kind of why

2746
01:32:16,319 --> 01:32:19,599
i think reversals became so popular was

2747
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:21,360
because

2748
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:23,600
not only did you not need a male but in

2749
01:32:21,359 --> 01:32:25,519
many cases most of these lines only one

2750
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:26,480
or two females from that line even

2751
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:29,040
survived

2752
01:32:26,479 --> 01:32:31,198
yeah so it's all you have left

2753
01:32:29,039 --> 01:32:32,399
it's a way to keep a line unhybridized

2754
01:32:31,198 --> 01:32:34,158
and pure

2755
01:32:32,399 --> 01:32:36,479
yeah you know so

2756
01:32:34,158 --> 01:32:38,638
it's it's changed all of it but that was

2757
01:32:36,479 --> 01:32:40,879
yeah that was that's 12 years ago and

2758
01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:42,400
it's like reading a historical novel

2759
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:43,520
yeah it was

2760
01:32:42,399 --> 01:32:45,839
it was a trip

2761
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:48,159
kind of a flashback yeah a flashback to

2762
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:49,600
like and that was all commonly sold and

2763
01:32:48,158 --> 01:32:52,399
traded that was the hot [ __ ] of the

2764
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:53,920
minute yeah everybody stuffed it it was

2765
01:32:52,399 --> 01:32:56,158
all stuff i had in my seat collection at

2766
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:57,600
one point it was crazy yeah every every

2767
01:32:56,158 --> 01:32:59,439
