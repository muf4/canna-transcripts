13
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:32,039
got the idea for this from another

14
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,420
YouTuber named Jesse on fire and I felt

15
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:35,700
like it was a fair it was fair for him

16
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:40,160
to ask so I figured I'd do the same

so dog breeder and grower from Mendocino

28
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:04,859
to speak on these subjects and sometimes

29
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,599
interview other participants our goal is

30
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:08,280
to document this history before it's

31
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:09,539
written by corporations and others who

32
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,359
just weren't there

33
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,560
let's start writing some wrongs welcome

34
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:15,560
to the underground

35
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,939
hey everyone welcome to breeder

36
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:24,478
Syndicate this is going to be part two

37
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:27,239

38
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:29,400

dog

40
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,680
peace everyone so yeah everybody uh we

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,359
we really had a good time recording the

42
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,299
show last time I think it was probably

43
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:41,640
the largest response we've ever gotten

44
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,040
for any show as far as the positive

45
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,560
positivity that we received

46
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:50,100
um it really really resonated with a lot

47
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:54,240
of people and uh yeah I'm really excited

48
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:56,399
to start with round two so to speak

49
00:01:54,239 --> 00:02:00,179
um we we tried to go into more linear

50
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:03,359
pattern and um we covered some of the

51
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,280
the canyon era but I know we after after

52
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:07,319
we recorded last time we spoke a little

53
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,060
bit and you have some notes and a good

54
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:10,500
direction so I'm going to let you uh go

55
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,840
ahead and start Mad Jack where do you

56
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,580
want to start the tail

57
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:19,640
hahaha

58
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:19,640
um the 1978 map that I drew

59
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,300
it says OG stands for original Garden

60
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,699
there we go

61
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,200
here's the 1978 map if you want to

62
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:30,719
explain it a little bit and break it

63
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:32,519
down the key is at the bottom this is

64
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:36,180
before

65
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:38,099
skunk number one this is the very first

66
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:42,719
um we had

67
00:02:38,098 --> 00:02:46,620
a friend in Kauai who who um had well

68
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:50,818
haken Hawaiian crosses yeah and they're

69
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:54,420
the h10 H9 HK and then

70
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:55,859
we had somehow some a few Thai seeds I

71
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:58,139
don't know where they came from the

72
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,940
Colombian came from my friend and

73
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:02,238
they're the ones that on Thanksgiving

74
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:05,219
while it was snowing above us on the rim

75
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:08,519
weren't even close to being finished

76
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:10,919
so this was the layout of that Garden

77
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:13,920
that you showed photos of last time that

78
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:15,738
blends in so well it's surrounded by

79
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:19,079
pine trees and

80
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:24,360
lots of heavy dark green brush

81
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:28,620
this Garden was probably I'm thinking

82
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:30,420
100 feet long and 50 feet wide you that

83
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,219
was the size

84
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:34,439
this is from the old notebooks that you

85
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:36,060
have it was a strong like at the time

86
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:38,340
you were drawing this as you were

87
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,780
looking on or how did it work that's

88
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,580
amazing

89
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,598
it's absolutely amazing

90
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:48,120
just all of them every year I did one

91
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:52,679
this was at the middle part of our

92
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:56,700
Canyon the subsequent years 80 79 80 and

93
00:03:52,680 --> 00:04:00,840
81 were about two or three miles further

94
00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:04,679
up the canyon okay and this one so this

95
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:07,739
one was closer to 1800 feet down it was

96
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,739
a longer hike more difficult and the

97
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:12,480
others were anywhere from 14 to 1600

98
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:14,878
feet down in

99
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,019
wow which makes a difference at the end

100
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:19,978
of the year of course when you're

101
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:22,139
carrying this your your Harvest out

102
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:25,019
that's why we did as much as possible

103
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:27,240
down inside the canyon later

104
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:29,159
by having friends come down in and camp

105
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,759
with us because

106
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,639
um

107
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,740
it wasn't feasible to carry out whole

108
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,960
plants or branches or anything like that

109
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:39,060
did you find that any of these grew any

110
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:41,039
different in these little micro climates

111
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:45,120
in the canyon like any of these strains

112
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,979
from like 78 between 78 and 79 if you

113
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,840
moved or grew any of the same exact

114
00:04:46,978 --> 00:04:51,060
strains in different little locations in

115
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:52,739
the canyon did you find any phenotypic

116
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:56,100
variations

117
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:58,800
I don't really think so it was it was

118
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:02,639
just more the size and ripeness because

119
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:06,418
this particular Garden was got the sun

120
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,519
east to west so it had the most on 10 11

121
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:11,698
hours at some days you know in the

122
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:13,379
summer yeah so they grew much larger

123
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:15,960
plants I mean there some of these plants

124
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:18,180
were 13 14 feet tall

125
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:21,180
um my friend my partner who's six foot

126
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:24,600
seven there's a photo of him reaching up

127
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:27,240
in in his um wizard outfit that's right

128
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,120
his his reach is at nine feet

129
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:33,120
and they're wow four or five feet Beyond

130
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:36,959
his reach so yeah they were the

131
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:41,819
Hawaiians h10 over here where it says

132
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:45,299
h10 yeah if you go down right let's see

133
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:49,800
right over in this region h-10 of this

134
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:52,139
photo or this drawing and also in the

135
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,759
middle there h10 they they were just

136
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:56,939
massive plants

137
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,979
beautiful and it was good smoke too

138
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:01,259
um it was wilhaken again cross with

139
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:03,060
whatever they were calling Hawaiian

140
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:06,300
which

141
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:09,120
yeah has a Thai background just because

142
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:12,478
Hawaii probably in the 40s and 50s

143
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,160
people from the Far East that visited

144
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:16,860
there that it'd be very easy to see

145
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,759
those sorts of varieties showing up in

146
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:23,038
another tropical area sure

147
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,919
and this is great this is crazy Mad Jack

148
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:28,680
because I used to um you know I drew a

149
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:30,899
plot like this for you know a map like

150
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:34,740
this for just about every outdoor plot I

151
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:37,918
ever did and it's crazy to see you know

152
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:40,379
that two people on you know other sides

153
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:42,538
of the country at the same time are

154
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:44,759
doing the same stuff but you know beyond

155
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:48,000
the fact that I did it yours is the

156
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:51,120
level of detail and Artistry is Way

157
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,120
Beyond anything I ever did man just this

158
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,240
is really cool to see it really is

159
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,579
yeah one thing I might I might want to

160
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:02,280
ask uh just because I I remember

161
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:04,620
something you mentioned last time which

162
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:07,978
was basically like you kind of averaged

163
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:09,300
about 6.8 or 7 ounces of plant or

164
00:07:07,978 --> 00:07:10,859
something

165
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,199
um and then I just heard you say that

166
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:15,660
like you had these nine to 13 foot tall

167
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,580
plants these Giants

168
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:19,439
um so maybe you could talk a little bit

169
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:20,939
about some of the different stuff that

170
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,098
you grew

171
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:25,259
um was a nine or third was a nine foot

172
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:27,598
or ten foot tall plant only giving you

173
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:30,180
that amount of flour because of how

174
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:31,860
loose it was did you have some that were

175
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,860
a lot denser and they were smaller

176
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:37,259
plants but yielded more because I have

177
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:39,120
old timers that would tell me that back

178
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:41,038
in the day you know they would get

179
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,240
ounces that were like the size of my

180
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:44,579
forearm

181
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,879
just because the the weed wasn't as

182
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:49,859
dense and so I'm curious as to like uh

183
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:51,839
was the 6.8 ounces the stuff that

184
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,819
happened in in subsequent years when you

185
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:56,219
were doing like the skunk one did you

186
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:58,020
get a massive variance of of weights and

187
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:02,000
sizes these first couple years when you

188
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:02,000
were experiencing them just curious

189
00:08:02,538 --> 00:08:10,560
the 6.8 ounces average across the entire

190
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:13,620
two gardens that we did later were all

191
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,860
almost all skunk number one and the

192
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,840
tallest plants were six seven eight feet

193
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,780
and

194
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:24,299
the Hawaiian in this particular

195
00:08:21,779 --> 00:08:26,878
um drawing that we're so tall they were

196
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,978
multi-pound plants we didn't have a

197
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,560
scale at the time down in there in the

198
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:34,620
series we brought a dialogram down o

199
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:38,038
house good old dialogram and it would go

200
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:40,560
up to two pounds I think I forget but um

201
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:44,399
this plant in particular

202
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:47,518
it it was obviously pounds of weed yeah

203
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:50,958
they were tight buds they aren't Rock

204
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,959
buds you know like some

205
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,419
um especially the ones I know of friends

206
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:58,199
who grow

207
00:08:54,419 --> 00:09:01,139
heavily uh Indica backgrounds yeah those

208
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,700
buds just get rock hard densities yeah

209
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:04,439
dried

210
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:07,640
um these

211
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:12,240
a pound of this or probably

212
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:14,759
was twice the size of the of the um

213
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,959
later skunk number one the skunk number

214
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:20,939
one were denser definitely yeah

215
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:22,739
I have a quick question that that I've

216
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,500
just been as going through the pictures

217
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,139
and stuff which wizard were you which

218
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,580
which color

219
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:32,819
we alternated out

220
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:36,440
um so did you this this was not this was

221
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:40,260
not me this was my friend Doug yeah

222
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:42,300
the the light blue one was my UK partner

223
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:44,458
that you have in a photo where he's

224
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:46,500
pointing off in well actually you used

225
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:49,679
it in this advertisement

226
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,778
um yes pointing out into the distance

227
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,579
um the garden is actually right below

228
00:09:51,778 --> 00:09:55,620
him but we had him pointing in a

229
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:59,040
direction that wouldn't be

230
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:03,778
um as easy to figure out if you got to

231
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:05,759
that Canyon yeah and I I was never I

232
00:10:03,778 --> 00:10:08,338
never wore the light blue one because I

233
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:11,159
think it was a smaller

234
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:13,380
um robe so we had a

235
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:16,199
what is the one I'm wearing there's one

236
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:18,240
of me in in my tall partner walking

237
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,879
across the rug there it is the white one

238
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,159
hey got it right I'm the one in front

239
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:25,439
and you can just see my beard back then

240
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:27,299
showing a little bit

241
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,980
my

242
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:31,979
my ex-wife

243
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:34,259
my kid's mom she's the one who sewed

244
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,379
these up for us she made all of these

245
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:39,838
and uh that red bag there was

246
00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:43,139
particularly colorful so

247
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,760
she was up with the idea too and it was

248
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:47,220
great I don't know what ever happened to

249
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:49,500
these costumes yeah I was gonna ask that

250
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:52,379
was my name I didn't keep at least one

251
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:54,120
around but I think

252
00:10:52,379 --> 00:10:58,379
um

253
00:10:54,120 --> 00:11:00,060
45 years later you know it's what really

254
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:02,939
pulled me to your story when I first

255
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:04,439
like I first like I said heard about or

256
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:07,079
even

257
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,360
found out what mad Jag was going through

258
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:11,159
Sam's old posts and going through the

259
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,019
kilo art and I kept seeing this really

260
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:14,639
pretty kilo art that said mad Jag on it

261
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:16,799
and that's what started that journey and

262
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:18,539
then when I saw these pictures of the

263
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:20,699
robes is when I was like these are my

264
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:23,899
people these are my people I gotta find

265
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:26,339
out who they are you know

266
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:28,259
yeah that log right there that we're

267
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:31,200
walking across

268
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:33,600
there was a storm I was camped on on the

269
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,600
side that this photo was taken from by

270
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,839
our third friend and water was almost

271
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,879
touching the bottom of this this log and

272
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,680
I had to sit on it and Scoot across with

273
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:47,039
a bag of weed in front of me and Scoot

274
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:51,199
across it ran for like three days from

275
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:53,639
this massive fall storm like in October

276
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,140
and uh

277
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:56,458
it's a good thing that thing was there

278
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:59,639
or else I would have been stuck on the

279
00:11:56,458 --> 00:12:00,719
other side and as it was I was in a

280
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:04,319
silly

281
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,820
old army tent and and Waters had didn't

282
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,620
have a built-in bottom and the water was

283
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:09,720
flowing through so you get out in the

284
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,820
pouring rain and cut a trench around it

285
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,320
like you do in Boy Scouts to funnel the

286
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:16,339
water away and

287
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,339
um it's funny

288
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:22,620
Wilderness experience okay

289
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:25,019
you know MJ uh you remember last week we

290
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,860
were talking about how the

291
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:28,740
um

292
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:31,879
how growing these plants kind of turns

293
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:34,919
you into an instant young entrepreneur

294
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:38,100
and the inspiration you know I've I've

295
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:40,679
often wondered you know what kind of

296
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,659
what what were your intentions you know

297
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:45,359
when you guys came up with this whole

298
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:48,179
mad Jag branding idea and started

299
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,620
sending stuff into High Times you know

300
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:51,659
what was what was going through your

301
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:54,539
head when you were

302
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:57,778
um when you were starting that thing it

303
00:12:54,539 --> 00:13:00,360
looks it looks like you know early viral

304
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:01,919
marketing stuff is what it looks like

305
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,500
that's fun

306
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:07,379
yeah viral didn't even exist that term

307
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,458
right that's right

308
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:10,860
um

309
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:13,619
we were inspired by High Times magazine

310
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:16,919
by the Grower's guide

311
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:19,799
um and then later Robert Clark's book

312
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:22,379
um it just seemed like

313
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:25,078
let's make our own Legend you know and

314
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:27,000
maybe someday we'll be doing a photo a

315
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:30,559
movie about it or

316
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,539
it was It was kind of with that in mind

317
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:36,419
uh it wasn't that it would make us

318
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:38,879
richer and we would get paid more for

319
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:42,179
the herb it was just

320
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:44,700
it would set us apart so that's why we

321
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:46,979
went and had labels made the crack and

322
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:48,060
peel labels I'll be glad to send you

323
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,860
guys some

324
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:54,179
um because I've kept a lot of them over

325
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:56,579
the years oh wow they still work we

326
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:58,559
would I would go through like an airport

327
00:13:56,578 --> 00:14:00,359
I remember I was going up the escalator

328
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:02,399
and I had one cracked and open I just

329
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:06,899
slapped it on the side of the paper

330
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:10,440
magazine dispenser in Los Angeles and

331
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:13,559
um one of my friends the guy in in Tempe

332
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,120
his brother who was a bigger dealer even

333
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:17,099
than he

334
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,440
um said did you put one of your stickers

335
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,180
in the airport in LA and I said yeah I

336
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,779
did

337
00:14:20,179 --> 00:14:23,778
yeah it's gone

338
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:29,099
that that reminds me so much of like

339
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:31,019
early skateboarding culture you know in

340
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,300
the 70s

341
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:34,980
um and that that was you know some of

342
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:37,859
the earliest

343
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:40,680
kind of uh viral marketing like you said

344
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:42,419
viral marketing absolutely the things

345
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:44,458
that they that they pioneered back then

346
00:14:42,419 --> 00:14:48,000
in skateboarding with skateboarder

347
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:50,698
magazine um you know is is absolutely

348
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,698
the foundation of of viral internet

349
00:14:50,698 --> 00:14:55,979
marketing today and you know social

350
00:14:53,698 --> 00:14:57,899
media influencers

351
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:00,240
um all that stuff has roots going

352
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:03,419
directly back to that and I see a lot of

353
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,220
that in in your mag stuff too Jim yeah

354
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:07,919
yeah

355
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:10,320
I see I see a lot of that like in the

356
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:13,019
haze poster the cosmic Boogie poster you

357
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,180
know that was like why I chased that so

358
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:17,759
hard was because as a person who sells

359
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:20,278
seeds and has made that my passion

360
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:23,759
breeding and all that to me that was the

361
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:26,578
first time that I could find a a

362
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:29,939
physical tangible representation or

363
00:15:26,578 --> 00:15:32,399
something I could possess that was a

364
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:34,740
perfect example of the first strain

365
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,659
marketing that I could find you know and

366
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,459
and the Mad Jack label I put it in that

367
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:41,939
same kind of category it's one of those

368
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:43,799
early just things it's striking imagery

369
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:45,720
that you never forget and it was done so

370
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:48,179
well that I had I never forgot it and

371
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:51,120
always chased it it's almost it's almost

372
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:52,620
like a pre-reagan era of Freedom where

373
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,740
everyone thought things were about to

374
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:57,600
loosen up yep and then they were kind of

375
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:59,698
loose for a bit and then they went in a

376
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,659
totally different direction for 15 more

377
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:02,879
years

378
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:05,159
there's still these old posters that you

379
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,778
can I found him a few times and I never

380
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:09,179
bought one but there's an old poster

381
00:16:06,778 --> 00:16:11,759
where it's like they made them declaring

382
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:14,039
like that ah we finally did it you know

383
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,360
like prohibition's over and posters but

384
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:19,740
they were just a little bit too early

385
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:22,519
you know yeah yeah like 40 years yeah

386
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:25,198
just a little bit yeah

387
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:27,480
one thing I'm curious about and like the

388
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:29,698
actual growing part of it is since

389
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,320
it sounds like you were basically this

390
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:33,659
first season you were just collecting

391
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,699
seeds from friends and people you could

392
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:38,039
get access to

393
00:16:35,698 --> 00:16:40,019
um what were the things that you liked

394
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:41,698
and disliked about the first crop like

395
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:43,019
did you look at those things when you

396
00:16:41,698 --> 00:16:45,659
were trying to get away with it and you

397
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:47,698
were like oh my God this 13-foot plant

398
00:16:45,659 --> 00:16:49,078
is blowing past all the bushes and

399
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:51,059
everything else that we were trying to

400
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:53,578
contain it and like make it look like it

401
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:57,359
was normal I don't want to do that giant

402
00:16:53,578 --> 00:16:59,039
again because it it makes me nervous or

403
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,659
like what was the what were the thoughts

404
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:02,399
there because obviously like this is the

405
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:05,039
first time that you were seeing a lot of

406
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,259
these things grown correct

407
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:09,379
yeah

408
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:12,119
definitely

409
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:13,980
what to expect really like you just oh

410
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:15,418
this is oaxacan and this is Hawaiian and

411
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:18,000
this is this and this is that and it was

412
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:19,559
kind of like plant spacing and how big

413
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,599
they were gonna get what they were gonna

414
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:22,558
do was all kind of a mystery I would

415
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,019
imagine

416
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:27,539
oh yeah we were

417
00:17:25,019 --> 00:17:30,240
I had had the one year before this with

418
00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:34,139
my dealer friend from Tempe

419
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,700
in a neighboring Canyon and that's the

420
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,799
first time I

421
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,940
got a chance to see plants actually

422
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:42,119
reach

423
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:45,120
Harvest Time and they were all Mexican

424
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:48,000
strains like you said but

425
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:49,019
in the next over the next year which the

426
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,019
next year

427
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:55,619
we tried a garden in that Canyon that

428
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:58,139
was massive it was so huge we had to get

429
00:17:55,619 --> 00:18:01,619
a we had to pump up 200 feet to the

430
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:04,080
alluvial Plateau we had found and it

431
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:07,819
wasn't really smart it's a good thing it

432
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:10,678
failed but we we got we got a

433
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:14,159
submersible pump that weighed like 40

434
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:16,798
pounds and hosed going up and the first

435
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,538
time we watered we laid a hose on the

436
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:21,599
ground and it just went it disappeared

437
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:24,298
into the soil is it this Garden we moved

438
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:26,759
it another 50 feet it's just

439
00:18:24,298 --> 00:18:30,058
made a hole and went down in we couldn't

440
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:32,819
flood irrigate it it just it was so

441
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:34,379
loose with Boulders and stuff below even

442
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:36,960
though it was this beautiful smooth

443
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:40,080
Garden on top that

444
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,519
it it just didn't work it was like

445
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:44,159
dredging

446
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:46,019
yeah and then the following year we had

447
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:50,160
collected all these other seeds Thai

448
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:52,679
Colombian and we and I knew from that

449
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:55,259
very first year how to do it

450
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:57,780
and

451
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:59,339
we just went on a larger scale

452
00:18:57,779 --> 00:19:00,899
these

453
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:03,839
um

454
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:07,019
the Colombian though that we had no idea

455
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:09,240
like we discovered that how long it took

456
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:11,519
to finish we just knew it was super

457
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,500
great weed that we had smoked and we

458
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,779
kept the seeds and

459
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,460
um so

460
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:20,759
these

461
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:23,100
on this Garden I'd say

462
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:25,440
30 percent of it failed

463
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:27,599
because I don't know it was just it

464
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,400
wasn't ready is this the garden that's

465
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:32,339
up here correct

466
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,620
um you're speaking about this is no this

467
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:35,519
one is

468
00:19:33,619 --> 00:19:37,979
1980. it's

469
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:40,019
we were looking at the 78 earlier that

470
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:41,460
had the key at the bottom which is what

471
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:43,379
are you speaking about currently that's

472
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:46,620
one that I want to hit

473
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:49,320
um the original one 1978 oh gee so

474
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:51,298
that's the one that 30 failed yeah and

475
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:54,359
by failed you mean just didn't finish

476
00:19:51,298 --> 00:19:57,779
right they were huge plants see that one

477
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:59,279
photo that he has from last episode

478
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:00,720
um they were beautiful plants in

479
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:03,359
slightly different colors because they

480
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:10,019
were different Colombian seeds but the

481
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:13,259
C10 here uh C9 wherever the C shows up

482
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:15,359
they were big big plants does that make

483
00:20:13,259 --> 00:20:17,759
it easier to see right there if I zoom

484
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:19,379
out and it might be too much but So

485
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:22,319
eventually did you just end up having to

486
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:24,000
chop them down uh did you just and and

487
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:26,099
you just realized they weren't done they

488
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,259
weren't they weren't real weed yet and

489
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:30,659
and kind of composted them down there or

490
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:32,879
no we took them out they're the ones

491
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:34,679
that I had to scoot across that Boulder

492
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,320
with in a bag

493
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:39,360
um once we cut them down to Branch size

494
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,619
and they were the size of my little

495
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:43,379
fingertip

496
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:46,379
Buds and they were kind of tight and

497
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:49,200
nice and we sold them actually they they

498
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:52,380
were just a very mild smoke they they

499
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,720
had resin but not not like they would

500
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:56,820
have been super killer weed if they'd

501
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,000
gotten a month and a half more or two

502
00:20:56,819 --> 00:21:02,058
yeah like the end of December or early

503
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,460
January like they would in the tropics

504
00:21:02,058 --> 00:21:07,379
but it was so let me let me maybe ask

505
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,840
you this because I didn't I don't think

506
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:11,299
we talked about this last time in the

507
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:14,759
area that you were in

508
00:21:11,298 --> 00:21:17,940
what month or around what date was it

509
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:19,919
safe to plant and then what was kind of

510
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,840
like the latter part of your Harvest

511
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,900
window where after that it was cold and

512
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:25,379
rainy and you were in fear of losing

513
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,340
[Music]

514
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:29,159
um

515
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:31,099
luckily those giant Hawaiian plants they

516
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:34,919
because they were oaxacan crosses too

517
00:21:31,099 --> 00:21:37,500
they were ready in October and like no

518
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:41,460
later than mid-october I'd say probably

519
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:43,679
and the rains and coal didn't really hit

520
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:45,600
us October traditionally in Arizona is

521
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,000
the second driest month of the year

522
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:51,178
June is the driest October and this is

523
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,480
in the 70s it has changed since then but

524
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:56,038
we had a beautiful fall so down in the

525
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,500
canyon to have cool nights but the days

526
00:21:56,038 --> 00:21:59,940
would be warm and nice

527
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:03,179
um so

528
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:05,220
it it just we harvested everything out

529
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:08,159
of this can out of this Garden except

530
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:11,220
those Colombian and we were going back

531
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:13,559
and watering them and back and watering

532
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:15,120
them and finally on Thanksgiving when it

533
00:22:13,558 --> 00:22:18,899
was snowing up above and we had to go

534
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:22,918
out on the mesas in inches of snow and

535
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:25,320
big quads of mud on our feet uh it was

536
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:28,020
just we decided we have to take them now

537
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:32,519
because we didn't want to come back any

538
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:34,500
colder and wetter yeah and so you know

539
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:36,960
it

540
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:39,720
it just what it just never reached

541
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,120
maturity but the earlier ones all these

542
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,140
other Hawaiians were they came out

543
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:45,538
wonderful

544
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:49,559
and we were able to hang them there in

545
00:22:45,538 --> 00:22:52,558
the shade dry them and I don't remember

546
00:22:49,558 --> 00:22:55,259
actually we didn't have breakdown boxes

547
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:58,918
like we did in following years

548
00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:59,700
we just um I think put them in our in

549
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:03,780
big

550
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:06,298
bags you know garbage bags and carried

551
00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:08,879
them up through the top of the rim with

552
00:23:06,298 --> 00:23:10,740
our um pack frames we had metal pack

553
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,059
frames celties and we would just strap

554
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,859
everything to them

555
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:16,500
so they didn't get handled as well

556
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:18,599
that's another thing the when we had

557
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:21,000
breakdown boxes after they were met

558
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:23,579
after the skunk number one was manicured

559
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,980
it was put right into these wonderful

560
00:23:23,579 --> 00:23:27,720
cardboard boxes that we bought stacks of

561
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:30,240
and brought them down and then we

562
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:32,038
assembled them down in the canyon taped

563
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,579
them and

564
00:23:32,038 --> 00:23:38,400
you could carry six or seven stacked on

565
00:23:35,579 --> 00:23:40,918
a pack frame any more than that they

566
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:44,700
would be catching on branches and and it

567
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:46,799
wasn't feasible so yeah that came out

568
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,419
very nice they they didn't get crushed

569
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:51,839
they didn't get smashed

570
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:55,860
pounded the time roughly in each box

571
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:57,418
was that does that that 1979 Harvest was

572
00:23:55,859 --> 00:23:59,519
that the one that ended up in the High

573
00:23:57,419 --> 00:24:01,200
Times is that what it was referred to in

574
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:04,319
that High Times that is up here on the

575
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,940
page and you'll see here it says

576
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:07,319
um

577
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:11,580
uh

578
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:15,298
Colombian stock killer purple 2015.

579
00:24:11,579 --> 00:24:17,158
um we it was it was funny because one

580
00:24:15,298 --> 00:24:18,379
guy actually paid us two thousand a

581
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:21,960
pound for it

582
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:24,240
it was just secret and they loved it you

583
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,740
know and then we had some lightly seeded

584
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,220
Hawaiian

585
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:30,900
one branch out of all this Garden we

586
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:34,259
came back after

587
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:36,298
as we traditionally did every week we

588
00:24:34,259 --> 00:24:38,460
were looking through inspecting and then

589
00:24:36,298 --> 00:24:39,418
we found one branch that was seated it

590
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:42,840
had

591
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:45,780
you know hurt me back yeah yeah took a

592
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:48,359
garbage bag and put it over quickly cut

593
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:50,460
that Branch off but it had enough time

594
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:53,699
to lightly seed a few of the plants

595
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:55,620
neighboring to it but people love

596
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,400
finding those few seeds and they were

597
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:59,819
like

598
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,860
do you have any more of this I bet they

599
00:24:59,819 --> 00:25:04,678
like the smoke and

600
00:25:01,859 --> 00:25:05,699
um it was the oaxacan Hawaiian kind of

601
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:07,200
rock

602
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,819
wow

603
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,340
and so how many of these in this list

604
00:25:08,819 --> 00:25:14,158
are from you guys

605
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:17,178
on this yes on this particular list just

606
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:20,039
the one that says magic Hawaiian Magic

607
00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:22,019
sensimilla God damn

608
00:25:20,038 --> 00:25:24,298
um all these others were current things

609
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:26,839
on the market yeah I mean like downtown

610
00:25:24,298 --> 00:25:26,839
Maryland

611
00:25:28,099 --> 00:25:31,859
that's something we didn't actually chat

612
00:25:30,538 --> 00:25:33,298
about last time but it's pretty

613
00:25:31,859 --> 00:25:35,278
interesting when you guys were doing

614
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:38,038
your gorilla

615
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:40,019
um you know obviously like you can get a

616
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:42,839
wildly Divergent amount of males and

617
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:44,819
females off a batch of seeds

618
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:46,740
um did you plant everything in your

619
00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:49,259
alluvial planes and all that and then

620
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:53,339
just cut males as they appeared did you

621
00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:55,079
plant them in pot you did yep and um did

622
00:25:53,339 --> 00:25:58,439
you go out there more than once a week

623
00:25:55,079 --> 00:26:00,418
when things were turning from Veg to

624
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,759
flour so that you didn't show up and all

625
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:04,980
of a sudden a stray male had like nuked

626
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:06,538
a whole patch with seed or how did you

627
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:09,058
handle the transition when you were

628
00:26:06,538 --> 00:26:10,679
worried about maybe we haven't caught

629
00:26:09,058 --> 00:26:13,440
all the males yet

630
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:16,980
right well

631
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,900
the next Garden that was 19 marked as

632
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:20,940
1979.

633
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:22,798
as the double e

634
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:25,860
the reason we called it the double e is

635
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:29,220
it was on a topo map right under the

636
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:31,199
word Creek where the double E's were and

637
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:34,558
so we went oh that's an easy way to spot

638
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:37,200
it so we called it the double e we spent

639
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:40,379
three nights I mean three days and two

640
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,538
nights every week on the next three

641
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:45,240
years we didn't just go out overnight

642
00:26:42,538 --> 00:26:48,298
and water and then leave the next day so

643
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:50,519
we were there three days out of seven

644
00:26:48,298 --> 00:26:53,639
and we

645
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:56,579
anything that was even remotely spooky

646
00:26:53,640 --> 00:27:00,538
looking like wow this might be a male

647
00:26:56,579 --> 00:27:02,220
change in here we then I don't know we

648
00:27:00,538 --> 00:27:05,339
might have just prematurely cut them out

649
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:08,339
but everything was grown from seed and

650
00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:12,000
the the year we ran two gardens of our

651
00:27:08,339 --> 00:27:14,220
big big here the one Garden good thing I

652
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,319
bought three thousand seeds because the

653
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:18,778
plants were about a foot tall and we

654
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:21,178
came back a week

655
00:27:18,778 --> 00:27:24,058
um three days later four days later and

656
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:26,519
grasshoppers had eaten them down every

657
00:27:24,058 --> 00:27:30,480
single one unbelievable we had to

658
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:33,538
replant on the first of June oh no we

659
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:36,798
put them in a tiny seed Garden area

660
00:27:33,538 --> 00:27:40,259
where we could put a screening over it

661
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:42,658
and they were super crowded and we were

662
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:44,940
just digging them out with wet with

663
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:46,980
inner Palm in our hands and plugging

664
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:48,840
them in plugging them in plugging them

665
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:51,179
in and replacing everything that had

666
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:52,678
been eaten by and what was weird there

667
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:55,679
was a few plants that made it through

668
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:58,559
from the grasshopper plague

669
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,840
yeah wow the ones that we planted and

670
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:03,599
they were like a month a month earlier

671
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:06,359
than the ones we had to replant in June

672
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:08,879
maybe more than a month and the June

673
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:10,678
ones caught up with them it was amazing

674
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,020
because of the 100 degree weather and

675
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:14,340
the Sun and the watering

676
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:16,379
um by the time

677
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:18,538
end of the summer like let's say August

678
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:22,200
was around they were all equal

679
00:28:18,538 --> 00:28:24,058
yeah it was good but having that little

680
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:28,140
um

681
00:28:24,058 --> 00:28:30,119
six foot by 10 foot garden full of seeds

682
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:31,320
luckily we we were able to replant

683
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:32,879
otherwise it would have been

684
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:36,000
catastrophic

685
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,940
oh I bet I mean maybe maybe another

686
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,880
angle is where did you first learn about

687
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:43,860
what an early female or an early male

688
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,778
even looked like back then was it Rob

689
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:47,699
Clark's book

690
00:28:45,778 --> 00:28:49,619
um was it High Times was it people

691
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:51,419
telling you

692
00:28:49,619 --> 00:28:53,399
um you know because obviously like now

693
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:56,100
you know like you look at it and like

694
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:58,679
two pistols mean a female and a little

695
00:28:56,099 --> 00:29:00,899
claw looking thing means a male

696
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:02,580
um but back then did you have that kind

697
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:04,380
of knowledge beforehand did they get

698
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:06,980
kind of advanced before you realized

699
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,980
what they were

700
00:29:07,019 --> 00:29:09,679
um

701
00:29:07,859 --> 00:29:12,599
well

702
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:15,900
I I'm not exactly sure I know from the

703
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:18,778
first year in 1976 that we grew I got to

704
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:21,240
see what males look like in females but

705
00:29:18,778 --> 00:29:24,319
not till they were probably more

706
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,319
advanced and invisible

707
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:32,700
I think Rob Clark I mean his early book

708
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:34,919
uh the one that he did in 77 on pod

709
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,860
press that was actually his dissertation

710
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:40,320
yeah yeah

711
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:43,678
that he he hand Drew all the drawings in

712
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:46,259
there oh wow yeah yeah it's Harbor every

713
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:49,019
single plant he hand Drew this so he's

714
00:29:46,259 --> 00:29:52,259
not only yeah he's a he's a good artist

715
00:29:49,019 --> 00:29:53,700
plus his photography later man he says

716
00:29:52,259 --> 00:29:56,278
when he traveled around and did that

717
00:29:53,700 --> 00:30:00,360
book on hashish the photos are just

718
00:29:56,278 --> 00:30:03,839
excellent you know Mountain watering and

719
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:06,898
the Grower's guide by Mel Frank

720
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:08,898
that I think

721
00:30:06,898 --> 00:30:12,599
showed I don't know if there were photos

722
00:30:08,898 --> 00:30:15,538
but it it was a learning curve but by

723
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:17,339
this year this I had already grown for

724
00:30:15,538 --> 00:30:20,700
two years before this

725
00:30:17,339 --> 00:30:23,220
so not the original Garden but by 1980

726
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:25,798
so when we went for two gardens at once

727
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:27,600
we had enough experience to know what to

728
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:29,879
look for plus we were spending three

729
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:33,719
days a week in the garden

730
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:36,240
and I think maybe even at the time when

731
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:36,960
the males had to be separated we might

732
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,599
have

733
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,860
um just had one of our we had a third

734
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:42,839
partner who

735
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:45,119
helped us part-time and he was from

736
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:47,278
Switzerland he's still a good friend of

737
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:49,678
mine I I saw him when I went to spana

738
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:54,240
this in 2019 and stayed at his house

739
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:57,419
that's nice and he's he's five years

740
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,319
older than I am he's he still smokes

741
00:30:57,419 --> 00:31:03,179
hash

742
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:05,700
mixed with tobacco for 50 years as is

743
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:08,340
the custom over there yeah

744
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:11,038
and he's an artist of course Swiss

745
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:12,898
artist and he may have just been down

746
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:15,058
there and as

747
00:31:12,898 --> 00:31:17,939
because I know what you're saying we

748
00:31:15,058 --> 00:31:21,778
ended up it was almost 50 50 with the

749
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:25,200
skunk 50 50 males 50 50 females it was

750
00:31:21,778 --> 00:31:28,440
wow we didn't end up with big huge empty

751
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,840
sections of the garden and we also

752
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:33,058
transplanted into any open sections if

753
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:35,579
we had to we would dig up a plant that

754
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:39,298
was four feet tall with a big room oh

755
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:41,519
wow and slide it over five more feet to

756
00:31:39,298 --> 00:31:43,619
get it in the hole that had more sun and

757
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:45,778
and was empty because a male had been

758
00:31:43,619 --> 00:31:48,658
removed yeah we did a lot of

759
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:50,220
transplanting and movements it was

760
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:52,320
experimental to see if it would work in

761
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:56,100
it yeah they did sure they're very Hardy

762
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:58,859
plants yeah there was resilience the

763
00:31:56,099 --> 00:32:02,038
term wheat is is accurate I mean wow

764
00:31:58,859 --> 00:32:03,959
yeah you know you know Jackie we last

765
00:32:02,038 --> 00:32:06,658
week we talked about the Terps and

766
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:08,220
flavors of Colombian and and you know

767
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:10,080
you were just talking about that first

768
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:12,120
year where the Colombians didn't finish

769
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:14,038
but you got a few purple ones out of

770
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:15,599
there that were you know that were made

771
00:32:14,038 --> 00:32:17,460
good smoke

772
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:19,798
um but you know I wasn't really

773
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:22,440
satisfied with my answer last week when

774
00:32:19,798 --> 00:32:25,019
when I was asked what what did I you

775
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:27,419
know describe those those flavors and

776
00:32:25,019 --> 00:32:29,639
smells coming off of Colombian

777
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:32,820
and you know I realized as I thought

778
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:34,380
back on it that you know the most of my

779
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:37,619
experience and what I know about

780
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:40,440
Colombian is more about what came

781
00:32:37,619 --> 00:32:43,500
imported you know and and was bought

782
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:45,600
than what I grew because it just it was

783
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:47,339
just so difficult to pull those things

784
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:49,980
off

785
00:32:47,339 --> 00:32:52,798
um and so you know for me it's it's such

786
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:54,000
a treat that we have you know we have

787
00:32:52,798 --> 00:32:57,298
it's

788
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,919
the the essence of it captured in in the

789
00:32:57,298 --> 00:33:03,000
ohaze

790
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:06,120
um as as Sam shared it you know that

791
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,859
that because otherwise it's so hard to

792
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:10,139
grow you know Growers all over the

793
00:33:07,859 --> 00:33:11,939
country were like they tried and it

794
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:13,620
didn't turn out well and then they found

795
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,240
something better and this stuff just

796
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:17,158
kind of disappeared

797
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,019
so

798
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:22,260
um but yeah you know can can you talk

799
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:24,019
about that that Colombian the the smells

800
00:33:22,259 --> 00:33:26,460
I mean did the

801
00:33:24,019 --> 00:33:27,778
anthocyanin or whatever the the purple

802
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:29,519
yeah

803
00:33:27,778 --> 00:33:31,558
um did that really take over and

804
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:35,099
dominate the one that you managed to to

805
00:33:31,558 --> 00:33:37,139
harvest and or you know no they were

806
00:33:35,099 --> 00:33:40,918
they

807
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:42,538
yeah because it was like you know it was

808
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:45,059
Thanksgiving

809
00:33:42,538 --> 00:33:47,460
um and as you know when the light starts

810
00:33:45,058 --> 00:33:50,759
dropping down the purple

811
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:53,880
tends to happen more and

812
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:56,940
it it didn't really

813
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,679
have a characteristic the Hawaiians that

814
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:01,080
were wilhakan crosses they had a

815
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:02,100
wonderful scent growing but the

816
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:04,019
Colombian

817
00:34:02,099 --> 00:34:07,439
because they didn't even have the tiny

818
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:10,378
buds till like late October uh beginning

819
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,960
of November they they didn't it wasn't

820
00:34:10,378 --> 00:34:16,079
warm like the hot

821
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:18,358
summer end of the summer they didn't

822
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:21,299
have really much scent at all until they

823
00:34:18,358 --> 00:34:23,460
were dried and then you crushed them yep

824
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:25,019
but the uh

825
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,878
I know what you're talking about the

826
00:34:25,019 --> 00:34:29,519
Piney that's how you would you know

827
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:31,739
focus on the Piney last week and that's

828
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:33,960
you know I had a lot of that too then

829
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:36,178
and you know like I said all my school

830
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:39,000
all my friends at school everybody was

831
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:40,679
growing these Colombian plants and the

832
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,320
Christmas Trees Everybody had these

833
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:45,659
little Christmas trees out there but

834
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,760
um some people they got more mature and

835
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:49,139
you know you got you got a really nice

836
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,679
buds

837
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:54,240
um but the pine was was dominant for

838
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:56,220
sure

839
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:58,618
um but you know the the diversity of

840
00:34:56,219 --> 00:35:00,899
what we got in the imported smoke was

841
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:03,960
just above and beyond

842
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:07,740
you know because the golds and the Reds

843
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:10,280
and you know uh yeah yeah just some

844
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:12,838
amazing stuff you know and

845
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:15,240
distinctive you know each one just such

846
00:35:12,838 --> 00:35:17,039
a unique distinctive thing just like

847
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:20,179
Mexico all of them you know whether it's

848
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:22,380
Sinaloa or Guerrero or Oaxaca yeah

849
00:35:20,179 --> 00:35:24,838
entirely the way they looked they

850
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:27,059
smelled the highs too

851
00:35:24,838 --> 00:35:30,358
yeah whereas Mexico is a long country

852
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:33,659
Colombia is pretty big but there's in

853
00:35:30,358 --> 00:35:36,719
Columbia it was like tropical versus

854
00:35:33,659 --> 00:35:38,699
yeah 5 000 foot level versus Santa Marta

855
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:42,299
way up at eight thousand nine thousand

856
00:35:38,699 --> 00:35:44,759
feet so it they were um land races that

857
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:47,460
didn't really get mixed up too much back

858
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,320
in the old days at least until the 60s

859
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:51,659
maybe yeah

860
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:54,539
and the the impact of the processing and

861
00:35:51,659 --> 00:35:56,699
transport to you know whatever it was in

862
00:35:54,539 --> 00:35:59,099
Colombia before it went on the boat or

863
00:35:56,699 --> 00:36:01,078
in the in the case or the high grade

864
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:03,420
stuff like the golds and the Reds you

865
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:05,400
know maybe on an airplane

866
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:08,460
um you know that that had such an impact

867
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:10,800
on it too but so I think a lot about the

868
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:12,659
commercial stuff that that you know we

869
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:16,500
used to buy on the street or sell even

870
00:36:12,659 --> 00:36:19,019
and you know what I think is interesting

871
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:21,420
is that the essence of that you know

872
00:36:19,019 --> 00:36:25,079
that it was a shadow of what it was when

873
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:27,119
they when they finished it yeah yeah but

874
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:29,160
the essence of it good point

875
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,500
um one thing that we could throw in

876
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:33,118
there is that a number of people that

877
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:36,179
have talked to Matt and I about growing

878
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:39,358
in that era when they first grew green

879
00:36:36,179 --> 00:36:40,618
marijuana they got scared because they

880
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:42,598
didn't think people would want it

881
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:46,019
because all the stuff they got was brown

882
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:47,579
or yellow or gold that's why that's why

883
00:36:46,019 --> 00:36:50,159
I asked last week

884
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:52,200
um if they if they sun dried because

885
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:53,819
that tends to be the way that the the

886
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:56,759
Mexicans and stuff are getting their

887
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:58,800
Golds like girdling or sun drying

888
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,780
but we've heard that consistently that a

889
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,460
lot of times the first home grows or the

890
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,900
first Outdoors that people did in

891
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:06,599
different regions they're like oh my God

892
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:08,160
it's such a weird color it's green are

893
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:10,800
people gonna like it they've never seen

894
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:13,259
it before and like obviously like now

895
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,780
it's shifted but I I'm curious is when

896
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:17,579
you did your when you did your uh your

897
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:19,560
shade drying and stuff like that what

898
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:21,660
kind of colors were you getting was it

899
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:24,599
staying green was it turning Golds and

900
00:37:21,659 --> 00:37:27,059
yellows and Browns no gold yellows or

901
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:28,859
Browns just greens or dark greens the

902
00:37:27,059 --> 00:37:32,820
the skunk number one was super dark

903
00:37:28,858 --> 00:37:34,199
green uh I understand yeah interesting

904
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:38,700
they

905
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:42,239
but even in 76 when we my

906
00:37:38,699 --> 00:37:44,879
dealer friend and I grew that first year

907
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:47,519
the proof was in the pudding we would

908
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:50,820
give people a smoke just one puff or two

909
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:53,759
and they were overwhelmed if they were

910
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:55,859
used to commercial stuff and seedless

911
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,020
they had not seen seedless really unless

912
00:37:55,858 --> 00:38:00,239
they had gotten Thai sticks Thai sticks

913
00:37:58,019 --> 00:38:01,800
were pretty much always seedless and the

914
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:04,759
Thai sticks back then were not green

915
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:07,619
they were brown or you know

916
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:10,740
right I always colored

917
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:12,838
Olive yeah maybe but the light green

918
00:38:10,739 --> 00:38:15,899
you're right I didn't even give that a

919
00:38:12,838 --> 00:38:18,299
thought because once our few people that

920
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,800
bought from us smoked it that's that's

921
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:21,480
all they cared man they bought

922
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:24,180
everything two people bought everything

923
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:25,740
we grew basically that's so cool because

924
00:38:24,179 --> 00:38:27,480
we heard we heard people telling us

925
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:29,598
stories about how when they first grew

926
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:31,858
green weed they tried to Brown it up

927
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,420
because they were like oh man No One's

928
00:38:31,858 --> 00:38:35,338
Gonna want this it's not the right color

929
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:36,838
it doesn't look right it doesn't look

930
00:38:35,338 --> 00:38:38,519
like anything we've ever had we need to

931
00:38:36,838 --> 00:38:41,159
do something it's it's this is wrong

932
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:43,139
well and not only that but some of the

933
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:45,539
earliest you know when people have a bad

934
00:38:43,139 --> 00:38:48,239
experience with green weed so you know

935
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:50,338
the guy who grows a you know a patch

936
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:53,219
full of Colombian and it doesn't finish

937
00:38:50,338 --> 00:38:55,619
and you harvest this leafy stuff with

938
00:38:53,219 --> 00:38:58,739
just a few white hairs and mostly tops

939
00:38:55,619 --> 00:39:01,500
and and you know he handles it poorly

940
00:38:58,739 --> 00:39:03,959
it's loaded with chlorophyll and he he

941
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:05,400
tries he sells it to people and and you

942
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:09,119
know all of a sudden there's this bad

943
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:11,940
reputation green weed is bad right and

944
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:15,000
then the next year people grow different

945
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:16,800
seeds this [ __ ] gets mature they handle

946
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,599
it better you know and all of a sudden

947
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,640
they're there's there's high quality

948
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:23,579
green weed but people's perception of

949
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:26,338
the color is that it's a turn off so you

950
00:39:23,579 --> 00:39:28,200
got to try and overcome that getting

951
00:39:26,338 --> 00:39:30,480
them to you know try it listen this is

952
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:32,759
different or whatever or or the thing

953
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,740
about renaming or changing the

954
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:37,160
appearance I mean a lot of people would

955
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:40,199
you know we we knew that the stuff

956
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:42,960
molded you know that the Colombian that

957
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:45,059
turned it brown it was some sort of mold

958
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,760
from being pressed when it was still wet

959
00:39:45,059 --> 00:39:50,279
or carried in the in the cargo bay of

960
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,320
the ship or whatever and and so it since

961
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:55,140
we've been smoking that stuff for years

962
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:58,200
and and you know people thought that was

963
00:39:55,139 --> 00:39:59,940
okay and uh they might try and you know

964
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:03,059
they might try and press some of their

965
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:05,579
wet homegrown and uh get a different

966
00:40:03,059 --> 00:40:08,699
appearance but it it never turned out

967
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:10,680
like the Colombians you know and uh it

968
00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:12,779
only wound up making it worse but that

969
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:14,759
chlorophyll was pretty horrible to smoke

970
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:16,619
if you had those unfinished tops that

971
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,119
somebody was trying to pass off as smoke

972
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:20,640
and

973
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:23,039
um you know and plus High Times was you

974
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:25,379
know was was becoming really popular and

975
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:28,380
people were here about Green from Hawaii

976
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:30,480
and California at least by the time I

977
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:32,400
was in it so that the thing for us was

978
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,338
you know I mean I would I had produced

979
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:37,980
some amazing freaking Indica buds but I

980
00:40:35,338 --> 00:40:39,900
would say it was Hawaiian you know or

981
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:42,358
from California

982
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:44,940
um just because you know your homegrown

983
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:47,219
isn't you know because I was charging

984
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:50,460
200 an ounce for this stuff

985
00:40:47,219 --> 00:40:52,319
and um and people were happy to pay it

986
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:54,000
even though you know as kids they didn't

987
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,180
have a lot of money they would find a

988
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,179
way

989
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:01,140
I had a guy I had a guy trade me a PA

990
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:05,880
system with you know with a beautiful

991
00:41:01,139 --> 00:41:08,819
mic and a and a fender backstage 20 for

992
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:11,940
um for a half ounce of tie purple tie

993
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:13,800
and he loved it he loved it so much he

994
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:15,838
came back for more and unfortunately I

995
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,820
was out of that and all I had was the

996
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:20,759
green Fino which didn't finish at all

997
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:22,619
and I I was like okay well you know I

998
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,780
knew it wasn't the same stuff but I

999
00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:28,079
wanted the money so I I

1000
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:31,200
sold in that second bag and and he was

1001
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:33,300
so pissed off because I wound up giving

1002
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:35,219
his money back because it wasn't even

1003
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:39,300
close to the same thing as the purple

1004
00:41:35,219 --> 00:41:40,679
one man so with with the skunk one did

1005
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:43,500
you notice any

1006
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:46,078
um like solely broadleaf Expressions

1007
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:48,179
stuff that looked just pure Afghani in

1008
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:52,079
the skunk one cup

1009
00:41:48,179 --> 00:41:54,779
well one of the photos that you posted

1010
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:56,640
last week I think

1011
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:58,380
um what was interesting about the skunk

1012
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:02,819
was it

1013
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:05,820
it grew like long colas and they were

1014
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:07,859
almost self-prooning in the fall the the

1015
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:09,119
sun leaves would all turn yellow and you

1016
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:11,219
could just shake the plant they would

1017
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:14,519
fall off and leave these long green

1018
00:42:11,219 --> 00:42:18,539
colors and I have one photo on my from

1019
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:21,719
that I took that is just slightly blurry

1020
00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:22,858
but it's just a series of the

1021
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:25,500
four

1022
00:42:22,858 --> 00:42:27,679
four to six foot tall colas you know

1023
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:31,079
like one Cola coming out of the ground

1024
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:33,179
and those are the ones that were 6.8

1025
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:37,320
ounces you know on average

1026
00:42:33,179 --> 00:42:40,199
it was dense and and nice uh very deep

1027
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:42,780
deep green but there was no

1028
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:46,799
Indica fat Leaf

1029
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:49,200
um Expressions solely it was uniform it

1030
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:52,680
was truly true breeding at that time

1031
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:55,919
what Robert and Sam had accomplished I

1032
00:42:52,679 --> 00:42:58,980
think Robert was more the geneticist in

1033
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:01,019
doing it but there's some some place in

1034
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:04,318
the history where they said they had ten

1035
00:43:01,019 --> 00:43:07,019
thousand things going in Red Cups and

1036
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:09,059
they chose from that and I don't know if

1037
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:11,759
that's accurate but I'm not sure yeah

1038
00:43:09,059 --> 00:43:14,338
and it it really um

1039
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:17,819
when we planted it it grew the way it

1040
00:43:14,338 --> 00:43:20,279
looked each plant they had a little bit

1041
00:43:17,818 --> 00:43:22,880
wider leaves certainly than like

1042
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:27,300
Acapulco Gold or Santa Martin or

1043
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:28,619
tropical thin Leaf but uh nothing like

1044
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:32,400
the uh

1045
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:35,220
deep chunk or Maple Leaf indicas that

1046
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:38,519
you know people had on on icy mag that

1047
00:43:35,219 --> 00:43:41,239
look just like you know umbrellas almost

1048
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:44,219
you could yeah your head if it's raining

1049
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:47,098
dinosaur leaves yeah

1050
00:43:44,219 --> 00:43:48,659
exactly was it your impression then I

1051
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:50,579
mean obviously you said before that you

1052
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:53,039
reached out to

1053
00:43:50,579 --> 00:43:55,920
um you reached out to to Rob through a

1054
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:57,480
letter and contacted him

1055
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,338
um and he brought you the seeds is what

1056
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:02,639
you said previously

1057
00:43:59,338 --> 00:44:05,039
um when it did you meet Sam back then

1058
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:07,679
did he talk about their partnership did

1059
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:09,239
he did they did he tell you any of the

1060
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:10,739
work that he had done to get to skunk

1061
00:44:09,239 --> 00:44:11,598
one

1062
00:44:10,739 --> 00:44:14,519
um

1063
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:16,859
all my info came from Robert I never met

1064
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:19,980
Sam I've never talked to him personally

1065
00:44:16,858 --> 00:44:24,000
I've I've private message with him on

1066
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:24,719
icmag in 2012 but nothing

1067
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,039
um

1068
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:31,618
I've I've sent him some labels for his

1069
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:34,500
collection but I don't

1070
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:36,119
I've never met him it was all second

1071
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:38,219
hand from Robert

1072
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:40,619
when he described

1073
00:44:38,219 --> 00:44:42,659
um and I I don't know if Rob was when I

1074
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:44,940
got on that when I got on there Sam was

1075
00:44:42,659 --> 00:44:47,338
very big that's where I saw all of his

1076
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:49,440
collection of of you know essentially

1077
00:44:47,338 --> 00:44:50,880
breeder art and grower art that they

1078
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,318
would that they would make and attach to

1079
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,700
their pounds

1080
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:55,559
um he would post a lot in something

1081
00:44:53,699 --> 00:44:56,879
called I was was it called the Breeders

1082
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:58,739
lab

1083
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,660
maybe something like that yeah something

1084
00:44:58,739 --> 00:45:02,699
along those lines but he was pretty

1085
00:45:00,659 --> 00:45:04,379
active in that

1086
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:06,358
um and so

1087
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:08,818
I I was just I'm just always curious

1088
00:45:06,358 --> 00:45:10,619
just about like what you know had did

1089
00:45:08,818 --> 00:45:13,500
Rob tell you how long he'd been working

1090
00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:16,140
on skunk one when he gave it to you or

1091
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:17,099
any kind of like any info along those

1092
00:45:16,139 --> 00:45:20,818
lines

1093
00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:22,559
yeah that you know he worked in Ben

1094
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:24,960
Loman which is a little town up in the

1095
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:27,659
Redwoods just above

1096
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,280
um Santa Cruz you you might go through

1097
00:45:27,659 --> 00:45:30,179
Ben Lomond for instance if you're going

1098
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,240
to go up

1099
00:45:30,179 --> 00:45:36,179
further up to like lahonda where Neil

1100
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:39,000
Young lived still a distance from San

1101
00:45:36,179 --> 00:45:40,318
Francisco and he told me that that's

1102
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,579
where he they had their little

1103
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:45,960
Underground

1104
00:45:41,579 --> 00:45:48,300
Greenhouse going and and but he made it

1105
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:51,720
sound like it they had been doing it for

1106
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:54,119
a year or two before he never went into

1107
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:57,000
the history of these other neighbors and

1108
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:59,099
Santa Cruz that Sam knew that were the

1109
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,420
two brothers and yeah

1110
00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:02,818
um

1111
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:04,019
all those stories those I read more

1112
00:46:02,818 --> 00:46:07,199
about later

1113
00:46:04,019 --> 00:46:08,940
in on icmag and people disputing it and

1114
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:10,439
one person saying oh no it was this and

1115
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:11,159
that so

1116
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:14,039
um

1117
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:16,920
yeah he he he mentioned though that he

1118
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:18,719
had been working on it I bought his 1977

1119
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:20,639
Treatise

1120
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:22,858
um not from him I don't know where I

1121
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:24,539
found it but somewhere online and then

1122
00:46:22,858 --> 00:46:26,940
when he came out with marijuana botany

1123
00:46:24,539 --> 00:46:28,739
you know everyone bought it

1124
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:31,338
but if it wasn't for the Growers guide

1125
00:46:28,739 --> 00:46:33,979
Mel Franks we would have failed because

1126
00:46:31,338 --> 00:46:37,019
when we had that year the second year

1127
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:39,599
where we got this Twist on the end of

1128
00:46:37,019 --> 00:46:42,420
all of our plants and they were already

1129
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:44,099
six foot seven foot plants we were like

1130
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:45,358
freaking out because they were supposed

1131
00:46:44,099 --> 00:46:47,880
to be getting

1132
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:51,000
flowers instead they had the leaves

1133
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:53,338
twisting and we

1134
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:56,219
he talked about micronutrients and how

1135
00:46:53,338 --> 00:46:59,279
you could have a you could be short and

1136
00:46:56,219 --> 00:47:00,419
a couple micronutrients in your soil and

1137
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:04,440
that could make the world of difference

1138
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:06,420
so we got some concentrated

1139
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:10,139
um

1140
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:11,639
seaweed extract yeah which have 90

1141
00:47:10,139 --> 00:47:14,279
different

1142
00:47:11,639 --> 00:47:18,480
sure yeah minerals from the ocean

1143
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:21,240
nothing even comes close and we bought a

1144
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:23,159
big backpack pump sprayer and then we

1145
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:25,259
filled it with water I think it held two

1146
00:47:23,159 --> 00:47:29,059
gallons and just walked around and

1147
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:31,920
sprayed the plants and I think we did it

1148
00:47:29,059 --> 00:47:34,078
once and waited a three or four days and

1149
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,059
then we did it again and but by the end

1150
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:38,339
of a week or eight or nine days they

1151
00:47:36,059 --> 00:47:40,199
were all untwisting so whatever what

1152
00:47:38,338 --> 00:47:42,179
they were missing and it was because of

1153
00:47:40,199 --> 00:47:45,118
Mel Frank's book about Mike talking

1154
00:47:42,179 --> 00:47:47,818
about micronutrient problems

1155
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:50,000
um we kind of zoned it down to being

1156
00:47:47,818 --> 00:47:52,199
molybdenum

1157
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,539
lack of molybdenum you know what's

1158
00:47:52,199 --> 00:47:58,379
what's amazing about that to me is that

1159
00:47:54,539 --> 00:48:01,139
uh many years later in 1993 when I was

1160
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:03,180
planning on growing for the first time

1161
00:48:01,139 --> 00:48:07,199
two of the three books that taught me

1162
00:48:03,179 --> 00:48:11,098
things was uh Rob Clark's uh marijuana

1163
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:13,078
botany and Mel Franks Growers guide yeah

1164
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:14,818
you know there are different editions by

1165
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:16,740
then obviously they'd been through some

1166
00:48:14,818 --> 00:48:18,719
revisions and things as time had gone on

1167
00:48:16,739 --> 00:48:21,479
but the same knowledge

1168
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:23,759
uh to a young kid desperate for it so

1169
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:25,380
that's pretty cool that that Grower's

1170
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:29,060
guide there was nothing that even came

1171
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:32,400
close when it first came out I mean yeah

1172
00:48:29,059 --> 00:48:35,639
it really was really was fantastic mine

1173
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:38,460
got so dog-eared I I put some like Rings

1174
00:48:35,639 --> 00:48:40,440
through it uh to hold it together and I

1175
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:42,300
I passed it on to you know another

1176
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:45,780
another guy that

1177
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:48,000
you know wound up growing and

1178
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:49,859
breeding and taking seeds to dead

1179
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,679
concerts and stuff which was pretty

1180
00:48:49,858 --> 00:48:55,318
pretty foreign to me as a

1181
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:57,598
skateboard punk rocker you know yeah

1182
00:48:55,318 --> 00:48:59,219
interesting Mel it was I think I can't

1183
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:01,380
remember there was three people involved

1184
00:48:59,219 --> 00:49:03,059
in that book Mel Frank and Ed Rosenthal

1185
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:03,780
of the two I remember off the top of my

1186
00:49:03,059 --> 00:49:06,539
head

1187
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:08,460
but there was a third author uh that was

1188
00:49:06,539 --> 00:49:10,259
that contributed to it to some degree I

1189
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:12,420
still have the books at my house it was

1190
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:15,420
Ang Lee no he's another photographer

1191
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:18,420
yeah that's it right there yeah that's

1192
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:21,659
the one yeah that book that book I've

1193
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:23,400
probably read a hundred times in this in

1194
00:49:21,659 --> 00:49:25,920
the six or eight months before I set up

1195
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:27,180
my first indoor because I had no idea

1196
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,400
what I was doing

1197
00:49:27,179 --> 00:49:31,139
yeah

1198
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:33,838
you got it not so it was probably called

1199
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:35,879
the indoor outdoor marijuana growers

1200
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:38,239
guide but the original one was just

1201
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:42,000
Grower's guide Grower's guide yeah

1202
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:45,000
indeed I indexed my books

1203
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:48,000
so that I could go in there and find

1204
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:49,619
whatever page I needed to really quickly

1205
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,119
um

1206
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:54,900
and

1207
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:56,099
then on the marijuana Spirits guide

1208
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:58,440
yeah

1209
00:49:56,099 --> 00:50:00,420
more stuff you know five hours direct

1210
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:02,220
life minimum

1211
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:05,639
I think it's probably hard for young

1212
00:50:02,219 --> 00:50:08,338
people today to like conceive of just

1213
00:50:05,639 --> 00:50:10,739
how sparse and hard to come by some of

1214
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:12,659
this information was because they're

1215
00:50:10,739 --> 00:50:15,899
used to the internet and typing things

1216
00:50:12,659 --> 00:50:18,118
in and forums and resources but it was

1217
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:20,700
really limited back then

1218
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:23,160
um in terms of what you could access and

1219
00:50:20,699 --> 00:50:25,559
you know and how to learn and so those

1220
00:50:23,159 --> 00:50:27,960
books played them obviously even with

1221
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:31,078
you guys they played a massive role

1222
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:33,659
in uh in teaching people exactly how to

1223
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:36,900
pull off a successful crop this is the

1224
00:50:33,659 --> 00:50:38,940
first first year came out 1978 it was

1225
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:42,119
the first edition and or press in

1226
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:44,400
Berkeley and mine is kind of falling

1227
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:45,900
apart so I understand what you're

1228
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,358
talking about

1229
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:51,358
um oh look what's one of my book markers

1230
00:50:48,358 --> 00:50:52,619
in here I didn't even remember oh yeah

1231
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:54,598
look at that

1232
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:55,920
that's another one so I have at least

1233
00:50:54,599 --> 00:50:56,579
two of them

1234
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,500
um

1235
00:50:56,579 --> 00:51:00,599
and

1236
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:03,239
we used to we used to go to the library

1237
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:05,880
and I mean I would search for everything

1238
00:51:03,239 --> 00:51:08,279
on hydroponics because I even growing

1239
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:11,338
outdoors I was doing outdoor hydroponics

1240
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:13,500
in in 1981 you know

1241
00:51:11,338 --> 00:51:16,078
um five gallon buckets filled with peat

1242
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:20,280
moss cow [ __ ] perlite and vermiculite

1243
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:22,440
and then you know fed with Eco grow

1244
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:26,220
um you know granular

1245
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:28,858
two-part mix and uh

1246
00:51:26,219 --> 00:51:31,439
yeah so I went to the library and I I

1247
00:51:28,858 --> 00:51:33,779
started researching Hydroponics and

1248
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:37,920
basically I stole any good book from the

1249
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:39,599
library that Hydroponics and uh kept it

1250
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:43,980
you know

1251
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:46,318
that was uh very much self-study this is

1252
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:48,420
the book um we are referring to the the

1253
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:51,300
Rob Clark thesis it's called the botany

1254
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:54,180
and Ecology of cannabis this is my copy

1255
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:56,180
but I scanned in is it loaded on the

1256
00:51:54,179 --> 00:52:00,299
screen they're numbered

1257
00:51:56,179 --> 00:52:02,460
mine's not mine's actually not no it's

1258
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:04,380
one of the few that's not um Clark

1259
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:06,059
actually uh the one of the few times

1260
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:08,640
that he's ever responded about anything

1261
00:52:06,059 --> 00:52:12,420
was to give me the print run on it and

1262
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:14,578
apparently there were I think 1500 total

1263
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:16,200
um where it was a first print a 500 and

1264
00:52:14,579 --> 00:52:17,700
a second print of a thousand but you

1265
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:20,719
can't tell the difference between the

1266
00:52:17,699 --> 00:52:24,358
two summer number and some are not

1267
00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:26,459
but another example this is he we drew

1268
00:52:24,358 --> 00:52:28,739
this by hand and all through the book

1269
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:31,318
this book are his drawings yeah

1270
00:52:28,739 --> 00:52:34,558
extraordinary I can just imagine him

1271
00:52:31,318 --> 00:52:37,679
getting wasted and just sitting and just

1272
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:38,400
digging drawing I could not draw that by

1273
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:40,558
hand

1274
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:42,480
no they're they're beautiful drawings in

1275
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:45,660
here like and that's one of the things

1276
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:47,880
like I've been sitting on it forever and

1277
00:52:45,659 --> 00:52:50,159
you know it's not really out there for

1278
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:51,900
people to see but there are some of the

1279
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:54,000
most beautiful drawings of cannabis and

1280
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:55,639
the in the Cannabis par the parts of the

1281
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:59,338
cannabis plant

1282
00:52:55,639 --> 00:53:02,960
I've ever seen yeah it's it's crazy he

1283
00:52:59,338 --> 00:53:02,960
did such an amazing job back then

1284
00:53:06,139 --> 00:53:12,779
it kind of It kind of you know it kind

1285
00:53:09,179 --> 00:53:15,118
of reminds me of early early botanists

1286
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:17,940
and explorers geneticists they'd travel

1287
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:20,640
around you know different Iowans and

1288
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:22,280
stuff and discovering dodo birds and

1289
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:25,139
things like that and sitting around

1290
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:28,380
drawing in their sketchbooks describing

1291
00:53:25,139 --> 00:53:31,500
the fauna and Flora of these these

1292
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:35,160
exotic locations it's just gorgeous and

1293
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:37,500
he got it so accurately I mean just they

1294
00:53:35,159 --> 00:53:40,078
looked exactly right the the Indica

1295
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:43,260
plants that he he drew in marijuana

1296
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:46,740
botany were just spot on you know yeah

1297
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:49,200
and uh the elegant the Elegance of the

1298
00:53:46,739 --> 00:53:51,779
branches and the weaves that he drew I I

1299
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:53,939
just I I always I didn't know if he drew

1300
00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:56,040
him or somebody else did but I did I

1301
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:57,780
asked him yeah he drew him I just

1302
00:53:56,039 --> 00:54:00,239
thought they were gorgeous

1303
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:03,480
yeah there's another book he did called

1304
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:05,459
hence that was released in Germany that

1305
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:08,460
has some beautiful illustrations of his

1306
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:10,980
and um but it's not available in the

1307
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:12,960
United States but if you guys can trace

1308
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:13,980
down a copy of hand which is German for

1309
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,659
him

1310
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:17,338
um there's more beautiful drawings from

1311
00:54:15,659 --> 00:54:19,318
him in there

1312
00:54:17,338 --> 00:54:22,380
cool

1313
00:54:19,318 --> 00:54:25,920
if you zoom over to the humbled uh up

1314
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:28,440
here on your list the article that I

1315
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:30,838
found on humble growing

1316
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:34,139
I thought not the dog would find this

1317
00:54:30,838 --> 00:54:36,539
interesting it has a it has Rob Clark in

1318
00:54:34,139 --> 00:54:40,679
the corner here when he's 29 years old

1319
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:42,838
oh wow sure does holding a Bud and it's

1320
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:45,358
in color but I I only scan in in black

1321
00:54:42,838 --> 00:54:47,818
and white because I my I'm running low

1322
00:54:45,358 --> 00:54:49,578
on the other well actually I could have

1323
00:54:47,818 --> 00:54:52,139
scanned it that's true

1324
00:54:49,579 --> 00:54:55,920
it's okay this works I've been thinking

1325
00:54:52,139 --> 00:54:59,539
about it but I I met him

1326
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:01,920
I I think this article is from about

1327
00:54:59,539 --> 00:55:03,599
1982 because they mentioned something

1328
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:08,720
the price of Marijuana

1329
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:11,880
in 82 so yeah right up here yeah

1330
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:14,879
in 82 an estimated 1.8 billion dollars

1331
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:17,519
the street value yeah so he was 29 in

1332
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:21,000
82. if so you can go backwards and

1333
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:22,559
figure that out how old he is and and

1334
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,380
I met Rob

1335
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:28,800
he came down to Negril once with his

1336
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:31,318
wife at the time and I was we hung out

1337
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:33,000
together for a few days in the group and

1338
00:55:31,318 --> 00:55:35,880
the concept was he was going to look for

1339
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,739
some you know land races there Jamaican

1340
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:39,960
I yeah I didn't see them after those

1341
00:55:37,739 --> 00:55:42,058
first few days but I think he traveled

1342
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:43,920
around a bit

1343
00:55:42,059 --> 00:55:47,400
um but this is great because it talks

1344
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:50,240
about the helicopters in in Humboldt and

1345
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:50,240
at this time

1346
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:53,940
I'm so glad you saved this stuff that's

1347
00:55:52,019 --> 00:55:54,838
the second photo

1348
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:57,420
um

1349
00:55:54,838 --> 00:55:58,558
I figure where it is

1350
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:00,420
oh well

1351
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:02,400
one of the uh one of the interesting

1352
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:04,680
things about when helicopters first

1353
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,780
started flying is that people were

1354
00:56:04,679 --> 00:56:09,118
growing all these giant sativas in the

1355
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:10,800
hills and Humboldt and Mendocino and

1356
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:12,480
nobody as long as you were tucked away

1357
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:14,880
nobody cared how big they were because

1358
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,619
no one was looking for them and so

1359
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:18,059
there's articles I've read where like

1360
00:56:16,619 --> 00:56:20,700
the very first

1361
00:56:18,059 --> 00:56:23,460
Gardens that got busted by helicopters

1362
00:56:20,699 --> 00:56:26,639
they actually chopped down most of the

1363
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:29,220
gardens with chainsaws yeah because the

1364
00:56:26,639 --> 00:56:30,779
the stocks were like this they were so

1365
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:33,779
big and thick and the people weren't

1366
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:37,140
worried about about getting caught um so

1367
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:41,460
they just had these ginormous uh you

1368
00:56:37,139 --> 00:56:45,118
know these huge sativa plants

1369
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:47,818
um oh goodness look at that yeah right

1370
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:50,220
gangster oh that's yeah that that's

1371
00:56:47,818 --> 00:56:52,639
that's pushing a certain narrative not

1372
00:56:50,219 --> 00:56:52,639
at all

1373
00:56:55,639 --> 00:57:01,019
chainsaw thing uh was that's that was

1374
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:03,000
common down in where I was living too

1375
00:57:01,019 --> 00:57:06,838
you know the National Guard helicopters

1376
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:09,358
were flying uh looking looking for the

1377
00:57:06,838 --> 00:57:11,699
crop and you know when we would go out

1378
00:57:09,358 --> 00:57:14,519
when I went out to my Gardens I was

1379
00:57:11,699 --> 00:57:16,799
always dressed in camouflage

1380
00:57:14,519 --> 00:57:20,280
um you know the the whole gorilla

1381
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:22,800
mindset leaving no Trail you you would

1382
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:25,680
create a trail to your spot where you

1383
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:27,780
would go from step to step always

1384
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:30,539
putting your foot in exactly the same

1385
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:33,240
spot that you did the time before you

1386
00:57:30,539 --> 00:57:35,279
know crawling under bushes and stuff to

1387
00:57:33,239 --> 00:57:37,979
it was um

1388
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:41,040
yeah you're probably familiar rajo we

1389
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:42,960
have we have a bunch of manzanitas uh in

1390
00:57:41,039 --> 00:57:44,400
Mendocino County which are for people

1391
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:47,639
that aren't familiar they're kind of

1392
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:50,099
these like Smooth limbed bushes that get

1393
00:57:47,639 --> 00:57:52,379
anywhere from six to 12 feet tall

1394
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:54,359
and you can kind of thin them out

1395
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:55,980
underneath and a lot of people grew in

1396
00:57:54,358 --> 00:57:57,960
Manzanita patches because you could

1397
00:57:55,980 --> 00:58:01,139
still get some filtered light but it

1398
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:03,240
wasn't going to be totally exposed so uh

1399
00:58:01,139 --> 00:58:05,519
crawling around in Manzanita patches and

1400
00:58:03,239 --> 00:58:08,639
and cutting off lower branches to make

1401
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:11,940
spots for Gardens is is like my first

1402
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:14,279
outdoor experiences up there right there

1403
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:17,039
sir can you zoom in on this this is

1404
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:19,619
these are humble photos from that same

1405
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:21,119
article let's see here I'm gonna try to

1406
00:58:19,619 --> 00:58:23,160
zoom in a little bit

1407
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:25,380
no he's holding up something on his

1408
00:58:23,159 --> 00:58:27,078
thing Matt oh okay let me see you over

1409
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:29,579
here

1410
00:58:27,079 --> 00:58:31,680
it's not easy to get back to you hold on

1411
00:58:29,579 --> 00:58:32,760
there we go there we go

1412
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:36,239
um

1413
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:38,940
damn it Matt oh look at that guys

1414
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:43,379
pruning their father and son pruning

1415
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:45,539
some big leaf plants too yeah and they

1416
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:47,400
both have 38 caliber weapons in their

1417
00:58:45,539 --> 00:58:50,219
back pocket that they point out in this

1418
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:54,059
article on the guard dog and then here's

1419
00:58:50,219 --> 00:58:56,818
an aerial shot of a huge Garden like the

1420
00:58:54,059 --> 00:58:58,798
chainsaw you're just describing

1421
00:58:56,818 --> 00:59:00,619
um people took that risk but it didn't

1422
00:58:58,798 --> 00:59:03,659
always work once the helicopters came

1423
00:59:00,619 --> 00:59:06,140
the helicopters dramatically changed

1424
00:59:03,659 --> 00:59:09,239
people's approaches

1425
00:59:06,139 --> 00:59:11,699
to a huge degree because most of these

1426
00:59:09,239 --> 00:59:13,618
things were grown in in like like you

1427
00:59:11,699 --> 00:59:16,139
know I mean that's super easily visible

1428
00:59:13,619 --> 00:59:19,798
from the air but like now there is not

1429
00:59:16,139 --> 00:59:22,259
from driving around that's him yeah

1430
00:59:19,798 --> 00:59:25,079
yeah the color difference is just so

1431
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:27,599
obvious from the air you know it the

1432
00:59:25,079 --> 00:59:29,640
tactics for hiding this stuff became you

1433
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:31,559
know pretty oh look at this gaster

1434
00:59:29,639 --> 00:59:34,500
creative these are your Humboldt

1435
00:59:31,559 --> 00:59:37,019
sheriffs yeah in the garden that they

1436
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:39,838
just dismantled

1437
00:59:37,019 --> 00:59:43,619
you know that Newsweek magazine um mad

1438
00:59:39,838 --> 00:59:45,838
Jag the that came out that at the same

1439
00:59:43,619 --> 00:59:47,880
time there was another article I can't

1440
00:59:45,838 --> 00:59:51,119
remember if it was time or it was a

1441
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:53,640
national publication where they came out

1442
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:57,358
with an article talking about this new

1443
00:59:53,639 --> 01:00:00,358
high potency kind of super weed that was

1444
00:59:57,358 --> 01:00:03,199
that was you know flooding the streets

1445
01:00:00,358 --> 01:00:05,639
called skunk yeah

1446
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:08,219
I've been I've been looking for this

1447
01:00:05,639 --> 01:00:10,078
magazine or this article ever since and

1448
01:00:08,219 --> 01:00:12,358
I honestly I thought the reference was

1449
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:13,740
in that Newsweek that had the guy with

1450
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:16,739
the mask

1451
01:00:13,739 --> 01:00:19,139
um and the and the M16 but

1452
01:00:16,739 --> 01:00:20,879
um it's it wasn't you know I've read

1453
01:00:19,139 --> 01:00:22,798
that article since and I don't think

1454
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:25,318
there's a reference to it but they

1455
01:00:22,798 --> 01:00:28,619
described the effects of skunk

1456
01:00:25,318 --> 01:00:31,199
in that article it's it's classic Reefer

1457
01:00:28,619 --> 01:00:33,480
Madness you know writing yeah

1458
01:00:31,199 --> 01:00:35,578
um you know but they honestly they got

1459
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:37,440
it right and they they described the

1460
01:00:35,579 --> 01:00:40,920
appearance of it they describe the

1461
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:44,460
effects and uh it was pretty spot on for

1462
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:47,338
what I thought skunk was tears what is

1463
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:52,199
this one a reason for Tears look at that

1464
01:00:47,338 --> 01:00:54,599
this is um from the state of of Utah and

1465
01:00:52,199 --> 01:00:57,000
it's a it's an entire Reaper Madness

1466
01:00:54,599 --> 01:00:58,740
basically

1467
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:01,039
um about

1468
01:00:58,739 --> 01:01:01,039
foreign

1469
01:01:05,519 --> 01:01:11,298
High School undercover it's an article

1470
01:01:08,298 --> 01:01:13,920

1472
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:18,420
t-shirt but he's shown his badge and

1473
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:20,338
it's a whole article about going

1474
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:23,519
undercover in the various high schools

1475
01:01:20,338 --> 01:01:26,159
in Utah like 21 Jump Street like the TV

1476
01:01:23,519 --> 01:01:28,259
show oh yeah I mean I'll tell you this

1477
01:01:26,159 --> 01:01:31,318
is obviously so much later but the first

1478
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:33,780
time that I ever saw a guy with waist

1479
01:01:31,318 --> 01:01:37,079
long dreadlocks tackle someone and then

1480
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:40,519
put cuffs on them oh wow and on dead

1481
01:01:37,079 --> 01:01:40,519
tour I was like oh man

1482
01:01:47,719 --> 01:01:53,098
they're labeled like Hawaiian Maui

1483
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:55,379
stickless Thai orange Colombian they

1484
01:01:53,099 --> 01:01:57,500
smell Colombian wrong too they always

1485
01:01:55,380 --> 01:02:01,140
spell it wrong

1486
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:01,739
Maui so they had some really good

1487
01:02:01,139 --> 01:02:04,379
um

1488
01:02:01,739 --> 01:02:06,659
photos here of different things that

1489
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:10,440
they had confiscated well Hawken red

1490
01:02:06,659 --> 01:02:11,940
Colombian red Guerrero gold

1491
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:14,159
wow

1492
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:16,318
um I always love those pictures the

1493
01:02:14,159 --> 01:02:18,719
reference pictures from point of origin

1494
01:02:16,318 --> 01:02:21,119
and time are so valuable so so so

1495
01:02:18,719 --> 01:02:22,439
valuable but it's hard when it's cops

1496
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:23,940
you know taking the pictures and you got

1497
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:25,318
to hope that they got your bag right and

1498
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:26,720
got this to get the strain name with it

1499
01:02:25,318 --> 01:02:28,980
and [ __ ]

1500
01:02:26,719 --> 01:02:31,098
I think if it's your bag you probably

1501
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:35,219
got other things to worry about

1502
01:02:31,099 --> 01:02:37,920
indeed freaking provenance you know

1503
01:02:35,219 --> 01:02:39,959
I mean one thing one thing that I think

1504
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,760
is kind of interesting too and it's it's

1505
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:44,220
it's obviously we don't need to dwell on

1506
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:45,900
it too much but I do think that like

1507
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:47,159
from what I'm listening to when you guys

1508
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:49,380
are talking about all these different

1509
01:02:47,159 --> 01:02:51,118
Highland and lowland Colombians and all

1510
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:52,619
these different regions and stuff like

1511
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:54,298
that and all these different Mexicans

1512
01:02:52,619 --> 01:02:57,059
and what they were

1513
01:02:54,298 --> 01:02:59,579
I kind of think that like the cocaine

1514
01:02:57,059 --> 01:03:01,680
trade and profitability with that sort

1515
01:02:59,579 --> 01:03:03,599
of blocked off the next generation of

1516
01:03:01,679 --> 01:03:06,000
Americans from being able to experience

1517
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:07,619
that because the groups that we're all

1518
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,659
bringing in those Colombians and

1519
01:03:07,619 --> 01:03:12,119
bringing in those Mexicans they shifted

1520
01:03:09,659 --> 01:03:14,818
to a more profitable thing and then it

1521
01:03:12,119 --> 01:03:16,740
also became unsafe for people a lot of

1522
01:03:14,818 --> 01:03:19,139
times that looked like us to go down to

1523
01:03:16,739 --> 01:03:22,078
those regions and get those things

1524
01:03:19,139 --> 01:03:23,879
so there was this era it was two things

1525
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:25,680
that were happening at the same time yes

1526
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:28,140
the cocaine you know

1527
01:03:25,679 --> 01:03:29,759
um became much more profitable for the

1528
01:03:28,139 --> 01:03:32,759
same people that you you know were

1529
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:34,619
formerly smuggling cannabis but at the

1530
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:38,880
same time the American you know

1531
01:03:34,619 --> 01:03:41,818
homegrown Market had had happened

1532
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:44,940
and and that product was just such a

1533
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:47,159
higher level of quality than what what

1534
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:49,740
the Imports had because of the freshness

1535
01:03:47,159 --> 01:03:52,858
and you know the introduction of

1536
01:03:49,739 --> 01:03:55,558
hard-hitting uh hard-hitting indicas and

1537
01:03:52,858 --> 01:03:57,659
in their high levels what what year do

1538
01:03:55,559 --> 01:04:03,119
you think that was

1539
01:03:57,659 --> 01:04:04,500
80 82 83 oh wow yeah because I mean we

1540
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:06,298
don't need to Sidetrack on it but

1541
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:08,818
there's been an interplay between like

1542
01:04:06,298 --> 01:04:11,880
what Mexico and down south does versus

1543
01:04:08,818 --> 01:04:14,400
what's going on in America and like each

1544
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:16,619
one responding to the other in terms of

1545
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:18,358
cannabis that's been going on for I

1546
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:20,160
guess that's not a that's not a side

1547
01:04:18,358 --> 01:04:24,440
track at all as a matter of fact it's

1548
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:24,440
another mad Jag story yeah

1549
01:04:24,619 --> 01:04:29,579
should we dive on into that I think

1550
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:31,980
that's a good idea I would love to I

1551
01:04:29,579 --> 01:04:35,039
mean that the the story about you know

1552
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:36,240
how you know mad Jag's uh contribution

1553
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:40,500
to the

1554
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:43,679
to the the Mexican uh cannabis gene pool

1555
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:46,380
my peoples you represent my peoples in

1556
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:48,899
Mexico all right so how did they how did

1557
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:51,358
this start happening what era did the um

1558
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:52,559
the Mexico stuff start occurring uh Jag

1559
01:04:51,358 --> 01:04:56,818
and how

1560
01:04:52,559 --> 01:05:02,400
well the last year I grew in Mad Jack

1561
01:04:56,818 --> 01:05:06,960
Canyon was 81. so by 82

1562
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:09,298
I I knew a guy who was a pilot and it's

1563
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:10,079
not the pilot I wrote about like

1564
01:05:09,298 --> 01:05:12,358
um

1565
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:16,200
that you know when we talked about 60

1566
01:05:12,358 --> 01:05:18,539
tons of Packy hatch yeah this is a guy

1567
01:05:16,199 --> 01:05:19,679
I met him when I was working a regular

1568
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:23,159
job

1569
01:05:19,679 --> 01:05:25,639
at a truck loading place I worked for

1570
01:05:23,159 --> 01:05:30,118
Georgia Pacific for two years in Phoenix

1571
01:05:25,639 --> 01:05:32,460
in the late 70s and this guy one day he

1572
01:05:30,119 --> 01:05:34,380
walked up to me I was loading his truck

1573
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:36,059
up with empty plastic bottles which is

1574
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:37,798
what they produced at Georgia Pacific

1575
01:05:36,059 --> 01:05:41,519
and he said uh

1576
01:05:37,798 --> 01:05:43,798
hey if if I found a whole bunch of of

1577
01:05:41,519 --> 01:05:47,900
weed out in the desert

1578
01:05:43,798 --> 01:05:50,759
um could you sell it I said what

1579
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:53,240
I had short hair too and but he just

1580
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:55,559
figured he felt that Vibe

1581
01:05:53,239 --> 01:05:56,459
and and I said what do you mean he says

1582
01:05:55,559 --> 01:05:59,880
well

1583
01:05:56,460 --> 01:06:03,000
I was flying over this area and I see

1584
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:05,160
where someone jettisoned when an empty

1585
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,420
fuel canister and it's stuck in the

1586
01:06:05,159 --> 01:06:08,399
ground and I'm gonna go out there and

1587
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:10,200
check it and it I think it's they were

1588
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:14,338
smuggling weed and I went

1589
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:15,598
sure man just let me know and he came

1590
01:06:14,338 --> 01:06:17,699
back a week later and he was all

1591
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:19,859
disappointed because it was just an

1592
01:06:17,699 --> 01:06:21,419
empty fuel canister damn

1593
01:06:19,858 --> 01:06:23,400
um and it was actually Air Force that

1594
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:24,720
had dropped it and it was stuck in the

1595
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:27,298
ground it looked like a bomb you know

1596
01:06:24,719 --> 01:06:29,699
yeah and it didn't explode but then he

1597
01:06:27,298 --> 01:06:31,980
started talking about other things and

1598
01:06:29,699 --> 01:06:34,379
then all of a sudden

1599
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:37,019
like two months later he comes back and

1600
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:40,920
I'm loading his truck and he says

1601
01:06:37,019 --> 01:06:43,500
um I I met the people in Mexico and and

1602
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:47,400
I said what and so

1603
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:49,500
he's he stole a twin engine Cessna from

1604
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:52,318
Scottsdale airport flew it to

1605
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:54,059
Guadalajara and gave it to the cartel to

1606
01:06:52,318 --> 01:06:57,358
prove to them that he was not a nerd

1607
01:06:54,059 --> 01:06:59,640
that is a gangster I know

1608
01:06:57,358 --> 01:07:02,699
later he stole a helicopter out of

1609
01:06:59,639 --> 01:07:04,318
Apache Junction and flew it down but he

1610
01:07:02,699 --> 01:07:06,598
only got 20 miles into Mexico before

1611
01:07:04,318 --> 01:07:09,960
something went wrong mechanically and he

1612
01:07:06,599 --> 01:07:11,818
had to crash land and Hike his way back

1613
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:14,159
and the FBI came to his house because he

1614
01:07:11,818 --> 01:07:16,679
found his fingerprints in Mexico on this

1615
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:18,659
and he denied everything so they

1616
01:07:16,679 --> 01:07:20,519
couldn't do anything scared the [ __ ] out

1617
01:07:18,659 --> 01:07:24,719
of him but I bet

1618
01:07:20,519 --> 01:07:28,920
they good Lord they brought several

1619
01:07:24,719 --> 01:07:31,679
loads of of weed I found an airstrip in

1620
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:34,139
along the Mogan Rim in a small town area

1621
01:07:31,679 --> 01:07:37,199
way out by itself

1622
01:07:34,139 --> 01:07:38,639
and they were like within five minutes

1623
01:07:37,199 --> 01:07:40,818
they said they would be there at one

1624
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:44,519
o'clock they were like they're at 105

1625
01:07:40,818 --> 01:07:46,619
kicking out Bales onto the aircraft and

1626
01:07:44,519 --> 01:07:48,960
they would they would bring 500 kilos

1627
01:07:46,619 --> 01:07:51,298
each flight and that's where one of two

1628
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:53,519
of the flights had labels already in

1629
01:07:51,298 --> 01:07:55,019
them from someone who was supposed to

1630
01:07:53,519 --> 01:07:58,259
get them in California but something

1631
01:07:55,019 --> 01:07:59,880
went wrong and we got them instead girl

1632
01:07:58,260 --> 01:08:02,339
I'm still hunting for those labels I've

1633
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:04,980
got them somewhere but

1634
01:08:02,338 --> 01:08:07,980
um anyway

1635
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:11,880
so you had a connection with those guys

1636
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:14,400
yeah it was 82 and 83. El bufaro that

1637
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:16,679
Raphael Caro Quintero

1638
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:18,539
um you could see it from space it was a

1639
01:08:16,679 --> 01:08:20,520
square couple miles you know they show

1640
01:08:18,539 --> 01:08:22,920
it in that TV show

1641
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:25,140
um Narco Mexico yeah so that's that's

1642
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:26,060
the name of the Garden or the farm El

1643
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:28,338
Buffalo

1644
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:33,060
Rancho Buffalo

1645
01:08:28,338 --> 01:08:37,579
and was this at the beginning of the the

1646
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:40,319
um Gallardo era of the development

1647
01:08:37,579 --> 01:08:41,698
when they were just doing weed yeah

1648
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:45,000
exactly

1649
01:08:41,698 --> 01:08:48,298
what happened was they they grew

1650
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:50,039
thousands and thousands of hectares of

1651
01:08:48,298 --> 01:08:52,619
of

1652
01:08:50,039 --> 01:08:55,380
weed but they didn't have anyone Growing

1653
01:08:52,619 --> 01:08:57,960
Seeds seed crops so they they were

1654
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:59,219
desperate for seeds and so my pilot

1655
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:01,798
friend

1656
01:08:59,219 --> 01:09:04,140
along with my other friend who was the

1657
01:09:01,798 --> 01:09:07,619
weed dealer in Tempe we filled two

1658
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:09,779
quart-sized bags half full and he stuck

1659
01:09:07,619 --> 01:09:12,238
one on each of his cowboy boots and

1660
01:09:09,779 --> 01:09:15,239
flewalahar and gave it to them and they

1661
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:19,079
were so grateful because it they they

1662
01:09:15,238 --> 01:09:21,358
had no seeds yeah so unfortunately I was

1663
01:09:19,079 --> 01:09:24,238
part of this because

1664
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:26,460
seeds from five different zones in

1665
01:09:24,238 --> 01:09:29,519
Mexico ended up in their hands and

1666
01:09:26,460 --> 01:09:31,319
became the new hybrid and

1667
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:32,819
um oh well

1668
01:09:31,319 --> 01:09:36,539
I was like why would you say

1669
01:09:32,819 --> 01:09:38,580
informatically in 1980s Dutch genetics

1670
01:09:36,539 --> 01:09:40,560
were already in the grill of Jamaica and

1671
01:09:38,579 --> 01:09:42,179
the people who wild over them they were

1672
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:45,120
growing them up in Orange Hill and all

1673
01:09:42,179 --> 01:09:49,380
this so land races were getting squeezed

1674
01:09:45,119 --> 01:09:52,559
out and um to find true Jamaican I don't

1675
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:54,420
think it's there anymore yeah sure

1676
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:56,400
there's probably land race that's still

1677
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:58,500
in stash spots and certainly in Colombia

1678
01:09:56,399 --> 01:10:01,500
but boy

1679
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:03,179
Jamaica being a little island so maybe

1680
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:05,279
you could clarify for a second then

1681
01:10:03,179 --> 01:10:07,739
those seeds that you brought down or he

1682
01:10:05,279 --> 01:10:10,139
brought down smuggled in his boots what

1683
01:10:07,738 --> 01:10:13,678
were they a mix of they were a mix of

1684
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:15,960
guerreran sin alone Michoacan oaxacan

1685
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:18,119
that my dealer friend and Tempe had high

1686
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:19,340
graded over the course of like two or

1687
01:10:18,119 --> 01:10:21,779
three years

1688
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:24,239
the best of the loads that had passed

1689
01:10:21,779 --> 01:10:25,738
through reloads and so that's why you

1690
01:10:24,238 --> 01:10:27,419
were like oh you were a little bummed

1691
01:10:25,738 --> 01:10:30,059
about it because you kind of mixed the

1692
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:31,619
strains and then they started growing in

1693
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:33,239
and then instead of it being like a

1694
01:10:31,619 --> 01:10:35,939
regional thing where these specific

1695
01:10:33,238 --> 01:10:38,879
kinds were coming from it was sort of a

1696
01:10:35,939 --> 01:10:42,479
blend coming back right and we have no

1697
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:43,560
idea El buflo got discovered um I wrote

1698
01:10:42,479 --> 01:10:46,979
down this

1699
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:50,699
November 14th of 84 is when they found

1700
01:10:46,979 --> 01:10:52,799
it and burned it and it actually the

1701
01:10:50,698 --> 01:10:55,979
smoke affected people within a hundred

1702
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:58,619
mile radius because they've earned 500

1703
01:10:55,979 --> 01:11:02,039
hectares and they estimate that it was

1704
01:10:58,619 --> 01:11:05,819
worth 2.5 billion dollars at that time

1705
01:11:02,039 --> 01:11:09,119
in 84. so there's a famous it's a famous

1706
01:11:05,819 --> 01:11:12,119
scene in narcos where he um I think it

1707
01:11:09,119 --> 01:11:15,179
was it was guyana's brother RAF is that

1708
01:11:12,119 --> 01:11:17,158
a brother it produces in the in the in

1709
01:11:15,179 --> 01:11:20,219
the series like this is the super the

1710
01:11:17,158 --> 01:11:22,399
super strain the the sinsamia

1711
01:11:20,219 --> 01:11:25,079
um right

1712
01:11:22,399 --> 01:11:27,299
was this before or after you met him

1713
01:11:25,079 --> 01:11:28,559
that or is this the the hybrid that

1714
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:31,500
you're talking about

1715
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:35,460
well we gave them a seats in 82 and 83

1716
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:37,140
and El buflo was captured and burned I

1717
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:41,100
don't know if it ran for years before

1718
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:42,900
that but just in general they Quintero

1719
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:44,880
was growing weed in other places but

1720
01:11:42,899 --> 01:11:46,799
Buffalo was like their

1721
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:48,420
huge place they had their own Wells

1722
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:50,400
drilled there

1723
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:53,279
um it was in Sinaloa

1724
01:11:50,399 --> 01:11:56,399
um and I've I've read about it in a book

1725
01:11:53,279 --> 01:11:59,340
called The Underground I forget I've got

1726
01:11:56,399 --> 01:12:01,379
the book it's like 900 pages long and

1727
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:04,020
it's um

1728
01:12:01,380 --> 01:12:06,359
written by a DEA agent who is in charge

1729
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:08,340
of all this stuff going on then and it

1730
01:12:06,359 --> 01:12:10,380
has three chapters one on heroin one on

1731
01:12:08,340 --> 01:12:13,440
cocaine and one on weed and the one on

1732
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:15,719
Weeds about Buffalo being spotted by a

1733
01:12:13,439 --> 01:12:18,119
TWA pilot or something they're flying

1734
01:12:15,719 --> 01:12:19,920
over and they went what in the world and

1735
01:12:18,119 --> 01:12:23,579
they just mentioned it casually that's

1736
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:26,460
where Kiki Camarena got a job and what

1737
01:12:23,579 --> 01:12:30,059
and actually penetrated it and in the

1738
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:32,039
second movie of sicario it's so popular

1739
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:34,380
it's kind of similar because he's

1740
01:12:32,039 --> 01:12:35,579
dressed up as a composino and he gets a

1741
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:38,520
job

1742
01:12:35,579 --> 01:12:40,380
um yeah Kiki is the is that the that's

1743
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:42,199
the name of the de agent that got killed

1744
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:46,079
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

1745
01:12:42,198 --> 01:12:48,960
Marina and that caused a huge amount of

1746
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:51,179
problems oh yeah that was it yeah I left

1747
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:52,679
it alone you know but they didn't

1748
01:12:51,179 --> 01:12:55,520
um and that's when they were switching

1749
01:12:52,679 --> 01:12:59,819
over to cocaine just about then

1750
01:12:55,520 --> 01:13:02,960
84.85 I think that being burned Quintero

1751
01:12:59,819 --> 01:13:07,259
um from what I read just became

1752
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:08,520
an addict of you know drug addict of

1753
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:09,600
whatever

1754
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:11,699
um

1755
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:14,280
he was sad he didn't want to see them go

1756
01:13:11,698 --> 01:13:17,879
into cocaine but Raphael

1757
01:13:14,279 --> 01:13:20,099
um Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo he went

1758
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:21,840
ahead and went you know he became he

1759
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:25,020
formed the first cartel with all these

1760
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:28,140
loose plazas that were existing guys

1761
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:31,860
over here and guys over there and

1762
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:34,980
I stayed at his hotel in 84 one of his

1763
01:13:31,859 --> 01:13:37,259
many he owned apparently a lot and my

1764
01:13:34,979 --> 01:13:39,658
friend who was the pilot we went down

1765
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:42,239
there and my friend from Colombia

1766
01:13:39,658 --> 01:13:45,779
found his way there from Colombia and we

1767
01:13:42,238 --> 01:13:48,959
all had a big party and they were hoping

1768
01:13:45,779 --> 01:13:50,939
that my friend from Colombia would be

1769
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:52,739
able to turn them on to New York

1770
01:13:50,939 --> 01:13:55,259
connections and stuff I don't know

1771
01:13:52,738 --> 01:13:58,259
really what happened because he loved to

1772
01:13:55,260 --> 01:14:00,000
do Coke but he and I both decided we

1773
01:13:58,260 --> 01:14:04,380
didn't want to be in that business yeah

1774
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:07,319
and the pilot this guy he he kept going

1775
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:09,420
they were using our airstrip the one

1776
01:14:07,319 --> 01:14:11,939
that we had found for weed

1777
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:14,460
sixteen hundred to two thousand pounds

1778
01:14:11,939 --> 01:14:16,559
of coke at the time they did nine loads

1779
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:18,600
and then they in off-duty Sheriff who

1780
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:21,960
was cutting wood saw them landing and

1781
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:23,940
unloading and they got busted and um I

1782
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:27,060
have no idea what happened it was in the

1783
01:14:23,939 --> 01:14:30,299
newspaper I've got a clip I've I've

1784
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:31,560
posted before I think on icy mag

1785
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:35,340
but

1786
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:38,520
I I never met I never met Miguel Felix

1787
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:42,300
but um my partners did

1788
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:44,400
I did enjoy his Hospitality because we

1789
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:48,119
went in this hotel room there was a just

1790
01:14:44,399 --> 01:14:50,879
like in the movies a plate with a four

1791
01:14:48,119 --> 01:14:52,319
ounce pile of cocaine on it and two

1792
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:54,960
other guys who did nothing but just

1793
01:14:52,319 --> 01:14:58,139
bring cases of beer all through the

1794
01:14:54,960 --> 01:15:01,020
days that's nice of them yeah

1795
01:14:58,140 --> 01:15:03,420
sounds like a weekend at not so's place

1796
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:08,540
I guess yeah it is it is except except

1797
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:08,539
there's a lot more men a lot it's crazy

1798
01:15:08,819 --> 01:15:14,099
Matt loves that if he doesn't at least

1799
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:16,500
wants a show try to throw me off my game

1800
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:19,500
with something like that he's upset so

1801
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:22,560
yeah uh yeah my bound is opening and he

1802
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:25,619
took it yeah that's what she said

1803
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:28,560
but I mean just just you know Rahul to

1804
01:15:25,619 --> 01:15:31,380
that that whole thing is just crazy but

1805
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:33,659
when I when I was when I was starting to

1806
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:36,420
do gorilla in California one of the

1807
01:15:33,658 --> 01:15:38,460
things that the Mexicans did was that

1808
01:15:36,420 --> 01:15:40,920
um even with the cocaine I was told that

1809
01:15:38,460 --> 01:15:44,760
like still 70 of their profits was

1810
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:46,980
marijuana and so they really didn't like

1811
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:50,039
um all this homegrown in the west coast

1812
01:15:46,979 --> 01:15:52,319
sort of taking their taking their you

1813
01:15:50,039 --> 01:15:55,560
know their their sales really well and

1814
01:15:52,319 --> 01:15:58,079
so they started sending these teams all

1815
01:15:55,560 --> 01:16:00,780
from down by where Matt is all the way

1816
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:03,059
up to the Oregon border and going in the

1817
01:16:00,779 --> 01:16:04,800
national forests and just growing a huge

1818
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:07,500
amount as much as they could get away

1819
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:08,940
with in all the national forests so that

1820
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:12,179
way they didn't have to smuggle it over

1821
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:13,439
the Border yeah you know and that's that

1822
01:16:12,179 --> 01:16:15,239
was kind of so there's been this

1823
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:17,399
obviously this like that's what I was

1824
01:16:15,238 --> 01:16:20,339
saying before about like how one one

1825
01:16:17,399 --> 01:16:22,198
country influences the other is the

1826
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:24,539
Homegrown movement has dramatically

1827
01:16:22,198 --> 01:16:26,879
changed changed how the how the Mexicans

1828
01:16:24,539 --> 01:16:29,100
approach growing weed because you know

1829
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:31,619
for a long time they were sort of the

1830
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:33,239
primary weed people yeah

1831
01:16:31,619 --> 01:16:35,519
yeah for sure

1832
01:16:33,238 --> 01:16:36,539
especially in Arizona with the Border

1833
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:38,280
here

1834
01:16:36,539 --> 01:16:42,060
um Tucson was like the capital of

1835
01:16:38,279 --> 01:16:43,920
Smugglers and and dealers and then it

1836
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:46,980
moved up to Phoenix and Tempe and

1837
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:50,819
Scottsdale but they they busted a big

1838
01:16:46,979 --> 01:16:53,039
grow in the canyon next to us just 10 15

1839
01:16:50,819 --> 01:16:56,158
years ago and it was a gang from from

1840
01:16:53,039 --> 01:16:58,679
Mexico operating out of Phoenix and they

1841
01:16:56,158 --> 01:17:01,019
had a spring that they had found up on

1842
01:16:58,679 --> 01:17:04,079
the side of this mountain and they had a

1843
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:07,260
system of drip irrigation that ran a

1844
01:17:04,079 --> 01:17:10,439
mile down into the canyon Jesus yeah

1845
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:12,739
they just went too big these guys they

1846
01:17:10,439 --> 01:17:16,139
just didn't even think about hunters and

1847
01:17:12,738 --> 01:17:18,299
ranchers and they just threw a team at

1848
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:22,100
it group all this stuff and then they

1849
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:25,260
all got busted so he blew it out yeah

1850
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:27,000
I mean to some degree on a spring on a

1851
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:28,860
hillside model that's that's the way it

1852
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,840
was done in NorCal when I was out there

1853
01:17:28,859 --> 01:17:33,119
that summer I'm sure yeah lots of that

1854
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:35,940
right I mean the I think the cartels

1855
01:17:33,119 --> 01:17:38,460
kind of had a uh they viewed their a lot

1856
01:17:35,939 --> 01:17:40,019
of their workers as semi-disposable and

1857
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:42,000
so they sort of expected a certain

1858
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:44,040
amount to get in trouble and they just

1859
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,479
threw a lot of people out there in a lot

1860
01:17:44,039 --> 01:17:47,519
of different regions and they figured

1861
01:17:45,479 --> 01:17:48,539
most of them will be successful and some

1862
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:50,100
of them won't

1863
01:17:48,539 --> 01:17:52,380
yep and that's kind of how they went

1864
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:54,840
about it I think just a numbers game

1865
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:56,219
yeah I mean they had money

1866
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:58,440
but you know when the pal when the

1867
01:17:56,219 --> 01:18:00,840
powder came in you know I think a lot of

1868
01:17:58,439 --> 01:18:04,139
that Colombian uh import just

1869
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:06,300
disappeared stopped entirely yeah and

1870
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:09,239
the Mexican commercial became they

1871
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:12,719
probably filled the gap for that for

1872
01:18:09,238 --> 01:18:15,359
that uh tier of product quality around

1873
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:17,158
the country I can tell you that

1874
01:18:15,359 --> 01:18:19,619
um you know I mean I started smoking in

1875
01:18:17,158 --> 01:18:21,658
the 90s there was brown Mexican and

1876
01:18:19,619 --> 01:18:24,539
green Mexican I didn't see Thai I didn't

1877
01:18:21,658 --> 01:18:26,279
see Colombian I didn't see Panamanian I

1878
01:18:24,539 --> 01:18:29,219
didn't see any of those of those famous

1879
01:18:26,279 --> 01:18:32,460
things that people wax poetic about it

1880
01:18:29,219 --> 01:18:34,020
was Mexican yeah I saw movies and I'm a

1881
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:36,359
decade later and all I saw was Mexican

1882
01:18:34,020 --> 01:18:38,640
too you know just you know I never saw

1883
01:18:36,359 --> 01:18:42,899
Thai never saw anything other than just

1884
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:46,020
Mexican yeah yeah it was gone okay so we

1885
01:18:42,899 --> 01:18:48,238
got a little bit into Mexico just just a

1886
01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:49,980
hair do you want to go more into that is

1887
01:18:48,238 --> 01:18:51,238
there some more details you want to add

1888
01:18:49,979 --> 01:18:54,658
in there

1889
01:18:51,238 --> 01:18:56,399
not really it's just rubbing shoulders

1890
01:18:54,658 --> 01:18:58,439
with these famous people was kind of

1891
01:18:56,399 --> 01:19:00,599
weird I didn't know who they were at the

1892
01:18:58,439 --> 01:19:03,658
time they were just

1893
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:05,699
um guys exporting weed from Guadalajara

1894
01:19:03,658 --> 01:19:07,439
area but then when we found out it was

1895
01:19:05,698 --> 01:19:10,619
Miguel Angel

1896
01:19:07,439 --> 01:19:14,819
um and yeah we were like whoa [ __ ] man

1897
01:19:10,619 --> 01:19:17,880
yeah I bet we I'm so glad we didn't get

1898
01:19:14,819 --> 01:19:20,939
sucked into the cocaine deal because the

1899
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:22,560
the guy who who was a truck driver he

1900
01:19:20,939 --> 01:19:26,539
could fly helicopters he could fly

1901
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:29,580
planes he he went that direction and

1902
01:19:26,539 --> 01:19:32,340
installed 10 kilos to an undercover

1903
01:19:29,579 --> 01:19:34,979
agent north of Phoenix in the biggest

1904
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:37,319
hand-to-hand sale Buy in Arizona history

1905
01:19:34,979 --> 01:19:39,238
at the time and he got I think it was

1906
01:19:37,319 --> 01:19:41,519
seven kilos and he got 10 years in

1907
01:19:39,238 --> 01:19:44,819
prison Jesus and his brother kept going

1908
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:47,340
and did those loads on our air our

1909
01:19:44,819 --> 01:19:49,139
airstrip that we found

1910
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:52,020
um and they got nine of them before they

1911
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:54,719
got busted and we calculated at the

1912
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:57,560
price of coke at the time that it was it

1913
01:19:54,719 --> 01:20:01,260
came to around a quarter billion dollars

1914
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:03,420
whoa 250 million dollars of coke that

1915
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:06,060
they successfully brought in before they

1916
01:20:03,420 --> 01:20:10,039
got busted and I have no idea what

1917
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:13,199
happened to those boys boy geez yeah

1918
01:20:10,039 --> 01:20:15,840
roselda Blanco I had never heard her

1919
01:20:13,198 --> 01:20:18,539
name until I read about it in Newsweek

1920
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:21,179
or time but that's who my Colombian

1921
01:20:18,539 --> 01:20:23,640
friend was actually working for and his

1922
01:20:21,179 --> 01:20:25,980
job was to count money and he would go

1923
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:28,199
to Aspen where they bring in DC nines or

1924
01:20:25,979 --> 01:20:31,439
something like six tons at a time of

1925
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:33,479
Colombian and he would just

1926
01:20:31,439 --> 01:20:34,799
his fingers he could barely move them

1927
01:20:33,479 --> 01:20:36,799
after a week because they didn't have

1928
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:40,020
machines yet then she's I can imagine

1929
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:44,480
hand counting five million dollars you

1930
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:44,480
know in 20s and tens and

1931
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:50,880
and that's where the stories started

1932
01:20:48,479 --> 01:20:53,519
happening about how they weighed their

1933
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:57,119
their money because in Florida he went

1934
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:59,640
to a apartment building once and he said

1935
01:20:57,119 --> 01:21:01,319
there'd be like five apartments and

1936
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:03,060
they'd have a secret door in a closet

1937
01:21:01,319 --> 01:21:05,819
that would link it to the next apartment

1938
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:07,440
into the next apartment so that if they

1939
01:21:05,819 --> 01:21:08,939
had to Barrel they could just disappear

1940
01:21:07,439 --> 01:21:12,178
yeah

1941
01:21:08,939 --> 01:21:14,639
he went into one apartment and he said

1942
01:21:12,179 --> 01:21:16,859
it was floor to ceiling with tiny

1943
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:19,199
passageways in the hallways of just

1944
01:21:16,859 --> 01:21:21,359
money piled floor to ceiling every

1945
01:21:19,198 --> 01:21:23,698
single room and he said there was

1946
01:21:21,359 --> 01:21:26,158
millions of millions of dollars and and

1947
01:21:23,698 --> 01:21:28,859
that was one of the kind of places where

1948
01:21:26,158 --> 01:21:31,738
they would just weigh money yeah you

1949
01:21:28,859 --> 01:21:34,259
know and then send it back to Colombia

1950
01:21:31,738 --> 01:21:35,639
that's so wild and the responsibility of

1951
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:36,960
being the dude who has to count it

1952
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:38,159
because like you get that [ __ ] wrong

1953
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:39,179
you're going to be the first person they

1954
01:21:38,158 --> 01:21:39,979
look at

1955
01:21:39,179 --> 01:21:42,779
right

1956
01:21:39,979 --> 01:21:45,198
not me

1957
01:21:42,779 --> 01:21:48,179
yeah might be making friends in Brooklyn

1958
01:21:45,198 --> 01:21:52,019
the guy who's in charge he goes by the

1959
01:21:48,179 --> 01:21:55,679
nickname SATA he overpaid us once two

1960
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:57,300
thousand dollars and I know him and he

1961
01:21:55,679 --> 01:21:59,399
did it as a trick to see if we were

1962
01:21:57,300 --> 01:22:01,380
going to tell him and be honest oh

1963
01:21:59,399 --> 01:22:04,920
interesting we counted the money a

1964
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:07,859
second time and I I said in his house in

1965
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:09,960
Brownsville and I said you know Sada

1966
01:22:07,859 --> 01:22:13,439
you're overt by two thousand dollars he

1967
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:14,939
goes what no no not even possible and he

1968
01:22:13,439 --> 01:22:15,899
was just messing with us because he

1969
01:22:14,939 --> 01:22:18,359
wanted

1970
01:22:15,899 --> 01:22:20,219
we were it was early in our relationship

1971
01:22:18,359 --> 01:22:23,880
and you wanted to see if we were honest

1972
01:22:20,219 --> 01:22:27,119
enough and we passed we passed the test

1973
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:29,100
so that was good yeah that's a good

1974
01:22:27,119 --> 01:22:32,099
thing yeah I used to do that with my

1975
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:33,539
spray like my reversal spray I'd give it

1976
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:36,060
to different people and you know give

1977
01:22:33,539 --> 01:22:38,039
them different like yeah you know for

1978
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:39,780
this exchange or this exchange and like

1979
01:22:38,039 --> 01:22:41,279
knowing mostly that I was never going to

1980
01:22:39,779 --> 01:22:43,619
get anything but just trying to get a

1981
01:22:41,279 --> 01:22:45,359
good gauge of who is going to just take

1982
01:22:43,619 --> 01:22:47,460
it run with it use it to make themselves

1983
01:22:45,359 --> 01:22:50,819
a bunch of money or who would do you

1984
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:53,158
know what they said it's a good way I

1985
01:22:50,819 --> 01:22:54,719
mean it's it's a small loss but it's a

1986
01:22:53,158 --> 01:22:56,759
good way to judge a potential future

1987
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:58,819
lifelong friend too

1988
01:22:56,760 --> 01:23:03,000
yeah

1989
01:22:58,819 --> 01:23:06,299
cheap way to to figure out who you can

1990
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:08,100
trust absolutely and to them and to the

1991
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:10,380
other person it's almost like

1992
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:12,300
from a greedy person's angle it's like

1993
01:23:10,380 --> 01:23:13,920
well this one bottle could potentially

1994
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:15,900
make me you know several thousand

1995
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:18,480
dollars worth of feminized seed so is it

1996
01:23:15,899 --> 01:23:21,059
worth the bird you know and a lot of

1997
01:23:18,479 --> 01:23:24,119
times it is worth the burn to people hmm

1998
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:25,500
yeah magic madjag always says if there

1999
01:23:24,119 --> 01:23:28,260
is a doubt

2000
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:31,260
about a person then there is no doubt

2001
01:23:28,260 --> 01:23:32,039
it's a good quote that's a line from the

2002
01:23:31,260 --> 01:23:32,760
movie

2003
01:23:32,039 --> 01:23:37,920
um

2004
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:39,960
Ronin and from running yep and yep um he

2005
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:42,119
says if there's a doubt there is no

2006
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:43,920
doubt and yeah it's near the end of the

2007
01:23:42,119 --> 01:23:45,719
movie and that's when you find out that

2008
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:47,460
he never quit and he was still working

2009
01:23:45,719 --> 01:23:50,579
for the

2010
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:54,539
CIA or something yeah um Robert De Niro

2011
01:23:50,579 --> 01:23:57,960
right classical movie but it's true it

2012
01:23:54,539 --> 01:24:00,960
if you I treat my life that way if I

2013
01:23:57,960 --> 01:24:04,020
have a doubt about something I just go

2014
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:07,399
I'll wait and see what the universe does

2015
01:24:04,020 --> 01:24:09,659
I I didn't do that when I was younger

2016
01:24:07,399 --> 01:24:11,759
you seem to have jumped in with both

2017
01:24:09,658 --> 01:24:13,979
feet you know you seem to have a very

2018
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:17,699
magical touched life though I mean a lot

2019
01:24:13,979 --> 01:24:21,539
of people you know only live a fraction

2020
01:24:17,698 --> 01:24:24,119
or see a fraction of what what you uh

2021
01:24:21,539 --> 01:24:26,760
managed to get yourself wound up in time

2022
01:24:24,119 --> 01:24:29,640
and time again and and the fact is you

2023
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:31,860
guys weren't Outlaws as far as carrying

2024
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:34,739
guns and being Cowboys and stuff like

2025
01:24:31,859 --> 01:24:36,198
that you carried this very humble

2026
01:24:34,738 --> 01:24:39,359
um

2027
01:24:36,198 --> 01:24:41,339
yeah I had a great big throwing knife on

2028
01:24:39,359 --> 01:24:43,799
my hip when I was going to the canyon

2029
01:24:41,340 --> 01:24:44,880
and you know I don't know what good that

2030
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:48,539
would do

2031
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:50,039
um but we specifically didn't we knew

2032
01:24:48,539 --> 01:24:52,380
other people some of the guys from

2033
01:24:50,039 --> 01:24:54,779
Jerome they were all heavily armed and

2034
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:56,819
they would have barbed wire in the

2035
01:24:54,779 --> 01:24:58,738
bushes and weird stuff you read about

2036
01:24:56,819 --> 01:24:59,939
this in magazines and yeah and I was

2037
01:24:58,738 --> 01:25:02,459
just going that's

2038
01:24:59,939 --> 01:25:05,039
that makes them instantly

2039
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:06,619
um dangerous criminals yeah yeah we were

2040
01:25:05,039 --> 01:25:08,880
just hippies

2041
01:25:06,619 --> 01:25:12,840
criminals that's an important

2042
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:14,699
distinction to make because I think uh

2043
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:17,039
We've chatted for long enough now that I

2044
01:25:14,698 --> 01:25:19,379
can safely say that everybody on on this

2045
01:25:17,039 --> 01:25:21,840
uh this little this little call that

2046
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:24,960
we're doing is is a weed nerd you know

2047
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:26,520
yeah in that regard and so for me

2048
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:28,980
um having been in a bunch of Counter

2049
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:31,980
Culture kind of my whole life I totally

2050
01:25:28,979 --> 01:25:33,959
differentiate between like people who do

2051
01:25:31,979 --> 01:25:36,539
certain substances but are otherwise

2052
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:37,920
like honorable and very good people it's

2053
01:25:36,539 --> 01:25:40,079
just some of the things they decided to

2054
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:43,679
get into happen to not be societally

2055
01:25:40,079 --> 01:25:46,738
acceptable right right and then people

2056
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:48,779
that are like actual criminals

2057
01:25:46,738 --> 01:25:50,218
you know yeah where it's and there's a

2058
01:25:48,779 --> 01:25:53,698
big difference there because there's a

2059
01:25:50,219 --> 01:25:55,679
lot of people that are wonderful people

2060
01:25:53,698 --> 01:25:56,879
um and the only thing that they do wrong

2061
01:25:55,679 --> 01:26:00,960
really they could get them into

2062
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:02,760
significant trouble is marijuana yeah

2063
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:04,139
you know and I and I was looking when I

2064
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:06,480
was listening to you guys talk about

2065
01:26:04,139 --> 01:26:08,219
some of the the the transition into

2066
01:26:06,479 --> 01:26:09,779
powders and stuff like that one of the

2067
01:26:08,219 --> 01:26:12,840
things that I've always thought about is

2068
01:26:09,779 --> 01:26:15,658
that like the weed game or the weed

2069
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:18,539
scene is inherently just like less

2070
01:26:15,658 --> 01:26:20,399
dangerous than that other world like

2071
01:26:18,539 --> 01:26:22,500
when that other world started happening

2072
01:26:20,399 --> 01:26:24,719
maybe it's because of the way it makes

2073
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:26,579
people think or the way people act or

2074
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:30,239
the money was so much bigger

2075
01:26:26,579 --> 01:26:32,399
but it seemed to bring out a lot of like

2076
01:26:30,238 --> 01:26:35,039
negative qualities in people that when

2077
01:26:32,399 --> 01:26:37,379
you were in the weed game existed but

2078
01:26:35,039 --> 01:26:40,198
maybe weren't like maybe weren't like

2079
01:26:37,380 --> 01:26:44,400
accented quite so much right you know

2080
01:26:40,198 --> 01:26:46,500
yep well my friends in Brooklyn they

2081
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:48,779
would oh Sato would open the door and

2082
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:50,880
he'd have a Mach 9 in his hand you know

2083
01:26:48,779 --> 01:26:54,238
and he'd look around and make sure it

2084
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:56,159
was cool to let us in but they had they

2085
01:26:54,238 --> 01:26:58,379
had plenty of weapons but my friend

2086
01:26:56,158 --> 01:27:00,420
Ricky who is still my friend I see him

2087
01:26:58,380 --> 01:27:03,060
when I go to New York he lives in

2088
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:07,079
Brooklyn in the same apartment since 74.

2089
01:27:03,060 --> 01:27:10,139
he uh never ever had a gun the other

2090
01:27:07,079 --> 01:27:13,319
rostas did and but he was he's a

2091
01:27:10,139 --> 01:27:13,920
philosopher he's a real gentle guy

2092
01:27:13,319 --> 01:27:17,519
um

2093
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:22,139
is a good brother of mine I've known him

2094
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:24,120
40 years now and he uh he's wonderful I

2095
01:27:22,139 --> 01:27:26,100
go have curry goat with him whenever

2096
01:27:24,119 --> 01:27:28,920
we're there he takes me a different

2097
01:27:26,100 --> 01:27:31,500
restaurant and

2098
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:32,940
Aki and saltfish they have in these

2099
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:34,380
those Caribbean neighborhoods you know

2100
01:27:32,939 --> 01:27:35,939
you can still get all that the

2101
01:27:34,380 --> 01:27:36,719
restaurants

2102
01:27:35,939 --> 01:27:38,939
um

2103
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:41,579
they cater to the people who live there

2104
01:27:38,939 --> 01:27:43,678
so it's very cool I love that stuff

2105
01:27:41,579 --> 01:27:45,420
I would say too like for Mendocino

2106
01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:47,460
County there's definitely people that

2107
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:49,380
have guns that have the intention on

2108
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:51,359
using them you know if they were

2109
01:27:49,380 --> 01:27:54,300
accosted by other humans but there was a

2110
01:27:51,359 --> 01:27:57,238
lot of Growers that had guns on them

2111
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:59,579
simply because they were in some remote

2112
01:27:57,238 --> 01:28:01,919
ass spot on the hill and if they came

2113
01:27:59,579 --> 01:28:04,920
across a bear with Cubs or a mountain

2114
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:06,960
lion they didn't want to just die right

2115
01:28:04,920 --> 01:28:09,060
they wanted to have a fighting chance so

2116
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:12,420
there was there was this idea of I'm

2117
01:28:09,060 --> 01:28:15,239
alone in the Deep Woods by myself

2118
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:17,279
and this is not my territory

2119
01:28:15,238 --> 01:28:19,500
and there's bear and Mountain Lion and

2120
01:28:17,279 --> 01:28:23,340
other things that that uh I'm a lot

2121
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:25,380
weaker than even Jaguars yeah yeah the

2122
01:28:23,340 --> 01:28:27,539
Jaguars yeah I mean even that I mean

2123
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:29,400
mountain lions this you know Bears

2124
01:28:27,539 --> 01:28:30,840
usually here

2125
01:28:29,399 --> 01:28:32,638
um mountain lions they they've been

2126
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:34,319
watching you for a while if you ever

2127
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:35,639
even know that they're there

2128
01:28:34,319 --> 01:28:37,139
you know

2129
01:28:35,639 --> 01:28:39,300
um but we would encounter all that that

2130
01:28:37,139 --> 01:28:40,500
kind of stuff like a lot of times all of

2131
01:28:39,300 --> 01:28:41,639
a sudden something would go wrong with

2132
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:43,738
our water

2133
01:28:41,639 --> 01:28:45,960
and we'd have to walk the water line

2134
01:28:43,738 --> 01:28:47,759
back to like the the cat you know the

2135
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:49,920
the spring box that we had made or

2136
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:54,000
something right and you're walking

2137
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:56,520
through Deep Woods totally alone

2138
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,960
you know and you're in the Deep Woods

2139
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:59,880
and you know you don't have teeth or

2140
01:28:57,960 --> 01:29:02,039
Claws and you're not super strong

2141
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:03,539
so some people would have pistols or

2142
01:29:02,039 --> 01:29:05,340
shotguns or something just to make

2143
01:29:03,539 --> 01:29:07,920
themselves feel okay when they're out

2144
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:10,739
there in the sticks yeah dual dual

2145
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:13,920
Dobermans is is popular with some people

2146
01:29:10,738 --> 01:29:16,319
I interviewed yeah two Dobermans and

2147
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:19,399
they were you know they went wherever

2148
01:29:16,319 --> 01:29:22,319
they went they had their Dobermans and

2149
01:29:19,399 --> 01:29:26,238
one's name was Tor and the other one was

2150
01:29:22,319 --> 01:29:26,238
Tia tortilla I know

2151
01:29:26,359 --> 01:29:32,460
this one guy and you know they they were

2152
01:29:30,359 --> 01:29:33,899
not quite command dogs but they were

2153
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:36,000
close you would tell them to do

2154
01:29:33,899 --> 01:29:38,759
something and they would just do it yeah

2155
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:41,219
so and they'd sniff out a bear or a bear

2156
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:43,159
would you know better let your dogs

2157
01:29:41,219 --> 01:29:46,079
fight the bearer than you

2158
01:29:43,158 --> 01:29:48,119
I mean in my era too it became

2159
01:29:46,079 --> 01:29:50,100
uncomfortable because

2160
01:29:48,119 --> 01:29:53,039
um the penalty for getting caught with a

2161
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:54,840
gun at a at a row was actually like

2162
01:29:53,039 --> 01:29:57,840
quite a bit worse than the grow itself

2163
01:29:54,840 --> 01:30:00,539
yeah then it was kind of like a do you

2164
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:02,039
risk it even because even if even if you

2165
01:30:00,539 --> 01:30:03,899
were gonna beat the case on a medical

2166
01:30:02,039 --> 01:30:05,760
thing or something like that later on

2167
01:30:03,899 --> 01:30:08,819
with the grow they'd be like oh no he's

2168
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:10,739
a hardened criminal armed right he was

2169
01:30:08,819 --> 01:30:13,559
ready to hurt people and we caught him

2170
01:30:10,738 --> 01:30:16,198
well you know that's what this is from

2171
01:30:13,560 --> 01:30:19,199
that humbled article and they're they're

2172
01:30:16,198 --> 01:30:23,460
pointing out this machine gun

2173
01:30:19,198 --> 01:30:26,460
yeah and it says Humboldt deputies

2174
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:29,939
sees this menacing array of Weaponry

2175
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:32,279
including an Uzi and an AK-47 along with

2176
01:30:29,939 --> 01:30:34,019
marijuana in raids on Growers you know

2177
01:30:32,279 --> 01:30:35,579
they love to point those out and make

2178
01:30:34,020 --> 01:30:37,739
everybody think that that's what most

2179
01:30:35,579 --> 01:30:40,679
Growers are doing they do absolutely

2180
01:30:37,738 --> 01:30:43,559
they do and some people sadly I mean

2181
01:30:40,679 --> 01:30:45,300
when wherever there's profit involved uh

2182
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:48,000
people get into it for different reasons

2183
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:50,520
yeah you know and and some of the people

2184
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:52,439
involved certainly were that way I

2185
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:55,500
wouldn't classify it as the majority but

2186
01:30:52,439 --> 01:30:58,079
certainly a percentage you know yeah

2187
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:59,579
humans are humans I didn't feel real

2188
01:30:58,079 --> 01:31:01,859
comfortable in Guadalajara to tell you

2189
01:30:59,579 --> 01:31:04,738
the truth because everyone was packing

2190
01:31:01,859 --> 01:31:05,939
in those the guys carrying the beer were

2191
01:31:04,738 --> 01:31:08,279
packing them

2192
01:31:05,939 --> 01:31:11,219
I don't know just they that's their job

2193
01:31:08,279 --> 01:31:12,420
they took us out to Sushi in malahari

2194
01:31:11,219 --> 01:31:15,539
and it was some of the best sushi I've

2195
01:31:12,420 --> 01:31:17,819
ever had in my life and they

2196
01:31:15,539 --> 01:31:20,939
um they were it was a lieutenant of

2197
01:31:17,819 --> 01:31:23,698
Miguel's he went by the name of Guapo

2198
01:31:20,939 --> 01:31:26,339
which means handsome and they took us

2199
01:31:23,698 --> 01:31:28,738
out and it was amazing because the guy

2200
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:31,020
who ran it he'd speak in Japanese to his

2201
01:31:28,738 --> 01:31:32,638
crew then he'd turn to us and speak in

2202
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:35,400
English perfectly and then he turns

2203
01:31:32,639 --> 01:31:37,859
talked to these guys in Spanish it was

2204
01:31:35,399 --> 01:31:40,859
quite quite amazing

2205
01:31:37,859 --> 01:31:43,679
yeah it doesn't doesn't fit in with the

2206
01:31:40,859 --> 01:31:46,339
stereotype of the dump of the the dumb

2207
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:50,760
Stoner right yeah

2208
01:31:46,340 --> 01:31:52,800
oh I mean I think Americans are uh we're

2209
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:55,020
very we're very isolated because we've

2210
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:56,940
got uh Canadians who also speak English

2211
01:31:55,020 --> 01:32:00,000
for the most part besides the people in

2212
01:31:56,939 --> 01:32:01,738
Quebec uh above us

2213
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:03,539
um and we've got two oceans next to us

2214
01:32:01,738 --> 01:32:06,479
but I think a lot of parts of the world

2215
01:32:03,539 --> 01:32:08,819
are multilingual just because they

2216
01:32:06,479 --> 01:32:10,738
encounter so many different languages as

2217
01:32:08,819 --> 01:32:13,500
part of their daily life and in America

2218
01:32:10,738 --> 01:32:16,500
we are we're kind of broken from that in

2219
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:19,380
a bit you know my Swisher makes five

2220
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:22,139
languages perfectly yeah I have an aunt

2221
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:23,699
who's Swiss and she speaks four

2222
01:32:22,139 --> 01:32:26,699
you know

2223
01:32:23,698 --> 01:32:28,619
and and and so much so yes very much so

2224
01:32:26,698 --> 01:32:30,419
and I I actually kind of regret that

2225
01:32:28,619 --> 01:32:32,819
because I think the long the younger you

2226
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:35,219
learn language the more fluent and fluid

2227
01:32:32,819 --> 01:32:36,359
you are in in speaking and and reading

2228
01:32:35,219 --> 01:32:38,100
it

2229
01:32:36,359 --> 01:32:40,198
um and I think Americans a lot of times

2230
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:42,600
like uh it does something to your brain

2231
01:32:40,198 --> 01:32:45,178
to be able to speak multiple languages

2232
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:47,659
and communicate you know I I think it's

2233
01:32:45,179 --> 01:32:47,658
super cool

2234
01:32:47,698 --> 01:32:53,638
um yeah so we have the the story of the

2235
01:32:51,899 --> 01:32:57,059
Peyote Prince

2236
01:32:53,639 --> 01:32:59,400
can you briefly or maybe not even

2237
01:32:57,060 --> 01:33:00,830
briefly can you tell us what a Peyote

2238
01:32:59,399 --> 01:33:02,519
Prince is

2239
01:33:00,829 --> 01:33:03,479
[Applause]

2240
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:06,360
um

2241
01:33:03,479 --> 01:33:08,698
one of they're they're both I don't know

2242
01:33:06,359 --> 01:33:10,979
how they came into this but they both

2243
01:33:08,698 --> 01:33:14,399
knew Sam

2244
01:33:10,979 --> 01:33:15,779
and Sam was a road Chief in the Native

2245
01:33:14,399 --> 01:33:18,960
American Church on the Navajo

2246
01:33:15,779 --> 01:33:21,179
reservation and he had a license that

2247
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:23,460
allowed him to go to Northern Mexico

2248
01:33:21,179 --> 01:33:25,380
across the border from Texas and he'd

2249
01:33:23,460 --> 01:33:27,480
come back with a quarter million or a

2250
01:33:25,380 --> 01:33:31,139
half a million of peyote buttons yeah

2251
01:33:27,479 --> 01:33:33,299
for the church where actually

2252
01:33:31,139 --> 01:33:35,699
ninety percent of it wasn't going to the

2253
01:33:33,300 --> 01:33:39,659
church it was going to these two guys

2254
01:33:35,698 --> 01:33:42,059
and they would one lived in Tempe

2255
01:33:39,658 --> 01:33:45,000
two blocks from the police station and

2256
01:33:42,060 --> 01:33:47,940
the other one in

2257
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Cottonwood Arizona and

2258
01:33:47,939 --> 01:33:53,399
um that's where I lived at the time

2259
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:56,100
and these were fresh buttons so they had

2260
01:33:53,399 --> 01:33:59,819
to dry them so the guy in Tempe had date

2261
01:33:56,100 --> 01:34:01,920
date racks that they dry dates in and it

2262
01:33:59,819 --> 01:34:04,738
was perfect for peyote and if you went

2263
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:06,179
into his little old house in Tempe you

2264
01:34:04,738 --> 01:34:08,698
had to turn sideways to go down the

2265
01:34:06,179 --> 01:34:10,260
hallways or go into any room in this

2266
01:34:08,698 --> 01:34:12,599
case that was in the stacks of money it

2267
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:16,199
was just stacks of date trades drawing

2268
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:17,460
200 000 buttons and once they drive as

2269
01:34:16,198 --> 01:34:20,939
you've if you've seen them they look

2270
01:34:17,460 --> 01:34:22,980
like little flat discs and

2271
01:34:20,939 --> 01:34:24,719
almost like jerky you know like a little

2272
01:34:22,979 --> 01:34:27,359
piece of jerky

2273
01:34:24,719 --> 01:34:32,399
but don't be fooled but until you take

2274
01:34:27,359 --> 01:34:34,500
it and they would just sell

2275
01:34:32,399 --> 01:34:36,779
this was 19

2276
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:39,779
73.

2277
01:34:36,779 --> 01:34:43,019
when I was first in Arizona and

2278
01:34:39,779 --> 01:34:45,079
um you could get them as low as a nickel

2279
01:34:43,020 --> 01:34:47,400
a button if you bought a certain amount

2280
01:34:45,079 --> 01:34:52,260
yeah and then you could sell them for a

2281
01:34:47,399 --> 01:34:55,679
quarter so in Illinois in Chicago

2282
01:34:52,260 --> 01:34:57,480
all over the United States these two

2283
01:34:55,679 --> 01:34:59,460
guys had friends who who would come to

2284
01:34:57,479 --> 01:35:01,678
Arizona and get them I don't think they

2285
01:34:59,460 --> 01:35:04,380
shipped in UPS or in the mail people

2286
01:35:01,679 --> 01:35:07,380
always took them one of my friends

2287
01:35:04,380 --> 01:35:10,739
gave a guy 200 and he was going through

2288
01:35:07,380 --> 01:35:14,880
custom or through the gate to go to his

2289
01:35:10,738 --> 01:35:18,119
air his flight this was about 19

2290
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:20,940
80 I'm thinking in Phoenix or maybe it

2291
01:35:18,119 --> 01:35:23,639
was 78 somewhere in there and he looked

2292
01:35:20,939 --> 01:35:25,259
back to see his friend leaving and one

2293
01:35:23,639 --> 01:35:27,119
of the security guys was holding the bag

2294
01:35:25,260 --> 01:35:30,600
of peyote up in the air and looking at

2295
01:35:27,119 --> 01:35:32,279
it and and that and he asked him what

2296
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:35,340
are these and he said they're peyotes

2297
01:35:32,279 --> 01:35:37,738
they're um Cactus seeds and the guy oh

2298
01:35:35,340 --> 01:35:39,480
okay and he escapes back to him they

2299
01:35:37,738 --> 01:35:41,819
they didn't even have it wasn't even in

2300
01:35:39,479 --> 01:35:43,799
the Raider in their training yet yeah at

2301
01:35:41,819 --> 01:35:46,439
that point sure

2302
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:48,539
um the princes were amazing

2303
01:35:46,439 --> 01:35:51,658
um I know both of them still they're

2304
01:35:48,539 --> 01:35:54,658
still both alive and one of them isn't

2305
01:35:51,658 --> 01:35:55,979
as healthy as the other but they were

2306
01:35:54,658 --> 01:35:57,719
you know

2307
01:35:55,979 --> 01:36:00,178
it was just a

2308
01:35:57,719 --> 01:36:02,639
an amazing thing that millions and

2309
01:36:00,179 --> 01:36:06,119
millions of buttons they sold and some

2310
01:36:02,639 --> 01:36:08,400
of them were diverted to Redway

2311
01:36:06,119 --> 01:36:11,819
who the guy there two of my friends

2312
01:36:08,399 --> 01:36:15,238
would drive 50 to 70 000 buttons to up

2313
01:36:11,819 --> 01:36:20,658
to Northern California and they would

2314
01:36:15,238 --> 01:36:24,599
get turned into mescaline sulfate pure

2315
01:36:20,658 --> 01:36:27,299
and masculine is only like 40 percent I

2316
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:29,960
think is some number like that of the

2317
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:29,960
alkaloids

2318
01:36:31,279 --> 01:36:35,819
then they even call it mescaline you

2319
01:36:33,719 --> 01:36:38,760
know or whatever but there's many other

2320
01:36:35,819 --> 01:36:41,420
alkaloids that are significant in a

2321
01:36:38,760 --> 01:36:44,880
Peyote Journey but when you extract just

2322
01:36:41,420 --> 01:36:47,699
the uh mescaline sulfate then it's a

2323
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:51,359
different journey and I would I did them

2324
01:36:47,698 --> 01:36:54,238
both and I I compared it to

2325
01:36:51,359 --> 01:36:57,198
the mescaline sulfate was like peyote

2326
01:36:54,238 --> 01:36:57,198
without the teacher

2327
01:36:57,260 --> 01:37:03,539
we take peyote or experience it there's

2328
01:37:01,079 --> 01:37:06,539
this inner voice

2329
01:37:03,539 --> 01:37:08,279
um it's it's hard to describe but you it

2330
01:37:06,539 --> 01:37:09,658
seems like it's someone else but it's

2331
01:37:08,279 --> 01:37:12,000
you actually

2332
01:37:09,658 --> 01:37:13,500
just your inner Consciousness you're

2333
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:16,319
hearing your thoughts in a way that it

2334
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:18,179
sounds like it's an external voice wow

2335
01:37:16,319 --> 01:37:20,819
yeah I've never done peyote it's it's

2336
01:37:18,179 --> 01:37:23,279
let me I'm terrified of throwing up so

2337
01:37:20,819 --> 01:37:25,139
well let me let me let me interject

2338
01:37:23,279 --> 01:37:27,238
something here my um

2339
01:37:25,139 --> 01:37:29,819
my experience with peyote is probably a

2340
01:37:27,238 --> 01:37:32,638
lot less than yours but I will say that

2341
01:37:29,819 --> 01:37:34,679
the buttons were some of the more bitter

2342
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:37,500
things that I ever intentionally

2343
01:37:34,679 --> 01:37:39,779
swallowed in my life

2344
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:42,000
um so I can see how the masculine pills

2345
01:37:39,779 --> 01:37:44,579
might might go down a little smoother

2346
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:46,619
for some people because you really have

2347
01:37:44,579 --> 01:37:50,819
to be like okay this is going to be good

2348
01:37:46,619 --> 01:37:53,158
for me oh because they don't taste good

2349
01:37:50,819 --> 01:37:55,319
at all not as bitter as wormwood but

2350
01:37:53,158 --> 01:37:57,899
it's right up there it's a pretty

2351
01:37:55,319 --> 01:38:00,779
intense bitter I I mean I remember that

2352
01:37:57,899 --> 01:38:03,359
was that's my strongest memory of trying

2353
01:38:00,779 --> 01:38:04,800
to consume them was like man

2354
01:38:03,359 --> 01:38:05,880
yeah and

2355
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:08,279
um yeah

2356
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:10,560
there was people doing peyote enemas to

2357
01:38:08,279 --> 01:38:14,399
avoid it going into their gut that was

2358
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:17,039
big in the area mostly apparently a

2359
01:38:14,399 --> 01:38:19,079
couple ladies trying to get me to do

2360
01:38:17,039 --> 01:38:21,300
that yeah they would make tea and then

2361
01:38:19,079 --> 01:38:22,859
just tune them and then you would have

2362
01:38:21,300 --> 01:38:24,840
this wonderful trip and you never throw

2363
01:38:22,859 --> 01:38:27,539
up you don't get any discomfort because

2364
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:30,840
you hit your gut your stuff yeah I mean

2365
01:38:27,539 --> 01:38:34,139
like I've I've done uh Ayahuasca and

2366
01:38:30,840 --> 01:38:36,420
Brazil all the time good Lord I do not

2367
01:38:34,139 --> 01:38:37,639
but I

2368
01:38:36,420 --> 01:38:40,800
um

2369
01:38:37,639 --> 01:38:42,420
that when you when you are like you know

2370
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:44,699
meeting your creator or whatever and

2371
01:38:42,420 --> 01:38:46,560
you're and you're super fired up

2372
01:38:44,698 --> 01:38:48,658
um having your stomach hurt and having

2373
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:51,120
to purge any which way you have to purge

2374
01:38:48,658 --> 01:38:53,460
is pretty intense yeah and I remember

2375
01:38:51,119 --> 01:38:55,800
when I did it in Brazil I had to run out

2376
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:57,779
and I had to do it I had to get rid of

2377
01:38:55,800 --> 01:39:01,079
some things out outside of myself in the

2378
01:38:57,779 --> 01:39:04,559
jungle and I really wanted a bright

2379
01:39:01,079 --> 01:39:06,859
American clean bathroom because I felt

2380
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:10,679
so exposed just like running in the dark

2381
01:39:06,859 --> 01:39:14,158
and and all of that experience of other

2382
01:39:10,679 --> 01:39:16,380
people yeah South America very intense

2383
01:39:14,158 --> 01:39:18,238
and you know peyote it doesn't it

2384
01:39:16,380 --> 01:39:20,880
doesn't feel good digesting some of

2385
01:39:18,238 --> 01:39:23,459
those alkaloids you were discussing your

2386
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:24,600
body is not ready to digest them

2387
01:39:23,460 --> 01:39:27,139
comfortably

2388
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:29,400
yeah so sometimes

2389
01:39:27,139 --> 01:39:31,020
chocolate masculine and the stuff that

2390
01:39:29,399 --> 01:39:33,179
was being sold on The Hill in Boulder

2391
01:39:31,020 --> 01:39:33,840
was not mescaline

2392
01:39:33,179 --> 01:39:36,779
um

2393
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:38,940
even at the low price of five or six or

2394
01:39:36,779 --> 01:39:40,500
eight sets a button when this was being

2395
01:39:38,939 --> 01:39:43,738
made by that

2396
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:46,020
that um wizard chemist in Northern

2397
01:39:43,738 --> 01:39:48,178
California it it

2398
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:49,920
enough to get you high would cost you

2399
01:39:48,179 --> 01:39:52,440
ten dollars

2400
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:54,420
so these one and two dollar hits of

2401
01:39:52,439 --> 01:39:58,198
chocolate Mexican were just

2402
01:39:54,420 --> 01:40:01,520
um LSD yeah oh wow mixed in Because

2403
01:39:58,198 --> 01:40:01,519
unless you paid her 10

2404
01:40:01,698 --> 01:40:09,119
15. it's photos on my

2405
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:11,179
I'm one of my um Chronicles they look

2406
01:40:09,119 --> 01:40:13,920
like Pickup Sticks about an inch long

2407
01:40:11,179 --> 01:40:15,719
sharp needles if you poured them out of

2408
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:18,658
a bottle they would just

2409
01:40:15,719 --> 01:40:20,399
pile up in these sharp needle looks and

2410
01:40:18,658 --> 01:40:21,839
they'd have to be crushed into a powder

2411
01:40:20,399 --> 01:40:24,960
to put them in a cap

2412
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:27,600
we um just ate some of the crystals once

2413
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:29,100
and but the guy who said you know if

2414
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:32,940
you're measuring this out a good trip

2415
01:40:29,100 --> 01:40:34,980
it'd be 10 to 15 so very few people have

2416
01:40:32,939 --> 01:40:37,500
actually even seen or done mescaline

2417
01:40:34,979 --> 01:40:39,178
sulfate is the point I I agree with you

2418
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:41,219
I would even say in my era when I was

2419
01:40:39,179 --> 01:40:44,219
experimenting with that stuff it's

2420
01:40:41,219 --> 01:40:46,198
almost all relabeled LSD

2421
01:40:44,219 --> 01:40:48,239
um you know it just was

2422
01:40:46,198 --> 01:40:50,279
yeah uh it most people haven't

2423
01:40:48,238 --> 01:40:51,779
experienced it because the pa the

2424
01:40:50,279 --> 01:40:53,519
buttons are hard to come by and they

2425
01:40:51,779 --> 01:40:55,859
taste gross

2426
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:57,179
um and and people are just marketing to

2427
01:40:55,859 --> 01:41:00,599
a different thing so they're like oh

2428
01:40:57,179 --> 01:41:02,699
yeah here's some masculine but it um

2429
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:05,460
yeah there's some really good advice you

2430
01:41:02,698 --> 01:41:09,539
gave in one of your stories uh bad Jack

2431
01:41:05,460 --> 01:41:12,179
about juicing buttons can you talk about

2432
01:41:09,539 --> 01:41:16,019
that a little bit well the last time I

2433
01:41:12,179 --> 01:41:21,179
did coyote I Juiced 15 buttons fresh

2434
01:41:16,020 --> 01:41:24,300
buttons and it's empty a lot yes

2435
01:41:21,179 --> 01:41:26,520
Tennessee if you eat 10 fresh buttons If

2436
01:41:24,300 --> 01:41:29,520
you could get those down you will have a

2437
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:32,100
really strong Journey oh wow we took 50

2438
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:34,139
and Juiced them and I had a quart bottle

2439
01:41:32,100 --> 01:41:37,800
of beautiful

2440
01:41:34,139 --> 01:41:40,800
emerald green liquid and my friend who

2441
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:42,600
is the tall fellow my first grow partner

2442
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:45,119
he drank a third of the bottle and I

2443
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:47,100
drank two-thirds of the bottle and he

2444
01:41:45,118 --> 01:41:48,839
spent the whole night face down on his

2445
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:52,260
sleeping bed

2446
01:41:48,840 --> 01:41:54,480
um he never moved for like 10 hours and

2447
01:41:52,260 --> 01:41:56,039
I would ask him a question and he

2448
01:41:54,479 --> 01:41:59,299
wouldn't answer and then about three or

2449
01:41:56,039 --> 01:42:01,859
four minutes later he'd go no

2450
01:41:59,300 --> 01:42:04,199
it was a time lag it was really funny

2451
01:42:01,859 --> 01:42:06,420
and I had a fire going and I was saying

2452
01:42:04,198 --> 01:42:08,638
let's go for a hike let's do this and he

2453
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:11,399
just he was immobilized

2454
01:42:08,639 --> 01:42:13,500
um but he had a good when he woke up in

2455
01:42:11,399 --> 01:42:16,399
the morning he said uh I had the

2456
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:16,399
strangest dreams

2457
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:21,119
so he did enjoy it though like the the

2458
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:23,460
do you ever see the movie Young Guns

2459
01:42:21,118 --> 01:42:26,099
with Emilio Estevez and all those young

2460
01:42:23,460 --> 01:42:28,260
kids stars that were there's a scene in

2461
01:42:26,100 --> 01:42:30,480
there where they eat peyote yeah and

2462
01:42:28,260 --> 01:42:34,320
they're the one guy shooting his gun

2463
01:42:30,479 --> 01:42:37,678
wildly out at this mining claim and in

2464
01:42:34,319 --> 01:42:40,799
the what other guys talking and you hear

2465
01:42:37,679 --> 01:42:44,399
his voice but he's not talking and

2466
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:46,320
whoever produced that movie has done

2467
01:42:44,399 --> 01:42:50,099
peyote because they knew about the voice

2468
01:42:46,319 --> 01:42:53,399
yeah it was so clear in that scene I I

2469
01:42:50,100 --> 01:42:56,460
was just amazed that someone had um or

2470
01:42:53,399 --> 01:42:58,738
they had a technical advisor that knew

2471
01:42:56,460 --> 01:43:00,960
that that's how they would do it because

2472
01:42:58,738 --> 01:43:03,118
he was stumbling around and you could

2473
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:06,420
hear this voice talking to him

2474
01:43:03,118 --> 01:43:08,158
yeah it was good I man has tried to get

2475
01:43:06,420 --> 01:43:09,600
me to talk about psychedelics on the

2476
01:43:08,158 --> 01:43:12,118
show and I've kind of kept it weed

2477
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:16,020
focused but I will say that sometimes

2478
01:43:12,118 --> 01:43:17,460
when when things get very intense

2479
01:43:16,020 --> 01:43:20,219
um you're kind of locked in your own

2480
01:43:17,460 --> 01:43:22,560
mind like if your friend was laying down

2481
01:43:20,219 --> 01:43:25,439
what they're experiencing and feeling

2482
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:27,119
and thinking and is so intense you just

2483
01:43:25,439 --> 01:43:29,519
lose track of the fact that you have

2484
01:43:27,118 --> 01:43:31,559
legs and arms and you can you can't

2485
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:33,659
really interact with the world because

2486
01:43:31,560 --> 01:43:35,820
you have so much sensory data that's

2487
01:43:33,658 --> 01:43:37,738
coming into your brain and you're

2488
01:43:35,819 --> 01:43:40,639
thinking about so many things that like

2489
01:43:37,738 --> 01:43:43,500
all that other stuff is extraneous

2490
01:43:40,639 --> 01:43:45,900
you know and that that's common I've

2491
01:43:43,500 --> 01:43:49,020
seen that on mushrooms on LSD on high

2492
01:43:45,899 --> 01:43:51,599
doses of different things where you just

2493
01:43:49,020 --> 01:43:53,520
end up kind of in your own head

2494
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:55,260
you know it's not a very physical thing

2495
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:58,920
it's a very inward thing

2496
01:43:55,260 --> 01:44:00,179
yeah you know and so

2497
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:03,260
um sometimes that's good and sometimes

2498
01:44:00,179 --> 01:44:05,639
that's bad but it usually is is is is is

2499
01:44:03,260 --> 01:44:07,560
positive long term

2500
01:44:05,639 --> 01:44:10,319
you know as long as you got a safe space

2501
01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:11,639
and you're with friends yep set and

2502
01:44:10,319 --> 01:44:14,880
setting is everything

2503
01:44:11,639 --> 01:44:18,118
yeah and I think I think for uh episode

2504
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:21,239
three we might adventure maybe if you're

2505
01:44:18,118 --> 01:44:24,299
open to it maybe make that more of the

2506
01:44:21,238 --> 01:44:27,178
um full expansive psychological uh

2507
01:44:24,300 --> 01:44:29,219
psychedelic aspect of your life the

2508
01:44:27,179 --> 01:44:31,440
spiritual journey that that it brought

2509
01:44:29,219 --> 01:44:33,480
magic to this point because we're

2510
01:44:31,439 --> 01:44:35,158

01:46:04,579 --> 01:46:09,479
yeah I can say from my perspective that

2546
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:12,420
first Matt will tell you it takes a lot

2547
01:46:09,479 --> 01:46:14,759
to shut me up and I try to talk as

2548
01:46:12,420 --> 01:46:17,279
little as possible but I burn with

2549
01:46:14,760 --> 01:46:20,100
questions almost every third sentence

2550
01:46:17,279 --> 01:46:22,198
that you or raho talk about and I try to

2551
01:46:20,100 --> 01:46:24,960
afterwards write down various questions

2552
01:46:22,198 --> 01:46:26,638
and ideas that I have and so it's really

2553
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:29,819
cool that we're having like this

2554
01:46:26,639 --> 01:46:31,859
multi-stage thing because an hour or two

2555
01:46:29,819 --> 01:46:34,380
after we do these things I get I'm like

2556
01:46:31,859 --> 01:46:36,599
oh my God why didn't I yeah I want to

2557
01:46:34,380 --> 01:46:38,100
follow up on that so bad I gotta

2558
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:40,079
remember we'll do it you know because

2559
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:41,579
there's this offhanded comment and you

2560
01:46:40,079 --> 01:46:43,198
know conversations Go in different

2561
01:46:41,579 --> 01:46:45,179
directions and you don't always get to

2562
01:46:43,198 --> 01:46:48,299
follow up on stuff

2563
01:46:45,179 --> 01:46:51,239
um and we like free-flowing but uh

2564
01:46:48,300 --> 01:46:54,000
there's a wealth there's a wealth of uh

2565
01:46:51,238 --> 01:46:56,759
of of information and just enjoyable

2566
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:59,158
convo here so I'm I'm super stoked well

2567
01:46:56,760 --> 01:47:01,760
remember this for next time pay phones

2568
01:46:59,158 --> 01:47:01,759
and quarters

2569
01:47:07,460 --> 01:47:12,480
that was my if we ever talk about the

2570
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:13,859
Psychedelic aspect that was my era pay

2571
01:47:12,479 --> 01:47:15,118
phones and quarters do you know what a

2572
01:47:13,859 --> 01:47:17,939
chinger is

2573
01:47:15,118 --> 01:47:20,939
yeah yeah it's a black box it's it's to

2574
01:47:17,939 --> 01:47:23,519
make it yeah so what we did when we were

2575
01:47:20,939 --> 01:47:25,618
on dead tour is we someone discovered

2576
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:27,659
that when you put quarters into a pay

2577
01:47:25,618 --> 01:47:30,599
phone the pay the pay the company

2578
01:47:27,658 --> 01:47:33,420
actually knows what

2579
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:36,900
coin you're putting in by the tone right

2580
01:47:33,420 --> 01:47:39,719
so a dime is One Tone a nickel is One

2581
01:47:36,899 --> 01:47:41,819
Tone a quarter is One Tone somebody got

2582
01:47:39,719 --> 01:47:43,739
the clever idea that you could get these

2583
01:47:41,819 --> 01:47:46,019
little recorders from Radio Shack that

2584
01:47:43,738 --> 01:47:48,299
recorded about 30 seconds and you could

2585
01:47:46,020 --> 01:47:52,020
record them and you could just push

2586
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:53,940
in quarters into the thing and record

2587
01:47:52,020 --> 01:47:57,239
right and then when you go to make a

2588
01:47:53,939 --> 01:47:59,339
long distance call yep you know you we

2589
01:47:57,238 --> 01:48:01,738
would so we would use pay phones and and

2590
01:47:59,340 --> 01:48:03,060
all these different things and like you

2591
01:48:01,738 --> 01:48:04,979
know tell each other where we're gonna

2592
01:48:03,060 --> 01:48:07,320
be at what time of day and what hour and

2593
01:48:04,979 --> 01:48:10,079
call us not so is a boomer he calls them

2594
01:48:07,319 --> 01:48:11,960
chingers us young men call them black

2595
01:48:10,079 --> 01:48:14,760
boxes

2596
01:48:11,960 --> 01:48:16,500
of the mouthpiece of the phone and hit

2597
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:18,360
play and it would make the sound of the

2598
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:20,039
coins falling into the machine right and

2599
01:48:18,359 --> 01:48:21,779
eventually eventually the phone company

2600
01:48:20,039 --> 01:48:24,300
caught on to it and you would get an

2601
01:48:21,779 --> 01:48:27,118
operator going sir hello hello sir yeah

2602
01:48:24,300 --> 01:48:30,360
and you would have to bail but

2603
01:48:27,118 --> 01:48:32,579
um you know yeah it uh that was that was

2604
01:48:30,359 --> 01:48:34,019
before cell phones uh when pay phones

2605
01:48:32,579 --> 01:48:36,179
were everywhere

2606
01:48:34,020 --> 01:48:38,840
nine dollars and ninety cents for three

2607
01:48:36,179 --> 01:48:43,679
minutes to Cali Colombia from New York

2608
01:48:38,840 --> 01:48:45,539
in 1982 and The Operators will be going

2609
01:48:43,679 --> 01:48:48,779
what and you know

2610
01:48:45,539 --> 01:48:51,840
I yeah it was I used a lot of quarters

2611
01:48:48,779 --> 01:48:54,779
but my friend in Manhattan one of the

2612
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:56,760
three brothers of the weed people

2613
01:48:54,779 --> 01:48:59,399
he would buy a thousand dollars worth at

2614
01:48:56,760 --> 01:49:01,199
a time at a bank and he had a cart and

2615
01:48:59,399 --> 01:49:03,179
he'd bring him out he'd load up his car

2616
01:49:01,198 --> 01:49:07,259
and whenever he'd go out he just put

2617
01:49:03,179 --> 01:49:08,760
like 10 rolls in his pockets because you

2618
01:49:07,260 --> 01:49:10,500
know never know how many phone calls

2619
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:11,940
you're gonna have to make and how long

2620
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:13,679
because he was always calling to

2621
01:49:11,939 --> 01:49:18,059
different states

2622
01:49:13,679 --> 01:49:20,460
um yeah pay phones wow yeah

2623
01:49:18,060 --> 01:49:23,699
uh you know a little spy versus spy on

2624
01:49:20,460 --> 01:49:25,618
that level they were safer you know they

2625
01:49:23,698 --> 01:49:27,599
were safer especially if you rotated and

2626
01:49:25,618 --> 01:49:29,880
didn't use the same ones all the time it

2627
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:31,380
always sucked following not so though

2628
01:49:29,880 --> 01:49:33,420
after a pay phone because they're just

2629
01:49:31,380 --> 01:49:34,639
so sticky I just cannot do what that

2630
01:49:33,420 --> 01:49:37,020
means

2631
01:49:34,639 --> 01:49:39,539
he's got two in this episode he didn't

2632
01:49:37,020 --> 01:49:41,219
get one last time so he's bummed it's

2633
01:49:39,539 --> 01:49:44,340
really practically three with the whole

2634
01:49:41,219 --> 01:49:46,279
booshing thing but yeah yeah I'm glad

2635
01:49:44,340 --> 01:49:49,920
someone remembered that one

2636
01:49:46,279 --> 01:49:52,738
especially messages at the bottom we're

2637
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:55,500
at almost two hours here yeah so Matt if

2638
01:49:52,738 --> 01:49:57,359
you want to plug anything and um and

2639
01:49:55,500 --> 01:49:59,698
we'll keep we'll keep this thing going I

2640
01:49:57,359 --> 01:50:02,399
mean there's a lot of paths we can go

2641
01:49:59,698 --> 01:50:04,259
down and uh we still only scratch the

2642
01:50:02,399 --> 01:50:08,039
surface on some of it yeah I mean we

2643
01:50:04,260 --> 01:50:10,619
made it to map one 1979 so I think yeah

2644
01:50:08,039 --> 01:50:12,719
next round we're gonna go to 1980 map

2645
01:50:10,618 --> 01:50:16,079

2656
01:50:38,158 --> 01:50:41,939
