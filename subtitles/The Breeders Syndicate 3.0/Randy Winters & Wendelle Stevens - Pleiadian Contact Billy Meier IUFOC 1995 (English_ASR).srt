10
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:07,438
been

11
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,319
knee-deep in everything we are talking

12
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:10,798
about

13
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:13,359
since the 1940s

14
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,720
okay i mean he is a live

15
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:17,200
living

treasure chest and encyclopedia

17
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,600
and

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,438
i have never met anyone in my life that

19
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:26,959
is more open to everyone

20
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:28,639
everyone

21
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:33,359
that has questions

22
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:35,040
and desires to know about the phenomena

23
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,000
i've been in his home he gets phone

24
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,880
calls

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,478
literally from around the world almost

26
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:43,118
non-stop

27
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:45,840
by people wanting information

28
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:48,319
and he doesn't turn anybody away

29
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,640
no one

30
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:53,679
and we have a treasure

31
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,879
a real treasure

32
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,920
um

33
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:57,920
here's wendell stevens

34
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,439
well it's a pleasure to be here and i'll

35
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,680
try to stand far enough back from this

36
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,840
this microphone so i don't get all of

37
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,840
those bloopers on the

38
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,000
getting too close to it

39
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,560
i'm probably best known

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,159
for my release of the

41
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,080
material in the investigation of the

42
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,759
billy meyer case

43
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,280
this happens to be the 20-year

44
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,159
anniversary

45
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,280
of the beginning of those contacts with

46
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:38,719
edward meyer in switzerland

47
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:42,719
uh it that was not the beginning of his

48
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:44,639
contacts however that was the point

49
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,560
where his contacts began with human

50
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,238
human beings who told him that they came

51
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,719
here from a star group we call the

52
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,878
pleiadian pleiades

53
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,400
and so we call them pleiadians that's

54
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:57,359
not what he called them it's not what

55
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,360
they call themselves

56
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,719
we were

57
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,440
i got into the case through

58
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:05,759
my

59
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:08,560
collection of ufo photographs and

60
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,840
luzinstag who was a niece of carl jung

61
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,640
in switzerland

62
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,439
a multilingual journalist

63
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:15,919
wrote

64
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:18,000
articles in four languages also

65
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:19,759
one of the earliest ufo researchers in

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,158
europe and published the first ufo

67
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:24,318
magazine in europe published it in basel

68
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:27,039
in german

69
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:29,280
this was began in her area not too far

70
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:32,959
from where she lived in basel

71
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,039
in hinwell south of zurich and she heard

72
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,640
about it as soon as word got out of the

73
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,318
small group there which took several

74
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:40,559
months to do so

75
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:42,479
she went to meet the man and

76
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,000
she found him to be very honest and

77
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:46,639
sincere

78
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,400
he was the poorest of poor he was living

79
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:50,000
in a uh

80
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,879
at that time he was living in a

81
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,360
renovated chicken house on a property

82
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:56,719
that belonged to absentee owners living

83
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,879
out of the state

84
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:01,840
and he was living there as a watchman

85
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:01,840
for a living

86
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,640
a time came shortly after the

87
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,480
information got out locally and and

88
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:11,039
people came from everywhere

89
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:12,639
to talk to him he became a liability

90
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,479
rather than an asset and the owner of

91
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,079
the property told him he'd have to go

92
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:19,918
and put another guard in there that

93
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,918
didn't have so many visitors

94
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,918
at that point the friends around meyer

95
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,759
pooled their small resources and made a

96
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,599
down payment on a property

97
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,400
where they could bring mr meyer and his

98
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,960
family

99
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:33,039
to live with them all together in a they

100
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:35,439
began modifying a barn on the property

101
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,919
and they made six or seven bedrooms and

102
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:40,319
they all lived on it together

103
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:41,359
and they worked on it for many months

104
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,879
and years

105
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,840
building it into a

106
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,600
livable facility so this is not a group

107
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,439
of people that had a lot of resource and

108
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,720
a lot of assets and a lot of material to

109
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,600
work with

110
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,600
mr meyer had a camera that had been

111
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,759
given to him by somebody else because it

112
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,199
was an old camera it was a good japanese

113
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,400
camera but it was an old one had been

114
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,120
dropped

115
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:04,959
the viewfinder or the

116
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,600
the focus adjustment had been jammed

117
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:09,680
just a little bit short of infinity

118
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,439
the mirror and the viewfinder had and it

119
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,038
was beside the lens viewfinder had

120
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:14,319
fallen over been knocked down he

121
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:15,519
couldn't look through the viewfinder at

122
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:17,839
all he just held the camera out like

123
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:19,519
this and shot his pictures

124
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:21,119
he uh

125
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,399
was not a very good photographer

126
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,160
although he had taken a number of

127
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:25,758
pictures before he just loaded the film

128
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,639
in the camera and shot the pictures he

129
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,038
shot all of his pictures on asa 100

130
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,960
slide film positive slide film

131
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:36,319
with a setting of f11 and one to 125th

132
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,758
of a second

133
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:38,959
then he didn't make any changes in the

134
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,360
cameras he

135
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:43,758
he just used it all the time he had also

136
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,840
been shooting pictures before

137
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,680
in an other contact series with other

138
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:48,879
extraterrestrials in india with another

139
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,720
camera

140
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:52,560
that and that was before he lost his arm

141
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,080
and could use the the camera effectively

142
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,319
the camera that he was using that i

143
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:58,800
found him using when i got there

144
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,639
was a type that he could roll the film

145
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,478
snapped the picture and everything all

146
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,800
with one hand and by this time he had

147
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:08,079
lost one arm in a bus accident

148
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,759
and uh so here was a man that was

149
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:11,758
seriously handicapped

150
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,280
had a broken camera

151
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,879
didn't have any money

152
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:16,799
had some good friends around him but

153
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:18,478
they were all very close friends all

154
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,160
talking to each other

155
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,680
that was taking these remarkable

156
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,439
pictures and

157
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,038
that impressed louise in stock who had a

158
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:26,879
sizable collection of photographs at the

159
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:29,038
time when i got there

160
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:30,879
and uh since we had been exchanging

161
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:33,680
photos for some time

162
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:35,519
and she now had mr mark

163
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,519
brad gladly gave her a dozen of the

164
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,318
pictures right out of his his box there

165
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:40,000
his

166
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,080
they were prints made

167
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,240
from the slides positive to positive

168
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:46,159
which was a process that was uh

169
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,680
current then in switzerland we got a

170
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,439
year or two later here in the states we

171
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,879
can do it now

172
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,038
and

173
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,360
she thought the pictures were

174
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:57,839
remarkably good

175
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,759
she was able to talk to a number of

176
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:01,519
other witnesses there with meyer some of

177
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,680
whom had seen the craft

178
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:04,719
she was able to view some of the lending

179
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,280
sites

180
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,960
so she was convinced that the contacts

181
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:10,959
were going on

182
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,560
but she didn't like the case because

183
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:14,159
they didn't have a jesus christ and she

184
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,759
was a born-again christian and she

185
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,120
thought that

186
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,919
if you're not with them you're against

187
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,720
them

188
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:22,399
and they must have been

189
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,880
representatives of the signs of the

190
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:26,399
times mentioned in our revelations but

191
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:29,199
she brought me the pictures anyway to

192
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:30,799
show them to me her and timothy good

193
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,079
we're coming to the united states the

194
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,400
following month

195
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:35,439
to do some investigation in the adamski

196
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,079
case

197
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:39,839
now lou zinstag was the lady that george

198
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:42,560
adamski stayed with when he was in

199
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:44,239
europe she's the translator that took

200
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,240
him to the hague to talk to the king and

201
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,840
queen of netherlands she's the one that

202
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,680
accompanied him to the vatican to talk

203
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:53,598
to the pope she accompanied him on other

204
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,120
official and state visits that he

205
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:57,199
carried out when he was in europe at

206
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,840
that time so she knew mr adamski quite

207
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,680
well she also was his translator for his

208
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:02,399
second trip to europe

209
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,680
so

210
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:06,719
now

211
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:09,280
with mr adamski's death she wanted to

212
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,960
confirm come to the states and confirm

213
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:12,799
some of the earlier information that she

214
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:14,318
understood but had not seen personally

215
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,960
and she went to vista california where

216
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,560
he lived where she contacted mr glenn

217
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:23,519
steckling at the time

218
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:25,439
who ended up with adamski's property

219
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:26,799
and material

220
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:28,719
so now

221
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,319
losing stock calls me and says she's

222
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,000
coming to the states with tim and that

223
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,479
she's going to bring me some remarkable

224
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,918
pictures that uh i'll surely want to see

225
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,278
if i would meet her at the bus station

226
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:39,519
when she gets in

227
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:40,479
i she'd be happy to let me take a look

228
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,000
at him

229
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,839
so i told her to call me when she got

230
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,278
there and she did and

231
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,200
a month later

232
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:48,720
i picked her up i happened to have in my

233
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,320
house at the time

234
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,600
lee and brit elders visiting from

235
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,959
phoenix

236
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,360
at the time that i picked louise in

237
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:57,759
stock up and i brought her home and i

238
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,639
introduced her and tim good to

239
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:02,799
lose it to lee and brit elders

240
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:05,679
they had a private investigation

241
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:09,838
organization in phoenix called intercept

242
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:11,278
and the organization's business was to

243
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,880
look at

244
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:15,759
computer systems

245
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:18,480
bank intelligence systems bank

246
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:19,919
master files and things like that

247
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,320
electronically

248
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:23,759
looking for penetration for somebody

249
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,000
else trying to get information out of

250
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:28,159
the banks out of the mines and out of a

251
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,360
number of places

252
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:30,958
they

253
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,959
they were doing fairly well with their

254
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:35,039
business because everybody was paranoid

255
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:37,439
about everybody else it seems like

256
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:40,159
and they were successful in finding

257
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,519
the bugs and so they were doing

258
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:44,639
well in their

259
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:47,839
in own private intelligence network

260
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:49,360
so uh i tried to interest them in in

261
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,279
going to switzerland with me to look the

262
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,360
man in the eye and they were not

263
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:55,360
interested in ufos and could care less

264
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,519
about the pictures they thought they

265
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,278
were remarkable and all but

266
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,519
that ended it they drove on home that

267
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:02,958
night and i i didn't see them again for

268
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,000
some time

269
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:08,159
i tried to get louise instead to leave

270
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,839
me copies of the pictures and she said

271
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:11,600
she had promised not to but finally she

272
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,480
let me photograph five of them in dim

273
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,399
light

274
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,159
in the kitchen of my house

275
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,200
so i could remember what they looked

276
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:18,639
like

277
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,480
and then she offered to translate

278
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,078
communications between

279
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,879
they're too close

280
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:25,278
okay

281
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:27,039
she uh oh okay shoveler to translate

282
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:28,559
communications between myself and mr

283
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:30,240
meyer which

284
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:31,039
by now that i've seen the pictures i've

285
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,720
got

286
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,559
they're the best i've seen anywhere at

287
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,480
any time and i've got to

288
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:39,439
get to the bottom of this myself in fact

289
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,680
i thought they were too good to be true

290
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,839
so i wrote letters to mr meyer asking

291
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:45,439
questions and she'd translate my letters

292
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,880
to german send them to billy and he'd

293
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,320
write the answer back in german and

294
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:49,360
she'd translate them to english and send

295
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,200
them to me

296
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,800
after three or four quick exchanges in

297
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,839
one month she said this is getting to be

298
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,679
too much for me i'm going to have to

299
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,079
bring somebody else into this

300
00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:01,039
so she brought in a lady

301
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:02,958
ils von jacobi another

302
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:05,199
german journalist

303
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:07,679
who was also multilingual was writing

304
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,879
articles in italian french german and

305
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:10,719
english

306
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:12,799
and mr miss

307
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,480
van jacobe also translated several

308
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:17,120
letters for me and

309
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,200
and that and by this time i've decided

310
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,560
that it's too slow taking too long i've

311
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,440
got to go look him in the eye and about

312
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:27,119
that time i got my income tax refund

313
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,480
on my tax on my home my uh

314
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,639
and it was enough to make the trip to

315
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,120
europe and i bought a ticket

316
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:34,799
and i wrote ilsan jacoby and asked her

317
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,399
how to get there and she said i i'll

318
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:38,879
have to go with you because he doesn't

319
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,958
speak any english

320
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,559
and so i said fine and i arranged to

321
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:44,000
take her i was going to pick her up in

322
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:46,479
wiesbaden

323
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,720
and go to switzerland which we did

324
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,159
and finally got to him that's how

325
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,160
i got interested

326
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:53,519
into the enter got introduced into the

327
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:56,000
case

328
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,720
um

329
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,879
just developed from there um

330
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,720
kind of uh i never intended to get it

331
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:05,039
deeply in it as i am

332
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,399
i probably best known for my release of

333
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:08,078
information out of the case and i should

334
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,600
tell you here that

335
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:11,679
the information that was being given to

336
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,639
mr meyer was never intended for public

337
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:14,399
release

338
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,000
it was intended for a small group of

339
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,480
people around him

340
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,078
and i thought that it would be wise to

341
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,920
let the rest of the world know what was

342
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:22,719
going on and i released it against their

343
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:24,958
will

344
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,440
and without their permission and i wrote

345
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:29,439
three articles for saga magazine

346
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,959
which brought the house down on they got

347
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,360
visitors from everywhere i didn't know

348
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,559
that many people read saga magazine

349
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,440
but

350
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:40,239
they they had so many visitors the naval

351
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,320
neighbors complained about it they uh

352
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,399
they got the villa that the district

353
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,240
police to issue a uh

354
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,679
an order prohibiting the assembly of

355
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,159
more than eight people on the property

356
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:52,879
at a time and of course 18 lived there

357
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:53,838
and just harassment like that

358
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:56,480
he

359
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,480
survived by this by the time i got there

360
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,920
the first time which is

361
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,440
several months after i'd written the

362
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:03,360
article

363
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,120
he had survived four assassination

364
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,919
attempts already

365
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,600
and

366
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,199
by the time i got the second there the

367
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,720
second time had gone to seven by the

368
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,680
time i was at the third time i'd gone to

369
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,920
12

370
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:16,479
i think he and now has successfully

371
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:17,599
survived 17 assassination attempts on

372
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,039
his life

373
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:23,200
and for the 14th one i happened to be

374
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:25,120
with him i was

375
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,440
was we'd been in the house trying to

376
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,159
correct some translations of the contact

377
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,000
notes that i had had arranged for

378
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:34,719
and he wasn't satisfied with the english

379
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,480
translations we had to redo it paragraph

380
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,480
by paragraph to

381
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,240
to get him to to agree that it was

382
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,440
reasonably correct

383
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,879
and at about 10 15 at night after hours

384
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,720
of this

385
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:48,078
he said let's go outside he wanted he

386
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,759
was a smoker he wanted to go outside and

387
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:51,278
smoke a cigarette he said why don't we

388
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:54,078
go out and get some fresh air and we

389
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:56,078
could do this resume this in the morning

390
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:58,958
and we did and we walked out the back

391
00:13:56,078 --> 00:14:00,719
door of his house the kitchen went out

392
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:02,799
to a lean too and a lean too went to the

393
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,240
end of the lean to and out into the

394
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:06,399
street in front

395
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,560
and he had an old car seat sitting to

396
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,360
the right of the door as you came out

397
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:13,198
and we came out there and and uh

398
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,360
sat down on a car seat we got out of

399
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:17,679
cigarettes and we sat down together he

400
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,440
was right beside me like this and

401
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:20,399
as we sat down

402
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,079
and i

403
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,519
moved to pull my pencils up a little bit

404
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:25,679
so they wouldn't be tight on my knees

405
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,679
always bothers me and as i did that he

406
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:28,479
was jerked across the front of me like

407
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:30,399
this

408
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,879
and came down across my lap and he

409
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,440
started to get up and again like that

410
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:37,838
and then we heard a shot

411
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,240
we first felt debris

412
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,240
falling on us like a rat in the rafters

413
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,600
there was rafters above us which that's

414
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,959
what i thought i believe it was raised

415
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,879
on a farm in the rats and the raptors

416
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,559
would kick dirt off on you and then we

417
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:49,439
heard the shot and he said that was a

418
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:50,958
shot

419
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,600
and he turned around and put his finger

420
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:55,359
in a in a bullet hole in a wall a cavity

421
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,040
left by a bullet he said it's still hot

422
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,399
the bullets behind the chair

423
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:00,159
and we pulled the chair out and sure

424
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,360
enough there was a 30 caliber dumb dumb

425
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:03,519
bullet there

426
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,560
so he said let's get a flashlight and go

427
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,560
see

428
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:08,399
about this and we went hands and knees

429
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:09,599
into the house got a big long flashlight

430
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,559
like this

431
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,480
came out with that and a rifle and went

432
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:16,399
out searching in his garden for somebody

433
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,159
that i didn't like the idea because the

434
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,679
guy the other guy surely got a rifle out

435
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:22,000
there too and he can see us we got

436
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:23,278
flashlights and he's in the dark

437
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,600
but billy

438
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:27,759
billy was determined to do it and and so

439
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,519
i was trooped along with him and we

440
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:31,838
found a spot where a man had stood in

441
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,759
his garden long enough to leave a packed

442
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,800
circle footprints on top of footprints

443
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,519
like this where he'd been out there

444
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:39,838
shuffling his feet like this waiting

445
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,679
until we came out and then he had plenty

446
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,360
of time he must have had a night scope

447
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:45,278
on his rifle he had

448
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,120
had plenty of time it was

449
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,799
about as far away as from here to the

450
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,240
lighted doors on the side other side of

451
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:52,319
the room there

452
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,399
and he had a night scope and if meyer

453
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,759
had not been drawn across my lap at that

454
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,078
time it would have gone through his

455
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,399
forehead the bullet

456
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:02,638
now if they're playing tricks to give me

457
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,159
a thrill it sure did because that could

458
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,759
have got me too

459
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:07,759
and i don't think meyer was playing

460
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,879
those kind of games and so now i know

461
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,159
for sure

462
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:11,838
that what he's telling me about the

463
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:13,838
assassination attempts and many of them

464
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,880
are witnessed by other people there i

465
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,079
know that

466
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:18,159
some of them are really happening

467
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:19,758
because i just witnessed one

468
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:22,639
so let me characterize the man a little

469
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:25,360
bit for you

470
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,639
he was a man of destiny from birth to

471
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,480
now

472
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,959
he came into this world at the beginning

473
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,879
of the great world war ii

474
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:34,479
and from his home in bulac switzerland

475
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:36,639
he watched the american bombers and the

476
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,360
german fighters battle it out over the

477
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,360
river across from him in germany

478
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,560
he was baptized to strict lutheran as a

479
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,959
boy

480
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:49,278
but was subsequently led through all the

481
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:51,518
great religions of the world in ex

482
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:52,879
where he experienced uh

483
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,720
uh

484
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:56,399
or four experience rather

485
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,360
he enlisted in the french foreign legion

486
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,679
in france when he was in his uh early

487
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,519
teens or late teens and he was sent to

488
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:05,038
the french outpost of algeria for

489
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,959
training

490
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:08,480
he completed that and

491
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,919
deciding that the legion wasn't the

492
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,759
place he wanted to spend the rest of his

493
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,520
life decided to leave it

494
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:14,558
and he managed to

495
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:16,240
escape

496
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:19,759
from the legion by walking across the

497
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,640
sahara desert a feet unequal before his

498
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:22,480
time

499
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,240
and he was joined there he joined the

500
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,160
desert caravan he had three men with him

501
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,038
two of them died on the way he joined

502
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:33,120
the desert caravan working his way

503
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:35,440
to the red sea where he was captured by

504
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:37,918
pirates red sea pirates

505
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:41,200
and enslaved aboard their dao

506
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,880
working for them he was favored by

507
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,640
putting him ashore

508
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,960
in iran on the persian gulf because he

509
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,480
he did what he's told to do

510
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,160
and they liked him

511
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,120
and from there he made his way away to

512
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:58,240
india where he studied a great teacher

513
00:17:55,119 --> 00:18:01,439
in the ashoka ashram at marawi india

514
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,679
near just north of new delhi

515
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,440
uh that teacher in the the great teacher

516
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,400
in the ashram was known as the cambodian

517
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,798
monk

518
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,840
and he still lives today and he's 106

519
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:15,839
years old and he says his words are mr

520
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:15,839
meyer was a spiritual man

521
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,880
from there

522
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,919
uh from the age of

523
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,000
five

524
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,600
let me get this thing out of here

525
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,200
the light is i don't think i can raise

526
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:29,839
the light so i'll just tip this a little

527
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,840
better here

528
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,519
from the age of five meyer was guided

529
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:37,519
and educated by et intelligences

530
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:38,798
preparing him for the role that he now

531
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:40,160
plays as the head of a spiritual

532
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:41,759
research and development center in

533
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,000
switzerland

534
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:44,798
he is surrounded by others chosen to

535
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,640
share

536
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:48,480
in his present role there

537
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,559
in as the center where the centers

538
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,440
created and designed to endure and

539
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:56,079
survive for at least the next 700 years

540
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,440
now this is a long-term ufo contact it's

541
00:18:56,079 --> 00:19:00,480
not going to end overnight it's not

542
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:03,120
going to enter in your or my lifetimes

543
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,200
this is certainly not

544
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:07,279
anything that

545
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,038
like the run-of-the-mill type

546
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:12,079
meyer's first contacts were with an old

547
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:14,160
man in a pear-shaped silvery gold ship

548
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:16,159
who educated him in many ways

549
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,080
using a big helmet that he put over his

550
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,250
head with wires or going into the helmet

551
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:21,519
and blinking lights on it

552
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:23,440
[Music]

553
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:25,200
and he would leave him there for 15 or

554
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,440
20 minutes at a time where it filled his

555
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,480
consciousness and his subconscious mind

556
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,798
with

557
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,558
myriads of ideas and vast knowledge that

558
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:34,639
he could not begin to describe but which

559
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:37,038
came back to him later in life as he

560
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,120
needed it now he was

561
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:40,640
he had to leave school in in the sixth

562
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:42,558
grade because he couldn't afford to go

563
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,080
anymore and he he was the

564
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:46,079
poor child in the neighborhood he didn't

565
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:48,159
have shoes to go to school he didn't

566
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:50,558
have new pants he didn't have new shoes

567
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,240
his new shirt and he became the butt of

568
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:53,359
jokes and pranks played by the more

569
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,319
affluent

570
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:58,558
uh members of the of the school

571
00:19:56,319 --> 00:20:01,200
and he he became disenchanted with it he

572
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:03,038
quit going to it they promoted him from

573
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,319
the fifth to the sixth grade to get him

574
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:05,759
out of the fifth

575
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:07,678
and then he didn't go back but two or

576
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,839
three days in the sixth grade and left

577
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,280
the school

578
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:13,839
uh the uh

579
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:16,720
this education was being conducted by

580
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:17,839
another extraterrestrial entity group

581
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,759
who told

582
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:22,240
him that they came from the doll

583
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:23,919
universe d.a.l universe

584
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,558
and he didn't know what it was

585
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,640
at the time and later in uh

586
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:30,079
with more questions on where they came

587
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,200
from and how they lived they told him

588
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:35,918
that their universe was a balancing

589
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,319
counterpart of our physical universe

590
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:42,000
that we perceive and experience

591
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:44,798
and that it exists because ours exists

592
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,839
oh thank you bob

593
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:49,440
and mr meyer

594
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:50,798
had after the training session with the

595
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,679
old man

596
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:56,158
which lasted almost a year

597
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:59,440
that stopped for several years he

598
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:01,520
he earned his living in a routine way

599
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,200
and then a new series of contacts began

600
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:05,839
with another female

601
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:09,038
who said she came from the doll universe

602
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:11,439
i told her he could call her ask it

603
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:13,440
and it was ask it that took him led him

604
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,360
through the various religions led him on

605
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,798
his trips

606
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:18,879
across the desert

607
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:20,400
some adventures that took him to

608
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,520
death's very door on a number of

609
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,280
occasions

610
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:25,519
where his survival

611
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:27,119
his survival tested his ingenuity and

612
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:30,079
his control of fear which he had to

613
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:32,158
learn for other reasons but above all he

614
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:34,639
learned faith in himself

615
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,240
vital training for the events to come

616
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,038
it was she who prepared him for his

617
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,798
future contacts with the pleiadians

618
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:42,400
edward meyer observed and photographed

619
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:46,079
the doll ships of several different

620
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,759
varieties for years more than nine years

621
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:51,119
and he went aboard the doll ships many

622
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:53,919
times even before meeting samyasi now we

623
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:55,599
knew all this when we were investigating

624
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,759
the case and we knew we couldn't tell it

625
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:59,439
all at one time it's too big so we

626
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:01,759
decided to

627
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,320
start where the contacts with samyasi

628
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:06,079
the pleiadian team began that team was

629
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:07,439
changing his language customs and habits

630
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:08,639
and could discuss things at great

631
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,400
lengths with him

632
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,559
and we terminated our reporting of the

633
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,559
case where that team left for other

634
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:16,639
assignments in another solar system so

635
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:19,119
we capsulized what we released but we

636
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:22,080
had a great deal more on the case that

637
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:22,079
we have never released

638
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:26,720
so he went aboard the dollar ships many

639
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:29,759
times before meeting samyasi he took

640
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,679
over 300 photographs of the doll ship

641
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:34,158
singly and in different groups of up to

642
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,440
eight craft together at a time

643
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,200
in the sky

644
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,759
while he was india in india and in the

645
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,200
mideast near mideast these photographs

646
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:43,038
and all of his possessions were taken

647
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,519
from him by jordanian secret police when

648
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:47,440
he was working his way back from india

649
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:49,359
where he had been persuaded to

650
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,679
infiltrate a drug smuggling operation

651
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:52,558
for u.s agents to make a living to make

652
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,559
money

653
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:56,000
and when it was intercepted

654
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:58,000
the they dumped him they let the

655
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,558
iranians have him along with the drug

656
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,558
smugglers and it took him some time

657
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:04,240
before they obtained a release for him

658
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:06,399
but when the iranians released him they

659
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,919
just turned him out and told him to go

660
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,600
and they didn't give me his possessions

661
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,919
money pictures or nothing don't know

662
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:14,719
whatever happened to those

663
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:16,960
his personal things were not returned

664
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,440
all he has now of those photos and

665
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,880
contact reports are copies of a few that

666
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,679
he had sent out to friends before his

667
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,280
loss

668
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,360
some of those pictures

669
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:28,000
photography thought before thousands of

670
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:29,519
eyes at the new delhi railroad station

671
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,880
were published on the front page of the

672
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:34,960
new delhi daily newspaper the next day

673

00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:44,639
at the time who knew mr meyer very well

677
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,759
because of his pet monkey that did many

678
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,679
tricks

679
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:50,558
said that the villagers were suspicious

680
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,640
of meyer because of his contact with a

681
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:54,960
celestial woman

682
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,360
a woman that they saw come from the sky

683
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,278
in a silvery ship get out talk to meyer

684
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:01,119
go back in the ship and leave

685
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:02,240
and this was observed by a number of the

686
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:04,319
villagers

687
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,519
who also watched meyer photograph the

688
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:10,079
doll ships from a distance sometimes

689
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:11,839
it was on the 28th of january 1975 when

690
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:13,278
meyer experienced his first contact with

691
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:16,158
the palladians and that's where i began

692
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:17,679
my reporting and so for you those of you

693
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,159
who are familiar with the case that you

694
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,960
know about it from there

695
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:25,039
seminyaci's small team of six pleiadians

696
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,038
was especially trained in the language

697
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:29,038
customs and habits of meyer and the

698
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:30,879
people around him in his area and so

699
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:34,879
they were able to carry on extensive

700
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:37,120
dialogue on science history many culture

701
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,960
men our relationship with our past and

702
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:41,599
our future they told him that we come

703
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,519
from a common ancestry that we are no

704
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:45,599
more than pleiadians slowed down in our

705
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:46,960
evolution by our own actions and that we

706
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:49,439
could be where they are today if we

707
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,038
hadn't done this

708
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,720
she actually posed her ship in the form

709
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:55,519
of flights demonstrations for meyer to

710
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,960
photograph for very special reasons

711
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:58,639
which mostly failed and you know the

712
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,200
rest of the story from there

713
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,600
so with that i'm going to

714
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,440
run you some photographs taken by meyer

715
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:06,959
but first of all

716
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,360
i want to

717
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,200
tell you how this developed after i

718
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:13,439
published the article in saga magazine

719
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,519
the first article in saga magazine

720
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,480
people started writing me

721
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:21,038
reminding me or telling me of other

722
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,440
alleged contacts by pleading humans with

723
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:26,158
earth humanity

724
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:29,400
and and and they kept coming

725
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,400
and uh

726
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:34,319
the uh

727
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,360
contacts were

728
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:37,038
uh

729
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:39,119
when i started the investigation in

730
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:42,240
switzerland the of the pleading contact

731
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:44,558
studies in 1976 which is the next year

732
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,319
after the context began they'd already

733
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:48,399
be been going on for over a year and a

734
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:50,319
half

735
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,320
and they'd been kept in relative secrecy

736
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:54,000
within the very small closed group up to

737
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:56,158
that time very few people knew about

738
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,440
them except for a few local ufo

739
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,799
researchers that had picked up the

740
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,798
rumors and gone to find out

741
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,839
up to that time i had never heard of ufo

742
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,519
contacts from the pleiades before

743
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:11,519
and the whole idea was fascinating and

744
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:12,400
very exotic and quite possibly not even

745
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:14,480
true

746
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,000
at least that's what i thought then

747
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,640
for a time i thought these palladian

748
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,720
contacts originated with edward meyer on

749
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,840
the 28th of january their first contact

750
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,600
with him and i didn't know anything

751
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:25,359
about any other ones

752
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:26,558
when i got on scene and began working

753
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:27,839
directly with meyer and the other

754
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:30,399
witnesses there there were a lot of

755
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:32,319
other witnesses i interviewed 18.

756
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:35,360
i discovered that these same euphemists

757
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:38,480
had been using another contact e before

758
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:40,639
edward meyer by the name of m rasheed

759
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,798
rasheed was a greek orthodox priest of

760
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,200
the little church in jerusalem who had

761
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:48,000
been their contactee for a time before

762
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,840
picking meyer up for the first time

763
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,440
then the contact notes being kept by the

764
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:53,918
swiss group showed that meyer had been

765
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,640
told that this group had at least two

766
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:59,200
other active contacts on earth with

767
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,200
earth humans going on at that time they

768
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,600
told him that theirs was not the only

769
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,840
inhabited planet in the pleiades

770
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:08,158
a comparatively young star group and

771
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:09,439
that other similar humans

772
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:12,080
from

773
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,519
some of those other planets were space

774
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:15,199
travelers and some of them were even

775
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:16,480
coming here to earth

776
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,798
they told them that their group had

777
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,038
contact operations going on in the

778
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:22,398
orient and in the western part of north

779
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:24,480
america

780
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:26,079
but would not reveal any more

781
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,120
saying that it had nothing to do with

782
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:30,879
their their relationship with mr meyer

783
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:32,398
when i released the amount of

784
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,159
that remote amount of relevant

785
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:35,278
information information that stirred up

786
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:37,840
a

787
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:39,839
a real storm over the next three years

788
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:42,720
my attention was called to several other

789
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:44,480
ufo contact cases where the euphonauts

790
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,600
said they came from the pleiades the

791
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,679
first

792
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:49,918
was the discovery that a well-known

793
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:52,798
argentine ufo researcher

794
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,720
mr fabio zerpa of buenos aires

795
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:55,918
was investigating a case involving

796
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,640
pleiadian

797
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,410
contacts with engineer enrique rincon

798
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,000
and enrique

799
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:03,440
[Music]

800
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,599
rincon

801
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,919
of bogota colombia

802
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:09,599
this was also a profound series of

803
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,799
ongoing contacts

804
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:14,959
that began in november 1973 now this

805
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:18,000
before mr meyer's contacts began in

806
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,079
november 1973 it was still going on

807
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,319
he thought his was the only such case

808
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:24,079
also although he had been told by the

809
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:25,759
plagues visiting him

810
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:27,038
that there were other

811
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:28,558
pleiadians

812
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:30,960
in that star group other humans in that

813
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:32,960
star group and some of them coming here

814
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,558
then in 1979

815
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,000
that's four years after mr meyer's

816
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:37,918
context began

817
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,599
a correspondent who had read my magazine

818
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,520
article in saga called my attention to

819
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:43,519
another contact d case

820
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:46,158
involving plating extraterrestrials who

821
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:49,038
were visiting juan senor guillermo

822
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,000
torres of hacienda las cruces

823
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:52,319
in

824
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,960
venezuela and this had been going on

825
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:56,798
since 1974 that's a year before mr myers

826
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,200
context began

827
00:28:56,798 --> 00:29:01,200
these pleiadian et's were also

828
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,798
entirely human as with the ones visiting

829
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,600
the colombian and those that were

830
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:08,480
visiting mr meyer but these contacts

831
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:10,879
were centered near el tokuyo

832
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,919
on the north coast of venezuela in this

833
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,760
hemisphere these et contacts and

834
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,120
visits and contacts were still going on

835
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:19,919
also now these are going on

836
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:22,158
simultaneously while i'm doing this

837
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,919
and hundreds of pages of notes and

838
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,480
technical dialogue had been recorded by

839
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:28,159
the venezuelan group including extensive

840
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,599
discussions of scientific subjects the

841
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,480
history of our planet the history of

842
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:34,240
humanity on it and a lot of other things

843
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,759
this was also kept highly confidential

844
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,880
within a small select group there in

845
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:40,398
venezuela a group of a group of

846
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,000
participants

847
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:44,079
who were not letting the story out of

848
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,440
their group either

849
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:49,439
then in 1983 lou ferriss of the ufo news

850
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,679
clip service sent me some notes on

851
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,480
another pleiadian contact case

852
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:57,200
that began in july of 1974. that's also

853
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,919
before mr meyer's contacts and was also

854
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,960
still going on it involved one charles a

855
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,960
silva

856
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,440
who was repeatedly met by an

857
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,278
extraterrestrial human woman who said he

858
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,038
could call her raw matisse

859
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:10,720
and that she and the other euphemists

860
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:12,879
associated with her came here from their

861
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,480
home in a star group we call the

862
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,080
pleiades

863
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,360
those contacts were taking place in

864
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:19,278
southern peru

865
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:20,798
and they also are still going on at this

866
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:22,480
time the time is investigating as they

867
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:24,639
were still going on

868
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,919
and up to that time silva described

869
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:30,720
those contacts in a 411 page book

870
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:33,200
privately published which he called

871
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,880
oh the date with the gods

872
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,798
which got little distribution very few

873
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,399
people ever saw it

874
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:40,480
another correspondent who had purchased

875
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:41,678
a copy of our preliminary report of

876
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,360
investigation

877
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:45,840
on the swiss case wrote me and gave me

878
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:47,678
the address of another contactee

879
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:49,439
whose extraterrestrial visitor told him

880
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:52,000
that he came from the pleiades and more

881
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,440
specifically from the alcion system

882
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,798
that's the brightest star we see in the

883
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,880
pleiades

884
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:59,759
his experiences began with that with the

885
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,679
ufo sightings that led up to the later

886
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:03,679
face-to-face context between him and

887
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,038
those extraterrestrials and long

888
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:07,120
discussions

889
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:08,960
of scientific and technical subjects and

890
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:11,359
the history of the human race

891
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,880
here on this planet

892
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:15,439
and these were

893
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,278
discussions carried out with mr delmar

894
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,200
duvers and that's a

895
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:20,720
that's a pen name

896
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,159
adopted by

897
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,880
that man

898
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:27,120
in favor of his contact door said he

899
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,039
could call him delmar duvers and he

900
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:31,439
didn't want his own name used so he used

901
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:33,200
that false name

902
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,960
those contacts continued both

903
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,600
face-to-face contacts and telepathic

904
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,038
contacts for some time

905
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:40,639
they continued for many years as a

906
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:42,558
matter of fact and were still going on

907
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,480
at the time i was doing this

908
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:45,759
and a whole philosophy of life and being

909
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,360
in earth's

910
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:48,879
earth man's relationship to the greater

911
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:52,240
plan was imparted

912
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,720
and in 1973 mr duvers published this

913
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,558
information in a 214 page book called

914
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,159
the golden read

915
00:31:56,558 --> 00:32:00,480
so there's a lot of information being

916
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,080
imparted here by these human

917
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,159
extraterrestrials who say they come from

918
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:06,079
a star group we call the pleiades

919
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,159
about that the time i received that book

920
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:09,359
i received a registered letter from

921
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,519
argentina

922
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:15,119
from another old friend

923
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:16,880
senor pedro romniac of buenos aires who

924
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:18,479
had been who had seen something

925
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,720
concerning my activities with the swiss

926
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,558
case and he was writing me to tell me

927
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,640
that he had been in contact with e.t

928
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:27,359
beings who told him that their home was

929
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,880
in the star system we call alcion and

930
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:31,038
the pleiades

931
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,640
i received scores of letters from

932
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:34,720
sincere people who claimed that they had

933
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,559
observed ufo craft that were very

934
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,159
similar or even identical

935
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:39,599
to some of the craft pictured in the

936
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,360
preliminary report which were the

937
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:43,439
pictures taken by mr myers and some of

938
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:46,240
them were quite accurately the same

939
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,159
pictures very similar craft

940
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,278
all of the ufo clubs were receiving

941
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,360
these two

942
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:53,119
which infuriated them

943
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:55,038
to the extent that none of them ever

944
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:56,639
told me what they were receiving i had

945
00:32:55,038 --> 00:32:58,640
to get my information from those who

946
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,919
were put down by the clubs for even

947
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,919
reporting anything to the clubs in the

948
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,159
first place about the pleiades

949
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,480
they all became

950
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:09,519
or nearly all of them

951
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,440
became incensed because

952
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,038
i didn't take them in on the contacts

953
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,440
that i was

954
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:18,480
studying in switzerland i was very close

955
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:20,720
friends with the lorenzens with hayden

956
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,720
hughes with

957
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,278
other researchers that come and gone

958
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:28,319
over the time i never tried to ally

959
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:29,919
myself with the nycap group because uh

960
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:32,079
they were a government agency the

961
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:33,759
private organizations were at the time

962
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:34,720
where mu were

963
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:37,839
apro

964
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,679
which uh out of which mufon grew and

965
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:42,079
hayden hughes over in oklahoma city and

966
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,080
a couple in california

967
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:46,158
but

968
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:48,879
they

969
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:51,440
were angry because each one was angry

970
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,440
because i considered myself good friends

971
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,798
with the the directors of them and they

972
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,240
considered me a good friend and i didn't

973
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:57,679
take the case to them so each one of

974
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,839
them separately

975
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,278
became disturbed because i hadn't

976
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:03,199
brought the case to him now i'll tell

977
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:04,960
you why i didn't do it

978
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,679
when i got there and found out how big

979
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,639
the case was how many witnesses were

980
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,918
involved

981
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,440
how many photographs were involved

982
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:14,158
there's over 800 photographs and how

983
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:16,639
many sites there was more than 20 sites

984
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,440
and that it involved police it involved

985
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:21,440
a swiss army it involved

986
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,358
communications people it involved the

987
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,679
security guard in the area

988
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:28,000
it involved swiss intelligence west

989
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,440
german intelligence russian intelligence

990
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,159
czech intelligence east german

991
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:34,720
intelligence and italian intelligence

992
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:37,358
we're all

993
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:39,279
involved in in pursuing mr meyer all

994
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:41,759
trying to collect as much information as

995
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,119
they could for themselves

996
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,599
so

997
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:47,838
realizing that it's going to take

998
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:49,039
a number of trips back and forth to

999
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:50,719
switzerland

1000
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:52,800
that it's going to take staying power it

1001
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:56,239
can't be somebody that works for a

1002
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,760
living draws a salary has only a weekend

1003
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:59,679
off and can only spend half a day on

1004
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,160
saturday afternoon investigating the

1005
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:04,719
case it's going to have to be somebody

1006
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:07,118
that can go there several times maybe a

1007
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:08,639
dozen times maybe 25 times

1008
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:10,160
gonna have to stay for two to three

1009
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:11,920
weeks at a time which means if you're

1010
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:14,000
working you're going to lose your job

1011
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,159
and that meant that automatically

1012
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,838
excluded almost all of the clubs they

1013
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:19,598
didn't have such investigators they

1014
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:22,078
didn't have money they didn't have

1015
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:24,400
resources there was no way any club in

1016
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:26,000
existence at the time could do it so i

1017
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,160
turned back to the folks that were in my

1018
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,000
home at the time that louise in stock

1019
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:31,118
brought me the pictures lee and brett

1020
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,039
elders

1021
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:35,039
and they had the intercept group and

1022
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:38,079
they were doing fairly well and they had

1023
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:41,440
staying power they could they were doing

1024
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:43,280
they were doing jobs all over the

1025
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,358
united states all over the western

1026
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:48,240
hemisphere and also europe

1027
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:50,319
and they had a job coming up in london

1028
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:52,000
uh for a big banking system in london

1029
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,680
looking for a penetration of the bank

1030
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,358
communications system

1031
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:56,879
and they were going to be in switzerland

1032
00:35:55,358 --> 00:35:59,759
at the time that i was going to be there

1033
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,440
on my third trip trip and i asked him to

1034
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,119
join me and see what i was looking at

1035
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,559
and that's when they got there and we

1036
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,559
went over the sights again and i showed

1037
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:08,239
them how it would be impossible for

1038
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:09,838
anybody to stage this even with

1039
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:11,679
elaborate equipment a lot of money a lot

1040
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:13,440
of resources a whole lot of confederates

1041
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:15,358
they still couldn't do it they became

1042
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,800
convinced that the case was worth

1043
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:19,119
studying and they began to put their own

1044
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,519
money in it i put mine in we went back

1045
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,599
and forth i went there 14 times they

1046
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:26,239
went 12 or 13 each

1047
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:28,320
and and it kept going on and on so

1048
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:30,479
that's why we didn't take the clubs in

1049
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:32,160
and that's why the clubs were basically

1050
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,320
why the clubs were upset

1051
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:36,319
about what we were doing and because we

1052
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,240
hadn't taken them in from the beginning

1053
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,920
we didn't go anyplace with it now as i

1054
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:41,439
said i was good friends with jim and

1055
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,000
carl lorenzon

1056
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,320
and i used to brief them it began at

1057
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,679
least in the first stages of this

1058
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,119
briefing them on everything that

1059
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:50,879
happened each time and i'd bring them

1060
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:52,559
the pictures and show them to them

1061
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,240
and i they realized they couldn't do

1062
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:55,679
anything but take what i had because

1063
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:57,039
they didn't have any way to follow up on

1064
00:36:55,679 --> 00:37:00,000
it

1065
00:36:57,039 --> 00:37:02,400
at some point jim carl lorenzen began to

1066
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,719
get the idea that since i was hanging

1067
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,639
around the apro office all the time

1068
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:08,559
that lewis instag was really coming to

1069
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:10,239
apro with the pictures and i intercepted

1070
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,279
her and stole the case

1071
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:14,000
and she

1072
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,680
she told me that one time and and i had

1073
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,880
keys to the office and i worked there

1074
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:19,039
for him and everything although is not a

1075
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,720
member of afro and she took the keys

1076
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:22,239
away changed the locks in the office and

1077
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:24,159
ordered the people there to not let me

1078
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:26,000
in the door anymore after that

1079
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:27,838
well that didn't stop my contacts

1080
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,760
because jim lorenzen

1081
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:30,480
was very interested and he used to call

1082
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,640
me

1083
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,639
early on friday morning and suggest we

1084
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:37,199
have breakfast together at the country

1085
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:38,879
kitchen and we did this

1086
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:40,719
almost every other week and he'd asked

1087
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,559
me about how the pleiadian case was

1088
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:44,719
developing he even wrote me that

1089
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:46,480
statement himself in his own handwriting

1090
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:48,639
that was in the cover of the first

1091
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,079
pictorial book that carl lorenzon denied

1092
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:50,799
that he ever offered

1093
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,280
and

1094
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:55,359
she ordered us to take it out of the

1095
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,280
the book because it wasn't true which it

1096
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:58,960
was and we didn't take it out and she

1097
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,640
got very upset over that but that's

1098
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,000
where we were

1099
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:03,759
and that's why

1100
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,400
most of the clubs are to take exception

1101
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:09,359
of what i was doing and they they didn't

1102
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:11,280
go along with what i was doing

1103
00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:13,838
now having all examined all of this from

1104
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,359
a knowledgeable point of view now

1105
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:18,400
with hindsight with a lot of other

1106
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:20,159
reports on plenty and contacts

1107
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,240
we can draw some conclusions that seem

1108
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:24,159
to be of interest people wonder how can

1109
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:25,598
you tell if the case is real or not i'm

1110
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:26,559
going to list 20

1111
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:30,079
points

1112
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:31,440
that points of knowledge that

1113
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:34,400
occur

1114
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,559
in frequently in the pleiadian context

1115
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,880
with earth humans so if you find a half

1116
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:41,199
a dozen or more of these points in a

1117
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,358
case where the extraterrestrial humans

1118
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:45,199
say they come from the pleiades

1119
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:46,639
they're probably right

1120
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:48,319
number one

1121
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:49,920
all of those mentioned here who claimed

1122
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,559
they came from what we call the pleiades

1123
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,639
looked as much human as we do

1124
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:55,920
and we're all about our size and stature

1125
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:57,679
and build

1126
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,838
number two all of them articulated the

1127
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:01,679
language of their contact e

1128
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:03,279
speaking fluently of our sciences

1129
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:04,319
history and culture they all spoke our

1130
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,839
language

1131
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,359
which meant they either knew it before

1132
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:09,519
or that they had acquired it and they

1133
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:12,639
knew how to read our textbooks on the

1134
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:15,599
shelf and they knew how to investigate

1135
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:16,960
our research and study live by observing

1136
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:18,240
it themselves through their viewing

1137
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,000
screens

1138
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:22,639
they all set this number three they all

1139
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,358
said that earth humanity was descended

1140
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:27,199
from their own ancient ancestors

1141
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:29,039
and from whom we had inherited an

1142
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:31,598
unusual aggressiveness

1143
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:33,759
they also argued that both our

1144
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:36,079
creationist theory and our evolutionist

1145
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,480
theory are equally untenable

1146
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:40,400
and that we really should be talking

1147
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,320
about or thinking about a migrationist

1148
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,240
theory because we all came here from

1149
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,359
somewhat someplace else we were brought

1150
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:47,838
here

1151
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:49,358
number four

1152
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:51,279
all of them said that their ancestors

1153
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:52,319
had been here many times before over the

1154
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,240
ages

1155
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,640
coming and going as conditions changed

1156
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:58,239
now we thought that our history began

1157
00:39:56,639 --> 00:40:00,480
four thousand or five thousand six

1158
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:01,838
thousand years ago with the back to our

1159
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,559
earliest

1160
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:07,599
written form or symbol form

1161
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:08,880
well that's just our modern re-emergence

1162
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:12,079
from

1163
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:13,358
and other state of society

1164
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:15,200
number five

1165
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:16,639
they all claim that they participated in

1166
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:19,118
some of the great events of our

1167
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:20,799
religious works and our mythology

1168
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:22,960
sometimes even being adored and

1169
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,119
worshiped as gods which they said they

1170
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,318
were not they said they were humans just

1171
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:28,800
like us

1172
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:31,440
number six they all claimed extensive

1173
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,519
life spans at least ten times what is

1174
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,838
normal for us now

1175
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:37,519
all of them

1176
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:39,039
they all just number seven they all

1177
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:42,559
without exception

1178
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:44,239
deplore our misuse of our sciences today

1179
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:46,159
saying that our mind has outrun our

1180
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:48,639
spiritual development and that we have

1181
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:51,279
already prepared the end of our planet

1182
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:53,679
and our own species as we know it

1183
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,839
and that we have done this before over

1184
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:57,440
and over and still have not learned this

1185
00:40:55,838 --> 00:40:59,679
very important lesson

1186
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:02,720
for this we are a valuable laboratory

1187
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:05,279
study and many ets come here from far

1188
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:07,199
and wide to observe us and how we might

1189
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,480
survive

1190
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:10,639
number eight

1191
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,318
they all travel faster than the speed of

1192
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:14,000
light as we know it in their

1193
00:41:12,318 --> 00:41:15,199
interstellar ships they're not plagued

1194
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,159
by

1195
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:18,879
the

1196
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:22,639
speed of light limitations

1197
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,640
as our science understands it

1198
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:26,880
number nine there was no conclusive

1199
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,119
evidence that any of the groups

1200
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,119
mentioned were in direct contact with

1201
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,079
any other of the pleiadian groups

1202
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,039
mentioned

1203
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,960
they're all coming here from the

1204
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:36,400
pleiades but they're coming at different

1205
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,079
times and on their own business doing

1206
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,760
their own thing and there was no

1207
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,280
evidence at least they didn't mention

1208
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:44,160
other pleiadian groups visiting here

1209
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,359
other than to say that there were others

1210
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:46,879
number 10

1211
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:49,039
they all mentioned other inhabited

1212
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,318
planets in the star group we call the

1213
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:51,920
pleiades

1214
00:41:50,318 --> 00:41:53,599
number 11 they all mention other

1215
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,599
extraterrestrial beings from elsewhere

1216
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:58,318
in the universe coming here to observe

1217
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:01,039
and study earth and its life forms

1218
00:41:58,318 --> 00:42:03,599
three mentioned actual contact and

1219
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:05,838
willing cooperation with other et's of

1220
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:08,079
other race types and systems

1221
00:42:05,838 --> 00:42:10,799
three of them use robotoid

1222
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:13,119
part mechanical and part organic created

1223
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,039
beings in limited operational functions

1224
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,880
in their societies

1225
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:19,039
number 12 they all used organic

1226
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,800
computers that could be controlled

1227
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:22,880
telepathically

1228
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:25,680
number 13. they all foresaw great

1229
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:28,400
changes in our planet in the near future

1230
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:30,399
number 14. none of them had any money as

1231
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,920
we know it they didn't have any religion

1232
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,760
as we know it and they had no

1233
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,119
competitive political system as we know

1234
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,560
it

1235
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,960
number fifteen

1236
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:40,960
three of them had active bases operating

1237
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,440
on the surface of our planet

1238
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:45,519
and those active bases frequently hosted

1239
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,800
other extraterrestrial species types up

1240
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:48,719
to eight

1241
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,240
in a group or up to eight other types

1242
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:52,318
for each of those who were hosting

1243
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:54,639
others coming here

1244
00:42:52,318 --> 00:42:57,039
number sixteen

1245
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:59,039
they all were capable of under ocean

1246
00:42:57,039 --> 00:43:00,318
operations and used our oceans to great

1247
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:01,838
advantage

1248
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:03,440
the water is no more hostile in deep

1249
00:43:01,838 --> 00:43:05,519
space

1250
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,760
seventeen they all used a variety of

1251
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:09,519
different spacecraft in their operations

1252
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,599
and they all had distinctive styles of

1253
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:14,559
ships and equipment yet there were many

1254
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:17,039
similarities in many respects

1255
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:19,358
number 18 three groups that we know of

1256
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:21,519
used very large carrier-type motherships

1257
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:22,960
in deep space near our solar system

1258
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:24,559
while they were here they didn't come

1259
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:27,440
into the solar system

1260
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:29,279
number 19. in each case

1261
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,960
to the group of individuals who formed

1262
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,880
around the contact e

1263
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,519
the new contacts and information was so

1264
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,280
mind-boggling and so profound

1265
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:39,358
and so far exceeded their knowledge of

1266
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,040
what was going on elsewhere in the world

1267
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:43,440
that they carefully guarded their secret

1268
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:44,880
within their own immediate circle for a

1269
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,800
number of years

1270
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:49,920
and then only confined it to a very few

1271
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:51,920
trusted friends in the 20 number 20 and

1272
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,838
the most important point of all

1273
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,358
up to

1274
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:56,838
1979 none of these groups had ever heard

1275
00:43:55,358 --> 00:43:58,799
of each other and there was no

1276
00:43:56,838 --> 00:44:01,199
cross-correspondence between the ones i

1277
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,079
just mentioned

1278
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:03,598
now

1279
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:05,839
with that characterization and those

1280
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:08,559
points in mind i would like to show you

1281
00:44:05,838 --> 00:44:09,440
some of the pictures taken by mr meyer

1282
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:11,358
and

1283
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,679
to give you an idea of what is being

1284
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:15,838
challenged as a as a lot of fraudulent

1285
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:18,078
photography

1286
00:44:15,838 --> 00:44:19,679
and you can judge for yourself and then

1287
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:21,119
we'll show you some other pictures taken

1288
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:23,039
by others

1289
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:25,200
and uh might let you make your own

1290
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:27,759
comparison you can you can be the

1291
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:30,480
the decision maker now you all probably

1292
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:32,160
have heard of many of you have heard of

1293
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,760
the program put on but i think it's

1294
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:35,598
laura lee or something like that in the

1295
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,200
northwest where they had a

1296
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:40,480
a

1297
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:43,598
popular pleiadius pleiades basher

1298
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:45,760
by the name of kalkorf on the program

1299
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:48,318
and he argued a lot of things against

1300
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,640
the swiss case so

1301
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:52,880
we don't encourage argument if people

1302
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:54,159
have a better explanation we are wide

1303
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,680
open to it

1304
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:57,118
uh you should listen to his his

1305
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:58,879
arguments and see if they make sense to

1306
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:01,200
you if they do they're going to be

1307
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:03,119
better than my arguments if they don't

1308
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:05,838
you can see through some of them

1309
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:07,599
mr kalkorf also appeared on the art bell

1310
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:09,838
program he got a lot of a lot of

1311
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:11,359
listeners they all tuned in and he was

1312
00:45:09,838 --> 00:45:14,000
doing the same thing there now let me

1313
00:45:11,358 --> 00:45:15,920
tell you who mr kelcorp is he was a

1314
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,679
16 year old boy in high school when he

1315
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,760
wrote me the first time about two years

1316
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:22,078
three years after i began investigating

1317
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,599
the police pleading case after he'd read

1318
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:25,200
the saga article

1319
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:27,838
and he wanted some pictures and i sent

1320
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:29,838
him 20 cold slides that i had made from

1321
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:31,199
the pictures i was working with

1322
00:45:29,838 --> 00:45:32,400
and then he wanted some more pictures

1323
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:34,000
and i sent him to moore and then he

1324
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,280
wanted more and i told him that we

1325
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,719
couldn't send him all the pictures it

1326
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,240
was getting expensive wasn't getting

1327
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:40,959
anything in return

1328
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:43,439
and the next in the next

1329
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,280
exchange of mail i got a package of 20

1330
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,280
slides from kalkorf

1331
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,880
he wanted to exchange them for more

1332
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,800
played in pictures well i put him in a

1333
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,920
box and sent him another cold slide they

1334
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,160
aren't the best ones they're the ones

1335
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:56,318
that were poor color

1336
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:58,399
faded

1337
00:45:56,318 --> 00:45:59,679
not a good copy

1338
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,680
and

1339
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:03,440
i just put his slides aside because i

1340
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:05,279
didn't have time to do anything with him

1341
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,200
and then a friend of kalkars who had

1342
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:09,280
seen the swiss pictures knew what kel

1343
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:11,519
was doing wrote me a letter and said do

1344
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,680
you know that kelkarf is manufacturing

1345
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:15,358
those slides that he's sending you he's

1346
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:17,358
faking him up to see if you can tell the

1347
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:19,199
difference so i put him in a projector

1348
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:21,519
and took a look at him and

1349
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:23,039
some of the slides were a plastic plate

1350
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:25,039
thrown up on the other side of a house

1351
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:26,880
by a confederate when it came above the

1352
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:29,279
roof line kelcorp would snap it with his

1353
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,880
camera and had to fall back out of sight

1354
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,040
those were some that he offered he had

1355
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:35,440
others that were

1356
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:36,639
faked in different ways and i i wrote

1357
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,400
him back and told him that i wasn't

1358
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:40,719
going to exchange any more pictures with

1359
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,079
him that i i wasn't interested in in

1360
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:43,519
processing the fakes i didn't have any

1361
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:45,440
room to keep them in my files i've got

1362
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:47,440
over 3000 photographs i certainly don't

1363
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,880
need fakes in there and there's nothing

1364
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,920
i can do with them

1365
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,760
and

1366
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,280
he became a little incensed he sent the

1367
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:56,480
pictures that i had sent him to saga

1368
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:59,040
magazine as a photo exclusive and they

1369
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,760
published kel gorf's photo exclusive on

1370
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:02,480
the

1371
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:05,200
on that case but

1372
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,880
mr korf became

1373
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:07,919
angry because we wouldn't take him into

1374
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,838
the case

1375
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,358
there was

1376
00:47:08,838 --> 00:47:13,838
another high school teacher in wisconsin

1377
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:16,159
at the time named bill moore

1378
00:47:13,838 --> 00:47:18,719
who wrote and wanted us to send him

1379
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:20,558
copies of all the pictures copies of our

1380
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:22,078
contact notes copies of everything that

1381
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:24,559
we had photographs that we had taken so

1382
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:26,240
he could analyze them and we wrote back

1383
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:28,079
and told bill moore that we didn't need

1384
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:30,318
anybody else in the case we were already

1385
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:31,680
having them analyzed by the best experts

1386
00:47:30,318 --> 00:47:33,599
we could find

1387
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:34,719
and qualified in various fields and

1388
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:36,640
disciplines

1389
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:39,919
and so he began attacking the case he

1390
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:42,639
became first critical that bill moore is

1391
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,240
known for poison pen writing he uh he

1392
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:46,639
was the ghost writer

1393
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:48,719
for charles burlitz when charles burlitz

1394
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:50,960
brought the philadelphia experiment

1395
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:52,959
material to bill moore to be written up

1396
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:55,199
in proper style and punctuated and

1397
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:57,039
prepared for a publisher

1398
00:47:55,199 --> 00:48:00,239
it didn't have bill moore's name i was

1399
00:47:57,039 --> 00:48:02,400
it was charles burlett's manuscript

1400
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:04,479
bill moore inserted his name on there as

1401
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,639
by charles burlitz and william moore in

1402
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,318
very small letters on the on the front

1403
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:10,318
cover of the dust jacket

1404
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:12,079
the next time they published it

1405
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:13,679
he demanded equal billing and the names

1406
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:15,519
were the same size the third time they

1407
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:18,078
published it the philadelphia experiment

1408
00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:19,519
was by bill moore and charles burles so

1409
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:21,760
that gave you an idea that kind of

1410
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:23,280
personality bill moore had at the time

1411
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,800
and uh you know he's faded from the

1412
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,240
scene by now having confessed that he

1413
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,760
was working for the cia in the first

1414
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:29,279
place getting paid by them at least for

1415
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:30,480
some things that he was doing

1416
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,319
so uh

1417
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:35,199
bill moore uh

1418
00:48:32,318 --> 00:48:36,318
was uh he he discovered cal karf through

1419
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:38,078
his uh

1420
00:48:36,318 --> 00:48:40,239
article in the saga magazine about the

1421
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:43,119
swiss case and a couple of challenging

1422
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:44,879
remarks that korff made so bill moore

1423
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:47,358
wrote up a uh

1424
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:50,240
a manuscript attacking the case

1425
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:52,159
from his poison pen hobby point of view

1426
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:54,000
and sent it to kalkorf who put his name

1427
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:55,838
on it and it was published in a yellow

1428
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,000
covered magazine paid for by a man and

1429
00:48:55,838 --> 00:49:00,558
wife who were also disenchanted about

1430
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,800
something it was called a great

1431
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:03,760
billy meyer hoax or something like that

1432
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,359
and they

1433
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,559
accused me of perpetrating the whole

1434
00:49:05,358 --> 00:49:07,759
thing

1435
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,400
um

1436
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:11,599
bill moore and

1437
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,760
several other

1438
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:15,920
people in agencies used calcorp as a

1439
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:18,319
mouthpiece because he was still a miner

1440
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:20,079
he was only 17 years old at time

1441
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:21,599
couldn't be pursued over slander or

1442
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:23,839
anything else so they had him making

1443
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:26,240
slenderous remarks about us and doing a

1444
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:28,000
lot of things and we failed to rise to

1445
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:30,479
the challenge we didn't even

1446
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,318
we didn't try to answer but it when

1447
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,240
mufon for instance you saw your move on

1448
00:49:32,318 --> 00:49:35,838
members here and you remember this when

1449
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:37,919
when his first article was published in

1450
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:39,679
the mufon journal it occupied three or

1451
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:42,400
four pages

1452
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:44,239
and so i wrote a and you know

1453
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,760
when a charge is made it can be a simple

1454
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:48,159
one-line charge and it takes a half a

1455
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,920
page of explanation to to explain it it

1456
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:53,279
usually has a foundation

1457
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:55,440
in some fact but that's been distorted

1458
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:58,240
so i wrote back about a nine page letter

1459
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,599
to move on rebuttals to the kalkorf

1460
00:49:58,239 --> 00:50:01,358
article and

1461
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:02,880
the answer i got from

1462
00:50:01,358 --> 00:50:04,960
uh

1463
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,559
walt anders was they only give a half a

1464
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,400
page for rebuttals well that's

1465
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:09,440
impossible i couldn't rebut even one of

1466
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,680
the

1467
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,200
the comments on a half a page they all

1468
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:14,480
had some merit but they had to be

1469
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:16,480
explained

1470
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,920
so we never tried we never attempted to

1471
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,358
rebut any of those arguments since you

1472
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,440
notice we never roast the challenge we

1473
00:50:19,358 --> 00:50:23,838
never argue with anybody and we don't

1474
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,119
feel impelled to lay the case on anybody

1475
00:50:23,838 --> 00:50:27,119
we don't care whether you believe it or

1476
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:28,400
not we're offering the information that

1477
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:30,240
we know

1478
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,960
that we have experienced and it's for

1479
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:34,959
you to evaluate it i it you know it's

1480
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,559
not important to us and we found that

1481
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,000
this was not important to the people in

1482
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:40,400
switzerland they don't care whether we

1483
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,239
believe it or not they let us have

1484
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,400
access to their information

1485
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:46,479
to do what we wanted to do with it to

1486
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,599
evaluate it the way we wanted to

1487
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,838
and and

1488
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:51,760
and they never tried to persuade us to

1489
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:53,199
any point of view and so we're not

1490
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,640
trying to persuade you to any point of

1491
00:50:53,199 --> 00:50:56,399
view we're offering information and

1492
00:50:54,639 --> 00:50:58,078
that's what i'm trying to do here so now

1493
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,559
i'm going to show you about

1494
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:01,839
a page of slides here real quick so i

1495
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:04,000
can bring on

1496
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:05,039
a man here who has been investigating

1497
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,639
another

1498
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:08,159
new case

1499
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:09,440
develops actually it's not so new but

1500
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:11,358
it's new to us because we only heard

1501
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:13,599
about it a year ago that's developing

1502
00:51:11,358 --> 00:51:16,078
here in this country in florida that is

1503
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:18,000
sort of a continuation of what i was

1504
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:19,440
just describing with respect to the

1505
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,800
swiss case now if you bring up the

1506
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,838
slides and cut down the lights please

1507
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,839
i'll try to describe them

1508
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:30,160
the first picture you're going to see

1509
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:32,079
here

1510
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:35,199
is the full moon

1511
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:37,359
rising over the sand dunes

1512
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:39,598
oh okay got it right here huh

1513
00:51:37,358 --> 00:51:39,598
okay

1514
00:51:40,719 --> 00:51:44,639
there's a uh oh i think they need that

1515
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:46,000
one for their camera okay the first

1516
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:48,239
picture you see here is a full moon

1517
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,719
rising over the sand dunes at yuma

1518
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:52,639
and i'm showing you this because i i

1519
00:51:50,719 --> 00:51:55,838
want you to remember that that that's

1520
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:58,400
exactly the size the full moon appears

1521
00:51:55,838 --> 00:52:00,799
in a slide film in a

1522
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,400
positive slide made by an ordinary 35

1523
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,559
millimeter camera with a standard lens

1524
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,240
spread of 49 millimeters i think it is

1525
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:08,559
but anything that you see in the

1526
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:11,279
pictures that i'm going to show you that

1527
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:12,880
are relatively larger than that will

1528
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:17,040
have appeared to the photographer as

1529
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:19,599
being larger than the full moon rising

1530
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:22,880
so here's the first one

1531
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:24,640
oh this mr meyer and his family

1532
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,280
that's uh that's the uniform he is

1533
00:52:24,639 --> 00:52:28,799
wearing as the the guard at the facility

1534
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,760
he was guarding that he's making his

1535
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,480
living at

1536
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,760
is with that he's also a watchman at

1537
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:36,000
that time for the railroad and that's

1538
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:37,920
his railroad uniform

1539
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,400
here is a uh

1540
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,440
one of the pictures taken in

1541
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,119
in

1542
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,159
india at the time he was in the ashram

1543
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:46,000
that's

1544
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:49,279
five balls of light in the sky that was

1545
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,400
published in the new delhi newspaper

1546
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,160
uh

1547
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,519
there were

1548
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:55,519
a number of other pictures taking the

1549
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:57,039
time and that thing goes off the ceiling

1550
00:52:55,519 --> 00:52:58,559
at the top is there a way to tip it down

1551
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:00,000
at all art or is this

1552
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:01,440
what we're going to have to go with the

1553
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,519
uh

1554
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,880
the object image is at the top of the

1555
00:53:03,519 --> 00:53:07,119
picture here the picture is taken in

1556
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:09,280
effect nature preserve now remember

1557
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:10,640
if this appears larger than the apparent

1558
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,160
size of the full moon you're going to

1559
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:14,799
see that the

1560
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:16,558
apparent size of the photographer

1561
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,359
it looks about four or five times as big

1562
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:18,960
right

1563
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:20,639
so to the photographer taking the

1564
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:23,519
picture that would have appeared to be

1565
00:53:20,639 --> 00:53:26,159
four or five times as large as the full

1566
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:27,679
moon rising okay thank you arc

1567
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:30,000
there's another picture in the nature

1568
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:31,440
reflect nature preserve here number two

1569
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,119
it's hovering over a tree actually

1570
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:35,119
that's about number five just before it

1571
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:38,318
departed that's all i put in here on

1572
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:40,240
that particular case here is a uh series

1573
00:53:38,318 --> 00:53:42,239
of four pictures taken over jacobsburg

1574
00:53:40,239 --> 00:53:44,399
ellenburg switzerland 27th of february

1575
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:45,519
that's just one month later at 10

1576
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,760
o'clock in the morning and there are

1577
00:53:45,519 --> 00:53:49,920
four ships in formation there two are

1578
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,440
remote drones being controlled by the

1579
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,358
two mother ships the lower ships of the

1580
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:55,119
motherships about

1581
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:57,440
seven meters that's about 21 feet in

1582
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:59,358
diameter the drones are about 4 meters

1583
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,358
or 12 feet in diameter

1584
00:53:59,358 --> 00:54:03,039
here is uh there's four ships wheeling

1585
00:54:01,358 --> 00:54:05,119
around and coming back overhead here you

1586
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:07,119
can see some of the bottom detail we

1587
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:08,480
were accused early on when i hadn't

1588
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:10,640
released this picture yet all the

1589
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,719
pictures seem to have dark bottoms so

1590
00:54:10,639 --> 00:54:14,078
uh one of the what the arguments offered

1591
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:16,000
was that they're all fakes that they're

1592
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:17,440
all models because the bottoms are black

1593
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,039
well you can see the bottoms are not

1594
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,880
black there you can see detail on all of

1595
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:22,239
them here's another picture taken of

1596
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,599
those four craft and there's two out of

1597
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:25,358
the scene at the top we'll go by them

1598
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:27,920
quick because we want to bring the other

1599
00:54:25,358 --> 00:54:29,358
gentleman on here now remember if that's

1600
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,960
bigger than the apparent size of the

1601
00:54:29,358 --> 00:54:32,719
rising moon in the picture we saw that

1602
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,318
was that much bigger to the photographer

1603
00:54:32,719 --> 00:54:36,959
when he took these pictures this is

1604
00:54:34,318 --> 00:54:38,798
jacobs burgalenbergian

1605
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,798
27th of february

1606
00:54:38,798 --> 00:54:42,400
here is an interesting picture

1607
00:54:40,798 --> 00:54:44,480
we don't have to tip that down because

1608
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,480
we can see enough of it but you see the

1609
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,760
rays being reflected from the dome of

1610
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,838
the craft there those are called

1611
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:52,480
crepuscular rays

1612
00:54:49,838 --> 00:54:53,440
crepuscular rays are like a rainbow

1613
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:55,199
they're

1614
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:57,200
they're formed at a distance from the

1615
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:58,879
observer you can never get up to a

1616
00:54:57,199 --> 00:55:01,439
crepuscular array anymore you can catch

1617
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:02,960
up to a rainbow this means this is one

1618
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:05,519
of the

1619
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:07,760
points demonstrating that this is not a

1620
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:10,239
model close to the camera because it has

1621
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:12,640
to be a certain distance away before the

1622
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:14,159
muscular rays can even be seen

1623
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:15,440
so we put this one in here for that

1624
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:17,118
reason

1625
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:19,039
here's another picture taken in the same

1626
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:20,480
series to show you what it looks like up

1627
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:22,079
close when it's so close that it's

1628
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,760
obscuring the sky down remember if

1629
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:25,839
that's bigger than the size of the

1630
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:27,839
rising moon that's how much bigger it

1631
00:55:25,838 --> 00:55:30,318
was in apparent size to the photographer

1632
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:30,318
at the time

1633
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:35,039
i'm going to back up to that one i just

1634
00:55:32,239 --> 00:55:36,558
had here because i think my friend randy

1635
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:38,480
winters has a picture similar to that

1636
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:40,960
he's going to show you where

1637
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:42,240
his craft is doing something very

1638
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,599
interesting and i want you to remember

1639
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:46,798
this one just for that purpose he'll

1640
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:46,798
mention it again when he comes up

1641
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:51,440
uh here are two craft a uh

1642
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:54,400
a uh

1643
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:55,760
21 foot diameter mothership

1644
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,599
or shepherd ship

1645
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,960
controlling a remote control craft in

1646
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:01,280
this case

1647
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:03,679
the remote craft had

1648
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:05,839
a safety seat for a single pilot they

1649
00:56:03,679 --> 00:56:08,159
could be flown by one pilot aboard or

1650
00:56:05,838 --> 00:56:10,639
they could be flown under remote control

1651
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:12,480
the 21 foot diameter craft had

1652
00:56:10,639 --> 00:56:14,639
two pilot positions aboard seat

1653
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,559
positions board and a third jump

1654
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:18,078
position where they could carry a pilot

1655
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:20,400
or another person

1656
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:22,240
aboard so they're not very big the ships

1657
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,000
really are not

1658
00:56:22,239 --> 00:56:25,598
large in size they are close to the

1659
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,199
camera because they

1660
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:28,318
and their apparent size is large because

1661
00:56:27,199 --> 00:56:30,159
they are close

1662
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:32,159
here is another picture following the

1663
00:56:30,159 --> 00:56:34,159
one just before we're back go back to

1664
00:56:32,159 --> 00:56:35,679
here you can see it going overhead it

1665
00:56:34,159 --> 00:56:37,838
appears to be higher in the sky only

1666
00:56:35,679 --> 00:56:39,679
because it's closer to the cameraman and

1667
00:56:37,838 --> 00:56:41,519
as they move away they appear to descend

1668
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:43,679
to the horizon only because they're

1669
00:56:41,519 --> 00:56:46,159
going away from him and appear to be

1670
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:47,358
going down it's just an optical uh

1671
00:56:46,159 --> 00:56:49,199
illusion

1672
00:56:47,358 --> 00:56:51,358
this next series of pictures and there's

1673
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:54,480
several in here was taking it over sadly

1674
00:56:51,358 --> 00:56:56,798
switzerland then 8 march 1975.

1675
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:59,358
the object was seen coming up the hazy

1676
00:56:56,798 --> 00:57:00,719
valley there slowly and

1677
00:56:59,358 --> 00:57:03,358
his first picture was taken of it over

1678
00:57:00,719 --> 00:57:05,519
the log pile he took about 13 or 14

1679
00:57:03,358 --> 00:57:07,838
pictures in series here it's

1680
00:57:05,519 --> 00:57:09,519
running to his left over the tops of

1681
00:57:07,838 --> 00:57:11,039
birch trees these are tall birch trees

1682
00:57:09,519 --> 00:57:14,000
growing down the hill from where meyer

1683
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:16,000
is standing they're not bush not bushes

1684
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,199
here's a second following picture in

1685
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,480
that series

1686
00:57:17,199 --> 00:57:21,199
and it moved

1687
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:24,159
along beyond the incinerator here

1688
00:57:21,199 --> 00:57:26,558
to curve around the top stand the paw of

1689
00:57:24,159 --> 00:57:28,719
tall pine trees here you can see again

1690
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:30,798
that that's about four times the visual

1691
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:32,959
diameter of the rising moon so it's

1692
00:57:30,798 --> 00:57:35,199
quite large to him visually it's really

1693
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:38,240
not that far away when it's about 280

1694
00:57:35,199 --> 00:57:38,239
meters as a matter of fact

1695
00:57:38,318 --> 00:57:42,558
here it's further back it's about 300

1696
00:57:40,239 --> 00:57:44,798
meters 320 meters away i think we

1697
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:46,319
measured for this one uh it's turned and

1698
00:57:44,798 --> 00:57:47,838
it's following this time the pine trees

1699
00:57:46,318 --> 00:57:49,759
there coming to the left and here it's

1700
00:57:47,838 --> 00:57:52,239
going around the end of it now this is a

1701
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:54,000
bit of an enlargement here to get uh to

1702
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:55,439
see some detail in it so

1703
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,599
in perspective it would have been about

1704
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:59,920
half that size

1705
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:01,680
and here it is going away

1706
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:03,119
here's another that's the last picture

1707
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:04,318
in that series

1708
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:06,960
here's another series that was

1709
00:58:04,318 --> 00:58:10,639
photographed over winkler switzerland

1710
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:12,240
on the 18th of march 1975 at uh nine

1711
00:58:10,639 --> 00:58:14,798
o'clock in the morning

1712
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:16,239
under a a heavy cloudy overcast the

1713
00:58:14,798 --> 00:58:18,000
object was flying

1714
00:58:16,239 --> 00:58:20,318
under the clouds

1715
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,000
it flew back and forth over

1716
00:58:20,318 --> 00:58:23,119
an area there the building that you see

1717
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,519
over here

1718
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:27,119
in the side is a sanitarium of some kind

1719
00:58:25,519 --> 00:58:28,559
for ill people

1720
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:32,079
you can see that it's

1721
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:33,680
shown edge on tilted

1722
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:35,519
both directions

1723
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:36,879
this one is the beginning now there's a

1724
00:58:35,519 --> 00:58:38,639
lot more in each of these series i'm

1725
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:40,960
just showing you some examples this is

1726
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:43,039
the one of the series taken over

1727
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:44,400
bird romlicon berg rumlikon means it's

1728
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:46,159
between the little town of berg and the

1729
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,440
little town of romlicon

1730
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:48,838
someplace in between over the

1731
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:52,318
countryside

1732
00:58:48,838 --> 00:58:55,279
there 12 june 1975

1733
00:58:52,318 --> 00:58:58,400
he was invited to this uh

1734
00:58:55,280 --> 00:59:00,000
photographic event he was often

1735
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:02,318
told when to bring his camera because if

1736
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,440
he didn't if he wasn't told that he

1737
00:59:02,318 --> 00:59:04,960
could take pictures he brought the

1738
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:07,119
camera he didn't they wouldn't give an

1739
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:09,039
opportunity to take him anyway so when

1740
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:10,880
they were going to uh

1741
00:59:09,039 --> 00:59:12,480
uh pose the ship for pictures they

1742
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:15,680
invited him to bring his cameras and in

1743
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:17,838
this case he took two 35 millimeter hand

1744
00:59:15,679 --> 00:59:19,598
cameras and an eight millimeter movie

1745
00:59:17,838 --> 00:59:21,199
camera a key wound

1746
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:23,200
eight millimeter movie camera set the

1747
00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:25,118
movie camera on a tripod

1748
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:26,798
turned it on automatic took his hand

1749
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:27,519
camera and waited for him to appear and

1750
00:59:26,798 --> 00:59:29,759
it

1751
00:59:27,519 --> 00:59:32,480
appeared just like that came right out

1752
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:34,319
of the the distance rapidly approaching

1753
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:36,639
making s turns coming up to the camera

1754
00:59:34,318 --> 00:59:38,798
and he simultaneously filmed this

1755
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:40,078
picture these pictures on eight

1756
00:59:38,798 --> 00:59:43,679
millimeter

1757
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:45,200
film as well as 35 millimeter slides

1758
00:59:43,679 --> 00:59:47,279
positive slides

1759
00:59:45,199 --> 00:59:48,480
this picture was taken near the same

1760
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:50,079
area

1761
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,960
at a time when they brought three ships

1762
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:52,400
in

1763
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:54,880
two of them hovered in the air one

1764
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:57,200
landed it had the third seat empty they

1765
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:59,760
invited meyer to go with them the first

1766
00:59:57,199 --> 01:00:01,279
two ships have taken off now the the

1767
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:03,359
high one there is number one here's

1768
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:04,640
number two and he's in the third one and

1769
01:00:03,358 --> 01:00:06,239
they're just leaving the ground there

1770
01:00:04,639 --> 01:00:08,239
was a second picture taken when they're

1771
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:09,919
about a thousand feet in the air there

1772
01:00:08,239 --> 01:00:12,000
it is you can't see the ground very well

1773
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:13,280
but it's down here in the haze in a good

1774
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,039
picture you can see buildings on the

1775
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:16,720
ground you can see that that they are in

1776
01:00:15,039 --> 01:00:18,159
the air

1777
01:00:16,719 --> 01:00:19,838
here's a series of pictures that we have

1778
01:00:18,159 --> 01:00:21,118
never released anywhere

1779
01:00:19,838 --> 01:00:22,239
before and you're seeing them for the

1780
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:24,559
first time

1781
01:00:22,239 --> 01:00:27,679
taken over back to hornley

1782
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:30,559
on the 28th of march 1976

1783
01:00:27,679 --> 01:00:32,480
where he has is using the tripod

1784
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:33,599
as a foreground reference we had been

1785
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:35,039
telling him

1786
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:36,000
craft in the sky don't mean a thing

1787
01:00:35,039 --> 01:00:37,759
there's nothing around him you can't

1788
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,519
tell far how far away they are how big

1789
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:41,280
they are or anything get foreground get

1790
01:00:39,519 --> 01:00:42,798
background get objects alongside them

1791
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:44,720
anything you can

1792
01:00:42,798 --> 01:00:46,798
so now he's trying to do that he's

1793
01:00:44,719 --> 01:00:48,318
trying to get the legs of his tripod in

1794
01:00:46,798 --> 01:00:49,679
the foreground later he tries to get

1795
01:00:48,318 --> 01:00:51,599
bushes and things like that in the

1796
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:53,199
foreground but this is a series you're

1797
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:55,280
seeing for the first time there's number

1798
01:00:53,199 --> 01:00:56,798
one we probably have four or five of

1799
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:59,280
them in here here he's shooting through

1800
01:00:56,798 --> 01:01:01,440
the legs of his tripod

1801
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:03,280
here it's uh apparently to the left now

1802
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:05,519
he's moving around the craft is moving

1803
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:07,359
slowly and he's moving back and forth

1804
01:01:05,519 --> 01:01:09,679
and if you if you want to sit down with

1805
01:01:07,358 --> 01:01:11,920
these pictures and and do some geometry

1806
01:01:09,679 --> 01:01:13,598
you can find about how much the craft is

1807
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:15,440
moving and about how far away by how

1808
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:17,200
he's changing position around the tripod

1809
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:19,280
there

1810
01:01:17,199 --> 01:01:20,798
here's a another picture in the series

1811
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,400
on that day he had

1812
01:01:20,798 --> 01:01:24,318
two photographic events one in the

1813
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:26,000
morning and one in the afternoon and

1814
01:01:24,318 --> 01:01:29,119
this picture was taken

1815
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:31,039
over back to hornley also same day and i

1816
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:33,280
want you to notice the detail under the

1817
01:01:31,039 --> 01:01:35,279
ship this is from the 35 millimeter

1818
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:37,519
slide

1819
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:38,960
here's another picture of that series

1820
01:01:37,519 --> 01:01:41,599
let's see if i can do something with the

1821
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,599
focus here

1822
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:49,760
how's that

1823
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:51,680
okay i want you to look carefully at the

1824
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:54,160
amount of detail you can see

1825
01:01:51,679 --> 01:01:55,199
you can see some trees a tree line under

1826
01:01:54,159 --> 01:01:56,719
the craft

1827
01:01:55,199 --> 01:01:59,519
and a little point of trees that rises

1828
01:01:56,719 --> 01:02:02,000
above the horizon line

1829
01:01:59,519 --> 01:02:03,358
there's a notch there in in the top of

1830
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,599
the hill where there are no trees you

1831
01:02:03,358 --> 01:02:08,239
can't see much in it now can you

1832
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:10,400
so we took this picture this was

1833
01:02:08,239 --> 01:02:12,318
one of the clearer pictures uh they took

1834
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,838
because there was very little motion in

1835
01:02:12,318 --> 01:02:16,000
the camera and very little motion on the

1836
01:02:13,838 --> 01:02:18,838
ship we got nice sharp edges

1837
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,798
we took it to a

1838
01:02:18,838 --> 01:02:23,519
a uh

1839
01:02:20,798 --> 01:02:25,679
graphics processing shop in basel

1840
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:28,798
where they had a hell chromograph 300

1841
01:02:25,679 --> 01:02:31,118
laser scanner an argon laser scanner and

1842
01:02:28,798 --> 01:02:32,880
they put it through the scanner

1843
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:34,559
and created four separate color

1844
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,599
separation negatives

1845
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:36,559
uh

1846
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:38,880
amber

1847
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:39,599
cyan and blue

1848
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,440
are

1849
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:42,559
amber scion and red

1850
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:44,639
negatives

1851
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:46,160
and a black and white negative and we

1852
01:02:44,639 --> 01:02:48,400
took those negatives we had the

1853
01:02:46,159 --> 01:02:51,279
negatives made poster size

1854
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:53,280
we took them to a poster printer and had

1855
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:55,119
them printed on poster paper

1856
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:58,720
now remember what you're seeing there

1857
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:58,720
and here's the detail that came out

1858
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:03,520
that's how much it improved the picture

1859
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:06,400
by just laser scanning it

1860
01:03:03,519 --> 01:03:08,318
and printing it back

1861
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:10,798
and that's the first time we saw detail

1862
01:03:08,318 --> 01:03:12,480
like that in any craft anywhere

1863
01:03:10,798 --> 01:03:13,920
and so it's a good process for testing

1864
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:15,039
we stumbled onto it accidentally we

1865
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:16,400
didn't know how it was going to come out

1866
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:18,000
when he started

1867
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:20,240
this next one was photographed over

1868
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,599
hossenball and you see that he is doing

1869
01:03:20,239 --> 01:03:24,239
what we said he is getting some

1870
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:25,680
foreground in his pictures as he uh he's

1871
01:03:24,239 --> 01:03:28,000
moving to the right as the craft is

1872
01:03:25,679 --> 01:03:30,000
moving to his right also and he keeps

1873
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,559
bringing bushes between him and the

1874
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:35,199
approaching craft and it's descending to

1875
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:36,960
a position behind a bear limb tree there

1876
01:03:35,199 --> 01:03:38,639
where it's hovering now

1877
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:40,880
i think if you look closely you can see

1878
01:03:38,639 --> 01:03:42,639
some crepuscular rays on that craft

1879
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:45,358
there you see them just below the the

1880
01:03:42,639 --> 01:03:47,440
rim plan shining down a kind of a v

1881
01:03:45,358 --> 01:03:49,440
rays like that those are also

1882
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:50,798
crepuscular rays from the sun reflecting

1883
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:53,679
off the dome of the craft and they can

1884
01:03:50,798 --> 01:03:55,119
only be perceived at a distance

1885
01:03:53,679 --> 01:03:56,719
change is

1886
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:59,838
eliminating the possibility of that

1887
01:03:56,719 --> 01:03:59,838
being a model close up

1888
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:04,240
here's a picture of that series in that

1889
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:05,839
series after the contact there was a

1890
01:04:04,239 --> 01:04:07,358
contact on the ground with the craft

1891
01:04:05,838 --> 01:04:08,798
hovering beyond the tree

1892
01:04:07,358 --> 01:04:10,960
when they boarded the craft and left he

1893
01:04:08,798 --> 01:04:13,199
took pictures of the departing craft as

1894
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:14,159
circled out over the valley came back

1895
01:04:13,199 --> 01:04:15,679
around

1896
01:04:14,159 --> 01:04:18,239
and then ascended vertically overhead

1897
01:04:15,679 --> 01:04:20,078
here's a series of pictures taken

1898
01:04:18,239 --> 01:04:21,759
at

1899
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:23,760
schmarbuel

1900
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:25,680
by where the swiss army was carrying was

1901
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:27,839
holding army maneuvers

1902
01:04:25,679 --> 01:04:29,598
and it was a big army maneuver exercise

1903
01:04:27,838 --> 01:04:32,400
they had aircraft they had tanks they

1904
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:33,599
had infantry forces they had paratroops

1905
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,519
everything there and the swiss are

1906
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:37,599
always on some kind of an exercise but

1907
01:04:35,519 --> 01:04:39,199
this was one of their bigger ones and

1908
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:41,440
right in the middle of the exercise

1909
01:04:39,199 --> 01:04:44,159
meyer was summoned to a contact in the

1910
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:46,000
middle of the exercise area and he had

1911
01:04:44,159 --> 01:04:47,679
he had to go across fields and around

1912
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,159
ditches to miss the checkpoints to get

1913
01:04:47,679 --> 01:04:50,879
to the place and when he got there

1914
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:52,879
the

1915
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:55,039
palladian craft approached from beyond

1916
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:56,880
the ridge line the army is on the other

1917
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:59,039
side of the ridge at the present time

1918
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:00,720
and unknown to him they're watching this

1919
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:02,640
on their radar

1920
01:05:00,719 --> 01:05:04,879
and it makes approach you can see it

1921
01:05:02,639 --> 01:05:06,719
coming through the smoke here as it gets

1922
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:08,480
close you barely see it

1923
01:05:06,719 --> 01:05:10,480
and then it came up

1924
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:12,960
at an angle overhead

1925
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:15,358
and he turned on a tape recorder he was

1926
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:16,880
carrying with him and he began recording

1927
01:05:15,358 --> 01:05:18,880
the sounds that he was hearing from the

1928
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:21,039
spacecraft he didn't always hear sounds

1929
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:23,920
but this time it was making a sound and

1930
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:25,920
he began recording the sounds he had a a

1931
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:28,318
half hour tape in his recording just let

1932
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:30,720
it run and took pictures as that swiss

1933
01:05:28,318 --> 01:05:33,599
army mirage now vectored in by the radar

1934
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:36,318
made 22 passes on the alien vehicle in

1935
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:38,079
the sky at low level around him there on

1936
01:05:36,318 --> 01:05:38,798
the 22nd pass

1937
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:41,119
the

1938
01:05:38,798 --> 01:05:43,599
mirage broke off contact and went back

1939
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:45,358
to its base and landed we learned from a

1940
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:48,240
mechanic at the base that the mirage

1941
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:50,159
returned with a story of

1942
01:05:48,239 --> 01:05:51,519
trying to intercept it to get gun camera

1943
01:05:50,159 --> 01:05:53,279
pictures of a ship and as soon as he

1944
01:05:51,519 --> 01:05:54,798
armed the fire control system which also

1945
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,760
arms the gun camera so he could take the

1946
01:05:54,798 --> 01:05:56,559
pictures

1947
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:58,640
the

1948
01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:00,880
electronic system began to smoke and

1949
01:05:58,639 --> 01:06:02,558
melted down in the cockpit it all had to

1950
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:05,200
be changed out at a very great expense

1951
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:06,720
to the swiss army so while this was

1952
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:08,798
going on

1953
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:10,639
and while it's making passes

1954
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:12,480
meyer was observed on the hillside with

1955
01:06:10,639 --> 01:06:13,598
his camera and his tape recorder and his

1956
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:15,519
moped

1957
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:18,240
and they sent a police car to find out

1958
01:06:15,519 --> 01:06:20,400
what he was doing there the police car a

1959
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:22,558
provincial police car drove up

1960
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:24,318
two policemen got out started walking

1961
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:27,519
towards meyer the craft

1962
01:06:24,318 --> 01:06:29,119
hovering in overhead there

1963
01:06:27,519 --> 01:06:30,719
actually started asking what he was

1964
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:32,720
doing he pointed up they looked up and

1965
01:06:30,719 --> 01:06:35,358
then the craft that was already making a

1966
01:06:32,719 --> 01:06:37,038
humming sound turned on a real loud

1967
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:39,679
humming whining sound that was ear

1968
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:41,119
piercing screeching and the cops ran

1969
01:06:39,679 --> 01:06:42,960
back jumped in the car put it in the

1970
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:45,039
gear and raced off in a cloud of dust

1971
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:46,798
and never came back all of this is

1972
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:48,799
recorded on the tape

1973
01:06:46,798 --> 01:06:50,400
so when we took the tape

1974
01:06:48,798 --> 01:06:52,000
when we took that tape to the naval

1975
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:54,880
sound research laboratory it wrote in

1976
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,920
connecticut for analysis they identified

1977
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:58,798
the

1978
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:00,798
make or the the model of the airplane

1979
01:06:58,798 --> 01:07:02,559
they also identified the sounds of a

1980
01:07:00,798 --> 01:07:05,559
junkers

1981
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:05,559
j-252

1982
01:07:05,679 --> 01:07:09,679
german transport plane dropping

1983
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:12,559
paratroopers they identified the sounds

1984
01:07:09,679 --> 01:07:14,960
of a pilates porter observation airplane

1985
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:16,880
flying overhead they recorded the sounds

1986
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:18,240
of the police car coming with a siren on

1987
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:20,160
before it entered the scene there

1988
01:07:18,239 --> 01:07:21,519
getting keeping its clearance in traffic

1989
01:07:20,159 --> 01:07:23,279
as it raced in

1990
01:07:21,519 --> 01:07:24,318
they recorded the sounds of a european

1991
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:26,240
train

1992
01:07:24,318 --> 01:07:28,318
all these things they found in the sound

1993
01:07:26,239 --> 01:07:29,838
bank and they could tell us which train

1994
01:07:28,318 --> 01:07:32,239
they could tell us to make it the kind

1995
01:07:29,838 --> 01:07:34,318
of a car that it was everything but they

1996
01:07:32,239 --> 01:07:35,759
couldn't tell us what was the source of

1997
01:07:34,318 --> 01:07:36,960
the sound from the spacecraft there was

1998
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,559
no match

1999
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:41,358
in the sound bank

2000
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:43,680
from buzz saws to anything that they had

2001
01:07:41,358 --> 01:07:45,358
they could couldn't get a match for the

2002
01:07:43,679 --> 01:07:47,519
sounds being made by the spacecraft that

2003
01:07:45,358 --> 01:07:47,519
day

2004
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:53,680
here is uh

2005
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:57,039
the part of switzerland in the red oval

2006
01:07:53,679 --> 01:08:00,000
there where much of this is taking place

2007
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:01,920
and here is a pleiades star group

2008
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,880
uh that's what they look like when we

2009
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:06,318
see them how close are we randy we got

2010
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:08,400
huh

2011
01:08:06,318 --> 01:08:11,119
yeah how close are we now that how many

2012
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:13,119
minutes are we into this

2013
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:14,640
okay i i i

2014
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:15,920
i'm going to run through real quick

2015
01:08:14,639 --> 01:08:17,439
through these slides and not bother

2016
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:20,480
tricks this is the disc of fistos and

2017
01:08:17,439 --> 01:08:23,599
it's a story in linear a on an ancient

2018
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:25,678
doc an ancient artifact from crete

2019
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:27,679
thousands of years old describing from

2020
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:29,520
the center out if you can see it

2021
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:32,399
the arrival

2022
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:32,400
of a

2023
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:42,719
those spacecraft

2024
01:08:38,798 --> 01:08:42,719
in mythology in several mythologies

2025
01:08:44,079 --> 01:08:49,679
here we see it on the tomb

2026
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:51,600
at palenque in mexico a uh

2027
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:53,199
a mexican figure of a man riding a

2028
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:58,159
rocket

2029
01:08:53,198 --> 01:08:58,879
here is the plains of ika peru where uh

2030
01:08:58,158 --> 01:09:00,879
a

2031
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:03,279
speaker just before me here showed you

2032
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:05,039
some scenes from the stones of ika

2033
01:09:03,279 --> 01:09:06,480
that's where they were the planes you

2034
01:09:05,039 --> 01:09:08,000
can see the plains of nazca are right

2035
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:09,838
around the province of nascar just to

2036
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,399
the right and here in the desert is

2037
01:09:09,838 --> 01:09:14,719
where the those stones that

2038
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:15,920
found by dr cabrera are and here's what

2039
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:17,039
the stones look like there's a

2040
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:19,520
hemisphere

2041
01:09:17,039 --> 01:09:22,319
of a planet probably ours on the cover

2042
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:25,120
of cabrera's book here is some of the

2043
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:27,120
the what this shows is uh metallic birds

2044
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:28,719
with men riding on them that means

2045
01:09:27,119 --> 01:09:30,719
airborne vehicles are sun cleaned with

2046
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:32,719
men in them and notice they're using

2047
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:34,719
tubes that means extended vision viewing

2048
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:36,399
screens of some kind of board the little

2049
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:38,319
aborigines you see one down here are

2050
01:09:36,399 --> 01:09:40,399
riding in the back of a dinosaur there

2051
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:43,120
little squat round men that wore

2052
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:45,198
knee length grease great grass skirts

2053
01:09:43,119 --> 01:09:47,119
the visitors were dressed in elaborate

2054
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:48,719
body fitting costumes

2055
01:09:47,119 --> 01:09:50,399
uh here is a

2056
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:52,798
one of the stars

2057
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:54,079
stones carved with astronomical figures

2058
01:09:52,798 --> 01:09:56,319
that shows

2059
01:09:54,079 --> 01:09:58,399
a probable origin for the people coming

2060
01:09:56,319 --> 01:10:00,238
here from the stars and this indicates

2061
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:02,639
that they're coming here from the

2062
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:04,799
pleiades

2063
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:07,119
and here's a book written by

2064
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:09,440
jj benitez does another humanity exist

2065
01:10:07,119 --> 01:10:12,079
describing a full book describing the

2066
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:13,678
stones of ika and the interpretations

2067
01:10:12,079 --> 01:10:15,039
made by dr cabrera and others that

2068
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:17,359
they're probably coming here from the

2069
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:19,359
pleiades and had been coming here since

2070
01:10:17,359 --> 01:10:21,839
the time of the dinosaurs that observed

2071
01:10:19,359 --> 01:10:22,960
or indigenous earth humanity

2072
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:25,039
living in

2073
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:27,760
harmony with the dinosaurs

2074
01:10:25,039 --> 01:10:29,679
even domesticated some here's a painting

2075
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:32,079
made by peter the frenchman pierre de la

2076

2077
01:10:32,079 --> 01:10:35,039
the sky during a religious event he

2078
01:10:34,158 --> 01:10:36,960
painted

2079
01:10:35,039 --> 01:10:40,000
12 stations the cross for the church at

2080
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:42,480
arizo italy and in five of those

2081
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,479
stations across these domed disc clouds

2082
01:10:42,479 --> 01:10:46,799
appeared

2083
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:48,399
here's a painting taken from a famous

2084
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:50,239
church in italy and i don't remember it

2085
01:10:48,399 --> 01:10:51,920
i don't think i got it on my card here

2086
01:10:50,238 --> 01:10:53,759
where if you notice in the painting in

2087
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:55,679
the box up in the upper right hand

2088

corner there's a shepherd with his dog

2089

object down here in an enlargement it's

2093
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:08,159
clearly a structured object radiating a

2094
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,840
great amount of light painted into that

2095
01:11:08,158 --> 01:11:11,439
religious picture and it's a very famous

2096
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:14,719
painting hangs at a big church in a

2097

from the pleiades and i didn't even

2103

discuss that before it's one of the

2104
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:28,960
cases that came to my attention in fact

2105

here is uh

2115
01:11:47,359 --> 01:11:51,439
the over in the circle there is a place

2116
01:11:49,198 --> 01:11:53,519
east of bogota where enrique castillo

2117
01:11:51,439 --> 01:11:55,599
rincon an attorney from bogota was led

2118
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:57,199
to the first run to be with the human

2119
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:59,360
beings that told him that they came from

2120
01:11:57,198 --> 01:12:00,960
the pleiades

2121
01:11:59,359 --> 01:12:02,479
here is what that ship looked like the

2122
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:05,279
ones that the one that

2123
01:12:02,479 --> 01:12:06,879
enrique castillo rincon was taken to he

2124
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:09,119
was picked up by a smaller shuttle to

2125
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:11,440
ship and taken to a larger craft

2126
01:12:09,119 --> 01:12:14,158
the smaller shuttle ship was operated by

2127
01:12:11,439 --> 01:12:16,559
human-like beings little humanoids

2128
01:12:14,158 --> 01:12:17,599
uh here is this the environmental gear

2129
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:20,239
worn by

2130
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:22,079
the uh humans aboard the spacecraft when

2131
01:12:20,238 --> 01:12:24,718
they came to the surface of the planet

2132
01:12:22,079 --> 01:12:26,158
for some reason i don't know why but

2133
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:28,560
when they got aboard the ship they took

2134
01:12:26,158 --> 01:12:29,679
the the suits off and this is how they

2135
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:32,000
were dressed

2136
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:35,440
they were shoulder lengths light hair

2137

01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:42,960
environmental gear

2141
01:12:41,198 --> 01:12:44,479
here is a star map they brought up on a

2142
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:45,840
screen to show him exactly where they

2143
01:12:44,479 --> 01:12:47,359
came from and the pleiades didn't make

2144
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:50,000
any sense to him but he was allowed to

2145
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:52,399
trace it on a piece of paper and the

2146
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,158
little dark spot in the lower right hand

2147
01:12:52,399 --> 01:12:57,359
corner is the position of our sun on

2148
01:12:54,158 --> 01:12:59,359

01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,439
here in the right-hand corner it looks

2158
01:13:13,119 --> 01:13:17,359
like a shuttle it's got a

2159
01:13:15,439 --> 01:13:19,439
silvery white flange with a reddish dome

2160
01:13:17,359 --> 01:13:20,639
on the top here's another picture of the

2161
01:13:19,439 --> 01:13:22,479
same craft you can see it a little

2162
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:24,640
better it's high in the clouds it's

2163
01:13:22,479 --> 01:13:26,799
these can see the rosy dome there and

2164
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:28,719
the silvery white flange

2165
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:30,480
and here is uh

2166
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:33,039
the things moved around to the sky into

2167
01:13:30,479 --> 01:13:35,359
a silhouette position

2168
01:13:33,039 --> 01:13:38,000
and here is where uh

2169
01:13:35,359 --> 01:13:40,158
juan kyle peru is where charles silva

2170
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:42,000
was having his contacts charles silva

2171
01:13:40,158 --> 01:13:44,719
was the man shirley maclaine called

2172
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:47,439
david in her book ramatis is the woman

2173
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:49,600
that shirley mclean called rama in her

2174
01:13:47,439 --> 01:13:51,198
book and those contacts were going on

2175
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:53,280
same time as investigating the case in

2176
01:13:51,198 --> 01:13:55,198
switzerland here's charles silva's book

2177
01:13:53,279 --> 01:13:56,880
a date with the gods

2178
01:13:55,198 --> 01:13:59,119
here is uh

2179
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:00,880
the place near you can see it tokuyo in

2180
01:13:59,119 --> 01:14:02,559
the middle el tokuyo that's the place in

2181
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:04,640
venezuela where the contacts were taking

2182
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:07,120
place in the sugar cane field and these

2183
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:08,880
contacts as they began and developed the

2184
01:14:07,119 --> 01:14:11,198
word got out around the countryside and

2185
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:12,400
cars came from everywhere until they had

2186
01:14:11,198 --> 01:14:15,119
as many as

2187
01:14:12,399 --> 01:14:17,198
hundreds of cars blocking the roads to

2188
01:14:15,119 --> 01:14:18,238
the cane fields and they get in there so

2189
01:14:17,198 --> 01:14:20,238
densely

2190
01:14:18,238 --> 01:14:21,839
crowded and jammed in that they even the

2191
01:14:20,238 --> 01:14:24,079
police would have to come and unscramble

2192
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:25,760
the cars from the outside in to get them

2193
01:14:24,079 --> 01:14:27,279
all out of there again

2194
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:29,039
and that happened a number of times and

2195
01:14:27,279 --> 01:14:31,359
and we interviewed police that were

2196
01:14:29,039 --> 01:14:33,679
involved in that particular uh

2197
01:14:31,359 --> 01:14:35,839
operation they even reported seeing the

2198
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:38,079
objects performing over the cane fields

2199
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:39,440
themselves here i'm showing you a gulf

2200
01:14:38,079 --> 01:14:42,238
breeze here you all know where it is

2201
01:14:39,439 --> 01:14:44,000
just off the coast of pensacola because

2202
01:14:42,238 --> 01:14:46,559
when i spent some time with ed walters

2203
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:48,158
and his wife francie in a in a condo one

2204
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:50,400
time in orlando where we were doing a

2205
01:14:48,158 --> 01:14:53,198
week thing like this they told he had

2206
01:14:50,399 --> 01:14:56,000
told me that his the controllers of the

2207
01:14:53,198 --> 01:14:57,839
little robot beings that he saw

2208
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:00,000
told him they came from the pleiades and

2209
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:02,159
when he was aboard the uh the mother

2210
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:04,319
ship that the disc shaped crap that

2211
01:15:02,158 --> 01:15:07,039
controlled the little robotoids he said

2212
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:09,359
that uh they were humans just like us

2213
01:15:07,039 --> 01:15:11,039
that uh

2214
01:15:09,359 --> 01:15:14,559
and and and for that reason he was very

2215
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:17,198
interested in what i was was doing

2216
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:18,800
here's the book that ed wrote i think uh

2217
01:15:17,198 --> 01:15:20,079
he didn't say in this one but in the

2218
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:22,000
next one here

2219
01:15:20,079 --> 01:15:23,359
he described he i think he mentioned one

2220
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,760
time that the

2221
01:15:23,359 --> 01:15:27,759
the beings aboard the ship told him they

2222
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:29,360
came from the pleiades he went into some

2223
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:31,199
detail with it with me because he was

2224
01:15:29,359 --> 01:15:32,960
interested in the police case these are

2225
01:15:31,198 --> 01:15:34,479
the little robotoids that

2226
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:35,840
operated the shuttlecraft that picked

2227
01:15:34,479 --> 01:15:37,359
that up

2228
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:38,880
that's also the creature they saw on the

2229
01:15:37,359 --> 01:15:40,960
porch of his

2230
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:43,840
the veranda of his home in gulf breeze

2231
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:46,960
florida here's the uh the area of buenos

2232
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:46,960
aires where uh

2233
01:15:47,359 --> 01:15:51,599
the

2234
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:53,440
forgotten his name the the

2235
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:57,520
man from from argentina was having his

2236
01:15:53,439 --> 01:15:57,519
contacts with pleiades lady and humans

2237
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,760
okay uh do you want to

2238
01:16:02,238 --> 01:16:05,678
can i do just a couple of slides here

2239
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:07,760
randy because

2240
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:10,000
while you change the carousel back there

2241
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:12,880
let me tell you that uh

2242
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:15,279
a time came in the discussions with uh

2243
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:16,880
mr meyer had with the pleiadians and

2244
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:19,439
randy when he was living there with him

2245
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:21,359
randy had long discussions with my hours

2246
01:16:19,439 --> 01:16:22,879
and hours into the night and so i'm sure

2247
01:16:21,359 --> 01:16:24,238
that this came up in his discussions

2248
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:26,079
with him too but

2249
01:16:24,238 --> 01:16:28,079
the uh

2250
01:16:26,079 --> 01:16:31,359
the the german militarists were

2251
01:16:28,079 --> 01:16:31,359
frequently mentioned and uh

2252
01:16:31,439 --> 01:16:35,839
at some point in the discussion with tom

2253
01:16:34,079 --> 01:16:37,920
the pleiadian man

2254
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:40,960
he uh said something about okay just

2255
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:42,079
hold that there he said something about

2256
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:43,840
that

2257
01:16:42,079 --> 01:16:46,000
the german

2258
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:48,640
uh the germans were developing this

2259
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:51,198
shapecraft during the war and that they

2260
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:53,840
had succeeded in developing operational

2261
01:16:51,198 --> 01:16:55,279
vehicles that had to be evacuated before

2262
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:56,960
germany collapsed

2263
01:16:55,279 --> 01:16:58,238
and that they were taken elsewhere and

2264
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:59,359
suggested

2265
01:16:58,238 --> 01:17:01,198
that

2266
01:16:59,359 --> 01:17:03,439
said that some went to antarctica and

2267
01:17:01,198 --> 01:17:05,279
some went to the amazon and a number of

2268
01:17:03,439 --> 01:17:06,879
other places we didn't pay much

2269
01:17:05,279 --> 01:17:08,479
attention to that at the time because

2270
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:10,159
everybody knew that

2271
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:12,639
they weren't in in the jungle in the

2272
01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:14,639
amazon jungles until we started doing

2273
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:16,159
some research on it there's a man in the

2274
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:18,239
audience here that has done a lot of

2275
01:17:16,158 --> 01:17:19,839
research on this and has come up with a

2276
01:17:18,238 --> 01:17:21,839
lot of information with his kind

2277
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:23,199
permission i'm going to show you several

2278
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:25,440
pictures here

2279
01:17:23,198 --> 01:17:28,639
that show how far the german research

2280
01:17:25,439 --> 01:17:30,399
got before it was evacuated this is

2281
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:32,239
there's the white corridor escape plan

2282
01:17:30,399 --> 01:17:35,119
that was allowed for for

2283
01:17:32,238 --> 01:17:36,879
as the as germany was falling you'll see

2284
01:17:35,119 --> 01:17:40,000
that somebody has marked the positions

2285
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:42,400
of nine saturn-shaped disks on there

2286
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,760
those were the locations of research

2287
01:17:42,399 --> 01:17:46,479
facilities

2288
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:47,360
controlled by the german ss they were

2289
01:17:46,479 --> 01:17:49,439
the

2290
01:17:47,359 --> 01:17:52,158
they were the responsible authority for

2291
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:54,719
the v-7 weapons research program in

2292
01:17:52,158 --> 01:17:57,039
germany and they successfully evacuated

2293
01:17:54,719 --> 01:17:58,560
seven of them and destroyed two

2294
01:17:57,039 --> 01:17:59,840
before they it was americans captured

2295
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:01,600
here's one of the research vehicles

2296
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:03,520
though that the germans produced

2297
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:06,400
and it certainly is a disc shaped craft

2298
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:06,400
this is an early one

2299
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:10,880
there are two

2300
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:14,239
when the war was winding down and and we

2301
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:15,679
were overrunning the german territory uh

2302
01:18:14,238 --> 01:18:17,119
we had the sector the french had a

2303
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:21,039
sector the australians had some the

2304
01:18:17,119 --> 01:18:22,960
english had some and whoever

2305
01:18:21,039 --> 01:18:24,158
captured a factory went in with trucks

2306
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:25,359
and hauled off all the factory's

2307
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:26,639
documents sent them back here to the

2308
01:18:25,359 --> 01:18:28,479
united states so we could figure out

2309
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:30,480
what they were doing and see what we

2310
01:18:28,479 --> 01:18:32,479
could learn from them

2311
01:18:30,479 --> 01:18:33,678
in those documents took years to sift

2312
01:18:32,479 --> 01:18:36,000
through all the documents but in the

2313
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:37,679
documents the australians found

2314
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,640
a

2315
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:41,760
16 millimeter video documentary prepared

2316
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:44,239
by

2317
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:47,520
german technicians describing or

2318
01:18:44,238 --> 01:18:50,000
outlining their research program and

2319
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:52,480
and uh they published it mr tarzinski

2320
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:54,960
encountered a copy and he has told us

2321
01:18:52,479 --> 01:18:57,359
about it for a number of years but after

2322
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:59,520
mr tarziki's release here

2323
01:18:57,359 --> 01:19:01,359
and the australian release down there

2324
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:03,440
the kgb started searching their files

2325
01:19:01,359 --> 01:19:05,519
they came up with another one

2326
01:19:03,439 --> 01:19:06,960
made by the germans also and you can

2327
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:09,280
tell which ones are from the russian

2328
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:10,480
film because they have the time code on

2329
01:19:09,279 --> 01:19:12,800
the right hand side when they were

2330
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:15,439
transferred to videotape and the the

2331
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:18,159
australian film does not so this is uh

2332
01:19:15,439 --> 01:19:20,639
is from the russian captured

2333
01:19:18,158 --> 01:19:22,238
film footage this is from the film

2334
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:23,360
footage captured by the australians and

2335
01:19:22,238 --> 01:19:25,759
here you see

2336
01:19:23,359 --> 01:19:27,119
a large craft it's a disc shaped craft

2337
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:29,520
with a dome on the top here you see a

2338
01:19:27,119 --> 01:19:31,119
truck this is a big german truck and

2339
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:32,640
there's a gantry crane on the other side

2340
01:19:31,119 --> 01:19:33,920
of the craft so you can see that this is

2341
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:35,840
probably

2342
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:37,199
around 100 feet in diameter there if we

2343
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:39,760
could see it better there are three men

2344
01:19:37,198 --> 01:19:41,359
working under the craft almost standing

2345
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:45,280
up

2346
01:19:41,359 --> 01:19:46,799
here's a one of that type in flight

2347
01:19:45,279 --> 01:19:49,119
here's another one this one is from the

2348
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:50,880
russian film

2349
01:19:49,119 --> 01:19:52,719
here's another one now you can see that

2350
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:53,920
there are some appendages underneath

2351
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:56,239
there's some kind of structure on the

2352
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:58,880
bottom that they're working with

2353
01:19:56,238 --> 01:20:00,639
here's another version

2354
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:02,000
this is a version where the germans have

2355
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:04,480
mounted a

2356
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:06,158
tank turret inverted on the bottom of

2357
01:20:04,479 --> 01:20:06,959
the craft trying to give it some cannon

2358
01:20:06,158 --> 01:20:09,119
power

2359
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:11,279
firepower

2360
01:20:09,119 --> 01:20:13,039
here is a view from the bottom of the

2361
01:20:11,279 --> 01:20:16,000
craft the german craft directly overhead

2362
01:20:13,039 --> 01:20:18,158
there's the german insignia on it

2363
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:22,319
here's a another view of the one with

2364
01:20:18,158 --> 01:20:22,319
the tank cannon pod mounted underneath

2365
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:26,080
here's one in flight in the air

2366
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:30,718
these are from the russian film

2367
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:32,639
these may here's a drawing

2368
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:34,158
from the german files and it also shows

2369
01:20:32,639 --> 01:20:36,239
the german insignia

2370
01:20:34,158 --> 01:20:38,638
on the side of the craft there it was a

2371
01:20:36,238 --> 01:20:40,158
this was a large craft intended to be

2372
01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:41,600
hundreds of feet in diameter i believe

2373
01:20:40,158 --> 01:20:43,198
it was supposed to be 300 feet in

2374
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:45,840
diameter and this was being considered

2375
01:20:43,198 --> 01:20:48,719
as a mars expeditionary craft now this

2376
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:51,520
is back in the 40s

2377
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:54,800
here's a german

2378
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:56,320
suggestion for a flying dreadnought

2379
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:58,000
disc

2380
01:20:56,319 --> 01:21:00,559
here's another

2381
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:03,039
expanded version of that and here's one

2382
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:05,679
that reached some considerable design

2383
01:21:03,039 --> 01:21:07,359
sophistication where they have located

2384
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:10,560
facilities and

2385
01:21:07,359 --> 01:21:12,158
equipment aboard the craft

2386
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:14,080
here's a craft

2387
01:21:12,158 --> 01:21:16,319
you see notice the ss symbol on the top

2388
01:21:14,079 --> 01:21:18,479
there it's a paper that i am told by

2389
01:21:16,319 --> 01:21:20,399
some people that it's it's hoaxed but it

2390
01:21:18,479 --> 01:21:22,158
came from australia along with the film

2391
01:21:20,399 --> 01:21:23,679
and i don't know how much hoaxing

2392
01:21:22,158 --> 01:21:26,079
there's done to it all the writing is in

2393
01:21:23,679 --> 01:21:27,359
german the craft is quite similar to the

2394
01:21:26,079 --> 01:21:30,319
one that was photographed by george

2395
01:21:27,359 --> 01:21:32,399
adamski back in 1953 and this was

2396
01:21:30,319 --> 01:21:34,399
allegedly evacuated from

2397
01:21:32,399 --> 01:21:37,039
germany sometime in the in 40s the

2398
01:21:34,399 --> 01:21:39,119
middle 40s 1943 or 44

2399
01:21:37,039 --> 01:21:40,880
and taken someplace else for development

2400
01:21:39,119 --> 01:21:42,639
here's one that mr adamski happened to

2401
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:44,719
photograph notice the similarity between

2402
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:46,639
the two

2403
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:48,719
here's another picture taken over

2404
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:51,359
england by uh the

2405
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:52,719
coniston moors by two young boys eight

2406
01:21:51,359 --> 01:21:54,399
eight seven and eight years so i believe

2407
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:56,000
it's six and eight years old with a

2408
01:21:54,399 --> 01:21:58,399
pinhole camera doesn't even have a lens

2409
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:00,800
in it but it's similar in shape and when

2410
01:21:58,399 --> 01:22:02,719
those are projected together by a

2411
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:05,279
gor leonard cramp in england he got

2412
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:07,119
similar profiles suggesting that they

2413
01:22:05,279 --> 01:22:08,960
have the tadamsky and the boys in

2414
01:22:07,119 --> 01:22:10,960
england photographed the same or very

2415
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:12,639
similar vehicle

2416
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:15,039
here is a

2417
01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:17,199
a schematic of a proposed german mother

2418
01:22:15,039 --> 01:22:19,198
ship that would carry one of the large

2419
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:21,039
honda boot type craft and three of the

2420
01:22:19,198 --> 01:22:22,319
smaller real type craft aboard the

2421
01:22:21,039 --> 01:22:23,920
mother ship

2422
01:22:22,319 --> 01:22:26,799
and here's a picture of a mother ship in

2423
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:28,399
flight over germany

2424
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:30,400
here's another picture taken by george

2425
01:22:28,399 --> 01:22:31,920
adamski of what he considered called the

2426
01:22:30,399 --> 01:22:33,839
mothership in his

2427
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:35,679
contacts and if you'll notice

2428
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:37,039
those little blobs of light if you look

2429
01:22:35,679 --> 01:22:39,840
closely at the middle one there you'll

2430
01:22:37,039 --> 01:22:41,600
notice that it's made up of

2431
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:43,760
spots of light

2432
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:46,159
it's not just a blob of light it's it's

2433
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:48,800
it's bright spots of light a barbs

2434
01:22:46,158 --> 01:22:52,079
bright spots of light with a curve on

2435
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:54,239
the top and a curve on the bottom

2436
01:22:52,079 --> 01:22:56,158
here is a craft that was photographed

2437
01:22:54,238 --> 01:22:58,638
it's not probably not extraterrestrial

2438
01:22:56,158 --> 01:23:01,519
it's a vehicle photographed over

2439
01:22:58,639 --> 01:23:02,719
south africa which is just off the coast

2440
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:05,120
of

2441
01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:07,439
antarctica new schwabenland in art in

2442
01:23:05,119 --> 01:23:09,198
antarctica it's a a piece of antarctica

2443
01:23:07,439 --> 01:23:11,919
claimed by the germans and staked out by

2444
01:23:09,198 --> 01:23:13,678
them and they have a fairly large uh

2445
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:16,560
facility down here's a picture taken

2446
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:18,800
over queensland australia by mr hall

2447
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:20,560
of what looks like a

2448
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:22,960
jungle hat shaped craft with three

2449
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:25,039
hemispheres under the bottom uh it's

2450
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:26,719
quite similar to another drawing now

2451
01:23:25,039 --> 01:23:29,039
here's notice the shape of this drawing

2452
01:23:26,719 --> 01:23:31,119
with the the the reverse curve in the

2453
01:23:29,039 --> 01:23:33,039
upper dome and here's a photograph taken

2454
01:23:31,119 --> 01:23:35,119
over italy of three craft in formation

2455
01:23:33,039 --> 01:23:37,359
with the very same shape so one has to

2456
01:23:35,119 --> 01:23:38,960
wonder a little bit about

2457
01:23:37,359 --> 01:23:40,000
where these shapes are coming from and

2458
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:42,560
how much

2459
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:44,000
of this fits together and with that

2460
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:46,159
and that slight introduction i want to

2461
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:48,479
bring randy on because he is

2462
01:23:46,158 --> 01:23:50,399
investigating a case in miami that

2463
01:23:48,479 --> 01:23:52,479
involves all of these things

2464
01:23:50,399 --> 01:23:54,079
including the german connection

2465
01:23:52,479 --> 01:23:56,238
so with that randy are you ready down

2466
01:23:54,079 --> 01:23:56,238
there

2467
01:23:59,119 --> 01:24:02,719
i'm going to show you today we may be

2468
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:04,560
full circle on really unraveling the

2469
01:24:02,719 --> 01:24:06,560
mystery

2470
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:08,000
it has always been believed by most all

2471
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:10,400
of us who have known about the meyer

2472
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:12,079
case particularly back in the early 80s

2473
01:24:10,399 --> 01:24:13,439
that we were given what we were told

2474
01:24:12,079 --> 01:24:15,039
that someone was coming from the

2475
01:24:13,439 --> 01:24:18,319
pleiades

2476
01:24:15,039 --> 01:24:19,920
they probably were our ancient ancestors

2477
01:24:18,319 --> 01:24:21,359
uh we didn't know any different than

2478
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:23,760
that and we had no reason to really

2479
01:24:21,359 --> 01:24:25,439
suspect that wendell has just given you

2480
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:27,119
some information about the development

2481
01:24:25,439 --> 01:24:30,079
of the german situation back in the

2482
01:24:27,119 --> 01:24:31,840
2030s because now 20 years later the

2483
01:24:30,079 --> 01:24:33,359
answers are starting to come out in kind

2484
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:34,400
of full circle

2485
01:24:33,359 --> 01:24:36,479
uh

2486
01:24:34,399 --> 01:24:38,879
i got involved in the case uh quite a

2487
01:24:36,479 --> 01:24:40,479
little bit differently than wendell

2488
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:42,719
my interest was really in kind of the

2489
01:24:40,479 --> 01:24:43,919
spiritual and historical information

2490
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:46,079
and when i first heard about the

2491
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:48,319
pleiadian case over at myers i said well

2492
01:24:46,079 --> 01:24:50,319
you know if human life is really coming

2493
01:24:48,319 --> 01:24:52,000
from someplace else and is that advanced

2494
01:24:50,319 --> 01:24:53,519
imagine what we could learn from them

2495
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,119
and i had a few hundred questions i

2496
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:57,199
wanted to know about you know life and

2497
01:24:55,119 --> 01:24:59,039
creation of the universe and so forth so

2498
01:24:57,198 --> 01:25:00,638
i eventually found my way over to myers

2499
01:24:59,039 --> 01:25:02,158
house and wound up painting the bar and

2500
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:03,520
taking care of the chickens and all that

2501
01:25:02,158 --> 01:25:05,519
and living there for a long period of

2502
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:07,199
time where i spent a lot of time with

2503
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:08,800
billy i had him all to myself for about

2504
01:25:07,198 --> 01:25:10,719
four months just he and i hanging out

2505
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:14,239
every day so i i drained his brain

2506
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:16,480
pretty good and when i did that

2507
01:25:14,238 --> 01:25:18,879
i got together a collection of all of

2508
01:25:16,479 --> 01:25:20,718
his information it turned out that his

2509
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:23,679
contacts had gone on for about three

2510
01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:24,880
years on a weekly basis he had 115

2511
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:27,199
contacts

2512
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:29,600
he had over 2 000 pages of his own

2513
01:25:27,198 --> 01:25:31,439
personal notes that he had taken of all

2514
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:34,000
of these conversations which he turned

2515
01:25:31,439 --> 01:25:35,678
over to me we went all through them uh i

2516
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,359
eventually put those into a book called

2517
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:40,000
the pleiadian mission which some of you

2518
01:25:37,359 --> 01:25:41,599
may know about i have it here with me if

2519
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,439
you'd like to get a copy

2520
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:44,880
my interest uh was trying to put this

2521
01:25:43,439 --> 01:25:47,198
connection together with who we are on

2522
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:48,639
this earth and if someone is coming from

2523
01:25:47,198 --> 01:25:50,000
another world and they're saying our

2524
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:51,279
ancestors

2525
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:54,000
is that true is there really a

2526
01:25:51,279 --> 01:25:56,158
connection here the pleiadian material

2527
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:58,238
tells us that our forefathers were their

2528
01:25:56,158 --> 01:25:59,920
forefathers that human life from the

2529
01:25:58,238 --> 01:26:02,399
pleiades has been coming here a long

2530
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:04,000
time that their forefathers were from a

2531
01:26:02,399 --> 01:26:06,158
place called lyra that's where they

2532
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,439
descended from and that is the seed of

2533
01:26:06,158 --> 01:26:09,279
human life

2534
01:26:07,439 --> 01:26:11,439
well i studied all this information and

2535
01:26:09,279 --> 01:26:13,679
i was traveling about a year ago

2536
01:26:11,439 --> 01:26:15,039
down in florida giving a talk

2537
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:17,119
on this case

2538
01:26:15,039 --> 01:26:18,560
and actually it was at the request of a

2539
01:26:17,119 --> 01:26:20,399
young lady in florida asked me to come

2540
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:23,679
down to speak to her a group which spoke

2541
01:26:20,399 --> 01:26:25,119
spanish and i don't speak spanish so i

2542
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:27,119
had an interesting afternoon being

2543
01:26:25,119 --> 01:26:29,519
translated and speaking very slowly and

2544
01:26:27,119 --> 01:26:31,279
explaining myself and then at the end of

2545
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:32,960
the talk a young man came up to him and

2546
01:26:31,279 --> 01:26:34,559
introduced himself and told me his name

2547
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:36,800
was audrey aim

2548
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:39,360
and he says do you remember an evening

2549
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:40,880
about six years ago when you were living

2550
01:26:39,359 --> 01:26:43,039
in billy myers house and you were

2551
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:45,279
hearing voices in your head and i kind

2552
01:26:43,039 --> 01:26:46,800
of yeah i i remember that yeah but i've

2553
01:26:45,279 --> 01:26:48,719
told a few people that so that didn't

2554
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:50,560
surprise me and he says you were you

2555
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:52,719
heard your name called out and you got

2556
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:54,560
got up went over and answered the door

2557
01:26:52,719 --> 01:26:56,560
to see who was there didn't you

2558
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:58,800
i says yeah as a matter of fact i did

2559
01:26:56,560 --> 01:27:00,159
and i've told that to a few people too

2560
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:01,440
but i was getting intrigued with how he

2561
01:27:00,158 --> 01:27:03,198
would know this

2562
01:27:01,439 --> 01:27:04,960
and then he says well after you looked

2563
01:27:03,198 --> 01:27:06,319
up and down the hall then it occurred to

2564
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:07,679
you that somebody might be trying to

2565
01:27:06,319 --> 01:27:09,119
send you something and you lay down on

2566
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:11,679
the bed and listen to the thoughts that

2567
01:27:09,119 --> 01:27:14,079
came in and those next thoughts told you

2568
01:27:11,679 --> 01:27:15,840
to study here learn what you can but

2569
01:27:14,079 --> 01:27:16,960
don't get involved in the situation and

2570
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:19,039
move on

2571
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:21,279
i says yeah i never told anybody that

2572
01:27:19,039 --> 01:27:22,639
really but you didn't listen instead you

2573
01:27:21,279 --> 01:27:24,399
got involved and stayed there anyway

2574
01:27:22,639 --> 01:27:26,800
didn't you i said yeah

2575
01:27:24,399 --> 01:27:28,399
he says i was on board a craft over the

2576
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:29,760
top of the house that night when the

2577
01:27:28,399 --> 01:27:31,759
pleiadians were sending you that

2578
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:34,239
information i've been having contacts

2579
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:36,079
with them for 29 years and they told me

2580
01:27:34,238 --> 01:27:38,000
in six years they would start contacts

2581
01:27:36,079 --> 01:27:39,679
in america to continue the processes

2582
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,119
they started in switzerland and when

2583
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:42,719
they were going to do that that you

2584
01:27:41,119 --> 01:27:45,119
would be the person that i have contact

2585
01:27:42,719 --> 01:27:47,439
with so about that time my mind was kind

2586
01:27:45,119 --> 01:27:48,719
of you know getting a little unraveled

2587
01:27:47,439 --> 01:27:50,079
the first thought that hit me was if

2588
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:51,359
someone's been reading my thoughts and

2589
01:27:50,079 --> 01:27:52,800
putting them in there for all these

2590
01:27:51,359 --> 01:27:54,158
years

2591
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:57,279
that they still wanted to talk to me

2592
01:27:54,158 --> 01:27:57,279
that kind of amazed me so

2593
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:01,119
we usually try to keep most of our

2594
01:27:59,359 --> 01:28:03,039
thoughts you know to ourselves so but

2595
01:28:01,119 --> 01:28:04,880
any rate he says i know you're going to

2596
01:28:03,039 --> 01:28:06,800
want some validation of this and some

2597
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:08,400
proof uh art whenever you're ready you

2598
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:10,560
could start the hiate camera and just

2599
01:28:08,399 --> 01:28:12,638
kind of let it roll

2600
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:13,679
as validation what he was talking about

2601
01:28:12,639 --> 01:28:15,440
he says

2602
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:17,039
my contacts have been going on for about

2603
01:28:15,439 --> 01:28:19,039
29 years but they're quite different

2604
01:28:17,039 --> 01:28:21,198
than the meyer situation

2605
01:28:19,039 --> 01:28:24,719
meyer was chosen as a contact person at

2606
01:28:21,198 --> 01:28:26,960
birth he says i was not he says i am a

2607
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:29,359
pleiadian soul transfer there are about

2608
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:30,880
20 of us on the planet by the way this

2609
01:28:29,359 --> 01:28:33,119
i'm going to let this tape run it's a

2610
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:35,359
tape i made down at his house

2611
01:28:33,119 --> 01:28:37,039
this is where he lives he has a photo

2612
01:28:35,359 --> 01:28:38,000
book of pictures he's been shooting for

2613
01:28:37,039 --> 01:28:40,238
years

2614
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:42,319
uh and you'll see a lot of similarity in

2615
01:28:40,238 --> 01:28:44,879
the craft

2616
01:28:42,319 --> 01:28:46,559
this is one of the remote disks here

2617
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:48,800
he says that he hangs out with him

2618
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:51,039
because he's family he has no interest

2619
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:52,800
in being a contact person but they had

2620
01:28:51,039 --> 01:28:54,960
asked him to do it to start getting new

2621
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:57,360
information and new photos out into the

2622
01:28:54,960 --> 01:29:00,639
general public this is by the way is one

2623
01:28:57,359 --> 01:29:02,158
of the kind of pie pan remote discs

2624
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:04,400
it's very similar to the one that

2625
01:29:02,158 --> 01:29:06,079
wendell just showed you over myers home

2626
01:29:04,399 --> 01:29:07,920
he says those are very common down over

2627
01:29:06,079 --> 01:29:10,800
mexico city that they have quite a few

2628
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:14,079
of them stationed down there this is a

2629
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:16,400
beam ship type one of those 21 footers

2630
01:29:14,079 --> 01:29:18,800
has the little antenna on it it's 21

2631
01:29:16,399 --> 01:29:21,359
feet in diameter and carry three people

2632
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:23,360
has interdimensional capabilities this

2633
01:29:21,359 --> 01:29:25,359
craft this picture was taken from inside

2634
01:29:23,359 --> 01:29:26,880
a craft if you look at it for a second

2635
01:29:25,359 --> 01:29:28,960
you'll notice that you're in the clouds

2636
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:30,719
kind of looking down at it this one we

2637
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:32,239
have the original negative on it and

2638
01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:35,039
it's just been analyzed and given a

2639
01:29:32,238 --> 01:29:36,638
pretty good clean bill of health

2640
01:29:35,039 --> 01:29:38,800
this one is taken through his screen

2641
01:29:36,639 --> 01:29:40,880
door he has a very busy patio he lives

2642
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:42,960
in miami in the middle of the city

2643
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:45,520
and on his patio most of these pictures

2644
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:47,198
are taken and he has a large screen door

2645
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:49,199
there and this one he took very quickly

2646
01:29:47,198 --> 01:29:50,960
through the screen

2647
01:29:49,198 --> 01:29:52,879
here he's in the craft again and you can

2648
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:54,399
see the craft now look at the top left

2649
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:57,199
it's probably hard to see but there's a

2650
01:29:54,399 --> 01:29:59,279
green line up there that's a mother ship

2651
01:29:57,198 --> 01:30:01,119
what we would call a mother ship it's

2652
01:29:59,279 --> 01:30:03,198
the first time we've seen anything

2653
01:30:01,119 --> 01:30:05,679
cylinder in reference to the pleiadian

2654
01:30:03,198 --> 01:30:07,599
case and it's green and has kind of a

2655
01:30:05,679 --> 01:30:09,119
bright red flare right around the middle

2656
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:10,480
of it somehow

2657
01:30:09,119 --> 01:30:13,279
this one's a little hard to see it's

2658
01:30:10,479 --> 01:30:15,439
just several discs over some tree tops

2659
01:30:13,279 --> 01:30:17,519
i asked him why his

2660
01:30:15,439 --> 01:30:19,599
what was what were the pleiadians going

2661
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:21,280
to try to make known through him they

2662
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:22,800
told me that they wanted to continue the

2663
01:30:21,279 --> 01:30:23,759
situation that they had started with

2664
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:25,679
meyer

2665
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:27,280
wendell showed you an overhead picture

2666
01:30:25,679 --> 01:30:29,119
this is the one that he was making

2667
01:30:27,279 --> 01:30:30,639
reference to he takes most of these

2668
01:30:29,119 --> 01:30:31,840
pictures with a polaroid now look at the

2669
01:30:30,639 --> 01:30:32,880
clouds right through the whole of the

2670
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:34,719
craft

2671
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:36,639
when he took the picture it took a 30th

2672
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:38,880
of a second to take it the craft was

2673
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:41,440
disappearing dematerializing as he took

2674
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:43,359
the picture and during the shot it was

2675
01:30:41,439 --> 01:30:45,599
in the kind of in various stages of

2676
01:30:43,359 --> 01:30:47,198
being invisible and you can see the

2677
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:49,440
clouds right through it

2678
01:30:47,198 --> 01:30:50,960
when he's on board the craft he says you

2679
01:30:49,439 --> 01:30:53,839
you can't tell anything when this is

2680
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:54,960
happening they power up the field around

2681
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:57,520
the craft

2682
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:59,359
and by so doing it distorts reflected

2683
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:01,280
light the craft could be floating right

2684
01:30:59,359 --> 01:31:02,719
over your head and your eyes cannot see

2685
01:31:01,279 --> 01:31:04,960
it and they can be sitting there

2686
01:31:02,719 --> 01:31:07,279
checking you out

2687
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:09,439
these next two or three shots uh are at

2688
01:31:07,279 --> 01:31:11,759
night i had asked him after i met him if

2689
01:31:09,439 --> 01:31:14,479
he could get some video for us

2690
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:15,520
and he did he obliged we got him a video

2691
01:31:14,479 --> 01:31:17,198
camera

2692
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:19,040
the ones you're looking at right now

2693
01:31:17,198 --> 01:31:21,119
these are still shots he took some

2694
01:31:19,039 --> 01:31:22,800
polaroids at the same time i'm going to

2695
01:31:21,119 --> 01:31:25,599
let this run just here for a few minutes

2696
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:28,639
while i explain things to you

2697
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:28,639
i asked him about

2698
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:31,440
notice this polaroid here because a

2699
01:31:30,158 --> 01:31:32,799
little later there's a video of this

2700
01:31:31,439 --> 01:31:34,638
same action and you'll kind of want to

2701
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:36,320
remember this shot

2702
01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:39,440
audreyanne told me that there was a very

2703
01:31:36,319 --> 01:31:41,439
unusual situation going on here on earth

2704
01:31:39,439 --> 01:31:42,960
that years ago in connection with what

2705
01:31:41,439 --> 01:31:45,919
wendell was telling you about in the

2706
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:49,760
late 20s and 30s that there were several

2707
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:51,920
old spirits born into the german plain

2708
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:54,079
that were of lyrian descent who were far

2709
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:55,920
older than most the others because of

2710
01:31:54,079 --> 01:31:57,600
their vast knowledge their spiritual

2711
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:59,440
knowledge from previous lives it was a

2712
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:01,760
fairly easy matter for them to get onto

2713
01:31:59,439 --> 01:32:04,399
the idea of building these discs with

2714
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:06,320
very little help they were able to do it

2715
01:32:04,399 --> 01:32:07,839
they had this flying he said in the

2716
01:32:06,319 --> 01:32:09,519
early 30s

2717
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:11,600
they weren't flying very well but they

2718
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:13,360
were also making connection with the ets

2719
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:15,920
who were watching them

2720
01:32:13,359 --> 01:32:17,759
by the time world war ii came along

2721
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:19,679
the pleiadians and other races saw what

2722
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:21,840
was happening in the german situation

2723
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:23,760
and did not want the technology involved

2724
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:25,279
in world war ii to throw the balance of

2725
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:27,760
power out

2726
01:32:25,279 --> 01:32:29,519
so they invited several german families

2727
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:31,119
italian families and english families

2728
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:33,760
who were involved in the development of

2729
01:32:31,119 --> 01:32:35,198
this technology to leave that situation

2730
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:36,000
and bring their families and kids with

2731
01:32:35,198 --> 01:32:38,319
them

2732
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,560
well they brought them to a station that

2733
01:32:38,319 --> 01:32:42,880
audrey calls the space city

2734
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:44,800
down in south america somewhere by the

2735
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:46,400
way that's the ground the morning after

2736
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:49,039
the craft was there where the grounds

2737
01:32:46,399 --> 01:32:49,039
all burnt up

2738
01:32:49,359 --> 01:32:52,960
they brought these people down to south

2739
01:32:51,439 --> 01:32:54,158
america once they had them down there

2740
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:56,000
they weren't too sure what to do with

2741
01:32:54,158 --> 01:32:59,039
them they had a couple hundred of them

2742
01:32:56,000 --> 01:33:01,198
so they offered to educate them and

2743
01:32:59,039 --> 01:33:03,279
seize the opportunity to start educating

2744
01:33:01,198 --> 01:33:06,158
from people from earth

2745
01:33:03,279 --> 01:33:08,238
about what life is like on other planets

2746
01:33:06,158 --> 01:33:10,238
audreyne told me that he frequently goes

2747
01:33:08,238 --> 01:33:12,479
back to the home planets he's shown me

2748
01:33:10,238 --> 01:33:14,399
pictures of the home planets he's shown

2749
01:33:12,479 --> 01:33:15,759
me pictures of the space city in south

2750
01:33:14,399 --> 01:33:17,039
america which we're trying to get some

2751
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:18,320
copies of

2752
01:33:17,039 --> 01:33:21,039
and he tells me that there are

2753
01:33:18,319 --> 01:33:22,880
communities now on a pleiadian world

2754
01:33:21,039 --> 01:33:25,039
with earth people living there with

2755
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:26,719
their families learning and studying

2756
01:33:25,039 --> 01:33:28,880
from them he believes there's

2757
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:31,198
approximately a 20-year program going on

2758
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:34,000
where these people may start returning

2759
01:33:31,198 --> 01:33:35,759
to help out the situation here on earth

2760
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,760
he feels that it's his mission he's

2761
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:39,760
taking it on personally to start finding

2762
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:41,199
other people that might wanting to start

2763
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:43,280
coming connection with the pleiadians

2764
01:33:41,198 --> 01:33:45,439
themselves and he's teaching his own

2765
01:33:43,279 --> 01:33:47,759
method of meditation and helping people

2766
01:33:45,439 --> 01:33:49,279
find their own mantras this is audrey

2767
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:51,280
and if you look closely at the bottom of

2768
01:33:49,279 --> 01:33:53,279
the picture this is last thanksgiving

2769
01:33:51,279 --> 01:33:55,198
day a year ago in 94

2770
01:33:53,279 --> 01:33:56,639
these are his pleiadian parents coming

2771
01:33:55,198 --> 01:33:58,479
to pick him up

2772
01:33:56,639 --> 01:33:59,920
his girlfriend is with him and is taking

2773
01:33:58,479 --> 01:34:01,359
the picture

2774
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:02,800
if you look at the top you can see the

2775
01:34:01,359 --> 01:34:04,880
craft coming in

2776
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:06,400
there's also four or five other craft in

2777
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:08,639
the area in the background it's a little

2778
01:34:06,399 --> 01:34:10,238
hard to see i know in the dark

2779
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:12,319
they picked him up and picked up his

2780
01:34:10,238 --> 01:34:13,439
girlfriend she gets to go on all the

2781
01:34:12,319 --> 01:34:14,479

poppy never got to go anywhere but she

2785
01:34:18,399 --> 01:34:21,439
gets to go along she takes most of the

2786
01:34:20,079 --> 01:34:23,279
pictures

2787
01:34:21,439 --> 01:34:24,158
they hung out for that afternoon she

2788
01:34:23,279 --> 01:34:25,759
said

2789
01:34:24,158 --> 01:34:27,519
i asked her if she'd been on other trips

2790
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:28,960
with him he says oh yeah i get to go all

2791
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:30,639
the time he says i don't ask many

2792
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:33,279
questions i just sit in the craft and be

2793
01:34:30,639 --> 01:34:34,560
quiet but she takes most of the photos

2794
01:34:33,279 --> 01:34:36,479
this is a little hard to see there's

2795
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:38,639
four or five discs over his apartment

2796
01:34:36,479 --> 01:34:41,519
building there and i can't see them from

2797
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:43,039
over here but now check these are six

2798
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:45,679
discs that are just beginning to

2799
01:34:43,039 --> 01:34:47,359
materialize this is off his patio it's a

2800
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:49,920
common thing for him to stand on the

2801
01:34:47,359 --> 01:34:52,000
patio which you'll see next

2802
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:54,079
take notes they send him telepathic

2803
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:58,238
information here he is standing on the

2804
01:34:54,079 --> 01:34:59,920
patio notice the disc in formation

2805
01:34:58,238 --> 01:35:01,599
now he didn't even notice they were

2806
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:03,440
there his girlfriend grabbed the picture

2807
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:05,039
while he's taking his notes down in the

2808
01:35:03,439 --> 01:35:07,759
very next picture

2809
01:35:05,039 --> 01:35:09,600
a helicopter flies in see the helicopter

2810
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:12,000
flies over the apartment buildings now

2811
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:13,920
look at the first three discs as they

2812
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:16,158
see the helicopter they begin to power

2813
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:18,158
up the field and dematerialize and the

2814
01:35:16,158 --> 01:35:20,719
camera caught him just in various stages

2815
01:35:18,158 --> 01:35:22,319
there of dematerializing

2816
01:35:20,719 --> 01:35:24,158
art is there any chance we could hit the

2817
01:35:22,319 --> 01:35:27,118
rewind and kind of let him see that last

2818
01:35:24,158 --> 01:35:27,118
30 seconds again

2819
01:35:27,359 --> 01:35:31,759
this is his spot out on the patio okay

2820
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,520
you can let go anywhere in there

2821
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:35,039
he spends a lot of time on the patio he

2822
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:36,560
says they talk to him all the time in

2823
01:35:35,039 --> 01:35:39,118
his head and he writes down all of his

2824
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:41,199
notes the he doesn't hear a voice he

2825
01:35:39,118 --> 01:35:43,279
gets a stream of visions like watching a

2826
01:35:41,198 --> 01:35:45,279
movie then he has to translate it and

2827
01:35:43,279 --> 01:35:47,920
then later then they come and he cleans

2828
01:35:45,279 --> 01:35:47,920
up his notes

2829
01:35:51,359 --> 01:35:56,000
now art if you don't mind doing that one

2830
01:35:53,359 --> 01:35:57,039
more time back to the same spot i want

2831
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,039
you

2832
01:35:57,039 --> 01:36:01,039
excuse me

2833
01:35:59,039 --> 01:36:03,039
okay i don't know how good it pauses but

2834
01:36:01,039 --> 01:36:04,319
i wanted to stop on that one if i can

2835
01:36:03,039 --> 01:36:06,719
okay good

2836
01:36:04,319 --> 01:36:08,319
now take a close look at this picture

2837
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:12,319
wendell just showed you some discs that

2838
01:36:08,319 --> 01:36:14,319
look almost exactly like that didn't he

2839
01:36:12,319 --> 01:36:16,399
the original what's called veril

2840
01:36:14,319 --> 01:36:18,559
levitation design that was designed by

2841
01:36:16,399 --> 01:36:21,039
these germans back in the 30s

2842
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:23,840
what you're looking at are nine vril

2843
01:36:21,039 --> 01:36:25,039
craft made in south america by earth

2844
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:29,760
people who are learning from the

2845
01:36:25,039 --> 01:36:31,760
pleiadians these are not pleiadian craft

2846
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:35,039
the next picture with the helicopter is

2847
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:37,119
also made here in south america

2848
01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:39,439
he has been to the space city and when

2849
01:36:37,118 --> 01:36:41,679
he will let me have them he has a nice

2850
01:36:39,439 --> 01:36:44,000
group of beautiful photos walking around

2851
01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:45,359
down there with discs everywhere

2852
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,800
when he got down there he had his

2853
01:36:45,359 --> 01:36:48,000
polaroid with him and they told him they

2854
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:49,679
were going to be there for a while and

2855
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:51,118
let him hang out

2856
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:52,800
he got out of the craft with his

2857
01:36:51,118 --> 01:36:54,238
polaroid and turned around he was very

2858
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:56,000
surprised because he had not been there

2859
01:36:54,238 --> 01:36:58,319
before but he said it looked like an

2860
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:00,319
airport there were rows of discs sitting

2861
01:36:58,319 --> 01:37:02,479
on the ground parked all over the place

2862
01:37:00,319 --> 01:37:04,238
they are zeta disk the zetas are down

2863
01:37:02,479 --> 01:37:06,559
there there are pleiadian very large

2864
01:37:04,238 --> 01:37:08,879
pleiadian disk there's a whole score of

2865
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:11,199
german vrilcraft even some old hanabus

2866
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:12,960
down there and pretty much all the craft

2867
01:37:11,198 --> 01:37:14,638
that we've seen throughout the meyer

2868
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:16,639
case are all parked down there also

2869
01:37:14,639 --> 01:37:18,319
there was about a hundred of them in his

2870
01:37:16,639 --> 01:37:21,760
photo book if he'll let me have them

2871
01:37:18,319 --> 01:37:23,279
which i'll i'll get them yet

2872
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:24,800
they're sitting right on the ground with

2873
01:37:23,279 --> 01:37:27,198
people working on them what he's

2874
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:28,960
concerned about is he says that

2875
01:37:27,198 --> 01:37:31,359
when people begin to find out that a

2876
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:33,198
select group of people from europe

2877
01:37:31,359 --> 01:37:35,839
have had some extra privileges over the

2878
01:37:33,198 --> 01:37:38,079
last 30 40 years they've gone to other

2879
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:39,920
worlds they've had children on other

2880
01:37:38,079 --> 01:37:41,600
worlds they no longer speak german

2881
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:43,440
italian or english they've learned on a

2882
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:45,280
pleiadian world and now they're coming

2883
01:37:43,439 --> 01:37:47,118
back here to help their own planet

2884
01:37:45,279 --> 01:37:49,039
they're having contacts with people all

2885
01:37:47,118 --> 01:37:50,719
over the planet sometimes they say

2886
01:37:49,039 --> 01:37:52,719
they're from the pleiades sometimes they

2887
01:37:50,719 --> 01:37:54,319
say from andromeda sometimes they say

2888
01:37:52,719 --> 01:37:55,920
they're from orion but it's all pretty

2889
01:37:54,319 --> 01:37:57,759
much coming from the same source i

2890
01:37:55,920 --> 01:38:00,000
believe they're trying to help people

2891
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:02,239
out all over the planet by raising our

2892
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,679
consciousness they are very aware that

2893
01:38:02,238 --> 01:38:06,158
in the near future we have some very

2894
01:38:03,679 --> 01:38:07,840
difficult times ahead of us they feel if

2895
01:38:06,158 --> 01:38:10,000
they were to come out and say our

2896
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:12,079
parents were germans that no one's going

2897
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:13,840
to pay much attention and the huge

2898
01:38:12,079 --> 01:38:15,198
amount of prejudice and hate we still

2899
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:17,279
have on the planet would distort

2900
01:38:15,198 --> 01:38:18,799
anything that we might learn from them i

2901
01:38:17,279 --> 01:38:20,800
think more and more we're going to find

2902
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:22,719
out in the near future contacts all over

2903
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:24,400
the planet the crafts are starting to

2904
01:38:22,719 --> 01:38:26,639
look the same the message is starting to

2905
01:38:24,399 --> 01:38:28,719
be the same ladies and gentlemen there's

2906
01:38:26,639 --> 01:38:30,880
over a hundred thousand people right now

2907
01:38:28,719 --> 01:38:33,198
from earth and their descendants living

2908
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:34,560
on pleiadian planets learning

2909
01:38:33,198 --> 01:38:36,079
these were the people that are starting

2910
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:37,520
to come back here over the next few

2911
01:38:36,079 --> 01:38:38,800
years that are probably going to make a

2912
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:40,400
major difference in the way our

2913
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:44,279
civilization goes

2914
01:38:40,399 --> 01:38:44,279
okay let her go

2915
01:38:45,439 --> 01:38:50,238
if you watch this one closely as the

2916
01:38:47,039 --> 01:38:52,079
camera goes by uh two pictures down

2917
01:38:50,238 --> 01:38:54,238
you'll see one of those honey boos that

2918
01:38:52,079 --> 01:38:56,000
uh wendell was talking about that was

2919
01:38:54,238 --> 01:38:59,039
just taken a few months ago we thought

2920
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:00,319
they were extinct but they're not

2921
01:38:59,039 --> 01:39:02,079
right at the bottom

2922
01:39:00,319 --> 01:39:05,679
see them

2923
01:39:02,079 --> 01:39:05,679
you want to try it one more time art

2924
01:39:07,039 --> 01:39:12,479
if it has a you can freeze there

2925
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:14,560
well looking at the bottom right

2926
01:39:12,479 --> 01:39:15,759
we'll try it one more time

2927
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:16,560
wham

2928
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:18,639
okay

2929
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:22,000
that's a german honeyboo parked at the

2930
01:39:18,639 --> 01:39:23,679
space city that's about 30 40 years old

2931
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:26,158
they built them to last and you can see

2932
01:39:23,679 --> 01:39:28,480
two men servicing them there he has

2933
01:39:26,158 --> 01:39:30,158
probably 30 40 pictures in this caliber

2934
01:39:28,479 --> 01:39:32,079
walking around down at the space city of

2935
01:39:30,158 --> 01:39:34,479
all different types of craft

2936
01:39:32,079 --> 01:39:35,920
so there is a serious connection going

2937
01:39:34,479 --> 01:39:38,319
on between different people on our

2938
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:41,800
planet and the extraterrestrials okay

2939
01:39:38,319 --> 01:39:41,799
art let her go

2940
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:47,600
adriane has a

2941
01:39:45,439 --> 01:39:50,079
special study group that he's starting

2942
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:51,760
now uh he feels that

2943
01:39:50,079 --> 01:39:53,519
the way that he could possibly be a

2944
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:55,600
benefit here was to find certain people

2945
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:57,760
that he thinks are ready

2946
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:59,360
and guide them through meditation in

2947
01:39:57,760 --> 01:40:00,800
their own awareness

2948
01:39:59,359 --> 01:40:01,920
and help them find themselves

2949
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:03,600
spiritually

2950
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:05,199
apparently the people that are most of

2951
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:06,719
the people anyway that are making the

2952
01:40:05,198 --> 01:40:08,638
connections with them

2953
01:40:06,719 --> 01:40:10,880
are people that through meditation learn

2954
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:12,880
to get into a balanced state

2955
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:14,880
with clear thought so they can receive

2956
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:15,920
information from them this is another

2957
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:18,880
shot where the craft is just

2958
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:18,880
dematerializing

2959
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:24,000
fortunately shot a lot of these they're

2960
01:40:21,279 --> 01:40:25,920
polaroids with a little cheap 1995 sure

2961
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:27,840
shock camera it's got a 30th of a second

2962
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:29,440
plastic lens on it

2963
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:31,360
just like in the meyer case we have a

2964
01:40:29,439 --> 01:40:32,479
man here getting the shots of a lifetime

2965
01:40:31,359 --> 01:40:35,039
and he's taking them with a very

2966
01:40:32,479 --> 01:40:38,319
inexpensive camera we've purchased him a

2967
01:40:35,039 --> 01:40:40,158
new 35 millimeter zoom auto focus auto

2968
01:40:38,319 --> 01:40:41,840
wine and a case of film

2969
01:40:40,158 --> 01:40:43,759
so hopefully he will start getting some

2970
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:45,279
more and just recently yesterday i had

2971
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:48,400
someone volunteered to buy him one of

2972
01:40:45,279 --> 01:40:50,399
those new 4 000 triple chip panasonic's

2973
01:40:48,399 --> 01:40:52,000
to take some stuff so i think our

2974
01:40:50,399 --> 01:40:52,960
quality of our pictures will increase a

2975
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,960
little bit

2976
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:57,118
this next section is a little slow it's

2977
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:59,198
a night video

2978
01:40:57,118 --> 01:41:00,719
and if you know where the fast forward

2979
01:40:59,198 --> 01:41:02,960
is art fast forward for about two

2980
01:41:00,719 --> 01:41:04,800
minutes and it'll move on down i'd ask

2981
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:05,679
him to get some video for us so we could

2982
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:09,199
see it

2983
01:41:05,679 --> 01:41:10,639
and he obliged as uh audreyn's situation

2984
01:41:09,198 --> 01:41:12,960
is a little different than the meyer

2985
01:41:10,639 --> 01:41:14,960
situation when meyer's contact started

2986
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:17,118
it was like going to school they came by

2987
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:19,039
almost on a weekly basis and it was

2988
01:41:17,118 --> 01:41:20,960
almost a classroom situation where he

2989
01:41:19,039 --> 01:41:22,719
would ask questions they would give

2990
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:24,319
answers they would teach him things

2991
01:41:22,719 --> 01:41:26,399
about history philosophy and

2992
01:41:24,319 --> 01:41:28,799
spirituality that they wanted to

2993
01:41:26,399 --> 01:41:30,638
audriane's situation is quite different

2994
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:32,560
he never knows when they're coming by

2995
01:41:30,639 --> 01:41:34,079
they treat him like a lost relative when

2996
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:36,159
they do come by they pick him up tell

2997
01:41:34,079 --> 01:41:38,158
him to be quiet they got things to do he

2998
01:41:36,158 --> 01:41:41,198
hangs out with him for a day or two he

2999
01:41:38,158 --> 01:41:42,479
can't usually ask for any favors uh and

3000
01:41:41,198 --> 01:41:43,839
even for the summer they told him

3001
01:41:42,479 --> 01:41:45,198
they're kind of busy and they just left

3002
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:46,639
him alone he wasn't even sure when they

3003
01:41:45,198 --> 01:41:48,399
were coming back

3004
01:41:46,639 --> 01:41:49,920
so we have a little different situation

3005
01:41:48,399 --> 01:41:51,839
going here we're never sure exactly

3006
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:54,800
what's happening when i asked him to get

3007
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:57,039
some video he says all right i'll try

3008
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:58,960
and he got the camera and he went out at

3009
01:41:57,039 --> 01:42:00,880
night to take the video this video by

3010
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:02,158
the way is just south of miami on the

3011
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:03,679
beach

3012
01:42:02,158 --> 01:42:05,118
he was directed for him and his

3013
01:42:03,679 --> 01:42:06,639
girlfriend to go down there which they

3014
01:42:05,118 --> 01:42:08,319
did

3015
01:42:06,639 --> 01:42:09,679
first there was just one craft until

3016
01:42:08,319 --> 01:42:12,479
they parked the car and got their

3017
01:42:09,679 --> 01:42:13,840
bearings and set out then two came in

3018
01:42:12,479 --> 01:42:14,959
and our you can fast forward a little

3019
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:17,279
bit more and then we'll get a little

3020
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:19,600
group thing going here

3021
01:42:17,279 --> 01:42:21,840
okay now we're pretty good

3022
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:24,320
this is similar to some of the shots

3023
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:25,920
we've also seen down in mexico city in

3024
01:42:24,319 --> 01:42:27,920
that area down there there's quite a bit

3025
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:29,679
of shots being seen at night with groups

3026
01:42:27,920 --> 01:42:31,359
of them coming and making formations

3027
01:42:29,679 --> 01:42:32,880
like this

3028
01:42:31,359 --> 01:42:36,000
he actually ran the camera here for

3029
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:37,440
about 15 minutes so

3030
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,880
that's why we're fast forwarding a

3031
01:42:37,439 --> 01:42:40,479
little bit

3032
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:42,639
besides it gets a little more exciting

3033
01:42:40,479 --> 01:42:45,359
here in a minute

3034
01:42:42,639 --> 01:42:46,960
okay art roll it on forward a little bit

3035
01:42:45,359 --> 01:42:48,799
you can take it down to where the screen

3036
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:53,079
will suddenly kind of go bright red

3037
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:53,079
should be about another minute or so

3038
01:42:56,639 --> 01:43:01,118
we've put together a collection of most

3039
01:42:59,279 --> 01:43:03,759
all of these pictures quite a few more

3040
01:43:01,118 --> 01:43:06,000
that aren't on here today too have a new

3041
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:08,159
video tape called the miami contacts and

3042
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:09,679
it'll be out next week

3043
01:43:08,158 --> 01:43:11,039
i have a table somewhere over here on

3044
01:43:09,679 --> 01:43:12,800
the exhibit room i haven't been to see

3045
01:43:11,039 --> 01:43:14,639
it yet but we'll have some forms there

3046
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:16,239
for anybody that wants to get it

3047
01:43:14,639 --> 01:43:17,840
all these pictures and quite a few more

3048
01:43:16,238 --> 01:43:19,439
will be on there

3049
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:21,920
and

3050
01:43:19,439 --> 01:43:23,118
yeah i've prepared a tape tomorrow night

3051
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:25,279
which we'll have quite a bit more on

3052
01:43:23,118 --> 01:43:26,559
there too so um

3053
01:43:25,279 --> 01:43:29,118
you can see that i'm not sure what time

3054
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:32,320
it's showing but some eight o'clock okay

3055
01:43:29,118 --> 01:43:32,319
i'm showing it at eight o'clock

3056
01:43:32,479 --> 01:43:36,399
okay here we go

3057
01:43:34,238 --> 01:43:38,638
uh coming up right after this there's

3058
01:43:36,399 --> 01:43:40,000
two sections here where the uh

3059
01:43:38,639 --> 01:43:41,679
with the three of them and then right

3060
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:44,319
after that there's a pretty interesting

3061
01:43:41,679 --> 01:43:46,719
daytime shot

3062
01:43:44,319 --> 01:43:48,880
most of his contacts um since he's quite

3063
01:43:46,719 --> 01:43:50,158
telepathic he says they they get in

3064
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:51,840
touch with him and let him know they're

3065
01:43:50,158 --> 01:43:54,638
around and since he lives in a

3066
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:56,880
centralized area in miami it's common

3067
01:43:54,639 --> 01:43:58,719
for them to stay cloaked and they just

3068
01:43:56,880 --> 01:44:00,079
communicate with him then occasionally

3069
01:43:58,719 --> 01:44:02,399
they'll let him know they're outside if

3070
01:44:00,079 --> 01:44:04,158
he wants to get a picture

3071
01:44:02,399 --> 01:44:05,519
and on this particular occasion coming

3072
01:44:04,158 --> 01:44:06,559
up out here he was actually in the

3073
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:07,280
shower

3074
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:09,360
and

3075
01:44:07,279 --> 01:44:11,519
they told him they were outside and if

3076
01:44:09,359 --> 01:44:13,198
he wanted to get some video he could so

3077
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:15,040
he grabbed his camera ran in the living

3078
01:44:13,198 --> 01:44:17,279
room and you'll see here in a second the

3079
01:44:15,039 --> 01:44:18,800
craft's outside and he's taking the

3080
01:44:17,279 --> 01:44:20,158
picture through the screen because he

3081
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:22,000
just noticed that outside there's a

3082
01:44:20,158 --> 01:44:23,920
bunch of people playing golf

3083
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:25,760
and he doesn't have any clothes on so

3084
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:28,480
he's telling them to hang on for a

3085
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:30,400
minute while he gets some pants on and

3086
01:44:28,479 --> 01:44:32,000
that's why the camera's jumping around

3087
01:44:30,399 --> 01:44:35,839
and he doesn't want to open the screen

3088
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,840
so it's throwing the focus off

3089
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:41,040
so they came back later that night and

3090
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:43,840
he walked out on the patio and they let

3091
01:44:41,039 --> 01:44:43,840
him get a little better

3092
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:51,119
shot now you'll remember from the

3093
01:44:49,118 --> 01:44:52,319
earlier shots there's a water right in

3094
01:44:51,118 --> 01:44:54,319
front and those are the apartment

3095
01:44:52,319 --> 01:44:56,000
buildings i'd say those are a good

3096
01:44:54,319 --> 01:45:00,039
quarter mile away on the other side of

3097
01:44:56,000 --> 01:45:00,039
the park over there in those buildings

3098
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:10,239
yeah it's um

3099
01:45:08,639 --> 01:45:12,400
you can see the lights coming out off it

3100
01:45:10,238 --> 01:45:13,359
i've got a second generation copy here

3101
01:45:12,399 --> 01:45:14,879
so

3102
01:45:13,359 --> 01:45:17,039
i had to inform him that we like

3103
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:19,118
originals he was

3104
01:45:17,039 --> 01:45:21,359
he was concerned about tape costs so he

3105
01:45:19,118 --> 01:45:22,880
took his original copy lower to a vhs

3106
01:45:21,359 --> 01:45:24,960
and then redid the original because he

3107
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:26,560
only had one tape cassette

3108
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:28,880
so i've had to educate him a little bit

3109
01:45:26,560 --> 01:45:30,159
about saving all those originals this is

3110
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:32,480
that

3111
01:45:30,158 --> 01:45:34,319
craft up in the clouds again

3112
01:45:32,479 --> 01:45:36,559
uh you can see the antenna coming out

3113
01:45:34,319 --> 01:45:38,158
the top up there this is by the way one

3114
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:39,679
of the ones we have the original

3115
01:45:38,158 --> 01:45:41,118
negative on we've got them now on

3116
01:45:39,679 --> 01:45:43,118
several of the pictures and i'm just

3117
01:45:41,118 --> 01:45:46,799
beginning to get them analyzed by some

3118
01:45:43,118 --> 01:45:48,479
independent uh steady imaging people and

3119
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:50,719
so far they've given this shot anyway a

3120
01:45:48,479 --> 01:45:52,319
real clean bill of health

3121
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:52,960
they couldn't find anything wrong with

3122
01:45:52,319 --> 01:45:54,399
it

3123
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:56,639
everything matches up there's no

3124
01:45:54,399 --> 01:45:58,399
tampering with the film

3125
01:45:56,639 --> 01:45:59,760
he doesn't have too many negatives most

3126
01:45:58,399 --> 01:46:01,679
of these pictures unfortunately were

3127
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:03,520
polaroids with a rubber band around him

3128
01:46:01,679 --> 01:46:04,960
and his dresser

3129
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:06,239
he didn't really expect to ever show

3130
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:08,319
them to anyone

3131
01:46:06,238 --> 01:46:09,519
this one's most unusual there's a shadow

3132
01:46:08,319 --> 01:46:11,840
on the ground

3133
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:13,920
he got a telepathic message looked

3134
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:15,920
outside expecting his pleiadian friends

3135
01:46:13,920 --> 01:46:18,000
and there was a life form out there in

3136
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:20,319
some sort of environment suit he went

3137
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:22,158
outside with his camera and the bean

3138
01:46:20,319 --> 01:46:24,158
forced his hands down to the ground and

3139
01:46:22,158 --> 01:46:25,759
made him take a picture of the shadow

3140
01:46:24,158 --> 01:46:27,759
and then as he raised his arms back up

3141
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:30,079
to talk to the bean he vanished right in

3142
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:32,880
front of him he doesn't have any clue at

3143
01:46:30,079 --> 01:46:34,880
all where the life form came from

3144
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:36,880
now here's a couple of shots on the

3145
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:38,960
patio again he's lowered the camera down

3146
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:40,639
you can see the disc there and

3147
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:42,000
through the bars on the patio trying to

3148
01:46:40,639 --> 01:46:44,560
get something in the foreground so you

3149
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,560
can see them

3150
01:46:48,238 --> 01:46:51,919
now look on the far left just barely in

3151
01:46:50,319 --> 01:46:53,679
there that's one of the german honda

3152
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:55,679
booths from the space city that's a 40

3153
01:46:53,679 --> 01:46:58,880
year old craft and the three on the

3154
01:46:55,679 --> 01:47:00,800
right are crafts made in space city down

3155
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:02,880
there by american people with the aid of

3156
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:04,880
the pleiadians

3157
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:06,319
they're teaching them their technology

3158
01:47:04,880 --> 01:47:08,480
they're taking them back and forth to

3159
01:47:06,319 --> 01:47:10,559
other worlds their philosophy seems to

3160
01:47:08,479 --> 01:47:12,879
be to take a small percentage of us

3161
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:14,639
educate us in matters of spirituality

3162
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:16,639
higher consciousness how to live a

3163
01:47:14,639 --> 01:47:18,400
higher quality life okay you can stop

3164
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:20,159
the tape there art

3165
01:47:18,399 --> 01:47:22,559
and you can start the vhs whenever you

3166
01:47:20,158 --> 01:47:24,399
want to

3167
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:25,679
their philosophy seems to be to educate

3168
01:47:24,399 --> 01:47:27,599
a few of us that could come back and

3169
01:47:25,679 --> 01:47:29,440
then educate the rest of us they

3170
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:31,199
realized that it would be rather futile

3171
01:47:29,439 --> 01:47:34,319
to try to make a landing on the white

3172
01:47:31,198 --> 01:47:36,559
house lawn or to take over the planet

3173
01:47:34,319 --> 01:47:38,559
watch right here see it disappearing

3174
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:40,320
this is that craft you saw at night and

3175
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:42,400
it's a frame by frame shot of it

3176
01:47:40,319 --> 01:47:45,439
disappearing this is how they power the

3177
01:47:42,399 --> 01:47:47,198
field up and how it disappears

3178
01:47:45,439 --> 01:47:49,279
we're always wondering why you can't see

3179
01:47:47,198 --> 01:47:51,599
them they have that ability and there

3180
01:47:49,279 --> 01:47:53,279
we've got it on film frame by frame they

3181
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:55,039
power the craft is still setting right

3182
01:47:53,279 --> 01:47:57,519
there and you can't see it it didn't go

3183
01:47:55,039 --> 01:47:57,519
anywhere

3184
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:05,520
there's a series on here now of several

3185
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:07,360
nighttime shots he's you can see he's

3186
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:08,960
panning back to show the foreground how

3187
01:48:07,359 --> 01:48:10,719
far away that he is

3188
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:13,760
that's where he lives he's got a pretty

3189
01:48:10,719 --> 01:48:13,760
interesting patio

3190
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:18,158
i think i'm just going to go down there

3191
01:48:16,238 --> 01:48:21,519
and you know rent space on his patio for

3192
01:48:18,158 --> 01:48:21,519
a few weeks and kind of hang out

3193
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:26,560
i think maybe one more time we'll get to

3194
01:48:24,238 --> 01:48:26,559
see it

3195
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:31,280
yeah this is another one of the same one

3196
01:48:29,279 --> 01:48:33,599
i i didn't have time to edit all these

3197
01:48:31,279 --> 01:48:37,279
together properly then this talk came a

3198
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:37,280
little quicker than i'd anticipated

3199
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:42,000
i haven't found anybody else that has

3200
01:48:39,679 --> 01:48:44,158
seen these i found two other people in

3201
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:46,238
his meditation study group who've gone

3202
01:48:44,158 --> 01:48:48,879
out with him and seen the craft one of

3203
01:48:46,238 --> 01:48:50,799
the ladies just during a meditation

3204
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:53,199
asked him

3205
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:55,440
how to see the craft he gave her some

3206
01:48:53,198 --> 01:48:57,118
clues on what to meditate on and when

3207
01:48:55,439 --> 01:49:01,479
she left that night one of the craft

3208
01:48:57,118 --> 01:49:01,479
followed over her car all the way home

3209
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:05,679
i wish i knew uh you know wendell and i

3210
01:49:04,079 --> 01:49:07,760
discussed that one night wendell's

3211
01:49:05,679 --> 01:49:10,319
guessing southeast ecuador i don't have

3212
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:11,600
a guess at all and audrey doesn't know

3213
01:49:10,319 --> 01:49:13,279
and he said it really wouldn't do you

3214
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:14,960
much good if you did know there's no way

3215
01:49:13,279 --> 01:49:16,238
to get to it and with the technology

3216
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:17,279
they have they wouldn't let you in

3217
01:49:16,238 --> 01:49:19,279
anyway

3218
01:49:17,279 --> 01:49:20,880
so there are no roads to it's somewhere

3219
01:49:19,279 --> 01:49:22,158
in south america but i really don't know

3220
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:24,319
where

3221
01:49:22,158 --> 01:49:26,079
now this is some new one i got a call

3222
01:49:24,319 --> 01:49:28,559
about a week ago from him said they came

3223
01:49:26,079 --> 01:49:30,399
by again these this next series now for

3224
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:32,239
about three or four minutes was all shot

3225
01:49:30,399 --> 01:49:34,879
on october 20th

3226
01:49:32,238 --> 01:49:36,638
and again he's on his patio and he's you

3227
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:38,800
can see the telephone poles off in the

3228
01:49:36,639 --> 01:49:40,000
distance it's three or four blocks away

3229
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:41,760
right in the middle of the telephone

3230
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,800
pole here's comes the disc it'll move to

3231
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:44,320
the left

3232
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:45,760
and they're talking to him in his head

3233
01:49:44,319 --> 01:49:48,158
now telling him to get ready and they're

3234
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:49,599
giving him some instructions

3235
01:49:48,158 --> 01:49:52,079
they've asked him basically they've

3236
01:49:49,599 --> 01:49:53,679
asked him if he can leave the house

3237
01:49:52,079 --> 01:49:56,559
i asked to get if we could get some more

3238
01:49:53,679 --> 01:49:58,480
video in some area where the craft was a

3239
01:49:56,560 --> 01:50:00,080
little more obvious

3240
01:49:58,479 --> 01:50:01,759
other things to compare it to so they

3241
01:50:00,079 --> 01:50:03,198
said they would and that's what you're

3242
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:04,880
going to see next they're going to lead

3243
01:50:03,198 --> 01:50:07,359
him around town and down the freeway and

3244
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:08,719
follow him

3245
01:50:07,359 --> 01:50:10,479
again you can see the apartment

3246
01:50:08,719 --> 01:50:12,880
buildings down at the bottom here

3247
01:50:10,479 --> 01:50:16,079
now where the clock on the vcr is

3248
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:18,079
running we're 1003 on october 20th

3249
01:50:16,079 --> 01:50:20,238
and he's got the thing zoomed out about

3250
01:50:18,079 --> 01:50:22,399
as far as he can go see how far away it

3251
01:50:20,238 --> 01:50:22,399
is

3252
01:50:22,960 --> 01:50:26,000
now to fake something like these next

3253
01:50:24,479 --> 01:50:27,359
shots you'd have to have some serious

3254
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:29,279
cooperation with somebody in a

3255
01:50:27,359 --> 01:50:30,960
helicopter some sort of large

3256
01:50:29,279 --> 01:50:33,359
illuminated object that half the city

3257
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:35,679
would see

3258
01:50:33,359 --> 01:50:37,118
it's interesting that uh

3259
01:50:35,679 --> 01:50:38,960
watch this one you're going to see it

3260
01:50:37,118 --> 01:50:40,158
now for a minute or so it's flickering

3261
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:42,079
there's a light flickering off the

3262
01:50:40,158 --> 01:50:45,359
bottom of it and going around it and

3263
01:50:42,079 --> 01:50:47,198
this is very similar to video taken by

3264
01:50:45,359 --> 01:50:49,198
other people in mexico and other areas

3265
01:50:47,198 --> 01:50:51,039
i've seen video shot down in mexico and

3266
01:50:49,198 --> 01:50:52,638
probably somebody here at the congress

3267
01:50:51,039 --> 01:50:54,880
may have some that looks very similar to

3268
01:50:52,639 --> 01:50:54,880
this

3269
01:50:56,800 --> 01:51:00,880
it is my belief this is happening all

3270
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:02,880
over i think that we have one group down

3271
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:05,039
in south america that is somehow

3272
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:06,800
coordinating contacts with people all

3273
01:51:05,039 --> 01:51:08,880
over the planet

3274
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:10,639
and they are keeping them all separate

3275
01:51:08,880 --> 01:51:12,639
they're not allowing the contact person

3276
01:51:10,639 --> 01:51:14,319
to know who the other individual is

3277
01:51:12,639 --> 01:51:16,719
meyer always believed he was the only

3278
01:51:14,319 --> 01:51:18,880
one and i think he really believed that

3279
01:51:16,719 --> 01:51:20,480
it just doesn't turn out to be true

3280
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:22,560
there are people having contacts all

3281
01:51:20,479 --> 01:51:24,399
over the planet they don't tell them

3282
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:26,400
they tell them they're special they tell

3283
01:51:24,399 --> 01:51:28,079
them that they're unique in almost every

3284
01:51:26,399 --> 01:51:29,519
case too they all have been told that

3285
01:51:28,079 --> 01:51:31,599
there is some sort of spiritual

3286
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:32,800
connection through past lives which may

3287
01:51:31,599 --> 01:51:35,119
be true

3288
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:37,760
meyer had many beliefs of who he had

3289
01:51:35,118 --> 01:51:38,960
been historically in past lives

3290
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:41,199
connected to the growth of our

3291
01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:43,439
civilization audreyne is the same

3292
01:51:41,198 --> 01:51:45,279
situation he also believes that he has

3293
01:51:43,439 --> 01:51:46,799
been several rather important historic

3294
01:51:45,279 --> 01:51:48,719
people involved in the development of

3295
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:50,000
life here on our planet and it's quite

3296
01:51:48,719 --> 01:51:52,079
possible that's exactly what they've

3297
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:53,840
been doing pulling people off from the

3298
01:51:52,079 --> 01:51:55,519
other side bringing them into physical

3299
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:58,639
life at a time when they're needed and

3300
01:51:55,520 --> 01:52:02,080
causing great change in our history

3301
01:51:58,639 --> 01:52:04,719
it's 10 14 this went on for an hour the

3302
01:52:02,079 --> 01:52:07,039
tape goes clear to 10 58.

3303
01:52:04,719 --> 01:52:08,880
he's just sent me copies of it brief

3304
01:52:07,039 --> 01:52:12,000
little excerpts that you'll see we're at

3305
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:12,000
10 14 here

3306
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:17,840
we jump to 10 40 here

3307
01:52:18,960 --> 01:52:23,118
any second now we're going to be out on

3308
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:23,119
the freeway

3309
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:32,880
that's a jumpy tape

3310
01:52:30,639 --> 01:52:34,159
no uh on i asked him if they did

3311
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:36,000
especially when you see this stuff on

3312
01:52:34,158 --> 01:52:37,118
the freeway i mean you'd think everybody

3313
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,800
had a wreck

3314
01:52:37,118 --> 01:52:41,039
but he said no

3315
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:42,960
that that particular night october 20th

3316
01:52:41,039 --> 01:52:44,639
they he knew they were coming actually

3317
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:46,800
he did tell me about a week earlier that

3318
01:52:44,639 --> 01:52:48,560
he would be having a contact that night

3319
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:50,960
he says that the

3320
01:52:48,560 --> 01:52:54,000
certain characteristics in the magnetic

3321
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:56,158
field of the planet itself facilitate

3322
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:58,479
having contacts better on sometimes than

3323
01:52:56,158 --> 01:52:59,920
others because the pleiadian disc that

3324
01:52:58,479 --> 01:53:01,839
we're looking at here he says have to

3325
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:03,920
convert themselves from fine matter into

3326
01:53:01,840 --> 01:53:05,760
solid form so we can see them now here

3327
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:07,279
we're on the freeway

3328
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:08,800
and the disc is floating over some

3329
01:53:07,279 --> 01:53:12,279
buildings over there here it's over the

3330
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:12,279
miami airport

3331
01:53:13,279 --> 01:53:17,279
he's i asked him did anybody else see

3332
01:53:15,039 --> 01:53:19,359
them he says no uh that they opened the

3333
01:53:17,279 --> 01:53:21,679
dimension door brought the craft in they

3334
01:53:19,359 --> 01:53:23,039
tuned it to his wavelength his brainwave

3335
01:53:21,679 --> 01:53:26,279
whatever and he's the only one that can

3336
01:53:23,039 --> 01:53:26,279
see it

3337
01:53:26,719 --> 01:53:30,560
that's a good question i wish i

3338
01:53:28,238 --> 01:53:32,718
understood that technology myself he

3339
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:34,560
says even on some occasions he doesn't

3340
01:53:32,719 --> 01:53:36,319
see the craft they tell him where to aim

3341
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:37,679
and when he can only see it by the

3342
01:53:36,319 --> 01:53:40,000
camera when he looks through the camera

3343
01:53:37,679 --> 01:53:41,440
he can see it and not with the naked eye

3344
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:43,039
but that is rather baffling it's

3345
01:53:41,439 --> 01:53:45,279
certainly a technology that's a little

3346
01:53:43,039 --> 01:53:47,198
bit beyond our understanding if they can

3347
01:53:45,279 --> 01:53:48,800
control reflected light that's one thing

3348
01:53:47,198 --> 01:53:51,039
but how they could narrow it down to

3349
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:52,400
just one individual is something else

3350
01:53:51,039 --> 01:53:55,840
here we have people and it's flying

3351
01:53:52,399 --> 01:53:55,839
right along down by the freeway now

3352
01:53:58,960 --> 01:54:04,158
excuse me

3353
01:54:01,039 --> 01:54:04,158
it appears to be

3354
01:54:05,679 --> 01:54:08,639
i see us jumping around a lot and it

3355
01:54:07,279 --> 01:54:11,880
didn't before is that something you're

3356
01:54:08,639 --> 01:54:11,880
doing harder

3357
01:54:18,300 --> 01:54:21,458
[Music]

3358
01:54:23,198 --> 01:54:27,439
well this is a slow-mo that he did of

3359
01:54:25,439 --> 01:54:28,638
the thing uh where it's moving behind

3360
01:54:27,439 --> 01:54:30,559
trees

3361
01:54:28,639 --> 01:54:32,480
i cleaned it up a lot on the tape so you

3362
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:34,480
can see it frame by frame we're not

3363
01:54:32,479 --> 01:54:37,479
getting a real good representation here

3364
01:54:34,479 --> 01:54:37,479
but

3365
01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:57,520
well they seem to be that situation

3366
01:54:55,679 --> 01:54:59,118
happened several times in the meyer case

3367
01:54:57,520 --> 01:55:01,119
where several people that drove him out

3368
01:54:59,118 --> 01:55:02,799
to context took cameras and were not

3369
01:55:01,118 --> 01:55:05,039
able to get pictures themselves while

3370
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:07,039
billy was nearby getting a shot

3371
01:55:05,039 --> 01:55:09,679
so i think they they somehow manage our

3372
01:55:07,039 --> 01:55:11,599
to confine it yeah to the individual

3373
01:55:09,679 --> 01:55:14,079
these next pictures here on my last trip

3374
01:55:11,599 --> 01:55:16,000
down there i was flipping it through his

3375
01:55:14,079 --> 01:55:17,439
photo book again and he had put inserted

3376
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:19,118
some pictures in here i hadn't seen

3377
01:55:17,439 --> 01:55:21,039
before here's the top of one of those

3378
01:55:19,118 --> 01:55:23,598
discs

3379
01:55:21,039 --> 01:55:25,840
so i've got my camcorder with me and i

3380
01:55:23,599 --> 01:55:28,400
just added them on here so i thought

3381
01:55:25,840 --> 01:55:30,719
you'd like to see this

3382
01:55:28,399 --> 01:55:31,759
by the way this disc here the pleiadian

3383
01:55:30,719 --> 01:55:34,158
disc

3384
01:55:31,760 --> 01:55:36,159
has time travel capabilities it says

3385
01:55:34,158 --> 01:55:37,839
most of the early craft the levitation

3386
01:55:36,158 --> 01:55:40,238
craft that the germans were designing in

3387
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:42,639
the 30s could travel 30 to 40 000 miles

3388
01:55:40,238 --> 01:55:44,319
an hour and they were able to visit all

3389
01:55:42,639 --> 01:55:46,159
of the planets in our solar system even

3390
01:55:44,319 --> 01:55:47,679
in the late 30s and we're building craft

3391
01:55:46,158 --> 01:55:49,279
in the 40s

3392
01:55:47,679 --> 01:55:51,039
because of their association with the

3393
01:55:49,279 --> 01:55:52,639
et's they've kind of disconnected

3394
01:55:51,039 --> 01:55:54,639
themselves for their concern for our

3395
01:55:52,639 --> 01:55:57,118
day-to-day living as you might well

3396
01:55:54,639 --> 01:55:58,719
imagine and have built a variety of

3397
01:55:57,118 --> 01:56:00,079
different types of crafts and have been

3398
01:55:58,719 --> 01:56:02,319
very involved now in their own

3399
01:56:00,079 --> 01:56:04,399
interplanetary discovery

3400
01:56:02,319 --> 01:56:06,559
uh here we've got a picture from the top

3401
01:56:04,399 --> 01:56:08,719
of the top of the cupola of one of those

3402
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:09,440
and you can almost see the framework of

3403
01:56:08,719 --> 01:56:12,000
the

3404
01:56:09,439 --> 01:56:13,519
craft and here's one right below

3405
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:16,000
i'm not sure how these pictures were

3406
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:17,520
taken he hasn't explained them yet

3407
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,960
but we're obviously pretty close or else

3408
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:20,960
somebody had a pretty good zoom lens

3409
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:22,880
when they got it it looks as though the

3410
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:25,439
air or the clouds right below the craft

3411
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:29,000
is somehow being disturbed uh by the

3412
01:56:25,439 --> 01:56:29,000
field of the ship

3413
01:56:36,479 --> 01:56:40,718
yes they are and apparently i'm told

3414
01:56:38,158 --> 01:56:42,559
anyway that's my job here that that's

3415
01:56:40,719 --> 01:56:44,158
why he asked me to do this because he

3416
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:46,159
doesn't want to so

3417
01:56:44,158 --> 01:56:48,079
uh i've asked them if i can you know we

3418
01:56:46,158 --> 01:56:50,158
turn abouts fair play could i go aboard

3419
01:56:48,079 --> 01:56:52,158
the craft and meet them and he's been

3420
01:56:50,158 --> 01:56:54,079
him high now for months he's just trying

3421
01:56:52,158 --> 01:56:56,000
to get me a ride but it hasn't happened

3422
01:56:54,079 --> 01:56:58,238
yet

3423
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:00,639
i keep my camera ready though we did

3424
01:56:58,238 --> 01:57:02,238
have one sighting about a week or so ago

3425
01:57:00,639 --> 01:57:04,560
my wife and i were driving back here

3426
01:57:02,238 --> 01:57:06,959
from vegas and down by zuzic's road by

3427
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:08,639
baker we saw a large one come right over

3428
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:10,560
right by us and go right down behind the

3429
01:57:08,639 --> 01:57:12,719
mountain this is something sitting on

3430
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:14,800
the ground audreyne says it's a type of

3431
01:57:12,719 --> 01:57:16,960
remote craft and he didn't take the

3432
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:21,079
picture they gave him the picture but he

3433
01:57:16,960 --> 01:57:21,079
was not familiar with it either

3434
01:57:27,039 --> 01:57:31,198
well up until he told me they were

3435
01:57:28,639 --> 01:57:32,960
building him here i had no idea uh we

3436
01:57:31,198 --> 01:57:35,279
don't really at this point we're just

3437
01:57:32,960 --> 01:57:37,679
we're just trying to figure things out

3438
01:57:35,279 --> 01:57:39,359
this one here which is a beam ship type

3439
01:57:37,679 --> 01:57:41,199
is very similar to the style that the

3440
01:57:39,359 --> 01:57:42,799
germans were building years ago i would

3441
01:57:41,198 --> 01:57:44,960
tend to think that that one is probably

3442
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:47,039
designed and still built here he tells

3443
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:48,639
me even the bmw is still involved and

3444
01:57:47,039 --> 01:57:51,198
makes parts and sends them down to the

3445
01:57:48,639 --> 01:57:53,840
space city for some of the disk

3446
01:57:51,198 --> 01:57:53,839
you believe that

3447
01:57:58,719 --> 01:58:04,800
now this is a view from the top of the

3448
01:58:01,118 --> 01:58:06,960
pleiadian disc which is quite different

3449
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:09,279
we also have to begin to consider

3450
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:10,960
uh i asked audrey anyone to ask us well

3451
01:58:09,279 --> 01:58:12,960
perhaps we should consider the idea that

3452
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:14,480
there are no pleiadians at all maybe

3453
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:16,960
we're just looking at continued

3454
01:58:14,479 --> 01:58:19,359
advancement in the german situation and

3455
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:21,840
he says oh no there's a vast difference

3456
01:58:19,359 --> 01:58:23,759
in the germans and the pleiadians that's

3457
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:26,880
all the tape art

3458
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:26,880
you can bring the lights up

3459
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:34,880
the

3460
01:58:32,319 --> 01:58:36,559
he tells me that the main difference is

3461
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:38,159
between the pleiadians and the germans

3462
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:39,679
the germans when they visit are no

3463
01:58:38,158 --> 01:58:42,000
different than you and i they look just

3464
01:58:39,679 --> 01:58:43,599
the same as we do they're the same size

3465
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:45,118
and i'm sure wendell gets many reports

3466
01:58:43,599 --> 01:58:47,599
of the same thing that could pass in a

3467
01:58:45,118 --> 01:58:50,000
crowd he tells me at the space city when

3468
01:58:47,599 --> 01:58:52,079
he was there a pleiadian craft came in

3469
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:53,840
and he says the place gets like church

3470
01:58:52,079 --> 01:58:56,319
the crafts are larger when the craft

3471
01:58:53,840 --> 01:58:58,159
sets down everybody gets very reverent

3472
01:58:56,319 --> 01:59:00,319
the pleiadians are larger they're seven

3473
01:58:58,158 --> 01:59:02,238
to eight feet tall he says you can best

3474
01:59:00,319 --> 01:59:04,079
describe them as like perfect beings

3475
01:59:02,238 --> 01:59:05,519
there's no flaws there's no lines on

3476
01:59:04,079 --> 01:59:07,198
their skin

3477
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:09,920
he says for the most part they are so

3478
01:59:07,198 --> 01:59:11,759
incredibly spiritually advanced

3479
01:59:09,920 --> 01:59:13,840
that just being around them he says put

3480
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:15,840
you a little bit in off because you can

3481
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:18,000
tell they know everything about you they

3482
01:59:15,840 --> 01:59:19,840
can sense your thoughts they feel you

3483
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:21,439
and there's nothing that you can hide

3484
01:59:19,840 --> 01:59:23,760
from them but he says they're very

3485
01:59:21,439 --> 01:59:26,079
peaceful immediately you feel tremendous

3486
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:28,480
sort of love and compassion from them

3487
01:59:26,079 --> 01:59:30,158
they don't they don't talk much he says

3488
01:59:28,479 --> 01:59:31,279
you might ask them a question they'll

3489
01:59:30,158 --> 01:59:34,000
pretty much know what you're going to

3490
01:59:31,279 --> 01:59:35,840
ask before you ask it they'll pause for

3491
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,960
a second scan your thoughts to see how

3492
01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:39,199
well you're going to deal with the

3493
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:41,279
answer decide to tell you what to tell

3494
01:59:39,198 --> 01:59:43,198
you give you the answer very succinctly

3495
01:59:41,279 --> 01:59:44,960
and quietly and stop

3496
01:59:43,198 --> 01:59:46,238
and he says there's a vast difference he

3497
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:48,719
says they come in and out of the space

3498
01:59:46,238 --> 01:59:50,718
city all the time and he says everybody

3499
01:59:48,719 --> 01:59:52,880
down there reveres them pretty much like

3500
01:59:50,719 --> 01:59:54,639
god's down there so well that's i think

3501
01:59:52,880 --> 01:59:55,679
our kind of our latest pleiadian update

3502
01:59:54,639 --> 01:59:57,039
we've got about five minutes for

3503
01:59:55,679 --> 01:59:58,560
questions okay we've got about five

3504
01:59:57,039 --> 02:00:01,279
minutes for questions anything for

3505
01:59:58,560 --> 02:00:03,920
wendell or me anything you'd like to ask

3506
02:00:01,279 --> 02:00:07,359
come to the mic uh bob says

3507
02:00:03,920 --> 02:00:07,359
so we can get it on the tape there

3508
02:00:08,479 --> 02:00:12,000
did they give you any do they give you

3509
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:13,920
any indication which particular star in

3510
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:16,399
the pleiades system they're coming from

3511
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:18,639
the new contacts audrey ains says are

3512
02:00:16,399 --> 02:00:21,118
all from the alcion area during the

3513
02:00:18,639 --> 02:00:22,960
meyer years meyer was always very

3514
02:00:21,118 --> 02:00:25,198
emphatic that all of his contacts were

3515
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:27,840
one group from tagetta and he believed

3516
02:00:25,198 --> 02:00:30,000
they were from only one solar system uh

3517
02:00:27,840 --> 02:00:31,760
audriane says that in the alcion area

3518
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,719
which is the principal area where there

3519
02:00:31,760 --> 02:00:34,480
are

3520
02:00:32,719 --> 02:00:36,639
they come from there are hundreds of

3521
02:00:34,479 --> 02:00:38,959
planets with civilized life there and

3522
02:00:36,639 --> 02:00:41,118
the underground facilities here on earth

3523
02:00:38,960 --> 02:00:42,880
are have been built and maintained by

3524
02:00:41,118 --> 02:00:44,880
the alcion group for a long period of

3525
02:00:42,880 --> 02:00:47,840
time

3526
02:00:44,880 --> 02:00:50,239
um during one of the previous

3527
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:52,719
presentations by norio

3528
02:00:50,238 --> 02:00:54,718
we were shown satellite capabilities of

3529
02:00:52,719 --> 02:00:56,639
the government

3530
02:00:54,719 --> 02:00:59,279
is there a possibility the government is

3531
02:00:56,639 --> 02:01:01,760
aware of space city and if so

3532
02:00:59,279 --> 02:01:02,960
what's the situation on that

3533
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:04,960
yes they are

3534
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:06,719
he says at the higher levels above

3535
02:01:04,960 --> 02:01:08,719
governments everybody knows what's going

3536
02:01:06,719 --> 02:01:10,319
on they're aware of the space city

3537
02:01:08,719 --> 02:01:12,158
doesn't do them any good they can't come

3538
02:01:10,319 --> 02:01:14,799
in and out anyway and he says there are

3539
02:01:12,158 --> 02:01:16,960
people at the space city representatives

3540
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:19,360
from governments and from the cia that

3541
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:21,599
the cia to some extent has been kind of

3542
02:01:19,359 --> 02:01:23,519
a liaison between them and governments

3543
02:01:21,599 --> 02:01:25,440
for a long period of time

3544
02:01:23,520 --> 02:01:29,440

terrestrially built craft with warp

3552
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:50,399
speed capability that departed on the

3553
02:01:48,079 --> 02:01:53,840
first interstellar flight
