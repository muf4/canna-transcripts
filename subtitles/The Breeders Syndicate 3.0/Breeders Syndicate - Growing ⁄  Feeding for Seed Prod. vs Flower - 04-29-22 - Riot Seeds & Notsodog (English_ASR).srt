yeah there he goes

43
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,560
all right

44
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,080
here we are here we are

45
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:55,598
okay

46
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,560
um let's see what are we going to start

47
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:58,318
off with

48
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,840
what do we usually start off with

49
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:01,919
i mean we usually start off maybe with

50
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,360
like a general overview of like what

51
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:04,878
we're actually going to chat about i

52
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,560
suppose okay

53
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:08,399
you know so

54
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,039
we thought today we would we would talk

55
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,680
about like different parts of

56
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:16,079
uh growing and flower and like what it

57
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,360
means for you so we'll try to there'll

58
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,800
be times where maybe we'll get a little

59
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,680
technical but we'll try to make it

60
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,519
topical and bring it back to stuff that

61
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,280
uh because there's a lot of different

62
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,080
ways of growing there's a lot of

63
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,039
different ways of uh you know there's a

64
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,599
lot of methods right yeah and if there's

65
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,798
anything in in weed that leads people to

66
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:38,079
religion

67
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,319
it's the way that i grow is the best way

68
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,319
yeah and i have the best pot

69
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:43,839
because of this method

70
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:46,399
right and so it gets really hard to

71
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,759
debate any part about it because there's

72
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,000
so much

73
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,560
there's so much pride i guess

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,639
yeah i mean it's it's like art you know

75
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,318
everybody's got ego with their art and

76
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:57,598
if someone tells you that you know it

77
00:03:56,318 --> 00:03:59,919
could be done a little bit better it

78
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:02,000
hurts something you know so yeah

79
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,359
definitely and you know there's there's

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,959
aspects of

81
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,280
two of like

82
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,878
you know one size fits all

83
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,400
yeah sense of depending on what your

84
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:12,560
goals are and we'll talk about we'll

85
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,239
break it down into chunks whether you're

86
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,840
breeding or whether you're growing for

87
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,680
pure heads or whether you're trying to

88
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,079
grow commercially on a bit larger of a

89
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,478
scale like there's different pros and

90
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,000
cons to your approach

91
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:25,359
they're not all the same so it's really

92
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,360
hard to be like oh i just need to learn

93
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,520
this one thing

94
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,120
and this method if i perfect it will

95
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:33,279
consistently do the best for me no

96
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,399
matter what i'm trying to do yeah

97
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:38,000
and that's just not the case no no no no

98
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:39,839
just really not the case you know and

99
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,680
then maybe we could talk a little bit

100
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,119
about like what those methods do to the

101
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,680
flower

102
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,240
sure and some misnomers maybe about how

103
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,319
and everybody thinks that like nutrition

104
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,918
is like the only thing

105
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:53,759
really that messes with it but there's

106
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:55,680
temperature and there's spectrum and

107
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,240
there's how you treat it afterwards and

108
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,918
all that that kind of goes into it

109
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,000
yeah you know

110
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:03,839
um you know and so as a result of that

111
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,759
there's like there's a lot of there's a

112
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:07,599
lot of people trying a lot of good good

113
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,360
ways to grow cannabis that they're not

114
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,199
putting all the pieces together

115
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,680
yeah you know i one of the most common

116
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,240
questions i get the in in relation to

117
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,360
nutrients and in feed is

118
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,280
um

119
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,360
when people email me about a specific

120
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:24,478
strain they'll ask like hey

121
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,160
how do i feed it what's it like and and

122
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:28,800
i try to explain to them the difference

123
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,560
between like you know it depends it all

124
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,960
depends i don't even know what

125
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,240
expression you know you're going for i

126
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:35,439
don't know what expression the plant's

127
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,600
gonna get in the first place in your

128
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:39,199
environment so it's really hard to tell

129
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,360
people how you're going to feed because

130
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,199
it's not just strain dependent it's it's

131
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,199
individual plant and individual rooms

132
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,800
dependent and i think it'd be a good way

133
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,478
to illustrate it talking about it

134
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,319
matters it's like trying to be like well

135
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:52,639
this if you just do this like you can

136
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:55,759
pick up any woman you want yeah you know

137
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,840
this this this dating method is just 100

138
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,400
effective yeah and doesn't take the

139
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:02,318
other human being into account you know

140
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:04,478
and i also thought like this is this is

141
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,800
a little esoteric but there's like uh

142
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:09,038
there's this really cool book

143
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,319
um by this he writes the new york times

144
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:11,360
or whatever and his name is michael

145
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,600
pollan

146
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,199
uh and it's called the botany of desire

147
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,759
yeah yeah it's a great book and

148
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,680
documentary and it's a it's a um you

149
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,960
know it's like a plant's eye view from

150
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,038
the world

151
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:25,758
so i thought maybe too like we rarely

152
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:27,279
talk about like what cannabis or hemp or

153
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,879
whatever wants

154
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:31,198
yeah like what it's trying to do and

155
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:33,439
what it's going for because in order for

156
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,759
us to get what we want

157
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:36,719
right we have to play with what it's

158
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,879
doing

159
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,120
yeah to convince it to give us what

160
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:43,038
we're after yeah because what it wants

161
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,879
isn't necessarily what our end product

162
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:46,478
of smoking it is

163
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:48,639
no and i mean in some cases you know

164
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:49,598
like i mean basically at its most basic

165
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,038
level

166
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:55,598
uh the plant wants to mate create seed

167
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:57,918
continue the progeny of itself

168
00:06:55,598 --> 00:07:00,639
uh it has zero interest in creating good

169
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:03,519
smoke for us yeah that's not seedless

170
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,439
seedless is failure genetically to it

171
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:07,519
yeah um and so there's a bunch of stuff

172
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:09,918
that that plays into that

173
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:12,318
you know and we just thought that you

174
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:13,680
know like we i i you know we we listen

175
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,240
to a lot of these things we hear a lot

176
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,918
of discussions and mostly what i see is

177
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,120
a bunch of people

178
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:20,719
no offense i'm not trying to piss

179
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,160
anybody off but like patting themselves

180
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,199
on the back for what method they've

181
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,759
chose

182
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,759
yeah and that's the superior method and

183
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,520
people aren't really interested in

184
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,400
hearing different opinions about things

185
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:32,318
too much

186
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:34,799
yeah you know there's yeah it's so it's

187
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,720
it's very like it's very cliquish

188
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,160
it is very cliquish whether you're a

189
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,199
salt farmer

190
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,720
or you use bottles yeah right there like

191
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,879
bottle people or you know that's that's

192
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,879
kind of faux pas right now organic wait

193
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,360
you know like not only organics but no

194
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,199
bottles organic yes no bottles or no

195
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:55,439
bottles knf

196
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:57,280
living soil you know full salts synganic

197
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:58,879
uh you know there's all the i even you

198
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:00,399
know all these different things play

199
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,000
into it and like

200
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:03,359
and i you know i mean i think that

201
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,120
there's i think that there's a lot of

202
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,840
misunderstanding that goes into all of

203
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,280
it yeah right and so you hear all these

204
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:11,758
there's all these talks i'm not gonna

205
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:13,519
sit here and say that i'm some you know

206
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,038
there's other more intelligent people

207
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:17,038
that can talk about like the pure

208
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:18,639
nutrition aspect of it

209
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,719
i can give a general overview that'll

210
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,598
probably work but mostly what we're

211
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,599
talking about is like end results

212
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:28,159
and how to manipulate your plants to get

213
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:29,839
what you want yeah right and there's

214
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,720
different goals and it's not all the

215
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:33,038
same

216
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,278
yeah i mean like like

217
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:37,838
i've talked about this a lot in the past

218
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:40,240
uh choosing for selection

219
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,279
a lot of when i choose a plant for

220
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,759
selection

221
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:46,320
or for keepers i'm choosing a plant for

222
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:49,439
keepers for breeding you know whereas

223
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,959
someone someone else's keeper may not

224
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,680
be that because they're looking for an

225
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:55,199
immediate production plant that has all

226
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:56,559
the traits they want right there i want

227
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,879
something that's going to have the

228
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:00,958
traits that it passes down as opposed to

229
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:03,278
what it's showing in itself you know

230
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:05,119
yeah neville and so the old-timers used

231
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:07,039
to talk about that that sometimes the

232
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,799
breast the best breeders

233
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:11,120
were not the plant that they would put

234
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:13,199
into production from that same line oh

235
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,959
yeah yeah very different things there

236
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,080
could be there could be they could be

237
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,518
the same

238
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,320
and they could also just end up being

239
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,159
different

240
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,200
we end up breeding with production

241
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,199
plants

242
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,399
yeah because those are what survived

243
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,278
yeah

244
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,720
for the most part you know uh you know

245
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:30,240
trying to you know it's not like there's

246
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,320
a bunch of even amongst traders and

247
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,039
collectors like ourselves

248
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,760
we're not you're not trading old males

249
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:39,919
yeah right no no but you're not getting

250
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:41,200
like oh that's the 98 male of this and

251
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:43,360
this you know

252
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,440
no that doesn't you're lucky if you're

253
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,000
lucky if like you know you get a female

254
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,360
from that long ago yeah

255
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,200
yeah i don't i don't think i've ever

256
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,000
heard of anybody keeping old mails like

257
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,440
that from uh the dutch days

258
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,480
no i mean some people some of them do

259
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,920
but they're certainly never going to

260
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,159
trade them for you they they view them

261
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:02,319
as like the bedrock of their company oh

262
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:03,600
so much g13 haze mill that's one that's

263
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,640
one that did make it out now that i

264
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,959
think about it i don't know if it's a

265
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:09,439
step around yeah but yeah rare

266
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:11,759
yeah very rare rare you know

267
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,279
now with sts and stuff like that it's

268
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:15,519
even become more rare because they've

269
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:16,320
eliminated the mail in a lot of cases

270
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,720
yeah

271
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,079
so i don't know maybe we could give it

272
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,759
we could start because it is a little

273
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:23,759
rambly or whatever but

274
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:25,360
uh we could we could start maybe with

275
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:27,200
like what's your goal so like i was

276
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,320
gonna break it down basically into like

277
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,839
three

278
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,399
like big chunks

279
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,920
right there's like growing for you which

280
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,240
is basically trying to make it as heady

281
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:37,199
as possible and usually relatively small

282
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,000
scale

283
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,680
then there's growing for seed

284
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,958
and then there's growing at a larger

285
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:45,838
scale for

286
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:47,199
uh production yeah and there's various

287
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,560
obvious there's various grades and

288
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,160
levels of that

289
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:52,719
uh and that's a lot of what people are

290
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:55,759
faced with today in terms of like how

291
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,639
um how do you scale up headies

292
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:58,799
yeah

293
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,559
yeah yeah that's been a major major

294
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:02,639
problem for people yeah and people are

295
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:04,479
realizing that like oh like you know

296
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:06,639
this method that i've done for 20 years

297
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,039
it's worked great my two greenhouses

298
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:12,159
yeah well now i've got six 10 000 square

299
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:13,679
foot licenses and my weeds not as nice

300
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:15,278
yeah and i think a lot of people

301
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:16,958
convinced themselves at the beginning of

302
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:18,480
rec that they were totally going to be

303
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:21,359
able to scale up you know like it

304
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,360
shouldn't be hard you know right

305
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,360
anyway it just didn't work out that way

306
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,120
and not only not only from a difficulty

307
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,278
standpoint but also certain things that

308
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,879
might be perfectly economically feasible

309
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:32,639
at a certain scale

310
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:35,838
you know inputs that you might be using

311
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,799
or whatever um might not scale up

312
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,720
yeah

313
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:39,599
yeah right and the amount of liquid

314
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,879
you're going to go through and the

315
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,040
amount of this and the amount of that

316
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:44,000
and the amount of labor it might entail

317
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:46,639
yeah

318
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,399
uh you know and so and and so all those

319
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:50,240
things all those things play into it

320
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,559
right so

321
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,839
maybe we'll just start real general and

322
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:55,838
we'll talk about like the difference

323
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,120
between like growing good weed and

324
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,160
growing for seed

325
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,399
okay

326
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:01,679
right okay so

327
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,958
you know if you're growing if you're

328
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,759
growing if you're trying to grow for

329
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:07,039
good weed these days that means seedless

330
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,039
so that means you're going to trick the

331
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:11,679
plant into constantly

332
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:14,399
going waiting for pollen that never

333
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:16,159
comes yes right and so what you're

334
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,000
trying to do is you're trying to give it

335
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:19,600
you know enough nitrogen enough veg or

336
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,039
boost or whatever and to get it to a

337
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,839
certain size

338
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:25,838
get it to flower set and then grow good

339
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:28,560
flour harvest it smoke it that's your

340
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,639
gig yeah right and so that requires a

341
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:33,518
certain kind of nutrition

342
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:36,079
right where if you're growing from seed

343
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,519
um you're planning on pollinating it

344
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:40,159
right and then since it's going to be

345
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,360
making babies like seeds inside itself

346
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,958
you'll probably give it a lot more

347
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,159
nitrogen and you'll give it a lot more

348
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,719
of a mix

349
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,000
um that is is very different than if

350
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,360
you'd smoke it

351
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:55,039
yeah i i tend to uh feed heavy nitrogen

352
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:57,200
during uh flour for seeds uh i feed it

353
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:58,879
like tomatoes a very tomato regimen is

354
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,839
great for seeds keeping them healthy and

355
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:03,679
viable

356
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:05,360
but um i i flip out like if people feed

357
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:06,559
cincimilla like that because it just to

358
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,120
me it just

359
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:11,199
ruins it you know when you just flood it

360
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,879
with nitrogen for the most part i mean

361
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,959
and so maybe there's an aspect that

362
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:16,559
people should realize here so

363
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,838
one of the interesting things is there's

364
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:20,799
this i'll give a plug there's this

365
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,079
company called canna okay which is a

366
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:25,278
dutch company

367
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:27,519
that designed nutrition for cannabis

368
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:29,200
right and the reason why they're special

369
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:32,078
is that for a super long time when

370
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,600
people were developing nutrition um they

371
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:35,039
couldn't test it on cannabis because it

372
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,600
was illegal

373
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:39,198
yeah but canna could so

374
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,959
canna um

375
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:43,919
you know they they were able actually to

376
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:45,838
grow different plants you know cannabis

377
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:49,120
different ways and then test how the

378
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:51,519
plant actually up took nutrient right

379
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,679
so they had this method of like give it

380
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,720
just enough and nothing more

381
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:56,239
yeah

382
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,000
right where like i would say american

383
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,519
companies are more super size me like

384
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,039
we'll sell the customer way more than

385
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:05,198
they need like advanced the 32 product

386
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:06,799
[Â __Â ] sweet yeah or you know general

387
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:10,240
hydroponic you know i just i just mean

388
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:12,240
like the usage rates it's like go heavy

389
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,079
put a bunch in there right

390
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,639
and so what happens with you know from a

391
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:19,120
plant's perspective right um you know

392
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,000
plants will sit there and what they want

393
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,078
to do

394
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,240
is they have no idea that there's like

395
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:26,638
humans taking care of them really right

396
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,440
so they want to soak up as much food as

397
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:32,159
they possibly can within themselves

398
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,320
so that when the food starts to run low

399
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:37,198
they have enough left inside themselves

400
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,079
to like carry on the process of making

401
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:38,879
seed

402
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:41,120
yes

403
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:42,320
right so like back in the day you see a

404
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,039
lot of people they're like oh i want to

405
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,560
pack on weight on my flower right and

406
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:48,319
they would like give boosters or

407
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,479
something heavy at the end

408
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,560
yeah and then you just you end up with

409
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,120
unused nutrient in your stuff and what

410
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:57,518
can i figured out is that if you gave it

411
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,919
at the at the like early mid part of

412
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,879
flower say like week three on a 10 week

413
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:04,159
strain

414
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:07,439
right then the plant would have the next

415
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:09,838
month to use up that excess yeah and

416
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,440
grow all that flour and boost itself and

417
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,240
then it would still be running out

418
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,839
running low towards the end yeah because

419
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,120
what you want is since you're going to

420
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,120
trick the plant and you're never going

421
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,278
to seed it you don't want a bunch of

422
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,399
that excess stored inside the plant

423
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:23,120
itself

424
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,399
no

425
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,919
in general

426
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,839
no right and so that's what happens

427
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:31,120
sometimes when people like quote unquote

428
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:33,040
pump it or they ride a high ec or they

429
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,720
have a lot of organic nutrition that's

430
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:37,838
like their soil is hot

431
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,839
yeah the plant just soaks up a bunch

432
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,360
and it and it's got a bunch in there

433
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,920
because it's trying to make sure when it

434
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,360
runs out it has enough to make seed yeah

435
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:46,399
it doesn't know you're gonna make

436
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,360
seedless

437
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,480
yeah

438
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:53,278
so you have to like plan your nutrition

439
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,879
around what you're trying to do

440
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:56,159
yeah

441
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:57,919
if the plant knew that it was going to

442
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:00,559
be seedless it just it would probably

443
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:03,120
not put so much energy into making the

444
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:06,000
little hairs you know oh yeah and i mean

445
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,759
you know like our buddy uh you know csi

446
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,440
who grows in beds

447
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,959
in his rooms that he makes seed i mean

448
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,399
he puts enough nutrition in there for

449
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,958
six or seven months

450
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,480
yeah he mostly feeds water

451
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,919
because he's not concerned it's really

452
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,360
high nitrogen it's not something he

453
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,838
would ever do if he was growing for a

454
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,440
flower for market yeah it's like a

455
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,800
completely different mix and that's why

456
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,160
it's so bunk

457
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:28,000
uh you know when he talks about like

458
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:29,198
when it fails people act like oh well

459
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,078
then you just got a bunch of good heady

460
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:32,240
weed

461
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:34,159
yeah no and he's like no i got a bunch

462
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,120
of overly nitrogen

463
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,799
you know

464
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,120
you're not gonna burn the right way like

465
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:41,519
it's not gonna come out heads because

466
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,320
it was it was a mix for seeds for seed

467
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,560
creation yeah you know and for to grow

468
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,160
heads you kind of want to give the plant

469
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:50,159
everything that it needs

470
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:52,000
and then ideally let it use up its

471
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:53,600
excess before you're done

472
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,039
yeah and it's like

473
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,360
it's also why it doesn't show a lot of

474
00:16:55,039 --> 00:17:00,000
pictures of the actual seed process

475
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,480
making because it's not pretty like it

476
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,959
to feed it correctly to uh

477
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:08,318
to to have it making healthy seeds it's

478
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:10,078
not a visually appealing plant you know

479
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,759
some people and the majority people

480
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:12,480
wouldn't understand that part they don't

481
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:15,199
even know

482
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,919
it's doing a great job of making thick

483
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,360
healthy tiger striped seeds that are

484
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,360
that are going to be good for customers

485
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,519
but it's not going to look pretty where

486
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,438
if he has different rooms for instance

487
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:27,599
that he's grown he's using to do like

488
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,279
seed pops and experiments yeah he's

489
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,399
going to like pheno hunt and see what

490
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:32,399
they are

491
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,640
those soil beds will be mixed at a

492
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,559
different ratio yeah

493
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,559
you know it'll be a lot less nitrogen

494
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:39,918
you know it'll be a lot more scaled for

495
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:42,558
flower

496
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,919
yeah you know and then you know there's

497
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:46,319
and then there's an ac there's there's

498
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,240
other aspects too where it's like plants

499
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:50,000
really are like people

500
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,440
in the sense that you know you've got

501
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,200
your friends that can eat whatever they

502
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,798
want and like you know and they're and

503
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,160
they stay thin as a rail and you got

504
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:58,639
your plants that like look at a potato

505
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,320
chip and again gain 10 pounds

506
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,799
plants do that same thing they eat at

507
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:04,798
different rates yeah they have different

508
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:07,519
feeding requirements they have different

509
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:10,960
root systems they drink different

510
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:11,839
and so what becomes what becomes hard is

511
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,279
like

512
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,879
you know i've always thought when i was

513
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:16,399
doing bigger [Â __Â ]

514
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,000
that you're trying to put plants that

515
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,240
drink the same

516
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,079
and eat the same

517
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,240
in the same area

518
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,480
yeah right because i've had situations

519
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,640
where i'm burning one plant

520
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,679
or one line and the other line wants

521
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,919
more food

522
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,080
yeah

523
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,679
right yeah anytime i have purple in the

524
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,359
room that's going on

525
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,280
yeah or or you know you're trying to

526
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:41,678
grow something that drinks a lot and

527
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:43,519
really fast versus something that like

528
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,038
drinks slower like kush

529
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:48,160
and you don't need to water that thing

530
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:50,160
as much so you end up over watering it

531
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,400
to compensate you know and that's what

532
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,480
makes like that's that's honestly like

533
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,480
people diss monocropping

534
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,200
but that's why a lot of people like to

535
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,440
mono crop yeah because you can dial in

536
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,919
your nutrient regimen or how you're

537
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,080
feeding your plant or your style

538
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:08,320
right to fit that crop like we have a

539
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:09,199
good buddy pip uh souvenir seed co or

540
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:11,359
whatever

541
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,798
and he talks about um you know he was at

542
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,558
our party one year

543
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:17,038
remember he was he was blown away by how

544
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:18,558
good that diesel was yeah

545
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:20,879
and he said you know it was it was you

546
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:22,720
know the cut was from him at the time

547
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,440
and you know he was used to putting one

548
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,360
or two in the corner

549
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,038
and he couldn't feed it the way he'd

550
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,038
feed a whole room of sour

551
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:32,720
yeah so it would come out nice but not

552
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:34,079
perfect yeah

553
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,759
you know because it's one of those

554
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:37,359
things where it it had different

555
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:38,720
requirements than the rest of the stuff

556
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:40,558
he was doing

557
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,400
yeah so it wouldn't come out as nice

558
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:44,480
yeah sour is also one of those where

559
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,280
it's like [Â __Â ] you miss it you miss

560
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,679
it yeah it's very easy to miss

561
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:51,918
you know it's finicky and so

562
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,880
you know there's an aspect to that where

563
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,038
people think that there's a

564
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,960
one-size-fits-all there's a one method

565
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:59,119
they can they can take the method they

566
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,798
know and apply it to anything

567
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:04,319
i mean you start to see there's these

568
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:06,319
like a5 and c5 and the cough and pith

569
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:08,158
and cuban black haze are starting to

570
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:09,918
gain in popularity

571
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,200
or even gmo right

572
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,679
yeah if you're gonna have a plant that

573
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,880
takes 12 to 15 weeks

574
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,240
you're going to have to feed it

575
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,760
differently than a plant that takes

576
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,960
eight to ten

577
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:20,319
yep

578
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,759
you're going you're gonna have to you're

579
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:23,759
gonna have to veg it for longer you're

580
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:25,759
gonna have to give it a different mix

581
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:26,798
and just so people know it's not like

582
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:29,279
the mix

583
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:31,038
dictates what happens to the plant

584
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:32,079
the plants trying to feed on what it

585
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:35,279
wants

586
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:37,439
yeah and it's either there or it's not

587
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:38,798
and i think that's a misconception like

588
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,798
maybe we could talk about that for a

589
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:42,000
second where like the plant absorbs

590
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:44,879
salts

591
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,599
yes that's what it absorbs right so if

592
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,240
you're feeding gh or

593
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:51,199
you know i don't know uh

594
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,400
you know

595
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:58,080
eagle or 20 20 20 or you know or any

596
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:00,880
kind of salt or liquid chem nutrition

597
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:02,558
you're giving it like the 17 major and

598
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,200
macro elements like

599
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:08,240
in like an iv basically yeah

600
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,960
right but if you if you're fully organic

601
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,120
you're still feeding it those same salts

602
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,159
it's just they're in longer chains so

603
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:18,558
you have to get various bacteria and and

604
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,000
fungi and stuff to break it down yeah

605
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:21,839
make it available

606
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,200
right and so

607
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:24,879
like people don't get that they're like

608
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,720
oh you you know the plant and if you

609
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,840
break it if you took a perfectly derived

610
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,600
organic salt and a salt the gh or

611
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:32,480
cutting edge or somebody throws in their

612
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:33,839
mix

613
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,839
you couldn't tell the difference under a

614
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:37,759
microscope

615
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:39,519
yeah i i don't even know anything like

616
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:40,480
even if you were a soil scientist you

617
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:41,918
couldn't

618
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,279
right no that doesn't mean they're the

619
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,200
same thing

620
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:46,319
that that's not that's not true so it's

621
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,558
like

622
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:50,158
because like basically like

623
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:52,798
you know chem is like you know our

624
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,400
understanding of what the plant needs

625
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:56,000
organic is more like if you get it

626
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,440
perfect it gives the plant everything

627
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,359
that it needs and then there's a bunch

628
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,600
of like relationships with the with the

629
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:03,519
soil itself that like it likes and we

630
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:04,798
don't really understand

631
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:08,720
you know i have a question i have a

632
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:10,960
question for you so i i am not

633
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,720
worldly or knowledgeable about organic

634
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,960
feeding i've always been like a housing

635
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,720
garden canada type dude bottles sure and

636
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,919
that's just what i rocked with you know

637
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,880
um

638
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,000
so

639
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,440
when you want to force the plant

640
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,599
to drink what you want it when you're

641
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,720
doing organics do you just do something

642
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:30,240
to lower the ph or raise the ph to no

643
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,798
you have to you basically when you're

644
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,079
doing organics us i mean there's

645
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:36,079
different approaches like there's

646
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:38,480
bottles like for instance like to use

647
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:40,798
the same thing canna bio canna if you

648
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,640
buy organic bottles you're essentially

649
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:44,720
buying things where like the company has

650
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,120
taken the time to sort of like cook it

651
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,079
or ferment it or brew it or whatever

652
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:50,239
method

653
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:52,240
yeah and those salts are more available

654
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,279
than just adding raw amendments to the

655
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,599
earth

656
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:57,119
okay yeah so like for instance we you

657
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:58,319
know if if you were if you're going to

658
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:00,639
be that kind of guy where you're going

659
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:01,839
to get soil and you want to amend it a

660
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,200
lot of times

661
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:05,519
you would get it and all you want to do

662
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,440
is raw amendments you'd probably get it

663
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:09,038
add your raw amendments and let it cook

664
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,159
for a month or two before you even ever

665
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:11,119
use it

666
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,360
yeah

667
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:14,719
you know um and then because what you're

668
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:17,119
trying to do is you're trying to like

669
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,919
get all those all that bacteria and

670
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:21,359
fungi and everything time to break down

671
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,720
the organic

672
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:24,319
food in there

673
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,919
and make it available

674
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,918
right because that's the issue right so

675
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,880
the big difference is like when you feed

676
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,360
salt

677
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,280
you can guarantee that the plant the

678
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:35,038
availability is there

679
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:37,038
yeah if the temperature is right and the

680
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:39,038
ph is right and the mix is right and

681
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:40,558
your salt it's going to get all that

682
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:42,720
food

683
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:44,079
in organics you're hoping that food is

684
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,319
there

685
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:47,918
but it has to be at a certain ph like it

686
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:50,399
at certain ph is nitrogen can't be

687
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,640
carried right certain p at certain ph

688
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,320
chem or organic the the plant has to

689
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,278
have that ph to absorb it through its

690
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:57,439
roots

691
00:23:55,278 --> 00:24:00,240
yeah and certain ones like nitrogen is

692
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,240
more available at certain ph and yeah

693
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,640
there's a range there's like a chart and

694
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,640
that's kind of why people um they give

695
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,559
you that range for cannabis

696
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,240
yeah is because you know you get five

697
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:11,599
and a half or five point eight or

698
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,120
something yeah there's going to be

699
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:16,079
certain things that are more available

700
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:19,439
than in the mid sixes and vice versa

701
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:21,439
right and it's usually uh you start out

702
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,880
lower and up higher right

703
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,038
yeah i mean if you want to do it that

704
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,400
way so you know it's it's it's one of

705
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:28,640
those things where like if you have a

706
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,759
well-buffered organic soil

707
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,038
it's probably something you don't have

708
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:33,919
to think about

709
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:35,919
okay if you know uh but it also depends

710
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,080
like if you've got a great soil but your

711
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,200
water is ph9 coming out because it's

712
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:41,278
well water

713
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,440
yeah you might need to treat your water

714
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:45,359
to not make the life of the microbial

715
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,720
life in your soil harder

716
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:48,399
okay

717
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,200
right but yeah

718
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,679
so

719
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,960
there's an aspect to it where it's like

720
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,240
you know and i don't think most people

721
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,679
most people look at it it's where it's

722
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,599
like salts are sort of like a cheat code

723
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,519
you know where organics is like the pure

724
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:02,319
way to go right

725
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:04,079
and

726
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:06,399
i don't well i mean there's an aspect to

727
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:08,000
that i i do think it's true but i also

728
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,278
think that there's some organics that's

729
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,200
dirtier

730
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:12,880
than salt

731
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,558
you know people think that like salt is

732
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,880
made in some kind of crazy lab when

733
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:19,359
really it's like mined minerals that are

734
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,880
refined to a certain purity

735
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:23,439
and when you're talking hydroponic

736
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,278
purity that's like one step below like

737
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,038
pharmaceutical grade

738
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:29,759
so it's really really clean and it's

739
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:32,158
designed to run through aerial jets

740
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:33,119
sprayers drippers all kinds of [Â __Â ] not

741
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,000
clog

742
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:38,319
yeah for the most part yeah you know

743
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,839
um and all and all that and so you know

744
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:43,038
it's low and heavy metals uh the good

745
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:45,439
ones um you know and that's another

746
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:47,119
thing too is like when people

747
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,640
people started uh

748
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:51,359
you know and then you go organic right

749
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,520
and so organic is a label but i don't

750
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:55,599
think most people get that a lot of the

751
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:57,759
organic stuff that you get is byproducts

752
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:59,839
from other industries

753
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:00,640
i didn't know that you didn't know that

754
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:03,119
i don't

755
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,520
know if you get i'll give you a perfect

756
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:06,639
example right if you get bone meal or

757
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:10,639
blood meal

758
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:13,440
yeah okay that's organic by law but it

759
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,278
comes from major slaughterhouses

760
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,919
well that makes sense the cows aren't

761
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:19,119
organic yeah they weren't fed organic

762
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,400
food

763
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,000
you could be getting mcdonald's

764
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,159
hamburger cows

765
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,640
yeah your bone and blood meal burger

766
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:29,039
king wendy's right think about like the

767
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,720
biggest meat buyers and producers and

768
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:32,240
that's all mixed together and it's all

769
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,919
it's all the same and there's not

770
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,200
actually a way to differentiate unless

771
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,640
you're really lucky and you know an

772
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:40,319
organic farm

773
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,679
but it's all certified organic

774
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:43,678
right is one better than the other

775
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,640
though like realistically so bone meal

776
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,720
is ground up bones from cows right okay

777
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:52,000
blood meal is the juice and the sluice

778
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:54,079
that comes off the slaughterhouse floor

779
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,720
and they collect it and like powderize

780
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:59,038
it delicious right feather meal is the

781
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,440
same [Â __Â ] it's a byproduct from

782
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:03,200
the the poultry industry

783
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:07,038
oh i didn't know that yeah that's better

784
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,080
sense okay you know turkey uh chickens

785
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:09,919
you know

786
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:10,798
uh all the parts that they can't sell

787
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,200
you

788
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:14,480
yeah ground up and turned into

789
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,798
fertilizer

790
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,278
okay right so you have an aspect where

791
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:21,200
it's like oh i'm fully organic

792
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:22,558
and then you end up like in the i use

793
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,840
bone meal and blood meal and feather

794
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:26,079
meal and this and that and you're like

795
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:27,918
holy [Â __Â ] you know yeah because it's

796
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:29,119
it's it's legally organic it's got the

797
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,360
legal label

798
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:32,959
yeah by law but it doesn't come from

799
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:34,879
organic animals

800
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,798
blood mill smells like girls periods

801
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,120
it's gross well yeah it is and you know

802
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:41,038
the issue the issue used to become too

803
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:42,719
where it's like you know when we used to

804
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:44,960
be guerrilla and stuff like that or

805
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,519
whatever uh when i first got to

806
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,200
california you use blood meal or

807
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:50,639
something like that and all of a sudden

808
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,519
you get it wet

809
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,600
and the the the vultures smell it

810
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:57,519
yeah my dog slips out and they start

811
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:59,359
circling or the dogs want to get into it

812
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:01,200
or a bear comes and wants to rip your

813
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:03,599
[Â __Â ] up because it's not you'd go put a

814
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,200
bunch of awesome fish emotion

815
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:06,000
in your [Â __Â ] and then you get a black

816
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,679
bear

817
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,720
yeah and who wants that who thinks that

818
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,240
there's fish and starts digging for it

819
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,960
yeah you know and then you're and then

820
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:16,480
you're [Â __Â ] you know and so

821
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,000
there's an aspect where it's like people

822
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,960
think there's a free lunch and it's like

823
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,720
it takes

824
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,558
even if you're using that stuff it takes

825
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,079
it a while for it to break down some of

826
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:26,319
it's available quick

827
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:29,119
some of it not so much and like fish

828
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:32,398
emulsion and all that that's all from

829
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:34,239
the you know the seafood industry yeah

830
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:36,639
it's all the it's all the brewed bits of

831
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,480
the nasty parts that they can't sell you

832
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,399
some of some people like build the soil

833
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:44,000
or whatever you know like some people

834
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:46,479
have stopped using uh bone meal because

835
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,839
of the issues with cows and mad cow and

836
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,519
just all the chem

837
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:50,959
yeah and they're selling you fish bone

838
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:53,359
meal

839
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,120
okay because you know because it's it's

840
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:56,479
still bones and still calcium and all

841
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:58,959
that but it comes from the seafood

842
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,000
industry because it's not quite as toxic

843
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,600
yeah

844
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,720
even though it's organic

845
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:04,398
so

846
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,960
you could have an organic style where

847
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:08,959
you could pick all these inputs

848
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,200
where i would rather use can or cutting

849
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,880
edge yeah i would think it would it

850
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,558
would be cleaner to me

851
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,720
yeah you know

852
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:18,639
even stuff that's clean like baquano or

853
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,759
seabird guano right

854
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,080
where they don't they're not there's

855
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:25,278
obviously not like factory bakuano or

856
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:27,439
factory seabird but you know you are

857
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:29,519
destroying habitat to get it

858
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,919
yeah right there for bats they're going

859
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:33,599
into caves and for seabirds they're

860
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,520
going to a lot of habitat and they're

861
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:37,359
scraping the [Â __Â ] off it

862
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:39,440
literally to send it to you

863
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:42,079
yeah and you know do you know why that

864
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,558
[Â __Â ] comes from like indonesia and peru

865
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:46,398
and all that not america

866
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:48,240
i i don't know

867
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:50,079
because america has osha and you can't

868
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,919
send a 10 year old boy with a bucket and

869
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:53,519
a shovel into a cave

870
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,679
that's a good point i have watched him

871
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:57,440
collect the quantity i'm dead serious

872
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,798
[Â __Â ] up they do it where it's super

873
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,600
cheap and there's not a bunch of labor

874
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:01,359
law

875
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:02,398
and they'll do it industrial style and

876
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:03,918
they'll have a bunch of people with

877
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:05,519
buckets and they'll have like a bunch of

878
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,200
bulldozers and they'll be [Â __Â ] up

879
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:09,759
some huge we have plenty of bats in

880
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,759
america yeah yeah it's just cheaper to

881
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:12,640
get it out of peru or indonesia and ship

882
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:14,480
it

883
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,440
because they don't have to obey labor

884
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,519
laws

885
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,278
yeah and kids are great workers they're

886
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:20,720
great yeah you know and there's not

887
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:22,960
child labor in there so a kid with a

888
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,159
bucket you know and so it's good i'm not

889
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,159
i believe me i've used tons of

890
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,360
background on seabird guano and stuff so

891
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,278
i'm not dizzy again i'm just saying that

892
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:31,519
that's the reality of getting it

893
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:33,359
yeah yeah it's a great nutrient i love

894
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:35,038
plants from i love brewing teas with it

895
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:36,798
and stuff like that it's like it's good

896
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:38,558
stuff but

897
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:40,720
uh it's not exactly harvested

898
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:42,879
environmentally soundly and what happens

899
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,640
with the people isn't the greatest thing

900
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,440
i remember the first time i got sent

901
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,360
home

902
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,960
with tea from the hydroponics store my

903
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:51,678
very first trip

904
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,360
got sent home with compost tea

905
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,640
and i really sat there wondering if i

906
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:56,158
was supposed to drink this like if it

907
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,519
was some hippie brew like that i was

908
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,080
supposed to drink i didn't understand it

909
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:02,399
was for the plants

910
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:05,359
yeah so you know i mean back you know

911
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:06,319
now we are really in a golden age

912
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:08,639
of

913
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:11,278
teas and compost and inputs and

914
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,480
availability i'll i'll say that like i

915
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:14,880
mean i used to work in the hydro

916
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,519
industry and so i i got to know

917
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,519
how they sourced a bunch of amendments

918
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,440
what the differences in quality were and

919
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,359
why certain why why certain companies

920
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,278
were cleaner and better

921
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:27,678
yeah versus other ones that were using

922
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:30,159
cheap inputs and covering it up

923
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,840
yeah right and now you have a situation

924
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,720
that goes on it's really a bummer but

925
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:34,240
it's like

926
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,000
there's a lot of stuff that's from the

927
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,880
ocean that we used to consider super

928
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,759
heady

929
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,840
right

930
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:41,278
but now that they test for heavy metals

931
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:42,879
it's dangerous

932
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:44,880
yeah because it's got too much lead or

933
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,960
too much arsenic or too much cadmium or

934
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,559
whatever in it yeah you know so you

935
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,558
could you could be like oh i'm using

936
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:52,798
fish emulsion and this and that and i've

937
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:54,079
got all this amazing stuff and i even

938
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:55,278
have a hook

939
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,720
and you're putting all this stuff in

940
00:31:55,278 --> 00:31:59,679
there and then your weed

941
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,360
test high for heavy metals yeah i mean

942
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:03,120
that's why they tell like women you're

943
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:05,119
only supposed to eat so much tuna and so

944
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:06,319
much big fish when you're pregnant oh

945
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:08,398
yeah because the mercury because the

946
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:10,319
mercury well that stuff is in you know

947
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:11,839
you want to get some amazing crab or

948
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:14,720
shrimp or whatever

949
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:17,519
yeah it's got it in it because they live

950
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:20,480
in a bath of it right yeah and so in

951
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:23,200
some cases it's like people are like oh

952
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:26,000
you know salts are the evil bad choice

953
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,960
yeah and organics is the smooth reliable

954
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,519
choice

955
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,840
and i think that that there's you know

956
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,359
there's like it's more complex than that

957
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:34,720
yeah and you can grow good weed with

958
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:36,319
both

959
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,440
you know there's a lot of organic weed

960
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:38,879
that's grown that i don't consider

961
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,000
that's that nice

962
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,159
yeah

963
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,319
you know oh yeah yeah i've seen some k f

964
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:46,320
[Â __Â ] be [Â __Â ] wild

965
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:48,639
yeah and so maybe maybe we'll maybe we

966
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:51,918
should like get out of the esoteric for

967
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,759
a bit and i'll tell a story that like

968
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:55,120
like is pertinent to people smoking

969
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:56,480
right

970
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:58,319
so

971
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,640
i used to go i used to go to the oregon

972
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:02,000
country fair okay which is right outside

973
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,720
eureka it's like a famous hippie

974
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,798
festival still goes on uh got delayed a

975
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,319
little bit with covet or whatever but so

976
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:10,480
i i went up there

977
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:12,798
and i was i was from chicago and i lived

978
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:16,079
out in cali for a few years and all that

979
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:17,918
but so i was all salt back then

980
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:20,480
because where i grew up and where i came

981
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:22,240
up like growing weed you used salt

982
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,919
i lived in apartments like there wasn't

983
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,679
you weren't like grabbing soiled you

984
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:27,919
weren't you didn't have a backyard you

985
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:30,080
know like you it was like

986
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,840
so anyway but you move out to mendo and

987
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:33,599
it's like a lot more it's a lot more

988
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:34,798
like back to the earth back to the land

989
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:36,319
or whatever so there's a lot of people

990
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:38,480
out here that grow dirt

991
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:41,439
and i went up there and i had all this

992
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,519
salt weed okay and it was like the super

993
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,840
skunk and the chem 91 and the mendo

994
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,960
perps and you know sour uh super dog and

995
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:48,959
stuff like that

996
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,558
and they all loved it

997
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,679
and they were all super prejudiced

998
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:52,879
against

999
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,200
chemweed

1000
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:58,559
yeah but they loved my chemweed right

1001
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,000
yeah and then they all grew organic

1002
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:01,678
and i never knew a bunch of cats that

1003
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,599
grew organic like that

1004
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,278
yeah and so we were like comparing each

1005
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:07,599
other's weed all the time

1006
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:10,000
yeah you know and so we

1007
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:11,519
uh you know we we ended up

1008
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,960
you know we ended up teaching each other

1009
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:14,960
a bunch of [Â __Â ]

1010
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,480
yeah right and i ended up i ended up

1011
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,000
going and working a little bit for john

1012
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,599
jevens who's written a couple famous

1013
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,960
books he lives up in willets by me and

1014
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:24,320
learning as much as i could about

1015
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:26,878
organics right yeah at a time when

1016
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,079
like organics was very very like do it

1017
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:30,719
yourself

1018
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:33,119
yeah not very many online didn't exist

1019
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:34,398
really like you know it was basically

1020
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,519
you were buying raw amendments and

1021
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:37,440
everything you had to do you had to do

1022
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:39,440
the work yourself yeah maybe there was

1023
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,000
earth there was earth juice

1024
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:44,000
yeah earthquake earthquakes yeah yeah

1025
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,760
still around there was very few products

1026
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,760
there was very few inoculants there was

1027
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,280
very few bacteria there was very few

1028
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,119
anything it was very

1029
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,440
like buy raw ingredients and go for it

1030
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:55,919
yourself right yeah so

1031
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,920
i did this project for

1032
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:00,319
i don't know probably four years

1033
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,559
where i grew my favorite strains

1034
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,559
in my in one of my rooms and most of the

1035
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:07,119
room was dedicated for flour for medical

1036
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:09,039
right but yeah i had a section that side

1037
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:11,440
by side and the same two lights i would

1038
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:14,559
grow the best organic wheat i could and

1039
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,880
i would grow the best salt weed i could

1040
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:18,960
yeah of the same strains over and over

1041
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,000
and over again right

1042
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,920
and then

1043
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,519
it was just for head and so i would pass

1044
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,880
out a bunch of joints to friends of mine

1045
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:26,480
and stuff like that and it would all be

1046
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,838
blind testing and they would just smoke

1047
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,719
and tell me what's up

1048
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:30,639
yeah

1049
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:32,959
and that started to shock me

1050
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:34,799
right because sometimes

1051
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,400
with certain strains they consistently

1052
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,280
preferred the salt

1053
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,119
yeah

1054
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,560
right and the salt was so much easier i

1055
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,920
didn't have to put all that i mean

1056
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:43,838
people should know back then it's like

1057
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:46,240
we made the people that taught me like

1058
00:35:43,838 --> 00:35:48,400
we made our own soil in like concrete in

1059
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:50,479
like those concrete tumblers

1060
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,320
you know you'd buy one of those no you

1061
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,000
know you know you buy your own concrete

1062
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,119
tumbler and you put all your elements

1063
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,559
and you put everything in it and you'd

1064
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,960
stir it up and then you pour it out

1065
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:01,440
you're wearing a mask and i mean i had

1066
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:04,320
multiple friends go to the hospital for

1067
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,559
um fungus infections in their lungs

1068
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,240
from breathing guano

1069
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:10,078
yeah so it was actually kind of

1070
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:12,879
dangerous you kind of had to like eye

1071
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:14,400
and mask and glove up to be cause you're

1072
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,079
working with a bunch of [Â __Â ] and a bunch

1073
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,519
of animal by-products and all this

1074
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,800
different stuff right

1075
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:20,639
yeah and so

1076
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,920
i would try to make the headiest mix i

1077
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:23,358
could

1078
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,639
yeah and i learned that like some

1079
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:26,639
strains

1080
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:27,598
consistently people like the organic one

1081
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:28,480
better

1082
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,000
mm-hmm

1083
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,639
and some strains people some

1084
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,400
consistently like the salt without which

1085
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:36,319
was remember

1086
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,280
yeah 100

1087
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:41,920
the the chems and the sours

1088
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,800
typically like we're easier with salt

1089
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,838
yeah

1090
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,599
uh the mendo perps the super skunk a few

1091
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:49,599
different ones would come out really

1092
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,720
nice organic

1093
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,559
yeah right

1094
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:54,000
um and it's not like you couldn't it's

1095
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:56,239
not like they weren't good it was just

1096
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,320
like what you preferred back to back and

1097
00:36:56,239 --> 00:37:00,000
i think that's really important for

1098
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,039
people i people have been asking me a

1099
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,838
bunch because i've been making some

1100
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:06,480
posts about various historical strains

1101
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:09,039
yeah really the only way to have like an

1102
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,719
effective comparison is for you to grow

1103
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:12,639
it yourself

1104
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:13,679
in your environment in your room same

1105
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:15,118
time

1106
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:16,960
okay i'm gonna get these four sour

1107
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:19,519
plants yeah and i'm gonna grow them at

1108
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,440
the same time under the same environment

1109
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:23,199
right i'm not gonna get it from my buddy

1110
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,039
who grows a totally different style and

1111
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:26,559
his room's different temperature

1112
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:27,838
yeah i'm going to like it doesn't you

1113
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:29,199
just have to be able to see it in the

1114
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:30,880
same event right

1115
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:32,480
so when you consider all these plants

1116
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,200
all these plants for three four years

1117
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,719
were all treated the same way every time

1118
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:37,679
yeah you know

1119
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:39,759
and

1120
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:41,440
and uh you know it was

1121
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,720
and it and and so

1122
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,838
you know and i have a bunch of obviously

1123
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:44,639
you have a bunch of friends with smoke

1124
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:47,838
weed

1125
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:48,879
so you're giving out a b joints

1126
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:50,880
yeah

1127
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,800
right and um

1128
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,119
and and trying to get feedback and i

1129
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:58,560
don't think most people ever compare

1130
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:59,599
styles they're doing one style at a time

1131
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:00,639
yeah

1132
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,599
right so how do you know what's

1133
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:03,838
different

1134
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:06,000
right and so we were trying to figure

1135
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:08,799
out like me and a few friends we were

1136
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,679
trying to figure out well what is better

1137
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,240
yeah

1138
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:14,239
what is what is and it was surprising in

1139
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:16,078
the sense that you know and there's

1140
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:18,078
another aspect too where it's like you

1141
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:21,039
start to realize once you start to get a

1142
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:23,440
little bit more educated about it but um

1143
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:26,400
indoor organic is almost never like

1144
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,400
outdoor organic

1145
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,200
yeah i wouldn't know so well i mean i'll

1146
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,920
give you a perfect example it makes

1147
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:37,118
total sense right so

1148
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,960
indoor organic is almost 100 organic

1149
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:41,920
right it's like a mixture of peat moss

1150
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:44,639
and perlite and you know or or cocoa or

1151
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,680
different things where outside maybe

1152
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:50,000
like 10 of the medium is organic yeah

1153
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:52,000
and the rest of it is clay or

1154
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,559
or crushed rocks

1155
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,079
minerals are like almost 45 of most

1156
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:57,519
soils

1157
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,400
so like that's why they talk about like

1158
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:02,239
there's a six inch layer of topsoil

1159
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,000
in a lot of places and that's like your

1160
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:06,159
organic matter and then underneath that

1161
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,559
it's a bunch of rock basically it might

1162
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:10,960
be porous rock but crushed rock but

1163
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:14,480
that's what most earth is so like most

1164
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:16,159
people's organic inside is like soilless

1165
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,079
with added amendments

1166
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:19,838
yeah like you'd never find like if you

1167
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,800
took say like sunshine number four or

1168
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:22,799
something

1169
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,000
and rice holes and other [Â __Â ] you add

1170
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,680
all your amendments and you make the

1171
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,679
super heady mix

1172
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:29,679
yeah it wouldn't exist in nature

1173
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:32,399
anywhere

1174
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:34,879
your mix yeah it's like a cannabis

1175
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,760
specific mix basically for an indoor

1176
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,240
garden

1177
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,040
yeah so you never actually really

1178
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:41,039
like

1179
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:43,440
any kind of organic inside is like a

1180
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:45,199
series of compromises

1181
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,639
to begin with

1182
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:48,319
because you're not like scraping up a

1183
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:51,279
bunch of native earth

1184
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:53,760
yeah and then using that

1185
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,640
yeah i mean it's not really organic is

1186
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,079
it

1187
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:58,719
well i mean you can't call it organic

1188
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,400
anyway organic is like a federal term

1189
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:02,000
yeah that's right it's like i don't even

1190
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,440
think legal weed

1191
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,079
i don't even think legal weed you're

1192
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,280
allowed to use the term organic yet

1193
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:09,359
interesting

1194
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:12,079
i don't think so because because organic

1195
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:13,838
is actually you have to you have to meet

1196
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:16,318
federal criteria

1197
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:18,159
yeah in order to to get the organic

1198
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:20,079
label and not be lying

1199
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:22,000
right yeah but you can't get federal

1200
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,720
approval for cannabis because they still

1201
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,480
think it's it's it's funky

1202
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:28,879
yeah you know people are saying organ

1203
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,000
artificial light is an organic right so

1204
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,519
you know and then there's a thing too

1205
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,679
where people talk about this is like a

1206
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:35,280
big key word and by no means am i trying

1207
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:39,399
to diss anybody but

1208
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,400
what does living soil mean

1209
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,440
right you know i always assumed it meant

1210
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,680
there were [Â __Â ] worms and microbial

1211
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,079
life a bunch of that [Â __Â ] right but

1212
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:50,000
almost all organic if it's active has a

1213
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,318
bunch of microbial life

1214
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,960
sure you know if you if you take home a

1215
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:56,880
well-made tea from your hydro store

1216
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,079
that they brewed fresh or you make tea

1217
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,039
yourself

1218
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:03,039
you're putting in trillions of living

1219
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:05,679
organisms

1220
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:07,039
into your soil it's alive

1221
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:09,279
you know it typically means when people

1222
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:11,119
talk about living soil they're basically

1223
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,200
talking about usually like a some kind

1224
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:15,119
of no-till method or some [Â __Â ] like that

1225
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:16,559
right yeah but

1226
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,920
you know but even that is like do you

1227
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:21,358
know why most people use no-till

1228
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,760
i have no clue

1229
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:25,679
to prevent erosion dude

1230
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,760
there's a lot of because if you don't

1231
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:29,440
till the earth then when the rain comes

1232
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,440
it's not going to wash away into the

1233
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:33,679
riverbank

1234
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,639
okay does that make sense

1235
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:36,399
no

1236
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:39,279
no okay so imagine imagine like you're

1237
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,880
on a factory farm in [Â __Â ] you know

1238
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,880
somewhere like iowa

1239
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,800
okay and you're tilling the earth

1240
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,640
like a foot deep you're fluffing it up

1241
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,160
and you're making it all light and loose

1242
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:49,440
and then there's torrential rain that

1243
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:51,440
comes in

1244
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,760
okay and in that runoff a bunch of earth

1245
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,519
washes away into the mississippi

1246
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,040
yeah that makes sense right okay so

1247
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:59,119
that's how that's where most of our top

1248
00:41:57,039 --> 00:41:59,920
soil went when they talk about the dust

1249
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,480
bowl

1250
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:04,240
in uh in in oklahoma

1251
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,000
yeah they tilled up all the earth and

1252
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:08,799
the wind came up and it blew all the

1253
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,800
[Â __Â ] earth away

1254
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:12,719
it did there was like yeah because of

1255
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:15,358
the buffalo and [Â __Â ] there was like 10

1256
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:16,639
feet of topsoil in oklahoma yeah and

1257
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:18,318
they didn't know what they were doing

1258
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:20,318
with with farming and they got a drought

1259
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:22,960
and they tilled it all up and then all

1260
00:42:20,318 --> 00:42:25,199
these huge winds came in and they and it

1261
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,880
washed it all [Â __Â ] away

1262
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:28,480
so i had no idea that's what the dust

1263
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,960
bowl meant that's what the dust bowl was

1264
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,800
it was literally it was literally

1265
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,318
people tilling farmland and then the

1266
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,359
farmland blowing away in the [Â __Â ]

1267
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:36,480
storms

1268
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:37,920
so weird

1269
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,318
so

1270
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,079
no-till is basically like this thing

1271
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:43,679
where in conventional agriculture they

1272
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:46,800
don't want to till the earth and have it

1273
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:48,639
blow away or rinse away in rain

1274
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,318
so they don't they don't till the earth

1275
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:52,480
they leave it right and they just dig a

1276
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:54,480
hole for for the plant

1277
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,599
but a lot of them use conventional

1278
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:01,280
herbicides and kill all the weeds

1279
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:02,960
okay so no-till inside is like this guy

1280
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,800
just commented i thought no-till was

1281
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,159
like not disturbing the microbial

1282
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,720
content

1283
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:11,440
well that's what weed people say

1284
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:13,199
for no t for no-till outside it's that

1285
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,358
but it's also a huge amount of erosion

1286
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:17,679
control

1287
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:19,039
but you don't have erosion problems

1288
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:20,799
indoors

1289
00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:21,838
yeah you could till all you want it's

1290
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,960
not like you're going to get a wind

1291
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:24,400
storm that's going to blow away your

1292
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,358
[Â __Â ] you know yeah that's why i was

1293
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,880
confused when you're talking about a

1294
00:43:25,358 --> 00:43:28,799
windstorm i'm wondering how that applies

1295
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,480
to indoor for no-till but that's what i

1296
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,560
mean but like no-till was designed so

1297
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,000
the soil doesn't fly away

1298
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:36,559
yeah and then it gets applied to an

1299
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,519
indoor environment where there's no wind

1300
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:39,599
yeah

1301
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:41,519
that's yeah

1302
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:43,039
right yeah and then you know there's

1303
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:44,480
people and when i'm talking about

1304
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:45,920
nutrition i'm sure how many people are

1305
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,599
gonna get all upset because i'm gonna

1306
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,680
you're gonna start stepping on toes and

1307
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:51,119
they're gonna say oh well no it's about

1308
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:53,358
the layers of

1309
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:56,079
microbial and fungal and this and that

1310
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:58,639
not disturbing them or whatever you know

1311
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:00,560
um but to be honest like cannabis is a

1312
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:02,719
shallow root growth plant it likes to

1313
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:04,559
grow wider than it does deep

1314
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:06,480
yeah and so basically what you're trying

1315
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:08,639
to do with cannabis is give it a not

1316
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,639
some kind of aerated good amount of air

1317
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:12,559
and water and the ability for the roots

1318
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:13,519
to freely go where they want

1319
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:15,759
yeah

1320
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:17,519
you know so a hard compact soil that's

1321
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:20,000
not that's not a good job

1322
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:23,039
i i've also been i've also been accused

1323
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,480
of being wider than deep this this is uh

1324
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:26,400
wider than exactly

1325
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,800
yeah shallow even

1326
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,920
shallow some say shallow some would say

1327
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,240
shallow

1328
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,000
blight is all in perspective someone say

1329
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:36,799
so getting back so you know getting back

1330
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,719
to like what all this means is that

1331
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,160
you know i i was reading some comments

1332
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:41,279
from some people the other day where

1333
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:44,000
they were talking about like their

1334
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,680
friends that do no-till it works amazing

1335
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,358
for certain strains

1336
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:50,719
yeah and then other strains they do

1337
00:44:47,358 --> 00:44:52,318
don't respond very well to it or you

1338
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:54,239
know you have a situation like we have a

1339
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:56,639
buddy up in trinity and it's like if

1340
00:44:54,239 --> 00:44:58,639
you're going to do depths organically

1341
00:44:56,639 --> 00:45:01,199
yeah that's a lot harder than a single

1342
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:03,358
season where you can give it you know

1343
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:04,799
food designed for vegetative growth for

1344
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:06,799
three years and months

1345
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,560
yeah and then food designed for bloom

1346
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:11,519
for a series of months

1347
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:13,279
it's not as easy organically to like

1348
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:14,800
get two or three rips out of the same

1349
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,720
thing a year

1350
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,560
no yeah that makes sense

1351
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:20,639
you know and time it perfectly for what

1352
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:22,559
you're trying to do so it's like and i

1353
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:24,239
don't don't get me wrong i think organic

1354
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:26,719
quality weed is like

1355
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:28,879
can be better than any salt

1356
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:30,480
to be honest but i think a lot of people

1357
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,039
don't get there

1358
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:36,159
like salt has a way higher floor there's

1359
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:37,599
a lot of poorly grown organic wheat

1360
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:39,358
yeah you know and it's not like they're

1361
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:41,039
messing up it's it's more just like the

1362
00:45:39,358 --> 00:45:42,960
availability of the food isn't there

1363
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:43,759
when the plant needs it

1364
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,599
yeah

1365
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,040
so that you know

1366
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:48,800
it took me years

1367
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:50,960
years and years and years to finally

1368
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:54,240
smoke organic weed that was really grown

1369
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:55,119
well organic and and to me was as

1370
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:58,159
uh

1371
00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:00,640
well grown as anything grown

1372
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:03,199
bad acid salts and that was from um mad

1373
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:06,000
elite that dude kills it organic and

1374
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:07,919
changed a lot of my own ego with like

1375
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,719
thinking the [Â __Â ] salts are so much

1376
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:12,720
better so much easier why waste the time

1377
00:46:10,719 --> 00:46:16,318
because it was it was really special i

1378
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:18,000
mean it also depends you know like so

1379
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:18,880
you know you've got to fit and this is

1380
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,599
kind of like what i said in the

1381
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:23,599
beginning where it's it's like you know

1382
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:25,440
you got to fit your growing style for

1383
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:27,440
what you're trying to do

1384
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,760
yeah of course right and that's

1385
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,440
important because they don't all fit

1386
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,640
you know yeah and

1387
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,318
you know if

1388
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:36,960
let's face it like in today's economy

1389
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:38,159
with wheat prices so cheap and you know

1390
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,920
no matter whether you're whether you're

1391
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:43,118
in the traditional market or you're in

1392
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,240
the fully legal market um you know times

1393
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:46,720
are tough

1394
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:48,959
right and so people are trying to get x

1395
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:52,318
amount of weight per greenhouse or per

1396
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:53,920
outdoor patch or per grow room right and

1397
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:55,519
so you're trying to get as much pretty

1398
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,880
weed because people are visual as

1399
00:46:55,519 --> 00:46:59,280
possible

1400
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:01,039
yeah right and that's not necessarily

1401
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,400
heads i mean even back in the old

1402
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:04,079
traditional days

1403
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,318
a lot of the guys i knew that were

1404
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:07,760
running 50 or 100 lighters would get

1405
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:10,719
their heads from people that were

1406
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:12,400
growing six or eight lighters yeah yeah

1407
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:14,078
that's a pretty common thing even now

1408
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,000
yeah well the other part of it too is

1409
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:19,200
like back in the 215 days when anybody

1410
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,838
with a 215 card could go to a like a

1411
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:25,039
dispensary and excuse me legally sell

1412
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:26,719
their earp to that dispensary right yeah

1413
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:29,039
think about that dispensary there was no

1414
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:31,838
regulations there was no cost of entry

1415
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:33,519
they bought so much garage weed oh yeah

1416
00:47:31,838 --> 00:47:36,400
talents dude and they could just pick

1417
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:37,838
based on quality yeah and guys are

1418
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,160
bringing in weed that's like you know it

1419
00:47:37,838 --> 00:47:41,838
was cut two weeks ago it's fresh it's

1420
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:44,159
still in the perfect form it's in turkey

1421
00:47:41,838 --> 00:47:45,838
bags it's like not very regulated and

1422
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:46,960
they can just pick the best and ditch

1423
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:47,838
the rest

1424
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,079
yeah

1425
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:51,199
now with all this legality

1426
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:52,559
you know a lot of times some of that

1427
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:53,679
weed doesn't hit the shelf for two or

1428
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:55,599
three months

1429
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:57,838
yeah and it's being grown in these big

1430
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:59,599
salt factories or it's being grown at a

1431
00:47:57,838 --> 00:48:01,679
scale where like all the little things

1432
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:04,160
that the egg the eight lighter guy could

1433
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:07,279
do they can't

1434
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:09,679
so sucks huh you you've actually

1435
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,280
experienced scaling up major right oh

1436
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:12,879
yeah why don't you talk about that i

1437
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:15,599
i've never done the

1438
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:18,480
except for the big big uh reversal and

1439
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:21,039
having to save those dummies [Â __Â ]

1440
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:23,358
already flowering crop for a reversal i

1441
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:25,119
had never done major major scale as far

1442
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:26,159
as feeding and all that stuff it was it

1443
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:27,599
was

1444
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:29,920
significantly different especially

1445
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:32,079
re-vegging at that scale it was insane

1446
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,920
any you know and there's a there's an

1447
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,599
aspect to where you can talk about this

1448
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,280
is pretty funny because you know there

1449
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:40,559
was these people that just opened up

1450
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:42,000
like whatever it is like 126 acres in in

1451
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:44,960
[Â __Â ] socal and they're calling it

1452
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,159
craft right yeah yeah uh

1453
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:48,639
everybody agrees that there's a

1454
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:50,799
difference between craft and commercial

1455
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:51,598
yeah the difference is is that people

1456
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,920
get

1457
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:55,200
hyphy about like when does that where is

1458
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,079
that line

1459
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:58,000
yeah

1460
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:59,680
you know and like i said before i used

1461
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,000
to never see the people that would who

1462
00:48:59,679 --> 00:49:04,078
are great growers and doing a great job

1463
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,159
they still would not get the same

1464
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:08,000
quality weed of their 50 or 100 lighter

1465
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:08,960
that we would get out of a garage sized

1466
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,838
scene

1467
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,358
yeah

1468
00:49:09,838 --> 00:49:13,358
for the most part they just wouldn't

1469
00:49:11,358 --> 00:49:14,960
they had way less time per plant they

1470
00:49:13,358 --> 00:49:17,039
weren't doing quite as many little

1471
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,639
things that made the plants happy

1472
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:20,719
you know like it was a little bit more

1473
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:22,400
commercial and yeah

1474
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:23,679
you know and then there's an aspect too

1475
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,639
where it's like

1476
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:29,039
they um so scaling becomes hard and a

1477
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:30,719
lot of times when people scale they lose

1478
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:32,318
quality

1479
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:34,000
so we can talk about that for a minute

1480
00:49:32,318 --> 00:49:36,159
too and i'm not trying to diss them but

1481
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,880
you look at like the the jungle boys

1482
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:39,199
right

1483
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,640
or some of these big you know rockwool

1484
00:49:39,199 --> 00:49:42,318
factory farms

1485
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:44,480
yeah they're doing that because they

1486
00:49:42,318 --> 00:49:46,079
have all these different rooms

1487
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:48,000
and relying on a bunch of hippies and

1488
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:50,318
weirdos to like hand water everything

1489
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,559
right every day is problematic

1490
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:54,800
yeah so you know they're trying to

1491
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:56,720
automate all this different [Â __Â ] and

1492
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:59,039
then just like work on looking at the

1493
00:49:56,719 --> 00:50:00,799
data and then messing with the the

1494
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:03,599
settings and the data and not looking

1495
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:05,599
each individual plant right yeah and so

1496
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:07,920
what they're doing is is that there's a

1497
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:09,838
lot of technology from northern europe

1498
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:11,358
um that basically is the basis of all

1499
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:13,679
hydroponics

1500
00:50:11,358 --> 00:50:16,078
yeah grow dan all that they all learned

1501
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:17,838
how to do all this growing tomatoes and

1502
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:19,119
peppers and cucumbers and all these

1503
00:50:17,838 --> 00:50:21,440
vegetables

1504
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:23,519
for places that are shitty like northern

1505
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,440
europe but have money yeah yeah and you

1506
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:27,679
can go there and you can see hot houses

1507
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:30,720
greenhouses that have tens of thousands

1508
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:32,000
of plants tens of thousands of lights

1509
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:34,639
huge

1510
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,079
right so you see these trick systems

1511
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:38,078
that they're installing

1512
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:39,280
they're all based on that

1513
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:41,280
yeah

1514
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,400
right yeah so

1515
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,640
they get all these things and they're

1516
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:46,318
looking at graphs right and they've got

1517
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:48,239
they've got like the moisture meter and

1518
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:50,639
they're perfectly planning the wet and

1519
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:52,879
dry cycles and they're and they're you

1520
00:50:50,639 --> 00:50:54,799
know dialing in their their salts and

1521
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:57,358
everything and it's like even the setup

1522
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:59,119
itself is like a plumbing nightmare

1523
00:50:57,358 --> 00:51:00,318
it's so intense

1524
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:01,760
and then people call their weed

1525
00:51:00,318 --> 00:51:04,239
cardboard

1526
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:05,119
yeah right because what happens is

1527
00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:06,639
they're you're trying to do a

1528
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:09,119
one-size-fits-all

1529
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:10,879
and cannabis actually it turns out it

1530
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:12,240
doesn't like being fed perfectly its

1531
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,119
whole life

1532
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:14,959
no

1533
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:16,640
like they've done studies where they've

1534
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,400
shown that certain amounts of drought

1535
00:51:16,639 --> 00:51:19,519
stress or certain amounts of stress to

1536
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,920
the plant

1537
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:23,358
um actually creates more terpenes and

1538
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,039
more crystal

1539
00:51:23,358 --> 00:51:26,799
yeah i'm saying beat the hell out of

1540
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:28,480
your plant no i've seen it firsthand

1541
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,920
though straight stress

1542
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,280
like uh

1543
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,680
where did i first learn that about it

1544
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:35,599
was it had to do with uh bugs attacking

1545
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:38,399
the plant and and that's why the

1546
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:40,880
trichomes are there yeah bugs like bugs

1547
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:42,240
signal uh you know they they signal a

1548
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,720
thing to the plant where i need to make

1549
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:46,318
more thc i need to make it harder for

1550
00:51:44,719 --> 00:51:48,799
them to crawl on me i need to make it

1551
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:50,558
harder for them to bite me you know and

1552
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,480
yeah so you get these perfect rooms and

1553
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:54,319
everything's perfect and everything's

1554
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,559
everything's dialed in and they're like

1555
00:51:54,318 --> 00:51:59,039
fine-tuning stuff and they have control

1556
00:51:56,559 --> 00:52:00,160
over all their parameters right

1557
00:51:59,039 --> 00:52:02,400
and

1558
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:05,279
then their weed comes out

1559
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:07,440
not that good you know and the guy that

1560
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:09,119
like you know like they got a little dry

1561
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,880
and a little wilty a few times and they

1562
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:12,880
stressed here and there a little bit

1563
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:15,519
like that weed was happier

1564
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:17,519
yeah there was it was better but

1565
00:52:15,519 --> 00:52:19,838
they're trying to grow like a reasonably

1566
00:52:17,519 --> 00:52:22,318
good looking product at scale

1567
00:52:19,838 --> 00:52:24,159
yeah and they can't have [Â __Â ] you

1568
00:52:22,318 --> 00:52:26,400
know three dozen rooms

1569
00:52:24,159 --> 00:52:28,078
and treat it like you have a garage

1570
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,680
or treat it like you have one greenhouse

1571
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:31,519
and no job

1572
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:33,118
yeah you know well you know you have a

1573
00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:35,039
situation there's people that you that

1574
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:36,240
rig that are quite popular and they they

1575
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:37,679
don't have that many plants and they

1576
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:39,358
have a greenhouse

1577
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:41,440
yeah and that's their job and you can go

1578
00:52:39,358 --> 00:52:44,000
out there and you can baby them

1579
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:46,079
and you can give them every little thing

1580
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,440
but then you join a legal scene and like

1581
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:48,880
you're working i don't talk very much

1582
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,960
about what i was doing but like you try

1583
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:53,200
to develop some things at scale

1584
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:55,440
and you've got to water some acreage

1585
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:56,318
and it's a whole different thing

1586
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,800
yeah

1587
00:52:56,318 --> 00:53:00,400
and it's not that easy to do

1588
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,000
no i can't imagine

1589
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,800
you know until there's so much to go

1590
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,639
wrong

1591
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,800
a lot of people messed up even just

1592
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:08,239
going from how big they were doing just

1593
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,920
to like two or three or four ten

1594
00:53:08,239 --> 00:53:11,039
thousand square foots

1595
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,559
yeah

1596
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:14,400
like and they started really and they

1597
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:16,240
started you know really messing you know

1598
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:18,880
they started really messing up

1599
00:53:16,239 --> 00:53:21,358
yeah you know and and so

1600
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:24,079
like a lot of and that's why because

1601
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:26,000
because like dispensaries can't just buy

1602
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:28,880
the best weed from whoever walks in with

1603
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,760
a duffel bag anymore yeah they were able

1604
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:33,920
to buy from like a lot of small time

1605
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:36,720
local gardeners

1606
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:38,079
you know and the bay would get tons of

1607
00:53:36,719 --> 00:53:40,399
people from

1608
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:43,119
even la la and san diego were flooded

1609
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,079
with weed from humble and lake oh yeah

1610
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:45,599
yeah

1611
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:48,240
there was people that would drive up to

1612
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:49,680
my area every week to get to bring it

1613
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:51,118
down to the dispensaries that was their

1614
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:53,759
entire gig

1615
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:55,599
was to flow it right into dispensaries

1616
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,040
and so they could they could say yes or

1617
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:58,960
no to any wheat that walk through their

1618
00:53:57,039 --> 00:53:59,759
door

1619
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,720
right

1620
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,480
and

1621
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:03,838
now there's all this regulation and

1622
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,440
there's all this thing there's all this

1623
00:54:03,838 --> 00:54:07,440
packaging and there's all this testing

1624
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,960
and there's all this time and people are

1625
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,400
trying to learn how to grow on a lot

1626
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,570
bigger scale

1627
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,200
and their weed is like

1628
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:15,680
[Music]

1629
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:17,838
yep way down

1630
00:54:15,679 --> 00:54:19,279
way down in quality in my opinion

1631
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:21,119
you know and people are going to learn

1632
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,960
they're going to get better over time

1633
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:24,240
but right now customers are [Â __Â ]

1634
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,679
because they're paying more than they

1635
00:54:24,239 --> 00:54:29,118
used to

1636
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:31,838
and the availability uh is shittier

1637
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:33,599
but at least it looks good on ig

1638
00:54:31,838 --> 00:54:35,119
and that and that's another thing ig

1639
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:38,000
[Â __Â ] it all up

1640
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:40,400
yeah because you couldn't sniff it or

1641
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,039
smell it or anything like that like you

1642
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:45,680
you know you could just see it

1643
00:54:43,039 --> 00:54:48,318
and so cookies cookies was perfectly

1644
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:51,279
timed for the social media wave

1645
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:53,039
yeah because it was unusually

1646
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,880
visually attractive

1647
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:56,960
and very unique looking it definitely

1648
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:58,640
did stand out from what was out there

1649
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,000
yeah and now there's a whole thing where

1650
00:54:58,639 --> 00:55:02,159
you see so many of these different

1651
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,679
strains and a lot of them i think have

1652
00:55:02,159 --> 00:55:07,759
been chosen based on looks and testing

1653
00:55:05,679 --> 00:55:09,440
and they can be like not to judge it oh

1654
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:12,640
look here's apple fritter and it tested

1655
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:14,559
33 look how fire it looks

1656
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:16,239
and then it [Â __Â ] is the worst term

1657
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:18,160
bomb on the face of the earth for

1658
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:19,759
breeding oh you smoke it and everyone's

1659
00:55:18,159 --> 00:55:21,440
all excited because the the people that

1660
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,640
they respect are hyping it and then six

1661
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,000
months later you know you're like i

1662
00:55:22,639 --> 00:55:25,358
don't think i'm gonna buy that seventy

1663
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,440
dollar eighth

1664
00:55:25,358 --> 00:55:28,639
yeah it just didn't it just didn't hit

1665
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,960
it for me

1666
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:32,639
you know what before before we scoot too

1667
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,720
far along i do remember there's one

1668
00:55:32,639 --> 00:55:36,798
thing that i wanted to talk about and

1669
00:55:34,719 --> 00:55:39,838
when it's uh feeding for breeding as far

1670
00:55:36,798 --> 00:55:41,759
as vegetative stuff one thing that i

1671
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:45,199
find a lot of bridges do when i talk to

1672
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:47,520
them and it's totally counterproductive

1673
00:55:45,199 --> 00:55:49,838
is when you are running cycles of

1674
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:51,440
different rooms and different different

1675
00:55:49,838 --> 00:55:53,679
strains you're trying to do multiple

1676
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:55,119
projects and they're one after the other

1677
00:55:53,679 --> 00:55:57,279
after the other

1678
00:55:55,119 --> 00:56:00,400
you start learning to

1679
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:02,480
feed differently to slow down the growth

1680
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,920
to try to make room and that's not

1681
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:06,079
something that's that's totally

1682
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:08,000
counterproductive and counter-intuitive

1683
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:09,519
but some of us have learned how to stunt

1684
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,000
our plants and bring them out of being

1685
00:56:09,519 --> 00:56:14,159
stunted because it's just there's no way

1686
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,559
to to constantly have that room to feed

1687
00:56:14,159 --> 00:56:17,920
in new cycles so you know there's things

1688
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:20,000
you'll do when breeding that you would

1689
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:22,639
never do for production because it would

1690
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,400
absolutely just butt [Â __Â ] you for for

1691
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:26,719
great flour well yeah i mean if you've

1692
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:29,440
got if you've got a big collection of

1693
00:56:26,719 --> 00:56:31,519
models and stock then

1694
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:34,079
very likely what you're doing is you're

1695
00:56:31,519 --> 00:56:35,119
keeping a bunch at moderate to small

1696
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:36,880
size

1697
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:39,358
under enough light to like keep them

1698
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,640
going and happy but nothing too vigorous

1699
00:56:39,358 --> 00:56:42,400
and then you've got always moderate

1700
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:44,078
health and then you're planting you're

1701
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,480
planning on putting some plants in like

1702
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:47,680
a vigorous very well-lit spot to get

1703
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,679
them going

1704
00:56:47,679 --> 00:56:51,279
because you have projects in mind for

1705
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:53,838
them and you want to get very vigorous

1706
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:55,359
cuttings and small plants going off them

1707
00:56:53,838 --> 00:56:58,000
and so there's a rotation there that

1708
00:56:55,358 --> 00:56:59,119
goes in where it's like a fine balance

1709
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,559
yeah

1710
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:02,318
hurting to

1711
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:04,319
to not you know if you're someone like

1712
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:07,199
kale you know like like csi or whatever

1713
00:57:04,318 --> 00:57:09,039
and you've got 150 different plants

1714
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:10,719
in mom's and then you've got a bunch of

1715
00:57:09,039 --> 00:57:12,318
stuff you're keeping for feno hunting

1716
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:14,558
and all of a sudden you've got hundreds

1717
00:57:12,318 --> 00:57:16,239
of different strains and and you might

1718
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:16,880
want to slow things down on a bunch of

1719
00:57:16,239 --> 00:57:19,199
it

1720
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:21,119
yeah a pheno hunt you might want to keep

1721
00:57:19,199 --> 00:57:22,879
it going really slow

1722
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:23,920
yeah you know and even starve it

1723
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:25,680
somewhat

1724
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,760
until you see what you have because if

1725
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:30,399
you start pumping it like you're trying

1726
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:32,160
to pump it to get ready to bloom a room

1727
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:34,160
all of a sudden you've got jungle growth

1728
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:36,000
and where do you put it all

1729
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:37,920
yeah

1730
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,159
yep especially keeping some of the older

1731
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:42,480
lines the the all five hazes and stuff

1732
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:44,399
like that you get it gets junky so

1733
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:46,960
[Â __Â ] fast

1734
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:49,358
yeah i guess yeah you know and then you

1735
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:51,039
know and and so you have an aspect where

1736
00:57:49,358 --> 00:57:52,798
it's like i just thought we could talk

1737
00:57:51,039 --> 00:57:53,679
about it from a flower perspective too

1738
00:57:52,798 --> 00:57:55,519
because

1739
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:57,118
you try to talk to people and like the

1740
00:57:55,519 --> 00:58:00,318
thing that i get the most when you try

1741
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:02,079
to talk nutrition is like smugness

1742
00:58:00,318 --> 00:58:03,519
like they want people

1743
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:05,440
people are smug

1744
00:58:03,519 --> 00:58:07,920
oh yeah yeah like they want they want to

1745
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:09,280
know that i'm growing the better way

1746
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:10,559
this way works

1747
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,920
you know what the [Â __Â ] are you talking

1748
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:14,559
about i get two and a half pounds of

1749
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,599
light everybody thinks my weed is fire

1750
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:17,599
you know

1751
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:19,359
and i'm not i'm not dissing anybody i'm

1752
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:21,920
i'm not like that's not what i'm trying

1753
00:58:19,358 --> 00:58:24,318
to say i'm just trying to say that like

1754
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,760
very few people are doing side by sides

1755
00:58:24,318 --> 00:58:28,639
to try to see

1756
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:30,480
what methods are giving them better weed

1757
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:32,879
they're growing the same style at one

1758
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:35,119
time and if they change styles they

1759
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:37,358
change it over entirely

1760
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:39,440
yeah you know and so you're not really

1761
00:58:37,358 --> 00:58:41,838
comparing you're just and you know most

1762
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:43,679
people's goals are just to sell it

1763
00:58:41,838 --> 00:58:45,679
right so yeah there's things with

1764
00:58:43,679 --> 00:58:46,960
organic like when i first moved here

1765
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:49,118
there was people that had been using

1766
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:51,440
their beds or using their holes in the

1767
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:53,119
in the hills or whatever for 10 or 15 20

1768
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:55,119
years

1769
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:56,798
and every year those things got better

1770
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:59,119
and better

1771
00:58:56,798 --> 00:59:00,880
right because they were able to add

1772
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:02,960
amendments they were able to add you

1773
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:05,760
know bacteria and various things it was

1774
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:08,159
alive it was like old and aged and fully

1775
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:09,839
functional and work and going good to go

1776
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:11,519
if you're going to grow

1777
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:13,039
the first rip or two probably isn't

1778
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:14,400
going to be as nice as the fifth or

1779
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:16,400
sixth one

1780
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,000
okay that makes sense because it take

1781
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,358
like you know you've heard about green

1782
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,559
sand

1783
00:59:19,358 --> 00:59:22,400
you ever heard about green sand green

1784
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:24,640
sand doesn't even become bio available

1785
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:27,358
for two years after you put it in

1786
00:59:24,639 --> 00:59:29,519
yeah same with uh normal silica you know

1787
00:59:27,358 --> 00:59:31,039
it's like one year i think there's

1788
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:32,480
things that are on that are fairly

1789
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:33,759
immediate there's things that take two

1790
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,039
or three months there's things that take

1791
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:37,280
a year

1792
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:39,838
you know and so if you have aged if you

1793
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:41,680
have aged stuff you know like a lot of

1794
00:59:39,838 --> 00:59:42,960
that breaking down availability has

1795
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:45,039
happened

1796
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:46,318
and yeah and the natural cycle is doing

1797
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:48,318
it for you but if you're starting a

1798
00:59:46,318 --> 00:59:49,519
fresh facility

1799
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:51,599
you're going to get a bunch of raw

1800
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:53,358
ingredients or whatever like you know

1801
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:54,880
tossed together and you're going to have

1802
00:59:53,358 --> 00:59:56,558
to amend

1803
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:59,760
yeah

1804
00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:02,000
you know and so if you're like if if you

1805
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:04,240
probably another thing is that like if

1806
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,760
you're a small tent farmer or you're a

1807
01:00:04,239 --> 01:00:07,838
small garage farmer and you're just

1808
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:10,799
trying to grow the best you can

1809
01:00:07,838 --> 01:00:12,719
don't try to copy some giant scene

1810
01:00:10,798 --> 01:00:14,239
yeah they are not the way for you they

1811
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:16,318
are not growing as good of weed as you

1812
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:18,479
could on a smaller scale

1813
01:00:16,318 --> 01:00:19,920
you're like you're like a hobbyist slash

1814
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:22,000
farmer

1815
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:23,280
right yeah if you're gonna grow at scale

1816
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:25,039
you're gonna try to have to figure out

1817
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:26,798
how can i take the methods that i like

1818
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:28,318
and scale them up

1819
01:00:26,798 --> 01:00:30,239
yeah probably going to sacrifice some

1820
01:00:28,318 --> 01:00:31,119
quality at scale

1821
01:00:30,239 --> 01:00:32,479
you know

1822
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:34,318
and you know and if you're if you're

1823
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:36,559
trying to grow for seed then

1824
01:00:34,318 --> 01:00:38,639
you know then definitely you're not

1825
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:39,920
growing for flour

1826
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:41,199
you're probably going to want to add

1827
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:42,639
more nitrogen you're probably going to

1828
01:00:41,199 --> 01:00:43,838
want to top dress with some different

1829
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:46,719
things

1830
01:00:43,838 --> 01:00:49,358
you know i also like to use a and i'm

1831
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:51,838
i'm a sucker for power si just because i

1832
01:00:49,358 --> 01:00:53,358
used you know regular silica for so long

1833
01:00:51,838 --> 01:00:55,920
and didn't understand that it wasn't

1834
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:57,838
really very bioavailable for the plant

1835
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:59,599
and when i started using the power si

1836
01:00:57,838 --> 01:01:02,318
stuff because someone was asking about

1837
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:03,920
feeding for veg moms and stuff like that

1838
01:01:02,318 --> 01:01:05,759
that's probably one of the the biggest

1839
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:08,639
game changers for me was that specific

1840
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:10,480
additive monosalicic acid or ortholicic

1841
01:01:08,639 --> 01:01:12,400
acid because it makes it makes

1842
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:14,400
everything so readily and bioavailable

1843
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:16,798
it's just so fast how quick it uptakes

1844
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:18,880
nitrogen and everything that goes along

1845
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:20,719
with it and i should also say something

1846
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,920
too right like so whether you're organic

1847
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:23,679
or salt

1848
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:25,440
uh one of the big reasons why things

1849
01:01:23,679 --> 01:01:27,118
don't grow in winter is that the roots

1850
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:29,358
get too cold

1851
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:31,119
yeah and then the pores shrink

1852
01:01:29,358 --> 01:01:33,358
and when the pores shrink and the and

1853
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:35,119
the and the relationship between the

1854
01:01:33,358 --> 01:01:38,159
pressure both in the roots and within

1855
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:40,400
the the soil itself changes they can't

1856
01:01:38,159 --> 01:01:42,798
uptake salt

1857
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:43,838
so if you're feeding with 50 degree

1858
01:01:42,798 --> 01:01:45,599
water

1859
01:01:43,838 --> 01:01:47,679
and you've got and you're growing with

1860
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:49,359
like canna or you know or athena or any

1861
01:01:47,679 --> 01:01:50,960
of these things people are mentioning

1862
01:01:49,358 --> 01:01:52,719
and it's too cold your plants are all

1863
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:54,480
going to suffer because the plant's not

1864
01:01:52,719 --> 01:01:56,000
going to suck up the nutrition your ph

1865
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:57,679
can be perfect

1866
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,838
right it's not that the temperature is

1867
01:01:57,679 --> 01:02:01,598
too much for it it needs it needs a

1868
01:01:59,838 --> 01:02:03,358
certain temperature range

1869
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:05,760
yeah and there's also a thing too where

1870
01:02:03,358 --> 01:02:08,000
it's like water in the 80s holds like

1871
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:09,280
half the oxygen that water in the 60s

1872
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,599
holds

1873
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:14,400
so there's actually like a window there

1874
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:16,240
yeah where like the mid 60s to low 70s

1875
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:18,559
is probably the best ratio of like

1876
01:02:16,239 --> 01:02:20,558
absorbability versus like

1877
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:22,319
oxygen ratio because the only place your

1878
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:23,519
plant really absorbs oxygen is through

1879
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:25,759
its roots

1880
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:28,318
yeah it takes co2 in through the leaves

1881
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:30,559
and it takes o2 in through the roots

1882
01:02:28,318 --> 01:02:32,000
you know and when people over water

1883
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:34,559
that's what [Â __Â ] the plant up is

1884
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,000
there's no oxygen in there they can't

1885
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:37,519
that's the roots

1886
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,039
yeah the roots can't breathe so they

1887
01:02:37,519 --> 01:02:40,159
drown

1888
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:41,359
right

1889
01:02:40,159 --> 01:02:43,038
and so

1890
01:02:41,358 --> 01:02:44,480
you know there's an aspect where it's

1891
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:46,319
like if you're growing indoor and you

1892
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:47,760
want to be organic

1893
01:02:46,318 --> 01:02:49,279
there's trade-offs like you see these

1894
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:51,280
people that are like oh they're i'm on

1895
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:53,839
the 26th cycle

1896
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:56,640
you know i just add various amendments

1897
01:02:53,838 --> 01:02:58,159
over time i just water it the bio you

1898
01:02:56,639 --> 01:02:59,920
know the

1899
01:02:58,159 --> 01:03:01,358
the organic does what it needs to do the

1900
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,480
plant absorbs what it wants when it

1901
01:03:01,358 --> 01:03:04,239
wants

1902
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:06,639
but then i have people that grow organic

1903
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:08,479
that grow in pots and their whole goal

1904
01:03:06,639 --> 01:03:10,239
is to give it enough food to veg and

1905
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:12,159
bloom to where they want

1906
01:03:10,239 --> 01:03:14,078
and then run out of food

1907
01:03:12,159 --> 01:03:15,759
towards the end

1908
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:17,200
so that the plant starts to starve

1909
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:18,720
itself for nutrition and you start

1910
01:03:17,199 --> 01:03:20,480
getting all those beautiful autumn

1911
01:03:18,719 --> 01:03:21,919
colors on the plant

1912
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:23,519
yeah and then when you harvest it it's

1913
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:25,039
used up all of its excess because if

1914
01:03:23,519 --> 01:03:27,199
you're growing k f style or you're

1915
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:28,640
growing like stuff that's amended that

1916
01:03:27,199 --> 01:03:30,318
you just you know you're no-till and

1917
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:33,199
you're never changing it well then

1918
01:03:30,318 --> 01:03:35,038
you're never flushing for instance yeah

1919
01:03:33,199 --> 01:03:36,639
and so some people are a big believer in

1920
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:38,079
flush

1921
01:03:36,639 --> 01:03:40,078
you know whether you're even salt or

1922
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:41,519
organic some people want to give it just

1923
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:42,640
the amount of food it needs and then

1924
01:03:41,519 --> 01:03:44,960
starve it

1925
01:03:42,639 --> 01:03:47,279
yeah and some people give it chock-full

1926
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:48,079
food right up until the end of flower

1927
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,359
yeah

1928
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:50,798
and a lot of times when you're growing

1929
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:52,558
for a production

1930
01:03:50,798 --> 01:03:53,599
you know like people the other thing is

1931
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:55,440
is like when you're growing through

1932
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:57,519
flower and this always used to make me

1933
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:58,639
laugh right is that people want the best

1934
01:03:57,519 --> 01:03:59,440
weed

1935
01:03:58,639 --> 01:04:03,679
but

1936
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:03,679
one yellow leaf and you [Â __Â ] up

1937
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,400
you know they're looking at a bag and

1938
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:08,480
they're like oh there's a little bit of

1939
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:10,079
there's a tiny bit of brown in there

1940
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:11,519
yeah there's a tiny little bit of yellow

1941
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:12,720
you should give me a deal

1942
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:14,079
yeah this is some [Â __Â ] up wheat and

1943
01:04:12,719 --> 01:04:15,679
you're like no i flushed it for two

1944
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:17,920
weeks it's perfect

1945
01:04:15,679 --> 01:04:19,118
right that's supposed to look and yeah

1946
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:21,119
and they're like no no it's got some

1947
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:22,480
funk in it so a lot of people will just

1948
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:24,480
pump it

1949
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:26,240
right up until the day of harvest

1950
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:28,000
because it looks better because it looks

1951
01:04:26,239 --> 01:04:29,519
better to the broker it's not going to

1952
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,838
smoke as good

1953
01:04:29,519 --> 01:04:33,199
yeah but it looks better to the broker

1954
01:04:31,838 --> 01:04:34,639
yeah and that's what they care about

1955
01:04:33,199 --> 01:04:36,239
they don't want the broker to [Â __Â ] and

1956
01:04:34,639 --> 01:04:37,440
start kicking the tires and try to knock

1957
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:38,558
points off

1958
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,480
yeah

1959
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:41,760
right and so then people don't grow as

1960
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:44,639
nice a weed

1961
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:45,680
i mean there's even a thing where

1962
01:04:44,639 --> 01:04:48,078
like

1963
01:04:45,679 --> 01:04:50,239
you know uh i'll say this about the

1964
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:52,720
chems where it's like if you grow

1965
01:04:50,239 --> 01:04:54,879
the dog or what people call the chem 91

1966
01:04:52,719 --> 01:04:57,838
now and you take it what we all use to

1967
01:04:54,880 --> 01:05:01,280
take it which is about 70ish days

1968
01:04:57,838 --> 01:05:03,599
it usually tests between 18 and 22

1969
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:04,720
yeah and it knocks your head off

1970
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:08,480
right

1971
01:05:04,719 --> 01:05:10,719
but if you take it 53 or 54 days

1972
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:13,519
it'll still have white hairs all over it

1973
01:05:10,719 --> 01:05:14,399
but it'll test 28 to 32 percent

1974
01:05:13,519 --> 01:05:16,318
yeah

1975
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:18,798
and so a lot of people that like put it

1976
01:05:16,318 --> 01:05:20,480
on the market they take it early

1977
01:05:18,798 --> 01:05:23,119
right to get that high percentage

1978
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:25,358
because the the shop and the and the

1979
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:27,680
distro or whatever like it's one they

1980
01:05:25,358 --> 01:05:28,960
don't want to give you for a 19 or 21

1981
01:05:27,679 --> 01:05:31,038
percent weed they don't want to give you

1982
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:33,440
the price point that's so [Â __Â ] but if

1983
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:34,559
it's 31 so you'll you'll see weed and

1984
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:36,240
you're like i'll look at this weed and

1985
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:37,280
i'll be like that dog is like two weeks

1986
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:40,639
premium

1987
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:42,640
yeah but it tests at 30

1988
01:05:40,639 --> 01:05:44,639
and the shop is happy

1989
01:05:42,639 --> 01:05:46,239
yeah the distro is happy and they'll

1990
01:05:44,639 --> 01:05:49,519
give you your price

1991
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:51,919
yeah and it's not as good for the smoker

1992
01:05:49,519 --> 01:05:53,358
right but yeah a lot in a lot of cases

1993
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:54,480
like these regulations and these new

1994
01:05:53,358 --> 01:05:57,199
rules

1995
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:59,519
are not taking the smoker into account

1996
01:05:57,199 --> 01:06:02,558
i mean it in some sense though like i

1997
01:05:59,519 --> 01:06:05,119
think smokers may have priced themselves

1998
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:07,599
out just by

1999
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:07,599
just by

2000
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,880
absorbing

2001
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:14,319
things like cookies things things that

2002
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:15,920
are you know cardboardy with high thc

2003
01:06:14,318 --> 01:06:17,679
stuff and they were happy with it

2004
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:19,680
despite most people like when you really

2005
01:06:17,679 --> 01:06:21,519
ask them like do you really like like

2006
01:06:19,679 --> 01:06:22,798
that you know the form cut do you really

2007
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:24,798
like getting high off that like they'll

2008
01:06:22,798 --> 01:06:26,719
be like oh it's okay you know for 20

2009
01:06:24,798 --> 01:06:27,759
minutes or 10 minutes and then it's you

2010
01:06:26,719 --> 01:06:29,199
know whatever

2011
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:31,680
but

2012
01:06:29,199 --> 01:06:33,439
yeah they kind of let themselves be told

2013
01:06:31,679 --> 01:06:35,440
what to buy

2014
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:36,639
you know they do and this is where we

2015
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,318
ended up

2016
01:06:36,639 --> 01:06:39,838
they so there's an aspect one of the

2017
01:06:38,318 --> 01:06:41,440
things that's interesting

2018
01:06:39,838 --> 01:06:43,519
and it's something i mentioned before

2019
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:46,559
but it bears repeating i guess is like

2020
01:06:43,519 --> 01:06:48,400
the first four or five years that they

2021
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:52,000
published like the emerald cup and like

2022
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:54,000
some high times entries for thc

2023
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:56,079
and you were able to see

2024
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,838
like you know before people were

2025
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:59,440
breeding by numbers

2026
01:06:57,838 --> 01:07:02,078
before a lot of breeders were getting

2027
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:04,400
data on like what you know what what the

2028
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:08,240
thc content was almost everything that

2029
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:11,280
was winning was between 22 and 26

2030
01:07:08,239 --> 01:07:13,279
yeah there was like four or five things

2031
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:15,519
in the first five years

2032
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:18,240
like that ever tested in the upper 20s

2033
01:07:15,519 --> 01:07:20,079
or hit 30. yeah yeah right i can like

2034
01:07:18,239 --> 01:07:22,078
and two of them were chem 91 there was a

2035
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:24,720
strawberry cough there was another weird

2036
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:27,680
one remember how rare the 30 club used

2037
01:07:24,719 --> 01:07:28,519
to be yeah yeah it was unheard of until

2038
01:07:27,679 --> 01:07:31,358
like

2039
01:07:28,519 --> 01:07:34,480
2009 10 people started claiming the 30s

2040
01:07:31,358 --> 01:07:35,519
30 right and so now you have this so

2041
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,440
basically

2042
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:39,280
all the favorite weed that people were

2043
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:41,679
paying good digits for

2044
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:42,480
was coming in in the low to mid 20s at

2045
01:07:41,679 --> 01:07:44,078
best

2046
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:47,199
yeah so it basically means as soon as

2047
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:49,760
you hit high teens to mid 20s that's

2048
01:07:47,199 --> 01:07:51,038
where almost all the elites were falling

2049
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:54,880
yeah everything that everybody [Â __Â ]

2050
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:56,240
drools over from back then kush's sours

2051
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:57,280
[Â __Â ] all this [Â __Â ] was all hitting

2052
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:58,719
that range

2053
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:00,400
yeah and then people started growing

2054
01:07:58,719 --> 01:08:02,318
because shops were like i'll pay you

2055
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:04,798
more for higher thc

2056
01:08:02,318 --> 01:08:07,358
yeah so they start selecting

2057
01:08:04,798 --> 01:08:08,159
cuts that test better

2058
01:08:07,358 --> 01:08:10,719
yeah

2059
01:08:08,159 --> 01:08:12,000
not necessarily ones that smoke better

2060
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:15,038
and start

2061
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:17,039
selecting labs that test higher so now

2062
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:19,520
that's why i say breeding by numbers

2063
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:21,439
yeah so instead of breeding by smoke

2064
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:23,359
testing and what your friends think and

2065
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:24,559
how long lasting the high is like you

2066
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:26,798
were mentioning

2067
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:29,759
or how intense it might be they start

2068
01:08:26,798 --> 01:08:31,838
being like oh well this one tests at 32

2069
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:33,600
and four percent terpenes

2070
01:08:31,838 --> 01:08:36,479
there is no such thing as a [Â __Â ] high

2071
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:36,480
30 yet is there

2072
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:40,000
i mean

2073
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:42,960
so i mean there's there's a lot of

2074
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:44,798
things that people do like like uh you

2075
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:46,880
know csi have talked about this a bunch

2076
01:08:44,798 --> 01:08:47,838
where there's a lot of labs that over

2077
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:49,679
test

2078
01:08:47,838 --> 01:08:51,600
sure because it's good for the distro

2079
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:53,520
it's good for the store it makes an easy

2080
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:55,520
sale everybody likes it

2081
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:58,000
and so he's done experiments where he

2082
01:08:55,520 --> 01:09:00,080
sent things off to commercial labs and

2083
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,319
sent the same bud to a friend who he

2084
01:09:00,079 --> 01:09:04,318
knows is going to do an accurate test

2085
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:05,679
and it might be as much as five or eight

2086
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:08,239
percent different

2087
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:10,319
oh yeah i've seen it much different

2088
01:09:08,238 --> 01:09:12,479
vastly different it's insane but the

2089
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:13,920
thing is now you've got five or six or

2090
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:15,919
seven or eight years ten years or

2091
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:18,640
whatever breeding by numbers

2092
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:20,719
and there's a huge 30 plus percent club

2093
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:23,679
oh good good skunk master flex posted

2094
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:25,198
something that's 40 well there we go so

2095
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:28,719
you start getting higher and higher

2096
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:29,759
right and but then the effect sucks

2097
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:31,520
yeah

2098
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:34,719
so then what does it matter

2099
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:37,359
yeah you know i mean i had a blueberry

2100
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:39,600
purple punch tested 34 so you know

2101
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:41,279
anything's possible you can't even pull

2102
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,960
those numbers out of individually you

2103
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:45,679
know and what's crazy about that is when

2104
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:47,520
you think about 30 or 35 or 40 like matt

2105
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:49,838
was just laughing about that's the

2106
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:50,799
percentage of thc by weight on the

2107
01:09:49,838 --> 01:09:51,679
flower

2108
01:09:50,798 --> 01:09:54,158
yes

2109
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:55,760
so yes it's crazy because you start

2110
01:09:54,158 --> 01:09:57,279
getting these numbers and it's like is

2111
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:58,560
it just going to be

2112
01:09:57,279 --> 01:10:00,719
like

2113
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:02,719
you know how much thc can you pack on a

2114
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:04,399
plant yeah and how much is left for

2115
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:07,039
cannabinoids and other cannabinoids and

2116
01:10:04,399 --> 01:10:09,039
yeah and it's not obviously like alcohol

2117
01:10:07,039 --> 01:10:10,560
where everclear is stronger than vodka

2118
01:10:09,039 --> 01:10:12,560
which is stronger than wine which is

2119
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:13,360
stronger than beer it doesn't work like

2120
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:14,880
that

2121
01:10:13,359 --> 01:10:17,599
like there is

2122
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:19,520
there is a certain situation where like

2123
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:21,039
you know csi and i see fletch on there

2124
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:23,840
there's some old school strains that

2125
01:10:21,039 --> 01:10:26,079
only test like eight ten twelve percent

2126
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:30,079
yeah and they don't hit that hard but

2127
01:10:26,079 --> 01:10:32,000
once you get up to 18 to 20 to 22 to 24

2128
01:10:30,079 --> 01:10:34,079
that's where like all the elites and the

2129
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,840
old best weed faults

2130
01:10:34,079 --> 01:10:37,840
you know where most of the skunky stuff

2131
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:40,319
is falling right now that we've been

2132
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:41,679
looking at low teens

2133
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:42,840
no

2134
01:10:41,679 --> 01:10:46,000
four to

2135
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:48,159
eight four to eight for the most skunky

2136
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,479
stuff i mean you know the the mendo

2137
01:10:48,158 --> 01:10:53,359
perps is supposedly you know seed from

2138
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:55,519
the late 70s or whatever yeah um and it

2139
01:10:53,359 --> 01:10:56,639
tests you know eight or ten percent at

2140
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:58,800
best

2141
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:01,520
yeah some of the s1s can get up into the

2142
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:03,119
high teens yeah but the mom cut itself

2143
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:04,000
is pretty low

2144
01:11:03,119 --> 01:11:06,158
you know

2145
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,920
and i think that used to be super common

2146
01:11:06,158 --> 01:11:12,319
like i think even like old school skunk

2147
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:15,199
one right yeah it was 13 to 15 back then

2148
01:11:12,319 --> 01:11:17,679
yeah when they could get testing done

2149
01:11:15,198 --> 01:11:19,119
you know um and so we've gone from like

2150
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:19,920
the start of everything where things

2151
01:11:19,119 --> 01:11:22,319
were

2152
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:25,039
you know low to you know single high

2153
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:27,519
single digits to low teens to mid teens

2154
01:11:25,039 --> 01:11:29,039
to upper teens low 20s

2155
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:31,360
yeah and now it's all

2156
01:11:29,039 --> 01:11:33,198
maybe it's all fake or whatever but um

2157
01:11:31,359 --> 01:11:35,119
it doesn't seem like after a certain

2158
01:11:33,198 --> 01:11:37,359
point there's a big correlation between

2159
01:11:35,119 --> 01:11:39,279
high numbers and best effect

2160
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:40,639
no not at all

2161
01:11:39,279 --> 01:11:42,158
because my friend would get all pissed

2162
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:43,280
off because they'd be like dude i don't

2163
01:11:42,158 --> 01:11:44,719
know if

2164
01:11:43,279 --> 01:11:46,399
i don't know if i can get your weed for

2165
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:50,158
the right price this dog is only this

2166
01:11:46,399 --> 01:11:50,158
chem 91 only testing an 18

2167
01:11:50,319 --> 01:11:53,198
but it took your head off

2168
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:54,719
yeah

2169
01:11:53,198 --> 01:11:56,559
you know but they would rather take

2170
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:58,158
two-week preemie

2171
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:00,400
chem 91

2172
01:11:58,158 --> 01:12:01,599
because it tested 29.

2173
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:02,799
yeah

2174
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:04,880
right and so

2175
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:07,039
i just i just think that like people

2176
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:08,400
started rob the only thing that matters

2177
01:12:07,039 --> 01:12:10,479
is like how

2178
01:12:08,399 --> 01:12:12,000
how it affects you

2179
01:12:10,479 --> 01:12:14,799
and yes the more people get away with

2180
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:17,600
effects and like not testing stuff like

2181
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:20,480
by smoking it with a variety of humans

2182
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:22,400
yeah because even one person two people

2183
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:24,158
like some of my favorite weed is stuff

2184
01:12:22,399 --> 01:12:26,238
that matt doesn't like at all

2185
01:12:24,158 --> 01:12:28,158
yes just not that he doesn't appreciate

2186
01:12:26,238 --> 01:12:29,919
it it just doesn't make him feel good

2187
01:12:28,158 --> 01:12:32,559
yeah yeah some of it just [Â __Â ] me up

2188
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:34,319
like paranoid or anxiety or yeah yeah

2189
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:36,159
some people get some people get weirded

2190
01:12:34,319 --> 01:12:38,639
out some people love a buzz some people

2191
01:12:36,158 --> 01:12:39,839
like sativa i mean there's a range of of

2192
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:42,320
effect

2193
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:43,679
yeah and so i think if you get away from

2194
01:12:42,319 --> 01:12:46,319
like i don't think a bunch of people are

2195
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:47,679
doing smoke testing anymore

2196
01:12:46,319 --> 01:12:49,359
yeah they're trying to find something

2197
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:50,480
that looks impressive and tests

2198
01:12:49,359 --> 01:12:51,359
impressive

2199
01:12:50,479 --> 01:12:53,759
yeah

2200
01:12:51,359 --> 01:12:56,399
right and then all of a sudden now we

2201
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:57,199
have a bunch of like midzie elites

2202
01:12:56,399 --> 01:12:58,559
yeah

2203
01:12:57,198 --> 01:12:59,759
right

2204
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:01,199
we have a bunch of elites where it's

2205
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:02,480
like people are saying oh i hate fritter

2206
01:13:01,198 --> 01:13:04,319
you know like well there was a minute

2207
01:13:02,479 --> 01:13:05,599
there where like and people are growing

2208
01:13:04,319 --> 01:13:07,439
stuff because they're like oh this weed

2209
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:09,120
gets this amount of pound

2210
01:13:07,439 --> 01:13:12,079
yeah it's an elite

2211
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:13,920
so i'm gonna grow lemon cherry gelato

2212
01:13:12,079 --> 01:13:15,840
and i'm gonna grow this runts by this or

2213
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:18,880
i'm gonna grow this jealousy cut because

2214
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:21,600
my buddies can get top dollar for it

2215
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:23,359
and i'm not trying to call it mids

2216
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:24,880
but it's probably not going to stand the

2217
01:13:23,359 --> 01:13:27,279
test of time

2218
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:29,359
no you know like like right now sour is

2219
01:13:27,279 --> 01:13:32,639
coming back around diesels

2220
01:13:29,359 --> 01:13:34,559
yeah why because it's fireweed

2221
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:35,520
and it works and it smokes and it tastes

2222
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:38,080
great

2223
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:39,199
yeah you know and that we weed that

2224
01:13:38,079 --> 01:13:40,960
works

2225
01:13:39,198 --> 01:13:42,079
is always going to have a popularity

2226
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:44,079
basis

2227
01:13:42,079 --> 01:13:46,158
yeah where we that doesn't work you know

2228
01:13:44,079 --> 01:13:48,719
like you can only the hype boys can only

2229
01:13:46,158 --> 01:13:50,399
hype it for so long

2230
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:52,319
i mean burner can obviously sell the

2231
01:13:50,399 --> 01:13:55,039
[Â __Â ] out of anything

2232
01:13:52,319 --> 01:13:56,719
yeah yeah you know

2233
01:13:55,039 --> 01:13:58,719
he's great at promotion he's great at

2234
01:13:56,719 --> 01:14:01,119
getting hip hop and rat and various

2235
01:13:58,719 --> 01:14:02,960
stars smoking his weed and exclusive

2236
01:14:01,119 --> 01:14:05,279
spots and building up but he's a

2237
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:07,439
horrible horrible kisser

2238
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:09,759
i have no idea you know don't let him

2239
01:14:07,439 --> 01:14:11,678
lie to you he's a liar about that but

2240
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:13,199
there's an aspect where it's like you

2241
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:14,960
can only promote something for you can

2242
01:14:13,198 --> 01:14:16,000
only force people to like something for

2243
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:16,880
so long

2244
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,119
yeah

2245
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:20,079
before they make their own decision

2246
01:14:19,119 --> 01:14:21,840
yeah

2247
01:14:20,079 --> 01:14:23,439
right and so that's why

2248
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:25,039
that's why you have all this [Â __Â ] that

2249
01:14:23,439 --> 01:14:27,359
like gets like flash in the pan that

2250
01:14:25,039 --> 01:14:29,279
gets popular for eight or ten months

2251
01:14:27,359 --> 01:14:31,039
or a year or a year and a half

2252
01:14:29,279 --> 01:14:32,479
yeah and then it's gone it's replaced by

2253
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:34,640
some new hype

2254
01:14:32,479 --> 01:14:36,639
yep where things that used to get

2255
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:38,719
popular before like the purples or the

2256
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:41,280
cushes or the sours or whatever the

2257
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:42,880
skittles when they become organically

2258
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:44,479
popular

2259
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:46,319
right where it's like grassroots

2260
01:14:44,479 --> 01:14:49,599
popularity drives it

2261
01:14:46,319 --> 01:14:49,599
they're a lot more lasting

2262
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:53,280
than when it's hyped

2263
01:14:52,319 --> 01:14:55,359
you know

2264
01:14:53,279 --> 01:14:57,679
because hype has become marketing

2265
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:59,359
cannabis weed wasn't we wasn't ready for

2266
01:14:57,679 --> 01:15:00,079
modern marketing dude

2267
01:14:59,359 --> 01:15:01,679
no

2268
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:04,079
we weren't ready for it at all we were

2269
01:15:01,679 --> 01:15:07,679
so ripe to be abused by modern

2270
01:15:04,079 --> 01:15:09,359
advertising techniques yeah then like

2271
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:11,039
you know it just got overwhelmed and

2272
01:15:09,359 --> 01:15:12,880
people realized oh i don't even need to

2273
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:14,158
have good weed to make money

2274
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:15,520
ten years ago that [Â __Â ] wouldn't have

2275
01:15:14,158 --> 01:15:17,039
worked everybody would have laughed at a

2276
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:18,880
[Â __Â ] for trying to front that

2277
01:15:17,039 --> 01:15:21,119
hard you know but nowadays it's just

2278
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:22,880
flies ten years ago the only way

2279
01:15:21,119 --> 01:15:24,960
something became elite was when enough

2280
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:28,239
people that were respected decided it

2281
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:31,039
was good yeah and like or you know the

2282
01:15:28,238 --> 01:15:33,439
market demand or the market demanded it

2283
01:15:31,039 --> 01:15:34,800
yeah and the market really when it boils

2284
01:15:33,439 --> 01:15:36,799
down to it when you have stuff like the

2285
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:38,560
purple wave with the urkel and the mendo

2286
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:40,000
p and the grape ape and all those and

2287
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:41,920
granddaddy and all that or you have the

2288
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,479
cush wave in southern california or the

2289
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:46,399
sour thing that happened for 10 years

2290
01:15:44,479 --> 01:15:48,079
that was market dictated a bunch of a

2291
01:15:46,399 --> 01:15:49,279
bunch of people wanted to get as much of

2292
01:15:48,079 --> 01:15:50,559
it as they could

2293
01:15:49,279 --> 01:15:52,238
yeah because they knew that the

2294
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:53,840
customers would endlessly buy it and

2295
01:15:52,238 --> 01:15:56,000
they didn't get burned out

2296
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:58,800
yeah that's why you can have 40

2297
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:00,560
different [Â __Â ] named kush's in socal

2298
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:01,679
yeah i was trying to name them all the

2299
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:03,440
other day and it like made me want to

2300
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:04,960
pound my head against that because

2301
01:16:03,439 --> 01:16:07,678
there's literally like you could walk

2302
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:09,840
into you know 2010 you could walk into a

2303
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:12,000
dispensary in la and they would

2304
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:14,880
literally have like two dozen kinds of

2305
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:17,359
kush oh easily some of them had like 50

2306
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:18,719
60 different types of ogs yeah yeah all

2307
01:16:17,359 --> 01:16:20,079
these different names and some of them

2308
01:16:18,719 --> 01:16:21,039
were repeated and just somebody of

2309
01:16:20,079 --> 01:16:22,960
course

2310
01:16:21,039 --> 01:16:25,760
they just had different names yeah but

2311
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:28,239
yeah like the entire dispensary was one

2312
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:30,880
family of wheat and slight variations

2313
01:16:28,238 --> 01:16:32,158
yeah you know and you know from the east

2314
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:34,960
coast and different things coming to

2315
01:16:32,158 --> 01:16:38,879
california sauer was like endless

2316
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:40,239
yeah there was endless demand for gas

2317
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:42,400
you know and now

2318
01:16:40,238 --> 01:16:44,238
instead of seeing endless demand for one

2319
01:16:42,399 --> 01:16:45,839
or two things that people can focus on a

2320
01:16:44,238 --> 01:16:47,119
lot of growers are like what the [Â __Â ] do

2321
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:48,880
i even grow

2322
01:16:47,119 --> 01:16:50,079
yeah because if you're in the legal

2323
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:51,760
market

2324
01:16:50,079 --> 01:16:53,920
you don't have a direct connection with

2325
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:56,719
your consumer

2326
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:58,319
you have to get a distro and uh unless

2327
01:16:56,719 --> 01:17:00,800
you own them you have to get a distro

2328
01:16:58,319 --> 01:17:03,679
and then a dispensary to buy it

2329
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:05,840
i remember red um up in canada talking

2330
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:07,520
about that with the the canadian legal

2331
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:09,520
stuff about

2332
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:11,760
now they have the buyers or are people

2333
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:14,080
that aren't even from cannabis now and

2334
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:15,760
they are who determine what value you're

2335
01:17:14,079 --> 01:17:16,399
getting for your weed non-smoking oh

2336
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:18,239
yeah

2337
01:17:16,399 --> 01:17:20,158
corporate people honestly that was a

2338
01:17:18,238 --> 01:17:22,079
depressing part of that i really liked

2339
01:17:20,158 --> 01:17:24,158
that interview he was super personable

2340
01:17:22,079 --> 01:17:26,479
yeah that was hard to listen to

2341
01:17:24,158 --> 01:17:28,079
uh just the just the reality of what

2342
01:17:26,479 --> 01:17:29,279
matters and what doesn't

2343
01:17:28,079 --> 01:17:32,238
yeah and him

2344
01:17:29,279 --> 01:17:34,238
looking at at testing and paperwork

2345
01:17:32,238 --> 01:17:36,319
and deciding what to do without even

2346
01:17:34,238 --> 01:17:38,399
seeing the wheat because if it didn't

2347
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:40,559
have the testing and the paperwork right

2348
01:17:38,399 --> 01:17:42,879
it was irrelevant yeah it just didn't

2349
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:44,480
matter and so a lot of times okay

2350
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:46,880
there's a lot of stuff out there that's

2351
01:17:44,479 --> 01:17:48,079
really fireweed and the reason why you

2352
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:49,760
can't get it

2353
01:17:48,079 --> 01:17:51,679
is because it doesn't make financial

2354
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:53,679
sense for the grower to grow it because

2355
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:54,560
the people that are in between him and

2356
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:56,560
you

2357
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:58,800
don't want to do it

2358
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:01,039
yeah so you get [Â __Â ]

2359
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:02,719
you personally out there you get [Â __Â ]

2360
01:18:01,039 --> 01:18:03,760
because the growers friends get to have

2361
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:05,600
it

2362
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:07,440
sometimes you know it gets traded

2363
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:08,800
amongst each other it gets survived and

2364
01:18:07,439 --> 01:18:11,198
all that you know

2365
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:13,760
but the consumer doesn't get to see it

2366
01:18:11,198 --> 01:18:15,119
yeah you know and we were joking i'll

2367
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:16,719
mention it one more time because there's

2368
01:18:15,119 --> 01:18:18,238
there's this you know huge grow that's

2369
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:20,079
getting set up in socal it's like over

2370
01:18:18,238 --> 01:18:21,119
100 acres and everybody was ragging on

2371
01:18:20,079 --> 01:18:23,439
them or whatever because it's like

2372
01:18:21,119 --> 01:18:25,119
another big corporate takeover type

2373
01:18:23,439 --> 01:18:26,479
thing right yeah and you look at their

2374
01:18:25,119 --> 01:18:30,158
clone list and they're getting a bunch

2375
01:18:26,479 --> 01:18:32,158
of gelato hybrids and skittles hybrids

2376
01:18:30,158 --> 01:18:34,000
right like the market is under

2377
01:18:32,158 --> 01:18:35,119
underserved right now with gelato and

2378
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:38,238
skittles

2379
01:18:35,119 --> 01:18:40,640
yeah they really got to fill that niche

2380
01:18:38,238 --> 01:18:43,119
yeah of course not you know

2381
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:43,920
and so and you know if if customers

2382
01:18:43,119 --> 01:18:45,760
could

2383
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:47,840
buy straight from the farm or straight

2384
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:49,440
from cooperatives or whatever

2385
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:51,840
you know then cooperatives would be able

2386
01:18:49,439 --> 01:18:53,759
to grow more niche weed

2387
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:56,079

2426
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:16,159
there's like you know consumers don't

2427
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:18,400
have power

2428
01:20:16,158 --> 01:20:19,839
to demand they have to go to the store

2429
01:20:18,399 --> 01:20:21,839
and they have to buy what the store

2430
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:23,679
wants to put in their store

2431
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:25,360
yeah

2432
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:27,920
you know and that that might be getting

2433
01:20:25,359 --> 01:20:29,519
chosen based on their margin

2434
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:31,600
there's this company up by me [Â __Â ]

ton of money do you know i don't know if

2437
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:37,920
people know this but like there's a lot

2438
01:20:35,279 --> 01:20:40,319
of big companies that pay dispensaries

2439
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:41,199
for shelf space

2440
01:20:40,319 --> 01:20:42,719
yeah

2441
01:20:41,198 --> 01:20:44,399
straight self space

2442
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:45,279
shelf space

2443
01:20:44,399 --> 01:20:46,799
like

2444
01:20:45,279 --> 01:20:49,519
you know and that and that's a profit

2445
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:51,679
they make just to put the [Â __Â ] the

2446
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:53,679
weed on the shelf so the consumer can

2455
01:21:07,439 --> 01:21:10,319
to play it so people hear it and they

2456
01:21:08,719 --> 01:21:11,600
want to go buy your album

2457
01:21:10,319 --> 01:21:13,439
yeah and there's people that were

2458
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:15,280
getting bribed to play certain things

2459
01:21:13,439 --> 01:21:17,198
and not play others

2460
01:21:15,279 --> 01:21:18,399
yep i'm connecting it to music again but

2461
01:21:17,198 --> 01:21:19,919
it's the same [Â __Â ] thing these

2462
01:21:18,399 --> 01:21:21,839
dispensaries because there's not enough

2463
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:24,000
of them they're deciding what gets on

2464
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:26,480
their shelf and not and they're deciding

2465
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,399
it what's based on what's good for them

2466
01:21:26,479 --> 01:21:30,238
yeah not what's good for the consumer

2467
01:21:28,399 --> 01:21:32,319
out there what's good for them

2468
01:21:30,238 --> 01:21:35,279
yeah you know so

2469
01:21:32,319 --> 01:21:37,439
choice has actually gone down

2470
01:21:35,279 --> 01:21:40,399
quite a bit quite a bit expenses up

2471
01:21:37,439 --> 01:21:42,479
quality is down choice is down and how

2472
01:21:40,399 --> 01:21:44,879
do you how do you like let's say that

2473
01:21:42,479 --> 01:21:46,718
that you know csi or somebody like or me

2474
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:48,560
or whoever fletch comes up with an

2475
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:49,600
amazing new hybrid

2476
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:51,199
yeah

2477
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:52,639
right unless you're vertically

2478
01:21:51,198 --> 01:21:54,319
integrated and you can control the

2479
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:56,480
supply chain you can't even guarantee

2480
01:21:54,319 --> 01:21:58,399
you're gonna get it in a shop

2481
01:21:56,479 --> 01:22:00,638
oh yeah you can't guarantee at all that

2482
01:21:58,399 --> 01:22:02,000
a bud tender will give a [Â __Â ]

2483
01:22:00,639 --> 01:22:03,600
yeah

2484
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,679
you know so

2485
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:07,360
it's like a whole deluge of like

2486
01:22:05,679 --> 01:22:08,639
everything that's already already

2487
01:22:07,359 --> 01:22:11,759
popular

2488
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:14,639
and variations on that theme

2489
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:17,199
you know and it gets controlled and so

2490
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:19,039
the reason why i think that all these

2491
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:21,039
elites from i always talk about like the

2492
01:22:19,039 --> 01:22:24,000
90s and the early 2000s are still my

2493
01:22:21,039 --> 01:22:28,800
favorite era of weed is it's because the

2494
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,800
best weed from then was consumer choice

2495
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:34,159
sorry i just read that question popped

2496
01:22:31,439 --> 01:22:36,238
up after everything we said

2497
01:22:34,158 --> 01:22:38,479
anyway yeah anyway but you know but yeah

2498
01:22:36,238 --> 01:22:41,439
that you know it it all the you know

2499
01:22:38,479 --> 01:22:42,799
sour became popular kush became popular

2500
01:22:41,439 --> 01:22:44,319
because people wanted it they were

2501
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:45,920
willing to spend a bunch of money on it

2502
01:22:44,319 --> 01:22:48,079
there was demand

2503
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:50,239
and yeah you know and and and people

2504
01:22:48,079 --> 01:22:51,119
wanted to fill that demand

2505
01:22:50,238 --> 01:22:53,439
yeah

2506
01:22:51,119 --> 01:22:55,198
and now it's like oh it's you know it's

2507
01:22:53,439 --> 01:22:57,198
here's a bunch of here's a bunch of weed

2508
01:22:55,198 --> 01:23:00,000
and with nurseries people might not know

2509
01:22:57,198 --> 01:23:01,279
this but most most like cultivators

2510
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,800
they don't even get to keep their own

2511
01:23:01,279 --> 01:23:04,079
mom house they have to get it from a

2512
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:06,480
nursery

2513
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:08,639
that's so wild and then the nursery

2514
01:23:06,479 --> 01:23:10,238
might offer 10 or 15 different things

2515
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:11,760
for this season

2516
01:23:10,238 --> 01:23:13,759
they might have 100 things but they're

2517
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:16,560
only they only mommed up enough to do

2518
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:18,960
like a lot of certain stuff

2519
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:21,840
yeah so then you're you're forced to

2520
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:24,158
operate off their menu

2521
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:25,840
so it's like the nursery limits you

2522
01:23:24,158 --> 01:23:27,759
right like when i was working in a big

2523
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:30,239
scene a couple of years ago i was trying

2524
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:32,639
to find some some some real sour diesel

2525
01:23:30,238 --> 01:23:33,759
like on the legal market metric

2526
01:23:32,639 --> 01:23:35,840
yeah

2527
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:37,039
and i couldn't find it pure

2528
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:39,199
of course the best thing i could find

2529
01:23:37,039 --> 01:23:41,920
was spy rock sour which was some sour

2530
01:23:39,198 --> 01:23:43,439
across to some kush

2531
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:45,520
i couldn't find it pure to grow on the

2532
01:23:43,439 --> 01:23:46,319
farm i was consulting at

2533
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:48,560
yeah

2534
01:23:46,319 --> 01:23:50,000
you know but back in the day in 215 you

2535
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:51,679
could be like oh we're gonna fill these

2536
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,039
four greenhouses with this

2537
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:55,199
yeah and then we're gonna take duffel

2538
01:23:53,039 --> 01:23:57,279
bags to the dispensary

2539
01:23:55,198 --> 01:23:59,279
and then you're gonna buy it

2540
01:23:57,279 --> 01:24:02,479
and people are gonna be stoked

2541
01:23:59,279 --> 01:24:04,158
64 ruin the [Â __Â ] world most of most

2542
01:24:02,479 --> 01:24:06,079
of most of uh

2543
01:24:04,158 --> 01:24:08,638
most of the good cushion a lot of the

2544
01:24:06,079 --> 01:24:10,158
good kush that was in la came from my

2545
01:24:08,639 --> 01:24:12,319
neck of the woods

2546
01:24:10,158 --> 01:24:14,079
yeah there was constantly brokers coming

2547
01:24:12,319 --> 01:24:16,719
up that their entire job was just to

2548
01:24:14,079 --> 01:24:19,279
grab excess capacity from up here and

2549
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:21,439
bring it down to the the socal

2550
01:24:19,279 --> 01:24:22,399
you know dispensaries

2551
01:24:21,439 --> 01:24:24,960
yeah

2552
01:24:22,399 --> 01:24:26,559
you know and and so people could go hunt

2553
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:28,560
the best weed

2554
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:29,679
and then go and then the and then the

2555
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:31,520
you know the

2556
01:24:29,679 --> 01:24:33,520
the uh dispensaries could pick the best

2557
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:34,960
wheat if they wanted to

2558
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:36,159
yeah now it's like they have to buy it

2559
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:37,760
from a dispenser they have to buy it

2560
01:24:36,158 --> 01:24:39,920
from a distro and the distro has to buy

2561
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:42,000
it from a farmer and it just turned

2562
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:43,119
everything into like a commodity

2563
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,880
yeah

2564
01:24:43,119 --> 01:24:46,880
you know and so as a result of that

2565
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:48,880
everybody i never thought i was worried

2566
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:50,800
about a bunch of [Â __Â ] with legalization

2567
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:53,440
i never thought that like we would

2568
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:55,920
accept way higher prices than the black

2569
01:24:53,439 --> 01:24:57,198
market or the gray market and shittier

2570
01:24:55,920 --> 01:25:00,079
quality

2571
01:24:57,198 --> 01:25:00,960
yeah but so far that's what we've gotten

2572
01:25:00,079 --> 01:25:02,479
yep

2573
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:04,399
sure is

2574
01:25:02,479 --> 01:25:06,399
you know that's what we've got

2575
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:07,439
and so you know we started off talking

2576
01:25:06,399 --> 01:25:08,879
about

2577
01:25:07,439 --> 01:25:10,960
and the reason why we've gotten that is

2578
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:13,199
because you have all these

2579
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:15,359
commercial farms that have intense

2580
01:25:13,198 --> 01:25:17,119
pressure with taxes and overhead and

2581
01:25:15,359 --> 01:25:19,039
regulations and paying out all this

2582
01:25:17,119 --> 01:25:22,800
[Â __Â ] money right

2583
01:25:19,039 --> 01:25:24,800
and quality and consumer happiness is

2584
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:27,039
like they do the best they can in some

2585
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:28,480
instances but it's not that great

2586
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:30,880
but they're doing the best they can with

2587
01:25:28,479 --> 01:25:31,678
the constraints they're put under

2588
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:33,520
yeah

2589
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:35,199
and a lot of little things that used to

2590
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:36,560
get done to make weed nice is getting

2591
01:25:35,198 --> 01:25:40,079
eliminated

2592
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:41,360
yeah and so your weed isn't as nice

2593
01:25:40,079 --> 01:25:43,359
you know when people talk about all the

2594
01:25:41,359 --> 01:25:44,880
time your weed is fire your weeds not

2595
01:25:43,359 --> 01:25:45,679
fire

2596
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:48,159
yeah

2597
01:25:45,679 --> 01:25:49,760
you know and a lot of times

2598
01:25:48,158 --> 01:25:51,279
it's like some of these things like the

2599
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:52,719
emerald cup and all this different [Â __Â ]

2600
01:25:51,279 --> 01:25:53,519
you know

2601
01:25:52,719 --> 01:25:55,119
like

2602
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:56,400
and i'm not saying this i've known tim

2603
01:25:55,119 --> 01:25:59,119
for a long time so this isn't a

2604
01:25:56,399 --> 01:26:00,879
disadvantage on any level but

2605
01:25:59,119 --> 01:26:03,039
when you're forced to basically like for

2606
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:05,279
the most part only accept from like

2607
01:26:03,039 --> 01:26:06,880
licensed buyers

2608
01:26:05,279 --> 01:26:08,800
people aren't entering the best weed in

2609
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:10,239
california anymore

2610
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:12,079
no no

2611
01:26:10,238 --> 01:26:13,759
because you have to cut off this large

2612
01:26:12,079 --> 01:26:15,760
segment of the population that used to

2613
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:17,119
win [Â __Â ] cups

2614
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:18,960
yeah that used to be able to come there

2615
01:26:17,119 --> 01:26:19,920
with their perfectly grown greenhouse

2616
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:21,279
weed

2617
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:23,119
from their little greenhouse that they

2618
01:26:21,279 --> 01:26:25,359
treated perfect and they got to give two

2619
01:26:23,119 --> 01:26:27,359
four two to four ounces to the testing

2620
01:26:25,359 --> 01:26:30,000
and then they placed third

2621
01:26:27,359 --> 01:26:31,359
yeah oh but you know but but the thing

2622
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,880
is the difference fletcher's like stop

2623
01:26:31,359 --> 01:26:34,399
[Â __Â ] on my weed the difference

2624
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:36,560
between fletcher from one like from

2625
01:26:34,399 --> 01:26:38,719
archive from what i understand is that

2626
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:41,440
they have a dispensary

2627
01:26:38,719 --> 01:26:43,520
yes they have control archives can make

2628
01:26:41,439 --> 01:26:45,599
a choice to i'm like i'm going to take

2629
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:46,719
the moonbow i'm going to take this that

2630
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:48,480
i love

2631
01:26:46,719 --> 01:26:49,520
and i'm going to make sure consumers get

2632
01:26:48,479 --> 01:26:50,638
it

2633
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:51,760
yeah

2634
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:54,560
right

2635
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:57,039
so but most farmers most farmers in

2636
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:59,039
california aren't vertically integrated

2637
01:26:57,039 --> 01:27:00,800
yeah they have to sell their we they

2638
01:26:59,039 --> 01:27:02,079
have to sell their wheat

2639
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:03,600
you know and so if you're vertically

2640
01:27:02,079 --> 01:27:06,000
integrated then you can have some

2641
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:07,360
uniqueness and you can choose like he

2642
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,880
could choose to take things that he

2643
01:27:07,359 --> 01:27:10,719
doesn't want to share

2644
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:12,400
and you can only come to his stores to

2645
01:27:10,719 --> 01:27:14,880
get them

2646
01:27:12,399 --> 01:27:17,198
it's no fair [Â __Â ]

2647
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:19,279
you know and a lot of people are cut off

2648
01:27:17,198 --> 01:27:21,119
and a lot of people's top shelf yeah

2649
01:27:19,279 --> 01:27:22,399
dispensaries top shelf

2650
01:27:21,119 --> 01:27:24,399
used to be

2651
01:27:22,399 --> 01:27:25,599
six to 20 lighters

2652
01:27:24,399 --> 01:27:28,879
yeah

2653
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:30,719
you know done by small scale people

2654
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:33,359
and that was constantly filling the top

2655
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:35,359
shelf because that was the top shelf

2656
01:27:33,359 --> 01:27:36,880
yep now all those people are [Â __Â ] cut

2657
01:27:35,359 --> 01:27:38,799
off

2658
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:40,239
and what used to be the midzie shelf is

2659
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:41,840
now top shelf

2660
01:27:40,238 --> 01:27:44,399
for more money a lot of those people are

2661
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:46,800
looking for new [Â __Â ] jobs

2662
01:27:44,399 --> 01:27:49,359
you know and so a lot of the best weed

2663
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:50,639
got cut off from consumers

2664
01:27:49,359 --> 01:27:54,158
yeah

2665
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:56,159
you know before they could even smoke it

2666
01:27:54,158 --> 01:27:57,119
you know i you can't like i don't know

2667
01:27:56,158 --> 01:28:00,319
you can't

2668
01:27:57,119 --> 01:28:01,359
you can't get real haze in california

2669
01:28:00,319 --> 01:28:02,158
yeah

2670
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:03,920
no

2671
01:28:02,158 --> 01:28:06,000
you can't get real sour diesel it's

2672
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:09,199
starting to make a comeback maybe it'll

2673
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:10,880
start forcing itself on some shelves

2674
01:28:09,198 --> 01:28:12,719
yeah yeah

2675
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:14,480
but there's only but then there's all

2676
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:16,158
this stuff too where it's like

2677
01:28:14,479 --> 01:28:17,519
these vertically integrated companies

2678
01:28:16,158 --> 01:28:19,279
like if you're going to get from jungle

2679
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:20,639
boys or whoever you're probably going to

2680
01:28:19,279 --> 01:28:21,920
get mostly their weed that they're

2681
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:24,079
growing because they want to sell their

2682
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:26,000
weed through their outlet

2683
01:28:24,079 --> 01:28:28,158
yeah

2684
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:30,079
too so then you know you get the

2685
01:28:28,158 --> 01:28:31,679
selection from them

2686
01:28:30,079 --> 01:28:33,920
you know and a lot of these dispensaries

2687
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:35,760
have captured markets

2688
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:37,679
so what you're getting

2689
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:38,960
is you're getting a lot of commercially

2690
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:41,440
grown weed

2691
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:45,198
that they're trying to grow for cheap

2692
01:28:41,439 --> 01:28:46,960
and get a minimum level of quality

2693
01:28:45,198 --> 01:28:49,359
and then you're trapped because you can

2694
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:50,719
only there's only you know 700 stores in

2695
01:28:49,359 --> 01:28:52,799
california

2696
01:28:50,719 --> 01:28:55,520
you got to buy it in one of them and you

2697
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:57,760
can't really get great deals so you end

2698
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:59,120
up like getting a bunch of expensive

2699
01:28:57,760 --> 01:29:01,920
commercial

2700
01:28:59,119 --> 01:29:05,039
yeah and that access to that actual top

2701
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:06,960
self top shelf that actual fire that was

2702
01:29:05,039 --> 01:29:08,800
treated deliciously and grown perfectly

2703
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:10,960
with organic or salt or whatever and all

2704
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:12,320
the little things done the right way

2705
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:13,520
yeah you don't even get to see that

2706
01:29:12,319 --> 01:29:16,799
anymore

2707
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:18,400
yeah like you know what's funny is uh

2708
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:21,520
all these american beer companies were

2709
01:29:18,399 --> 01:29:22,719
never winning any any beer awards

2710
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:24,560
did you know that

2711
01:29:22,719 --> 01:29:26,560
right no so these all these like

2712
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:28,960
international competitions

2713
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:30,880
obviously like michelob and milwaukee's

2714
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:32,719
best and budweiser and all that we're

2715
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:34,960
never winning any gold medals at any of

2716
01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:38,319
these at any of these competitions the

2717
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:40,000
beast wasn't winning medals no so they

2718
01:29:38,319 --> 01:29:42,158
made their own

2719
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,520
they made their own category american

2720
01:29:42,158 --> 01:29:45,439
lager

2721
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:47,360
oh now so now a bunch of these companies

2722
01:29:45,439 --> 01:29:48,960
have gold medals

2723
01:29:47,359 --> 01:29:50,719
because they were only [Â __Â ] competing

2724
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:52,480
against themselves

2725
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:54,319
yeah right when they were competing

2726
01:29:52,479 --> 01:29:56,000
against other microbreweries and places

2727
01:29:54,319 --> 01:29:57,599
from belgium and germany and all that

2728
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,760
[Â __Â ] they had no chance

2729
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:02,159
yeah their beer wasn't as good

2730
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:04,239
yeah right so now you're getting the

2731
01:30:02,158 --> 01:30:06,638
same thing here where you're getting all

2732
01:30:04,238 --> 01:30:07,759
these big factory farms and they're like

2733
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:09,920
do you want

2734
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:12,159
old style do you want old milwaukee do

2735
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:13,840
you want michelob do you want budweiser

2736
01:30:12,158 --> 01:30:16,319
do you want coors

2737
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:18,319
yeah you know like oh you want some hedy

2738
01:30:16,319 --> 01:30:20,559
how about some heineken

2739
01:30:18,319 --> 01:30:22,559
yeah oh well it's maybe some amstel

2740
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:24,159
light get an import

2741
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:25,920
right and that's what they're you're

2742
01:30:24,158 --> 01:30:27,519
competing against you'd actually can't

2743
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:29,039
get these little

2744
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:31,120
you can't get these little things where

2745
01:30:29,039 --> 01:30:33,439
the quality really matters

2746
01:30:31,119 --> 01:30:35,519
and until they open that stuff up so if

2747
01:30:33,439 --> 01:30:37,119
you're growing for yourself

2748
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:40,159
i said it before

2749
01:30:37,119 --> 01:30:42,880
don't emulate some big farm

2750
01:30:40,158 --> 01:30:44,559
yeah they're cutting corners

2751
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:46,960
they're doing things that only work at

2752
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:46,960
scale

2753
01:30:47,119 --> 01:30:51,760
you know uh and and all that right like

2754
01:30:50,079 --> 01:30:52,960
do things there's there's a there's a i

2755
01:30:51,760 --> 01:30:54,639
mean it's i don't want to get too

2756
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:55,600
technical because i'm trying to keep it

2757
01:30:54,639 --> 01:30:56,719
general

2758
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:59,679
enough

2759
01:30:56,719 --> 01:31:01,119
that like uh you know it it stays fairly

2760
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:02,639
popular because i don't know how many

2761
01:31:01,119 --> 01:31:05,198
people are actual growers on this thing

2762
01:31:02,639 --> 01:31:06,159
versus just smokers or whatever but yeah

2763
01:31:05,198 --> 01:31:07,839
um

2764
01:31:06,158 --> 01:31:09,519
but yeah it's it's it's there's an

2765
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:10,800
aspect where it's like plants don't

2766
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:13,520
drink the same

2767
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:14,960
it's really hard to like just automate

2768
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:18,000
everything

2769
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:20,560
and there is microclimates even like

2770
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:22,319
this and reversing a shitload how how

2771
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:23,920
one clone to the next clone won't

2772
01:31:22,319 --> 01:31:25,759
reverse the same way even if they're two

2773
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:27,359
feet apart from each other or a foot

2774
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:28,480
apart from each other getting the same

2775
01:31:27,359 --> 01:31:30,799
exact feed

2776
01:31:28,479 --> 01:31:32,479
microclimates a real thing too so

2777
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:34,480
climate and some of those big rooms the

2778
01:31:32,479 --> 01:31:36,559
microclimates are really different

2779
01:31:34,479 --> 01:31:38,079
yeah you know and i mean we haven't even

2780
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:39,760
talked about spectrum

2781
01:31:38,079 --> 01:31:41,840
but yeah that has a big roof you're not

2782
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:43,920
growing with with the sun

2783
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:45,600
um one of the best lights to this day is

2784
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:48,000
still the single-ended old-school

2785
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:50,480
hortilux thousand

2786
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:52,399
a lot of these grown under double ended

2787
01:31:50,479 --> 01:31:54,238
and stuff like that like a lot of them

2788
01:31:52,399 --> 01:31:55,679
people are choosing spectrums that give

2789
01:31:54,238 --> 01:31:57,839
the most weight

2790
01:31:55,679 --> 01:31:58,960
yeah and not blends that give a better

2791
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:00,400
quality

2792
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:03,439
yeah

2793
01:32:00,399 --> 01:32:05,119
you know uh and because because we're

2794
01:32:03,439 --> 01:32:07,519
not in a position yet it's like such a

2795
01:32:05,119 --> 01:32:08,319
regulated and taxed industry

2796
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:10,320
that

2797
01:32:08,319 --> 01:32:11,198
the best isn't allowed to bubble to the

2798
01:32:10,319 --> 01:32:13,039
top

2799
01:32:11,198 --> 01:32:16,559
yeah it's controlled

2800
01:32:13,039 --> 01:32:18,479
by dispensaries by dyspo's by burner by

2801
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:20,639
people popularizing things by

2802
01:32:18,479 --> 01:32:22,319
celebrities stepping in and people

2803
01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:23,920
throwing their money around

2804
01:32:22,319 --> 01:32:25,679
and so that's why that's why if you're

2805
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:27,760
if you're bummed at how your the weed

2806
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:28,800
sucks in clubs that's why

2807
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:30,639
yeah

2808
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:33,199
because consumer choice has gone way

2809
01:32:30,639 --> 01:32:36,400
down since 215.

2810
01:32:33,198 --> 01:32:38,479
we are at an hour and a half right now

2811
01:32:36,399 --> 01:32:40,719
dang people we want to start winding it

2812
01:32:38,479 --> 01:32:42,399
down we could start doing the [Â __Â ] you

2813
01:32:40,719 --> 01:32:44,639
want to take some questions or i could

2814
01:32:42,399 --> 01:32:46,559
take some questions i mean i could talk

2815
01:32:44,639 --> 01:32:48,159
to maybe i'll talk for five or ten

2816
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:49,920
minutes even though we're winding it

2817
01:32:48,158 --> 01:32:51,920
down because i haven't uh i haven't

2818
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:53,760
talked about it but

2819
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:55,039
aside from nutrition and environment

2820
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:56,320
which we kind of talked about a little

2821
01:32:55,039 --> 01:32:58,560
bit before

2822
01:32:56,319 --> 01:33:00,238
um the spectrum that the plants grow

2823
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:01,679
under makes a big difference

2824
01:33:00,238 --> 01:33:04,479
yeah and that could probably be its own

2825
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:06,960
whole show but just in general plants

2826
01:33:04,479 --> 01:33:09,198
developed underneath the sun which has

2827
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:11,198
all the spectrum all the time everything

2828
01:33:09,198 --> 01:33:13,519
from uv to

2829
01:33:11,198 --> 01:33:14,399
you know ev every color

2830
01:33:13,520 --> 01:33:16,400
huge

2831
01:33:14,399 --> 01:33:18,158
where most indoor lights are

2832
01:33:16,399 --> 01:33:20,879
approximations of that and they have

2833
01:33:18,158 --> 01:33:23,039
relatively narrow spectrums yeah right

2834
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:24,880
and you put plants underneath them

2835
01:33:23,039 --> 01:33:26,319
and they grow vastly differently

2836
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:27,440
depending on what kind of light they're

2837
01:33:26,319 --> 01:33:29,840
exposed to

2838
01:33:27,439 --> 01:33:31,519
yeah we used to 20 years ago when there

2839
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:33,679
wasn't all these other lights we would

2840
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:35,360
grow one light of metal halide

2841
01:33:33,679 --> 01:33:36,480
and the buds would come out half the

2842
01:33:35,359 --> 01:33:38,079
size

2843
01:33:36,479 --> 01:33:40,559
but they would burn better and they'd be

2844
01:33:38,079 --> 01:33:41,439
way frostier than the hps stuff

2845
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:43,360
yeah

2846
01:33:41,439 --> 01:33:45,198
now you see all this stuff with ceramics

2847
01:33:43,359 --> 01:33:48,158
and leds and this and that and

2848
01:33:45,198 --> 01:33:50,399
everything else and it's like

2849
01:33:48,158 --> 01:33:52,158
different plants some plants respond to

2850
01:33:50,399 --> 01:33:55,039
like a different different types of

2851
01:33:52,158 --> 01:33:57,679
light and do well regardless some plants

2852
01:33:55,039 --> 01:33:59,439
do phenomenal under one type of light

2853
01:33:57,679 --> 01:34:00,719
and then like you move them and you

2854
01:33:59,439 --> 01:34:02,079
think oh i'm gonna put them under this

2855
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:03,198
and it's gonna do great and then they

2856
01:34:02,079 --> 01:34:05,039
hate it

2857
01:34:03,198 --> 01:34:07,119
yeah because they're not getting

2858
01:34:05,039 --> 01:34:09,198
sometimes you'd see people where

2859
01:34:07,119 --> 01:34:10,559
they were growing all these straight

2860
01:34:09,198 --> 01:34:11,759
hps's

2861
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:13,440
and then they'd have straight up

2862
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:14,960
old-school metal halides like hanging

2863
01:34:13,439 --> 01:34:16,799
from the ceiling

2864
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:18,800
yeah you mean the vertical ones yeah

2865
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:20,400
vertical just just to give but i just

2866
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:22,320
mean i still got scars from those

2867
01:34:20,399 --> 01:34:24,000
[Â __Â ] but just just to give a

2868
01:34:22,319 --> 01:34:26,000
different spectrum like not to be the

2869
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,960
majority of it but just to shine some

2870
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,359
blue

2871
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:31,520
yeah so the plants had that to use and

2872
01:34:29,359 --> 01:34:33,679
you remember like the crusty buckets

2873
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:37,040
yeah that guy's that guy swore if you

2874
01:34:33,679 --> 01:34:38,639
didn't have 25 metal halide light

2875
01:34:37,039 --> 01:34:39,600
you couldn't get those kind of huge

2876
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:42,400
plants

2877
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:44,480
yeah he swore if you if you had all hps

2878
01:34:42,399 --> 01:34:46,399
you get you get shittier wheat

2879
01:34:44,479 --> 01:34:48,718
yeah in order to get the size and the

2880
01:34:46,399 --> 01:34:50,719
frost you needed some blue

2881
01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:52,319
yeah and that's partially why the old

2882
01:34:50,719 --> 01:34:54,000
hps single ended a lot of people

2883
01:34:52,319 --> 01:34:55,198
considered them to be the best

2884
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:58,800
all-around light and they were the

2885
01:34:55,198 --> 01:35:00,719
standard because they had 25 more blue

2886
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:03,760
yeah you look at their spectrum versus

2887
01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:06,480
like a double-ended right now that's hps

2888
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:09,440
and the hps is almost all orange and red

2889
01:35:06,479 --> 01:35:11,118
yeah very little uv very little and so i

2890
01:35:09,439 --> 01:35:13,359
have a bunch of plants like my headband

2891
01:35:11,118 --> 01:35:14,559
and my sours and dog and stuff

2892
01:35:13,359 --> 01:35:16,719
you know and you grow them under

2893
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:19,760
different lights i grew that i grew the

2894
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:22,079
dog once under pure ceramic

2895
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:23,760
yeah i cut it at 85 days and it still

2896
01:35:22,079 --> 01:35:25,679
had white hairs

2897
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:28,560
yeah and you know what's weird is that i

2898
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:30,158
grew the dog [Â __Â ] under that same light

2899
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:31,679
and it finished two weeks earlier than

2900
01:35:30,158 --> 01:35:33,359
it normally would

2901
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:35,600
with a different spectrum

2902
01:35:33,359 --> 01:35:38,238
yeah with the with the cma normally the

2903
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:41,280
dog [Â __Â ] would go 12 or 13 weeks yeah i

2904
01:35:38,238 --> 01:35:42,559
grew it under pure 3 100 ceramic metal

2905
01:35:41,279 --> 01:35:45,039
halides

2906
01:35:42,560 --> 01:35:47,280
it was done in 70 days every hair turned

2907
01:35:45,039 --> 01:35:49,359
fully ripened i've got beautiful picks

2908
01:35:47,279 --> 01:35:50,960
of it it shaved two weeks off but the

2909
01:35:49,359 --> 01:35:52,799
same spectrum

2910
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:54,960
made the dog go two weeks longer than

2911
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:57,199
i've ever taken her yeah that's funny

2912
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:59,039
i've never taken the dog 85 days in my

2913
01:35:57,198 --> 01:36:02,238
life dude yeah

2914
01:35:59,039 --> 01:36:03,679
you know she's she's 65 she's 63 to 70

2915
01:36:02,238 --> 01:36:05,759
and she's pretty done

2916
01:36:03,679 --> 01:36:06,880
yeah and when i finally cut her and i

2917
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:08,960
gave up

2918
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:12,239
tons of white hair is all over

2919
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:13,679
yeah so you know maybe like as a as a

2920
01:36:12,238 --> 01:36:14,638
final thing if you're trying to grow

2921
01:36:13,679 --> 01:36:17,039
heads

2922
01:36:14,639 --> 01:36:19,600
spectrum plays a big deal food plays a

2923
01:36:17,039 --> 01:36:21,679
big deal your style definitely helps and

2924
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:25,199
like less is more

2925
01:36:21,679 --> 01:36:27,359
yeah in a lot of ways like just enough

2926
01:36:25,198 --> 01:36:29,279
and nothing more is a better style than

2927
01:36:27,359 --> 01:36:30,158
like let's give it way too much and pump

2928
01:36:29,279 --> 01:36:32,800
it

2929
01:36:30,158 --> 01:36:34,479
let's super size it let's get hot you

2930
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:36,560
know let's run hot

2931
01:36:34,479 --> 01:36:37,759
um you know i don't

2932
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:39,360
that's not gonna that might give you

2933
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:40,960
better weight but i doubt it'll give you

2934
01:36:39,359 --> 01:36:42,960
better better weed

2935
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:44,800
yeah you know and so

2936
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:46,319
and that's a lot of times like what what

2937
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:48,400
it happens is like

2938
01:36:46,319 --> 01:36:50,079
like whether it's drying or curing or

2939
01:36:48,399 --> 01:36:51,359
growing or your nutrition or your

2940
01:36:50,079 --> 01:36:53,519
environment

2941
01:36:51,359 --> 01:36:55,279
like growing the same strains over and

2942
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:57,920
over they're your favorites and learning

2943
01:36:55,279 --> 01:37:01,359
why some rips they come out amazing

2944
01:36:57,920 --> 01:37:02,399
yeah and some rips you're like eh

2945
01:37:01,359 --> 01:37:04,079
you know

2946
01:37:02,399 --> 01:37:05,679
yeah cause even good growers get they

2947
01:37:04,079 --> 01:37:08,079
get the ant runs

2948
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:09,840
oh yeah yeah

2949
01:37:08,079 --> 01:37:12,158
yeah i mean honestly people people are

2950
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:14,079
still using [Â __Â ] other than leds i think

2951
01:37:12,158 --> 01:37:16,000
leds have come a long way

2952
01:37:14,079 --> 01:37:17,920
i'm still not convinced they're better

2953
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:20,719
than a blend of other light

2954
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:22,560
i still have never even tried led lights

2955
01:37:20,719 --> 01:37:24,880
so if any led light sponsors want to

2956
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:27,360
sponsor i'll give it a [Â __Â ] try but i

2957
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:29,440
i tend to like cmh quite a bit do i

2958
01:37:27,359 --> 01:37:31,519
think that leds are great for for

2959
01:37:29,439 --> 01:37:33,118
various aspects of heat and do i

2960
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:34,239
have i started seeing a lot of nice weed

2961
01:37:33,118 --> 01:37:36,719
under them and do they have good

2962
01:37:34,238 --> 01:37:39,118
applications i do

2963
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:40,960
but i still think some of the best heads

2964
01:37:39,118 --> 01:37:43,439
you can ever grow are off an old school

2965

at our safeway

2990
01:38:27,679 --> 01:38:31,760
and there was one point in willets where

2991
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:33,840
that safeway sold more organic produce

2992
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:35,600
than any safeway in the country

2993
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:36,880
yeah because there was so many [Â __Â ]

2994
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:38,960

2995

because

3002
01:38:46,319 --> 01:38:51,679

3003
01:38:49,439 --> 01:38:53,919

3005
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:58,880
number one he couldn't believe it they

3006
01:38:56,238 --> 01:39:00,959
came out there to figure out

3007
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:02,400
what the hell is going on

3008
01:39:00,960 --> 01:39:03,920
why are people cooking so many [Â __Â ]

3009
01:39:02,399 --> 01:39:06,638
turkeys why are people cooking they had

3010
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:09,118
no idea they were like this zone

3011
01:39:06,639 --> 01:39:10,639
we have more like can we spread what

3012
01:39:09,118 --> 01:39:12,880
we're doing here

3013
01:39:10,639 --> 01:39:14,800
to other parts because our sails are

3014
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:16,239
through the [Â __Â ] roof you know yeah

3015
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:17,360
and when they found out it was all for

3016
01:39:16,238 --> 01:39:19,279
weed

3017
01:39:17,359 --> 01:39:21,118
like the dude's face just

3018
01:39:19,279 --> 01:39:21,920
you know he was just so bummed right

3019
01:39:21,118 --> 01:39:24,559
yeah

3020
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:26,880
but it was it was like because back then

3021
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:29,600
you couldn't get like turkey bags in 50

3022
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:31,440
or 100 packs like you can today yeah you

3023
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:33,199
would have to go to the store

3024
01:39:31,439 --> 01:39:35,599
and like the turkey turkey they came in

3025
01:39:33,198 --> 01:39:37,039
like two or three packs yeah yeah so if

3026
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:39,520
you had you know an indoor and 20 pound

3027
01:39:37,039 --> 01:39:41,359
you'd buy 10 bat 10 boxes

3028
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:43,280
yeah and you're at the store you know

3029
01:39:41,359 --> 01:39:44,799
it's like buying like lube or something

3030
01:39:43,279 --> 01:39:46,399
like that you're like you want to get

3031
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:48,400
other [Â __Â ]

3032
01:39:46,399 --> 01:39:49,759
why i never got the turkey bag [Â __Â ]

3033
01:39:48,399 --> 01:39:52,319
thing because it's not like it really

3034
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:54,239
kept smells

3035
01:39:52,319 --> 01:39:56,799
it was the standard it was it was a bag

3036
01:39:54,238 --> 01:39:59,198
that fit a pound you could tie it and

3037
01:39:56,800 --> 01:40:01,360
like the thing is with fluffy weed if

3038
01:39:59,198 --> 01:40:03,279
you didn't get the bigger turkey bag you

3039
01:40:01,359 --> 01:40:04,559
could not have enough of a tail to make

3040
01:40:03,279 --> 01:40:06,639
a knot

3041
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:08,560
and i'll seal it down yeah off of off a

3042
01:40:06,639 --> 01:40:10,560
full pound so like where do you get a

3043
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:12,239
bag that can fit a pound

3044
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:13,840
yeah that's a good point that's a very

3045
01:40:12,238 --> 01:40:15,919
good point you know and it's like you

3046
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:18,319
grow kush or something or you know urkel

3047
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:19,920
you're gonna get a a tight pound

3048
01:40:18,319 --> 01:40:23,519
yeah right you grow diesel and it's

3049
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:24,560
gonna be like a a tall pound yeah

3050
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:26,719
you know

3051
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:29,360
so there's an aspect to it where it's

3052
01:40:26,719 --> 01:40:31,760
like it it just became the standard

3053
01:40:29,359 --> 01:40:33,920
and what days of fighting over [Â __Â ]

3054
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:36,079
sizes of bags and weight

3055
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:38,000
yeah and and so the amount what's crazy

3056
01:40:36,079 --> 01:40:40,000
is that like wil the will it's safeway

3057
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:41,279
learned and they just had i mean they

3058
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:44,639
would just they would they would just

3059
01:40:41,279 --> 01:40:46,158
buy immense amounts of the [Â __Â ]

3060
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:48,319
all the time it was like such a huge

3061
01:40:46,158 --> 01:40:50,000
seller for so long because there wasn't

3062
01:40:48,319 --> 01:40:51,840
eventually companies started making

3063
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:54,880
where you could go to the hydro store

3064
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:56,159
and you could buy like 25 or 50 or 100

3065
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:58,000
and it was like something you could

3066
01:40:56,158 --> 01:40:58,799
purchase there and not be so embarrassed

3067
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,479
but

3068
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:02,480
you had to back in the day you had to

3069
01:41:00,479 --> 01:41:04,319
just go into the grocery store yeah

3070
01:41:02,479 --> 01:41:06,959
that's where you [Â __Â ] got it you know

3071
01:41:04,319 --> 01:41:08,880
yep and that's how it fit so

3072
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:10,480
um so yeah i guess we've been on i mean

3073
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:11,920
we've been

3074
01:41:10,479 --> 01:41:14,158
the reason why we wanted to chat about

3075
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:16,000
this is because we thought that

3076
01:41:14,158 --> 01:41:17,679
uh and we could get deeper into it so

3077
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:19,920
you can always reach out to us on our

3078
01:41:17,679 --> 01:41:22,399
discord which mattel plug or you can

3079
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:24,079
reach out to us on ig or whatever but

3080
01:41:22,399 --> 01:41:26,399
there's a lot of different strategies i

3081
01:41:24,079 --> 01:41:28,079
didn't want to nerd out too hard

3082
01:41:26,399 --> 01:41:29,839
but there's a lot of depth to what kind

3083
01:41:28,079 --> 01:41:33,279
of weed you're trying to grow and what

3084
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:34,480
your goals are for it right and how you

3085
01:41:33,279 --> 01:41:36,800
want to feed it and how you want to

3086
01:41:34,479 --> 01:41:38,638
treat it and it matters

3087
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:40,719
you know and so don't just look online

3088
01:41:38,639 --> 01:41:42,159
at someone you think is killing it

3089
01:41:40,719 --> 01:41:43,198
and just feel like oh i figured it all

3090
01:41:42,158 --> 01:41:45,039
