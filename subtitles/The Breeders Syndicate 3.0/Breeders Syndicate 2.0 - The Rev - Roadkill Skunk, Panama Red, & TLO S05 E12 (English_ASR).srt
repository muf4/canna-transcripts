see you

19
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,140
thanks man good to be here a long time

we haven't talked so we're going to

21
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,400
catch up a lot on uh everything you've

22
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,680
been doing everything that you've done

23

for the people who are new to you and

24
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,420
where we're going from there so let's

25
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,640
start off dude like what started the The

26
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,820
Rev on his cannabis Adventure

27
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:27,719
well I guess I was about this has been

28
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:30,539
about 1975 I guess you know I planted my

29
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:32,719
first weed ever and my mom ended up

30
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,118
killing it right right

31
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:37,618
me out you know

32
00:01:35,118 --> 00:01:39,659
so I was so pissed that my beautiful

33
00:01:37,618 --> 00:01:41,280
plants got killed I had about a half a

34
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,500
pound baggie about a quarter full of

35
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,239
seeds yeah I went out in the backyard

36
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:49,739
the next day and I just spread them

37
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:53,099
everywhere right so so a dichondra lawn

38
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:54,539
of cannabis came up I bet germs freaked

39
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:57,239
out and we eventually struck a deal

40
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,399
where I could grow four plants oh wow

41
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:01,798
they they gave in yeah well I just

42
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,899
overrode them you know yeah dude and uh

43
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,579
so I was jazzed about that so I grew up

44
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:07,739
my mom's backyard for a couple years

45
00:02:05,578 --> 00:02:09,060
after that just you know I was an idiot

46
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:11,038
I didn't know what I was doing but I

47
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:15,120
grew some giant freaking plants you know

48
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:18,719
I bet and uh then you know my dad he was

49
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,360
a hydroponic experiment scientist guy he

50
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,979
loved Hydroponics oh wow one was on the

51
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,599
other end of the scale she's fully

52
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:27,959
organic I mean you know as organic as

53
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:30,719
you could be back in 1970s yeah now so

54
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:33,060
they each had their own input to me so I

55
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:35,400
learned Hydroponics really well really

56
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,439
fast the whole dynamic of it and my mom

57
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,879
taught me Organics and the first thing I

58
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:42,598
did of course was I flopped into

59
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:45,179
Hydroponics and you know started uh

60
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:47,759
Building Systems and designing them and

61
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,219
uh that worked out really good and I

62
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:51,959
look back now at that and I think man we

63
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:54,060
really sure thought we had some great

64
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:56,340
buds back then but I won't even touch a

65
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,840
synthetic grown Bud these days I mean do

66
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,939
you remember those old catalogs from

67
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,640
Scentsy seeds like the pictures the buds

68
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:04,979
back then just all chewed up and rotten

69
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,559
yeah

70
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:09,119
yeah dude it was a different time man

71
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,878
well I hope there's no difference

72
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,340
because of my organ my uh hydroponic

73
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:17,158
knowledge right I had met these guys in

74
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:19,080
Northern California and uh they were

75
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:20,519
super interested in Hydroponics they

76
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,560
didn't know anything about Hydroponics

77
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:24,658
and they wanted to know big time oh I

78
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,519
bet so it was kind of a marriage made in

79
00:03:24,658 --> 00:03:28,439
heaven right there I got together with

80
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:31,019
them they agreed to teach me their ways

81
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:33,239
and they were breeders and Growers and

82
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:34,620
uh if I would teach them Hydroponics so

83
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:36,840
I mean that couldn't have worked out

84
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,700
better yeah no kidding apprenticeship

85
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,620
made in heaven yeah

86
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:42,359
so what kind of stuff were you seeing

87
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,060
around then was it mostly Mexican stuff

88
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:48,180
that was coming in import no no these

89
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:50,580
guys had connection with uh the Surfers

90
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,739
right around the world like a several

91
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,659
Pro Surfers so they were hooked up with

92
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:57,719
some really Prime genetics that's why

93
00:03:54,658 --> 00:03:59,818
when people nowadays tell me

94
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:03,780
um you know the weed now is so much more

95
00:03:59,818 --> 00:04:06,298
strong well as a whole yeah but not if

96
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,519
you're a selector and you find a a clone

97
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:10,620
of something like Blue Mountain Jamaican

98
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:12,840
or something you know something from

99
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,900
Hawaii something picked and selected it

100
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,720
was just it was incredible weed Ty oh my

101
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:20,280
God yeah see I always hear these stories

102
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,139
about the old ties and that's why I've

103
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,698
always kind of chased them I looked up

104
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:25,620
to you and I was you know getting into

105
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:27,660
breeding and growing up and I was like

106
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,120
wow this dude's super into Thai I want

107
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,460
to see what this is about I love Thai

108
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,800
yeah yeah it's a special it's a special

109
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:36,239
region that produce just I don't know if

110
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,220
it was the region that produced the

111
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,460
incredibly special plants or the farmers

112
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:43,380
were just better at it or how it worked

113
00:04:41,459 --> 00:04:45,418
plants from different regions are kind

114
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:48,659
of similar sometimes it's like Central

115
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:50,399
Americans are kind kind of close to

116
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:53,220
Southeast Asians you know they have a

117
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:55,500
lot in common yeah where like Colombians

118
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,660
and South Americans are have some

119
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,478
similarities with South Africans and

120
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:03,720
Africans like the rui BART right from

121
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:06,539
South Africa and uh like a Colombian red

122
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,639
a good a good strong real Colombian red

123
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,860
they're very similar it would be tough

124
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,600
to tell them apart by high time and I've

125
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,040
always tripped out about that you know I

126
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,960
thought well there must have been some

127
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,720
boats going around exchanging genetics

128
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:21,198
way back then yeah you wonder about like

129
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:25,139
maybe they were just you know similar

130
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:28,379
equator similar elevation [ __ ] like that

131
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:30,418
yeah yeah and I think the genes are

132
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:32,100
similar too because I mean you can grow

133
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:34,918
you can have something like a Durban

134
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:37,320
Poison from South Africa that is Miles

135
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:39,899
different than a rui Bard or a Colombian

136
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:41,759
oh sure you know but but there are there

137
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:43,379
are strange similarities across the

138
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,439
table that always make me wonder what

139
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:47,939
happened in the past how they got there

140
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:50,038
yeah no kidding man that I've seen some

141
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:51,538
pretty weird ones like uh there's a lot

142
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:53,399
of that terpinoline in a lot of

143
00:05:51,538 --> 00:05:54,899
Colombians but in a lot of Mexicans

144
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:56,339
there's skunkiness and you think there

145
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:57,839
would have been a lot of trade going up

146
00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:00,060
and down through there but they did keep

147
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:02,519
their own little separate divisions too

148
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:05,339
it's wild and they're you know they're

149
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:08,279
they're those like the Mexicans

150
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:11,099
especially they're uh they're like the

151
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:12,478
South Africans too in a way is that at

152
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,699
first you know when people are looking

153
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:16,019
for all the terpenes that looking for

154
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:18,000
the smells and the flavors they're

155
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:19,978
always like oh this smells like lemon oh

156
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,560
well that's super common at the early

157
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:24,599
stages of flowering right yeah a lot of

158
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,459
sativas to smell that way they don't

159
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,819
really start to put their real smelly

160
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:31,680
legs on until at least halfway through

161
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:34,199
so what were some of the first lines

162
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,280
that you were um making crosses of what

163
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:37,560
were some of the first crosses even

164
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:40,879
before braiding just to first like

165
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,879
oh my God

166
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:46,258
let's see God you know what I

167
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,600
the first ones I find it hard to

168
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:51,660
remember I remember I had a uh I

169
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:54,539
remember I had a tackle box oh yeah the

170
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:57,180
cops got that I haven't I had a tackle

171
00:06:54,538 --> 00:06:59,038
box just full of a big one labeled just

172
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:01,019
full of all kinds of I wish I could

173
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:04,139
remember some of them now but damn I

174
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:06,180
just I just can't it's mostly Regional

175
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:07,500
varieties yeah some of them are

176
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,879
reasonable some of them I got from

177
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,300
France some of them I got you know

178
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:15,478
online having to read the catalog and

179
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:18,418
mail and go yeah yeah and then uh let's

180
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:22,459
see when was it that when sea Bay came

181
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:22,459
online around that time okay

182
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:27,598
yeah yeah when they came online I

183
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:29,579
started really digging on the

184
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:31,079
availability of online stuff and of

185
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:34,139
course you know you run the risk of crap

186
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:36,060
but oh yeah I found some real gems back

187
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:39,180
then just popping around talking to

188
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:40,740
people there was crap too but still I

189
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,180
mean is that is that the error that you

190
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:45,120
got the metal Haze

191
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,860
yeah that wasn't from Dutch Flowers yeah

192
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,259
it was and in fact you know you and I

193
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,419
were talking about the having to select

194
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:55,139
things Southeast Asians like Hayes is

195
00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:58,079
right yes and uh that that metal Haze it

196
00:07:55,139 --> 00:08:00,960
was funny because if I recall I got uh I

197
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:04,079
think I got six or eight females out of

198
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:07,258
a ten pack and pretty much most of them

199
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:09,000
were average and okay yeah a couple of

200
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:10,919
them were better than okay and then that

201
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,740
one they're like oh my God you know I

202
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:16,258
mean it just it stood out like a beacon

203
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:18,240
so yeah that was lucky really that was

204
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:20,340
lucky because really you usually have to

205
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,060
go through a lot more than that yeah

206
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:22,918
yeah

207
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:26,300
yeah especially in Haze varieties

208
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:29,399
because it's just so much any any

209
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:31,978
sativa that has like mostly a land race

210
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:34,379
history is going to be a real good

211
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:36,240
selection because wild plants keep their

212
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:40,740
options open you know yeah they sure do

213
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:42,479
big genotype on reserve to tap so they

214
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,959
they don't really unless they're super

215
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:49,379
super old like like the Deep chunk or

216
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:51,000
Panama Red or Thai some things like that

217
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:52,559
yeah they're just they're set in their

218
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,720
ways just like old people they aren't

219
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:57,299
changing yeah yeah deep chunks perfect

220
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,160
for that yeah you know they're just

221
00:08:57,299 --> 00:09:01,799
they're real they're real acclimated to

222
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:05,338
whatever environment they were inbred

223
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:07,379
500 times into or whatever exactly deep

224
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:09,180
chunk just loves the Mendo and that's it

225
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:11,700
you know like the Mendo outdoor is

226
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:14,099
perfect for it people have big problems

227
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:16,980
with it when their pH usually runs low

228
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:19,080
oh really you know yeah because uh you

229
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:22,560
know it won't tolerate a normal pH if

230
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:24,360
your pH runs six eight six seven you're

231
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:26,338
gonna have small issues with it your pH

232
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,620
has to be up around seven for it to

233
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:30,000
really kick ass that's awesome I didn't

234
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,919
even know that part I've had trouble

235
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,740
with it on and off in the past yeah I

236
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:36,778
guess it's because it's from the desert

237
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:38,399
basically yeah that makes sense so it's

238
00:09:36,778 --> 00:09:40,259
used to a lot of minerals probably a

239
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,539
super high soil PH with pretty low

240
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:45,059
organic content so yeah it makes a

241
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:47,338
little bit of sense yeah it sure does

242
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:48,899
um so what was let's let's let's talk

243
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:51,300
about the first strain that you actually

244
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:53,220
started breeding breeding a line you

245
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:58,759
started working

246
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:58,759
damn I think I used

247
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:05,939
I think I had a

248
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:09,659
damn I really just can't remember yeah

249
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:12,000
how old are you son I'm 62. I've been

250
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:13,620
doing this for half a century I know I

251
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,299
guess it gets harder over time you know

252
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,620
over the years it's gotten a lot harder

253
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:18,899
for me to remember some of the earlier

254
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:21,179
years it used to be just like damn bam

255
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:24,000
no just just wait till you pass 55

256
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:25,439
brother I know I can't I'm already I'm

257
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,360
all about walking in the kitchen and

258
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,060
going what am I doing

259
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,440
[Laughter]

260
00:10:29,059 --> 00:10:32,939
it's like a mad scientist thing around

261
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,519
here I got

262
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:38,220
I got sticky notes at my Google

263
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,899
Calendars busy all day long you know oh

264
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,759
you know that's [ __ ] to remind me of

265
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:42,899
what the [ __ ] I'm doing all the time see

266
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:44,819
I haven't even gotten to the point of

267
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:46,919
utilizing that so I just forget and say

268
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:50,040
[ __ ] it and go smoke again I just I give

269
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:51,659
up oh man I can't do that because you

270
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:54,659
know when I'm when I'm so especially if

271
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:57,299
I'm selecting like I am now yeah if I

272
00:10:54,659 --> 00:10:58,980
screw up even once man now I have now I

273
00:10:57,299 --> 00:11:01,199
have a whole new set of variables I have

274
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,879
to take into account that's true you

275
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,500
know I mean it's like I can't tell you

276
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,958
how many people I visit they're trying

277
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:09,000
to select a clone that'll have like a

278
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:11,099
closet or a small area of plants right

279
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,419
and they'll be like yeah well I'm gonna

280
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,339
kill these three because they're not

281
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:15,000
doing well and I'll be like wait a

282
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:17,100
minute

283
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,320
you know your fan is blowing extra

284
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,959
strong on those three back plants so

285
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:24,600
really happening is they're dehydrating

286
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:26,099
faster they're needing water sooner so

287
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,800
the reason they look shitty isn't

288
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,839
genetics you got to understand the

289
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:32,939
environment around them right yeah

290
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:34,860
that's like selecting in veg like

291
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,300
culling in veg like oh it doesn't grow

292
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,860
well it could be the one that's the most

293
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:40,019
potent we're going for effect not for

294
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:43,079
structure in veg you know if you're

295
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:45,060
super familiar with the line like I am

296
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:47,699
with most of that one yeah because I'm

297
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:49,559
like the embodiment of Tasmania or uh

298
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:52,200
the Galapagos Islands right I have a

299
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:54,059
pretty sealed gene pool yeah you do I

300
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,420
don't walk outside of my gene pool very

301
00:11:54,059 --> 00:12:00,059
often so it works out really good for me

302
00:11:57,419 --> 00:12:02,458
yeah I mean that's that's one of the

303
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:05,039
best ways to truly learn your lines and

304
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:08,278
to master a line to really really get it

305
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:11,759
into I mean for lack of better word to

306
00:12:08,278 --> 00:12:13,200
master it to get that bug grown to its

307
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:14,939
best Expressions to where you're

308
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,860
familiar and you know I use marker

309
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,600
Expressions on lines I'm real familiar

310
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:21,740
with like my own lines I've worked with

311
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:24,300
a lot I know if uh if I have a square

312
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:26,579
petiole right on this one I know that

313
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:28,379
that that is a link Gene to something I

314
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:32,219
either want or don't want as an example

315
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:34,078
right okay so I can select early I can

316
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:36,120
wipe out a lot of planets I know I don't

317
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:38,338
want early write in veg with things I'm

318
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,500
familiar with so for people listening

319
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:42,180
like a linked trait could be like you

320
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,519
see at least certain Leaf mutations so

321
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:47,519
you know that in that line it happens to

322
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:49,019
also denote another trait right and a

323
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,299
lot of times a lot of times it gets a

324
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:54,000
lot deeper than that like patterns of

325
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:56,399
leaf hairs the patterns that they form

326
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,200
in certain places on the plants one of

327
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,720
my one of my favorite things to do to be

328
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:02,160
able to check plants early is uh I look

329
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,660
at those you know the little round I

330
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:05,000
forget what they're called coital zones

331
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:07,799
or whatever

332
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,360
on the Sprouts right yeah those are uh

333
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:11,278
those are some of my favorites when I

334
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,740
catch the plants about a week up above

335
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:15,299
ground I always take a 30 times scope

336
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,159
and look really close at those those

337
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:19,439
leaves and look at the density of the

338
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:21,838
leaf hairs now what that does is since

339
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,060
Leaf hairs and trichomes are pretty much

340
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,579
exactly the same just a little tiny move

341
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:28,679
on the planet different I then know

342
00:13:26,578 --> 00:13:31,500
which is most dense which can have the

343
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:34,559
most dense trichomes right from go this

344
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:36,720
helps me a ton for males so if I'm

345
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:38,039
selecting a male from something I'm a

346
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,500
little familiar with or not that

347
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:43,919
familiar with I can get a good grip on

348
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:47,278
how what my potential is in my males to

349
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:49,439
to pass off heavy resin production with

350
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:51,838
the female for The Offspring right yeah

351
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,639
that gives me my first little marker so

352
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:57,800
I can you know do that hang on I'm gonna

353
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:57,799
grab all right okay all right

354
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,660
that reminds me I got one too

355
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,420
there we go

356
00:14:02,659 --> 00:14:08,120
that's something I can never never even

357
00:14:05,419 --> 00:14:11,099
considered that's amazing

358
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,778
I'm glad you like it yeah the leader the

359
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,120
leafer things are big I use them to

360
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:17,100
judge a lot of things and it's like um

361
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,200
most people go right to the leaves they

362
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:22,200
look at like leave formations Leaf

363
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:24,420
whatever some some aspect expression of

364
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,759
the leaf yeah those work good those were

365
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:29,699
good for a lot of things but the problem

366
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:31,799
is with different environments and with

367
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:35,639
any strain especially a hybrid if it's

368
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:37,519
not an IBL yeah it'll throw out just on

369
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:40,379
the notch it'll throw out different

370
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,240
morphologies different resin values you

371
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:45,000
know because it's still testing the

372
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,799
water it's a hybrid yeah right that's

373
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,879
what it's doing it's getting a grip on

374
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:50,519
the world

375
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:52,860
yeah and and in today's society we know

376
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:54,720
like almost everything's a poly poly

377
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:57,419
poly poly hybrid in the cookie worlds

378
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,899
unless you're yeah unless you have a a

379
00:14:57,419 --> 00:15:04,198
nice sealed environment away from that

380
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:06,000
kind of BS like yours well you know My

381
00:15:04,198 --> 00:15:08,219
worry is I it's not that I think

382
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,620
anything is particularly bad or

383
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:13,320
particularly good in in the recent 20

384
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:16,379
years or so but the problem I have is is

385
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:19,079
it's is it's useless for me to try to

386
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:22,078
run down the origin of some type of

387
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:24,479
genetics that I get because I'm involved

388
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:26,879
with two or three people at least with

389
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,860
one or two of them at least have just

390
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:31,439
gotten it decide to rename it something

391
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:33,899
else and maybe embellish on the history

392
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,720
so I just I just don't trust anything I

393
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:39,539
hear now so I have my uh my Galapagos

394
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,699
Islands gene pool that I went man I got

395
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:43,198
a lot of seeds from a long time ago I'm

396
00:15:41,698 --> 00:15:45,778
just working through them now like I

397
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:49,759
told you recently I just got a g I just

398
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:52,740
got some G13 haze from Soma to pop

399
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,360
30 years old oh yeah I bet those are

400
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,579
that's a really good line too I think

401
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,519
that's where they found the the CBD

402
00:15:56,578 --> 00:16:01,019
stuff a lot of the the CBD bases is for

403
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,539
cannotonic and stuff like that was in

404
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:06,959
someone's G13 Haze well the haze would

405
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:09,360
definitely have some CBD yeah yeah right

406
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:11,759
but yeah because it's not just the resin

407
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,800
production you know I mean a lot like

408
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:17,039
with uh let me think of it oh like let's

409
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:19,500
take a Congo for example okay several

410
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:22,679
times I've seen Congos that suck right

411
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:25,139
yeah several times I've seen Congos that

412
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:28,319
look like they'd be okay you know it's

413
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:30,360
like a real dark spooky looking bud but

414
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,720
you don't see much resin you know just

415
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:36,240
and it will kick your ah I mean bad

416
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:38,459
right yeah and if you were to chop that

417
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,259
butt in half and look at it you would

418
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:42,299
see that it forms this different it's

419
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:43,919
resin different than an Indica would you

420
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:46,019
know a lot of the indicas were bred to

421
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,879
make hash right yeah so they always

422
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:49,379
wanted the resin spread out all over the

423
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:51,778
whole plant so they could all extract it

424
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:53,519
with hash yep sativas are a lot

425
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:55,919
different especially some of the really

426
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,659
Wild Ones yeah it's their resin

427
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:59,939
production as you get closer to the core

428
00:16:57,659 --> 00:17:01,860
of the flower to protect it from the

429
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:04,199
weather basically is what they do for

430
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:06,240
but that's why you can have a sativa

431
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:08,039
that to your naked eye you can go oh

432
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,980
yeah that looks alright and it will lay

433
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:12,539
you out yeah I mean you look at a lot of

434
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:14,400
these old sativas I was looking at some

435
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:17,220
Highland Thai bud I had from Bodhi save

436
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,740
and if you look at it like if I guess if

437
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:21,860
a modern person that like in the that

438
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:24,179
started growing in the

439
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:25,859
2020s looked at it they wouldn't even

440
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:27,959
understand what to smoke on it because

441
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:30,539
it's almost all Leaf you know there's no

442
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:33,179
floral density to it whatsoever yeah

443
00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:35,579
yeah no we had those a matter of fact

444
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:38,038
when I went to Northern California they

445
00:17:35,579 --> 00:17:40,439
had just gotten pretty flush with those

446
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:42,599
exactly yeah right those the ones from

447
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,940
Afghanistan and the Mideast that were

448
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:47,879
not really buds right they were just

449
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:50,580
like Leaf bud

450
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,320
florets or something yeah yeah yeah and

451
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:54,599
uh and they were just covered in resin

452
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:57,659
you know just these big non-dense

453
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:59,639
flowers just soaked with resin

454
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:03,660
Jesus

455
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:06,240
so let's talk about some of your lines I

456
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:07,919
mean you've made a lot of I mean so many

457
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,500
lines over the years what are your

458
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:14,340
flagships is the uh what is it the Blue

459
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:16,798
Rhino 1947 love it let's talk about that

460
00:18:14,339 --> 00:18:18,240
one it's one of your Staples when I when

461
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:19,440
we first started talking I think that

462
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,980
was one of the big ones you were working

463
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:25,500
with man I still love it it's one of my

464
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:27,599
favorite go-to smokes of all time it's

465
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,160
it's kind of heavy on the Indica side

466
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:30,599
but you wouldn't know it by smoking it

467
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,240
because it doesn't really relate that

468
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:34,980
kind of sleepy side too much yeah it

469
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,339
doesn't give you munchies too much but

470
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:41,640
what it does do is it reminds me a lot I

471
00:18:38,339 --> 00:18:43,558
I've mentioned Bhutan earlier as it

472
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,200
reminds me of some boots and knees right

473
00:18:43,558 --> 00:18:48,359
that have this this resin profile where

474
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,100
the high type is like I don't know how

475
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:53,159
to describe it other than it's golden

476
00:18:50,099 --> 00:18:55,798
and happy right everything is like

477
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:58,019
golden and you're happy and that's what

478
00:18:55,798 --> 00:19:00,779
the Blue Rhino does the blue Ryan 1947

479
00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:03,480
does for me but its most unique property

480
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:06,000
that I have found in nothing else is

481
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:08,339
that I have some I have a lot of damage

482
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,099
actually but one of my major damage

483
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:13,619
zones is in my leg right and I took some

484
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:15,240
really bad nerve damage yeah the problem

485
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:17,159
is is when I'm up and walking around

486
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,440
because of all that damage along with

487
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,179
bone damage and other stuff but when I'm

488
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,340
up and walking around I have to hold my

489
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:26,340
muscles in that leg tight right yeah

490
00:19:23,339 --> 00:19:27,720
because any loose if I step down a step

491
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:30,178
that's not there or something man I'm

492
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,100
done I'm on I'm on a cane for a week I

493
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:33,720
know what you mean yeah it's bad right

494
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:37,619
yeah so

495
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:39,779
the Blue Rhino 1947 after a day when I

496
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:42,058
lay down to go to sleep of if I'm up and

497
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:45,119
around right my leg will get spasms when

498
00:19:42,058 --> 00:19:47,519
it relaxes right and that hurts the hell

499
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:49,739
out of me oh I'm sure if so the Blue

500
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:52,019
Rhino 1947 I could just puff some of

501
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:54,240
that and those spasms are just reduced

502
00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:56,460
to a tiny tiny little Rumble that

503
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,339
doesn't hurt at all so while I don't use

504
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:02,100
it for pain relief directly it

505
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:04,139
absolutely cures me from the pain I

506
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:07,319
would be suffering so I always have Blue

507
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:09,480
Rhino 1947 always also do you think

508
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:12,659
that's from the blueberry side or what's

509
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:17,640
in the Blue Rhino it's a blueberry white

510
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:20,279
rhino and Peak 19 and AK-47 19 and AK-47

511
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:23,400
that's right right I got the I got the

512
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:26,178
peak 19 AK-47 from sea Bay many many

513
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:28,320
many many moons ago do you remember

514
00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:30,360
pardon me do you remember who made that

515
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:32,879
one I know it's a hybrid Sega math and

516
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:35,399
something else I do not know who made

517
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,100
that one yeah about you but I use the

518
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,980
Irish Rose version of Blue Rhino very

519
00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:42,480
cool and uh I just crossed them up and

520
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:45,120
you know

521
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:48,298
it's a it's an impactive line anyway I

522
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:50,639
mean the high is impressive but beyond

523
00:20:48,298 --> 00:20:53,700
that I started noticing that stuff with

524
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,400
the Tremors in my leg I went oh there

525
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:58,019
really is medical marijuana yeah you

526
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,740
know the first time I realized that was

527
00:20:58,019 --> 00:21:03,839
when I had a um uh for myself anyways I

528
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:05,279
had a uh abscessed tooth an abscess

529
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:06,480
molar and it was just it was one of

530
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:07,980
those ones where it was like tears

531
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,019
running down your face it's the only

532
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:12,298
thing you can feel in your body is that

533
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:14,700
pain just throbbing and nothing was

534
00:21:12,298 --> 00:21:17,519
working dabs nothing and then I smoked

535
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:19,200
some very weak blueberry just because I

536
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:21,000
happen to have it and it completely took

537
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,360
away the nerve pain and I realized oh

538
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,339
this this for me helps with nerve pain

539
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:28,979
insanely like a whole bunch so I was

540
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:31,379
wondering if that maybe helped you any

541
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:34,140
of the blue stuff at first I really

542
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:35,580
thought it was the blueberry I did for

543
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:38,038
several years I thought was the

544
00:21:35,579 --> 00:21:39,779
blueberry but then as I started to

545
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:41,400
inbreed them and mess with them and look

546
00:21:39,779 --> 00:21:43,980
at different ones that were better at

547
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,480
exactly that nerve damage stuff yeah I

548
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:47,179
noticed that the ones I would select

549
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,440
that would be the best would

550
00:21:47,179 --> 00:21:52,740
morphologically they would look the most

551
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,140
like the peak 19. oh interesting not the

552
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:57,240
blueberry so I just kind of naturally

553
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:59,400
made the leap and thought it must be the

554
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,679
peak 19 that's doing it but I could I

555
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,240
could be wrong yeah yeah I don't know I

556
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,980
mean the the blueberries that I've had

557
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,298
usually smell like blueberry the ones

558
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,179
that helps my nerve pain because I have

559
00:22:06,298 --> 00:22:11,879
neuropathy bad and that tends to help me

560
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:15,298
a lot but I also like when you mentioned

561
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:17,580
White Rhino like one of my white whales

562
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:19,558
is White Rhino like a very good White

563
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:22,019
Rhino cut because I had one it's just

564
00:22:19,558 --> 00:22:24,298
the one time ever that we just made me

565
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:26,639
see tracers and hallucinate like LSD and

566
00:22:24,298 --> 00:22:27,900
it was White Rhino so man that's a

567
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,000
special line

568
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,919
yeah yeah we used to smoke a ton of

569
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,440
White Rhino when we were out taking care

570
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,600
of stuff outdoors and white rhino works

571
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,700
really good Outdoors because it's also

572
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:40,500
hardly smelly at all when you grow it

573
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:44,038
yeah

574
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:47,339
Let's see we have your Riff Raff tie

575
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:50,279
which I know is a popular one that's

576
00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:52,500
that's a real great great fruity baby

577
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:54,240

times stronger it's radical what's in

589
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:23,700
the what's in it Riff Raff tie is uh

590
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:24,658
deep chunk and let's see which tie did I

591
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,779
use

592
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:30,240
I can't remember if it was the I had

593
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:33,480
gotten sent from my cousin in Vietnam

594
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,940
and when he sent it to me the the paper

595
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:39,058
or whatever it was wrapped in said bat

596
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:41,640
damn bang on it right so I just called

597
00:23:39,058 --> 00:23:43,379
that bad damn bang time that's a good

598
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:46,320
name too all right and then the other

599
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:48,299
tie I had that I worked with was from a

600
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:52,619
breeder that I hooked up with that was

601
00:23:48,298 --> 00:23:56,279
in uh Denmark or Amsterdam and he wanted

602
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:58,798
to trade me some juicy for a tie oh yeah

603
00:23:56,279 --> 00:24:00,658
for uh something I had I forget what it

604
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:03,720
was but I was like oh hell yeah

605
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:06,059
and uh that was legit juicy for a time I

606
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,940
mean it was long flowering smelled just

607
00:24:06,058 --> 00:24:11,099
like Juicy Fruit gum was kick ass so in

608
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:13,320
the Riff Raff tie I forget which one it

609
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:16,259
was but it was one of those one of those

610
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:18,599
two it'll say so in the description yeah

611
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:20,819
so check this only I had a photographic

612
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:22,918

out go check those out there we want to

620
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:39,658
talk about some more of your stuff let's

621
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:41,879
see I know my friend smell boat would

622
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:46,440
kill me if I didn't ask about the Cherry

623
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:48,900
tie the chunky Cherry tie yeah now you

624
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,900
know something this I love that for so

625
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:53,700
many reasons but the the first thing I

626
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:56,460
really liked about was when I saw The

627
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:58,380
Offspring I knew because sometimes when

628
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:00,720
you're working with like it usually

629
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:03,600
happens with the land race or or an

630
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:06,480
heirloom long IBL when you pop it into a

631
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:08,939
hybrid usually what will happen is they

632
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,279
will just merge right it'll the

633
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:13,380
resulting will be uniform and it will

634
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:16,619
blend yeah it's pretty uniform in the F1

635
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:19,020
times that doesn't happen sometimes it's

636
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:21,178
like they resist each other a little and

637
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:23,819
you definitely get lots of different

638
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:25,980
recombinations that's what happened with

639
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:28,200
the chunky Cherry tie so as soon as I

640
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:30,778
saw saw some starting to finish at about

641
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:33,480
10 or 11 weeks and I saw others that had

642
00:25:30,778 --> 00:25:36,480
two more weeks to go I was like oh yeah

643
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:38,579
I knew and then oh my god when I smoked

644
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:42,120
them there was one I had that was a

645
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:45,418
14-week finisher and it was uh so close

646
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:47,519
to just Thai I mean it was just like

647
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:50,100
smoking Thai it was slightly different

648
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:52,019
but not very and so I treasure that one

649
00:25:50,099 --> 00:25:54,719
I still have deep stash buds of that

650
00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:57,599
that's awesome you came in the freezer

651
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,278
it's incredibly like time I mean it's

652
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:01,678
almost spot on

653
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:04,019
that's really cool I know um my friend

654
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,480
smell boat used just the Cherry tie part

655
00:26:04,019 --> 00:26:09,298
in his uh rainbow and it's one of his

656
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,740
favorite lines yeah the Cherry Pie yeah

657
00:26:09,298 --> 00:26:13,139
that's one you need a little selection

658
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:15,480
there but there are one out of four of

659
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:17,580
those females are just Stellar they're

660
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:20,099
all good you know you don't have any bad

661
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:22,079
ones but there's like you know out of

662
00:26:20,099 --> 00:26:25,379
like four females you would probably get

663
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:28,319
two average ones one really good one and

664
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:29,940
one Epic one if it spread the if it

665
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:31,859
spread the bandwidth you know yeah yeah

666
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:33,659
it's an even distribution of the

667
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:37,500
Expressions yeah

668
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:40,740
yeah let's see what else we got we have

669
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:42,960
um let's talk about

670
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:45,720
do you remember a string called Uncle

671
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,240
Lucius lemonade I still have Uncle

672
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,640
Lucius lemonade I remember that was a

673
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,380
big hit on skunk Magazine's uh forums

674
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,299
back in the day the Uncle Lucius lemony

675
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:55,679
all my friends were grabbing them

676
00:26:54,298 --> 00:26:58,558
popping them loving it what was that one

677
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:01,080
about I've almost popped it here in the

678
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:03,058
last uh six months I've almost popped it

679
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:06,000
twice I mean I've had it out and ready

680
00:27:03,058 --> 00:27:07,139
to roll yeah something else came up and

681
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,240
I went oh it had to go a different

682
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:11,640
direction yeah but I'm definitely going

683
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:13,859
to rework that again the only problem is

684
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,960
it takes a lot of work like I was

685
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:17,639
talking to you earlier about if I'm

686
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,038
working with things I'm really familiar

687
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:23,038
with right like you know blew around a

688
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:24,778
1947 website I can pop eight if I want

689
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:28,019
to continue the line I can usually get

690
00:27:24,778 --> 00:27:30,000
away with one wave of eight Sprouts I

691
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:32,700
can select from there and be good find

692
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,380
everybody I'm looking for yeah maybe I

693
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:36,538
might have to do that twice but usually

694
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:38,820
not because I'm familiar with it I know

695
00:27:36,538 --> 00:27:41,220
what I'm looking for exactly so that

696
00:27:38,819 --> 00:27:45,359
works out really good but the Uncle

697
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:47,759
Lucius lemonade now that's made from

698
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:51,899
a lemon rack that a friend of mine

699
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:54,119
brought me in about 2004 I think a lemon

700
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:56,580
rack clone up from Northern California

701
00:27:54,119 --> 00:28:00,418
up from Willits

702
00:27:56,579 --> 00:28:02,699
um it uh it was an intense train wreck

703
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:05,520
super lemony it must have developed a

704
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:08,600
sport mutation or something and it had

705
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:08,599
become super lemony

706
00:28:09,538 --> 00:28:15,000
okay there we go so but it also had

707
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,620
another couple other weaknesses that may

708
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,839
have come along with the lemony flavor

709
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:22,379
was it was real weak it had no

710
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:25,199
structural integrity and stuff yeah so

711
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:27,480
I crossed it with another heavy hard

712
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:30,720
hitter the iron Cindy which is a lot

713
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,919
like a train wreck yeah and um so I

714
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,558
crossed it with that to make Uncle

715
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,700
Lucius lemonade now the problem with the

716
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:39,538
original

717
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:43,500
uh Uncle Lucius was or with the original

718
00:28:39,538 --> 00:28:46,079
lemon uh lemon wreck was that it had

719
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:48,000
some Hermes in it right yeah you had to

720
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:49,619
weed those out and they weren't the easy

721
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,179
kind to weed out they weren't true

722
00:28:49,619 --> 00:28:54,079
Hermes they were the kind you don't find

723
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:57,419
out until two weeks before yeah those

724
00:28:54,079 --> 00:29:00,359
brutal just just weak breeding right

725
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:02,460
yeah so uh so I have to fish through

726
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:05,158
them so now in order to run those and

727
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:08,700
then breed them I'm gonna need to run 16

728
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:10,860
Sprouts to start with and and cross my

729
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:13,620
fingers that I can find what I need in

730
00:29:10,859 --> 00:29:16,259
that run because those are particularly

731
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:19,139
dangerous first I have to find true

732
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:21,179
males for sure yeah then I have to find

733
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:23,340
a female that can take some stress I

734
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:25,380
have to beat the [ __ ] out of them to

735
00:29:23,339 --> 00:29:28,379
find out who has the least tolerance for

736
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:30,600
stress so once I find that I will do it

737
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:33,480
because that is some of the most lemony

738
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:35,158
stuff man ever I think people run into

739
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,380
that a lot with the train wreck stuff a

740
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:39,059
lot of um intersex traits and a lot of

741
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:42,360
like there's even auto flowering traits

742
00:29:39,058 --> 00:29:43,859
in the line somewhere and but man for me

743
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:45,658
there's not a much better height than

744
00:29:43,859 --> 00:29:49,500
train wreck stuff it's one of those ones

745
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:52,260
just that I associate with Thai Thai

746
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:55,319
pies kind of in there that that kind of

747
00:29:52,259 --> 00:29:58,859
make me happy energetic just

748
00:29:55,319 --> 00:30:01,139
yeah time makes me happy and energetic

749
00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:03,599
for sure sometimes it's totally spaced

750
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:05,880
out depends on how much I smoke but uh

751
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:08,459
but the train wrecks any train wreck

752
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:10,980
I've ever smoked I'm not a big fan uh oh

753
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:13,640
they're potent that's for sure yeah but

754
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:17,159
they have uh they have a quality to me

755
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:19,559
that is not dissimilar than when you uh

756
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:22,140
take something two weeks late you know

757
00:30:19,558 --> 00:30:24,240
how the resin changes yeah yeah that's

758
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:25,559
that's how they always remind me of I've

759
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,200
even tried taking them a little early

760
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:29,639
and that doesn't change yeah but you

761
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,460
know it's just it's a personal thing

762
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:34,259
like you and millions of people love

763
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:36,240
train wreck yeah they have nothing

764
00:30:34,259 --> 00:30:38,819
against other than the fact that it just

765
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,819
kind of makes me feel yeah like it's

766
00:30:38,819 --> 00:30:44,038
like it's weed that was taken too late I

767
00:30:41,819 --> 00:30:45,658
always get that vibe from it you know

768
00:30:44,038 --> 00:30:46,919
what train wreck people either and it's

769
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:48,179
kind of like that with Jack hair or two

770
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:49,559
a little bit maybe it's because of the

771
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:51,600
Terps maybe it's because of the high too

772
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:53,339
but it's either people love it or

773
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:55,678
they're just like man and some people it

774
00:30:53,339 --> 00:30:57,298
makes speedy and paranoid like crazy

775
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,460
paranoid and it just never does it to me

776
00:30:57,298 --> 00:31:01,259
but a lot of afghanis do it to me and

777
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:04,019
skunk one does it to me but yeah it's

778
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:07,278
weird oh man you want to see the queen

779
00:31:04,019 --> 00:31:10,200
of paranoid that black forest I have

780
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:12,419
yeah let's talk about some of the Black

781
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,980
Forest let's talk about that one oh man

782
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:15,419
I can't tell you how many people I've

783
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:17,399
sent running for the hills with that

784
00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:19,200
where they go yeah well I do get a

785
00:31:17,398 --> 00:31:21,058
little paranoid I go well I wouldn't

786
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,399
smoke it if I was you if that's the case

787
00:31:21,058 --> 00:31:25,619
right yeah yeah and you know they don't

788
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:28,199
listen and uh you know they run for the

789
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:30,778
hills because that thing's just a pure

790
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,519
jungle black Vietnamese who knows how

791
00:31:30,778 --> 00:31:35,339
many

792
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:37,918
bazillion years old it is across with my

793
00:31:35,339 --> 00:31:39,658
old Cherry Bomb male which God I love

794
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:42,840
that cross because what was the cherry

795
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:44,760
bomb that was an F3 out of Hawaii that

796
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:47,339
was uh it was a combination of about

797
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:50,640
three or four Hawaiian sativas elephant

798
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:53,579
ear Puna butter a couple others and it

799
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:56,880
was crossed with a cherry ak-47. oh wow

800
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:58,918
that it was inbred a few times to F3 and

801
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,500
it was shared with me under some kind of

802
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:03,720
top secret you know how the Hawaiians do

803
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:06,720
they they do they are tight with their

804
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:07,980
stuff top secret so anyway when I got it

805
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,778
the first thing I noticed the first

806
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:12,240
couple things I crossed it with is it

807
00:32:09,778 --> 00:32:15,480
was sort of uh it was sort of submissive

808
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:18,120
you know it would impart larger yields

809
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,980
and it would impart added resin but it

810
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:24,599
wouldn't really contribute too much to

811
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:26,819
Terps or or high type or morphology to

812
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:29,278
any big degree so I really liked it

813
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:32,038
because I could blend it with almost

814
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:34,679
anything and it would come out mostly

815
00:32:32,038 --> 00:32:37,500
whatever else was in the hybrid you know

816
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:40,740
would always be like 80 20 instead of a

817
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:42,960
50 50. yeah so yeah I love that so

818
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:45,839
anyway I bled I've read that with the

819
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:48,058
the with the Vietnamese black which I

820
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:51,178
got from my cousin back in I don't know

821
00:32:48,058 --> 00:32:53,220
I think it was like maybe the late 80s

822
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:55,919
or something so you've kept the

823
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:58,440
Vietnamese blackout law uh line around

824
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:01,320
that long yeah I still have it I just

825
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:04,440
popped three a few months ago because I

826
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:07,678
just inbred the uh I just inbred the uh

827
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:11,100
Black Forest by getting a mail from the

828
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:14,700
original V black line oh not using him

829
00:33:11,099 --> 00:33:17,398
to do a soft back cross yeah to to the

830
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:19,558
Black Forest so now it's like the black

831
00:33:17,398 --> 00:33:22,500
forest runs over anything it crosses

832
00:33:19,558 --> 00:33:25,379
anyway you know ones that flower

833
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:27,480
16 weeks oh I bet that's got to be so

834
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:29,640
killer though oh my God but you know

835
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:32,640
peeps have problems with it because yeah

836
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:35,100
if you never have flowered a 16 week

837
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,679
plant in a container you may have some

838
00:33:35,099 --> 00:33:40,500
issues yeah yeah people that aren't used

839
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,899
to used to land races and heirloom lines

840
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:44,880
and long flowering lines indoors you've

841
00:33:42,898 --> 00:33:47,158
really gotta do your homework before you

842
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,440
start flattering them puppies oh yeah

843
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:51,179
yeah yeah because you know [ __ ] not only

844
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,278
do you have to select the [ __ ] out of

845
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:54,960
them and keep them over loving them is

846
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:57,119
the death sentence to them you know yeah

847
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:00,659
you start trying to pour food on them or

848
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:03,178
switch their pH faster your bone over

849
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:05,159
watering all kinds of [ __ ] plus people

850
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:06,840
people will take them as a common

851
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:09,419
mistake with a black forest or anything

852
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:11,579
that's like up 14 weeks or something is

853
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:13,918
they'll get to about the 10 11 week Mark

854
00:34:11,579 --> 00:34:16,440
and they'll be oh [ __ ] my plant's dying

855
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:18,000
yeah I need to transplant it well that's

856
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:20,338
like the worst possible thing you could

857
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,280
do in flowering because suddenly the

858
00:34:20,338 --> 00:34:25,440
plant gets this dose of all kinds of

859
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,560
available nitrogen and [ __ ] so it says

860
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:31,320
yay time to veg and what that means is

861
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:32,579
time to reduce resin production yes so

862
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,440
if you're in flowering and you're

863
00:34:32,579 --> 00:34:36,779
reducing resin production well that's

864
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,159
not right yeah counterintuitive as [ __ ]

865
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,780
that's that's how that's why I tell

866
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,460
people you're feeding cannabis not

867
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:43,440
tomatoes because tomatoes like some

868
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:45,960
nitrogen in calcium and veg and stuff

869
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,240
but cannabis nitrogen kills resin

870
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,858
production and flour yeah I mean sure

871
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,959
your plant will get really happy and

872
00:34:49,858 --> 00:34:54,779
will start to grow really fast maybe

873
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:57,119
even mutate growth a little bit but

874
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:59,519
well it's like with tomatoes like if if

875
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,740
you were overdosing your tomatoes with

876
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:03,838
nitrogen at the end if you weren't sort

877
00:35:01,739 --> 00:35:06,598
of fading your Tomatoes you'll get

878
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:10,619
really big gnarly Tomatoes but they'll

879
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:14,300
have a thick skin yes right yeah super

880
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:17,700
thick robust thick skin yeah yeah

881
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:19,980
so one of the lines that I probably

882
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:21,480
associate with you the most and that I

883
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:24,800
get asked about the most when people ask

884
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,800
about your lines is iron Cindy

885
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:31,500
it's basically a haze for my money you

886
00:35:29,219 --> 00:35:35,098
know it's like it's just like a faster

887
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:38,820
flowering Haze it's a slightly longer

888
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:40,920
flowering Cindy because Cindy and Haze

889
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:43,380
have a lot in common Cindy and Southeast

890
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,519
Asian have a lot in common yeah so the

891
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:47,760
iron the

892
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:49,440
so that I the metal Haze was kind of a

893
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,339
no-brainer that I wanted to cross with

894
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,679
it you know

895
00:35:50,338 --> 00:35:54,900
it kind of makes a really nice outdoor

896
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:57,559
plant too for the for the metal Haze a

897
00:35:54,900 --> 00:36:00,119
better frame for it and everything else

898
00:35:57,559 --> 00:36:02,400
so what kind of what kind of Terps are

899
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:04,559
you seeing in the the iron Cindy is it

900
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,380
did you use a pineapple c99 a grapefruit

901
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:09,838
what kind do you use it no no I just

902
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:12,300
used uh I just selected some I think I

903
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:14,880
used a couple of females for that maybe

904
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:17,220
more than a couple but I just took some

905
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,559
good cindies and crusted it's hard to

906
00:36:17,219 --> 00:36:21,959
get a bad Cindy yeah the only the only

907
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:24,358
bad Cindy or every once in a while I

908
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:27,179
would say one in eight are super small

909
00:36:24,358 --> 00:36:29,880
yielding yeah that's the only really bad

910
00:36:27,179 --> 00:36:32,819
Cindy I've ever seen and that's not bad

911
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:35,160
it just yields really small yeah but it

912
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:37,200
probably has heavy resin production yeah

913
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:38,879
yeah that's funny that's funny too

914
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:41,159
because you know something in any line

915
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:44,039
I've ever seen yeah if you have you know

916
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:47,279
usually they're big fat plants usually

917
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:50,039
if you get one a a phenotype that has

918
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:53,099
like let's say 25 percent less yield

919
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:55,559
yeah it will also have about 25 percent

920
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:57,480
more potency yeah and resin production

921
00:36:55,559 --> 00:37:00,239
it puts all that energy Elsewhere for

922
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,519
the plant I love I love cannabis I love

923
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:04,679
how how

924
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:07,019
just intuitive it is as a as a plant and

925
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:09,838
how how quickly it adapts everything

926
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:12,059
everything about the plant it evolves

927
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:15,119
um a lot of times we talk about on our

928
00:37:12,059 --> 00:37:16,440
show about like expressions and clonal

929
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,059
expression meaning you know a lot of

930
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:20,280
people used to call it genetic drift but

931
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:21,900
it's not necessarily a thing but taking

932
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:24,660
a clone from one environment to another

933
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:26,760
and watching how quickly it adapts how

934
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:28,980
quickly it will

935
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:31,440
change its form even

936
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:34,500
you my man know the important stuff if

937
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:37,139
you ask me because that is it now I call

938
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:39,000
it adaptability as a general yeah

939
00:37:37,139 --> 00:37:41,219
but yeah one of the first things I do to

940
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,858
my plans to check them out is back in

941
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:45,659
the day we used to call it the breeders

942
00:37:43,858 --> 00:37:49,319
in Northern California used to call it

943
00:37:45,659 --> 00:37:51,239
growth hormone okay and what it is is

944
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:54,180
basically when you take a plant you top

945
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:56,459
it right yeah you see how fast it comes

946
00:37:54,179 --> 00:37:58,858
back with the axial branches yeah and

947
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:00,780
then you top it again see how fast it

948
00:37:58,858 --> 00:38:02,699
comes back with the abstra branches top

949
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:05,339
all those and you see how many times

950
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:07,259
before you actually slow the process

951
00:38:05,338 --> 00:38:09,179
yeah now of course you got to keep the

952
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:11,339
resources all in line here during this

953
00:38:09,179 --> 00:38:13,618
sure you know you gotta have container

954
00:38:11,338 --> 00:38:16,440
size and food and water because you know

955
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:19,140
it's now putting up 20 leads yeah

956
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:21,659
exactly whatever but but that's how you

957
00:38:19,139 --> 00:38:24,239
could tell a plant has like the superior

958
00:38:21,659 --> 00:38:27,239
Vigor from hell if it can come back four

959
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:29,338
times and still be just the Hemingway

960
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:31,919
one of the ones I worked with a long

961
00:38:29,338 --> 00:38:33,599
time ago Terry Hemingway well before it

962
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,480
was the Cherry Hemingway it was the

963
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:38,180
Hemingway oh okay and it's a bhutanese

964
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,920
mad plant

965
00:38:38,179 --> 00:38:42,838
that thing man my friends would tell me

966
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,960
it's broken out of the grow room window

967
00:38:42,838 --> 00:38:47,578
and ate the neighbor's dog

968
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:49,199
I mean you talk about bigger you could

969
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:51,240
just you prune the [ __ ] out of that

970
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:53,399
plant you just make it mad I mean it

971
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:55,799
comes back that's adaptability right

972
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,358
there is it the pure Boonies that's one

973
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,160
of the things I always look for with all

974
00:38:57,358 --> 00:39:00,960
my breeders is I test them that way you

975
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:02,338
know I always yeah I took the crap out

976
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,400
of them and see how fast they come back

977
00:39:02,338 --> 00:39:07,199
and also I take advantage of any

978
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:09,300
incidents I might have where if my tent

979
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:11,338
were way all of a sudden it's 110 in

980
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:13,500
there I'm like oh [ __ ] then I watch

981
00:39:11,338 --> 00:39:16,199
those plants very closely for the next

982
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:18,358
two weeks I see who handled that best or

983
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:20,039
or if something happens where I I I

984
00:39:18,358 --> 00:39:22,078
drowned them all out and they all hurt

985
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:24,119
from drought's Death that's a really

986
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,800
good opportunity to see what's up yeah

987
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:27,059
yeah it's a great way to see what's up

988
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,720
with your plants and their ability to

989
00:39:27,059 --> 00:39:33,019
test for stress and yeah

990
00:39:29,719 --> 00:39:36,419
they got to be they got to be

991
00:39:33,019 --> 00:39:38,880
strong first and foremost you know yeah

992
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:41,400
when I'm selecting them I don't want any

993
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,559
weaknesses in there at all once I've got

994
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:46,079
it down to all the strongest plants then

995
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:47,940
I go to work on resin production Terps I

996
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:50,640
see what's up with all that

997
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:53,099
so aside from your breeding work which

998
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:55,319
is is completely prolific it's really

999
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:57,300
well known and like you said it's its

1000
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:00,059
own kind of ecosystem where you've kept

1001
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:01,980
it very pure in its own form and rarely

1002
00:40:00,059 --> 00:40:04,559
do you bring anything in you're also

1003
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:06,838
very well known for your true living

1004
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:09,539
Organics you have a book out from Green

1005
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:11,460
candy press called true living Organics

1006
00:40:09,539 --> 00:40:16,039
let's talk about it let's talk about

1007
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:19,380
let's let's do a a step-by-step quick

1008
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:20,880
basic organic introduction like you

1009
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:24,119
would you would teach a beginner give

1010
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:26,400
them your your best advice that you

1011
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:28,079
would give a beginner starting into

1012
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,599
Organics

1013
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:32,220
okay

1014
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:35,640
TLO

1015
00:40:32,219 --> 00:40:36,959
simply an all-natural Style

1016
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:39,960
okay

1017
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:43,980
when I say all natural style

1018
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:46,800
I do mean organic yeah but all organic

1019
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:49,500
Styles aren't all natural that's right

1020
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:52,380
yeah I could be growing organic with my

1021
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:55,019
Earth Juice bottles and it would not be

1022
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:57,480
all natural exactly it would be organic

1023
00:40:55,019 --> 00:41:00,059
yes so that's the first difference there

1024
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:02,460
TLO is an all-natural style there's no

1025
00:41:00,059 --> 00:41:04,500
liquid anything no synthetics we don't

1026
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:06,780
cram

1027
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:09,719
organic acids in there to force feed

1028
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:12,960
them yada yada no synthetic processes in

1029
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:16,139
any of it or even any hot or organic

1030
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:18,480
acids in any prolific amounts okay and

1031
00:41:16,139 --> 00:41:21,838
um then the next thing you need to know

1032
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:24,059
about TLO is we leverage Mother Nature

1033
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:26,578
right we take some advantage of the

1034
00:41:24,059 --> 00:41:29,039
plants being in containers like higher

1035
00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:30,660
root temperatures yeah that means

1036
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:32,519
there's more you know you've seen an ant

1037
00:41:30,659 --> 00:41:34,500
hill on a sunny day compared to an ant

1038
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:35,880
hill on a cloudy day yeah you know

1039
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,320
they're moving like lightning on the

1040
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,180
sunny day and they're all just screwed

1041
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:41,220
all right same with your plants when the

1042
00:41:39,179 --> 00:41:43,019
roots are the temperature around the

1043
00:41:41,219 --> 00:41:44,699
roots in the container are warm like

1044
00:41:43,019 --> 00:41:47,280
that that's pretty alien to the plant

1045
00:41:44,699 --> 00:41:49,439
but Mother Nature comes to the rescue

1046
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,480
takes advantage of that but we can

1047
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,519
leverage all those things right yeah it

1048
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,740
goes warmer temperatures and the right

1049
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:57,780
balance the right pH the right food the

1050
00:41:55,739 --> 00:42:00,838
right aeration the right container

1051
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:03,060
Dynamics you put the right water you put

1052
00:42:00,838 --> 00:42:05,759
all those together and not only is it

1053
00:42:03,059 --> 00:42:08,759
all natural growing it's freaking

1054
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:11,700
Supernatural right and I mean literally

1055
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:14,280
not just a tagline yeah yeah

1056
00:42:11,699 --> 00:42:16,199
natural yeah

1057
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:17,940
so we were getting into

1058
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:21,000
um the second part the second question

1059
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:22,440
of uh best advice you would give a tll

1060
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,440
grower

1061
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:28,380
right right the second part is

1062
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:31,320
from the movie Ghostbusters do not cross

1063
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:33,059
the streams

1064
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:35,460
okay

1065
00:42:33,059 --> 00:42:38,159
this is one of the most important things

1066
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:40,740
and what [ __ ] up the most people most

1067
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:43,139
often right is they have their grow

1068
00:42:40,739 --> 00:42:46,199
going really good everything's cranking

1069
00:42:43,139 --> 00:42:50,098
along and they decide to add some sweet

1070
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:52,980
or some you know super Thrive or some

1071
00:42:50,099 --> 00:42:56,220
kind of Elixir or yes you know because

1072
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:58,920
that just does once you get how the

1073
00:42:56,219 --> 00:43:01,739
all-natural process works it's all about

1074
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:04,200
consistency right yes it's all about the

1075
00:43:01,739 --> 00:43:06,479
plant and the soil all getting used to

1076
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:09,299
their environment the changes don't come

1077
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:11,338
rapidly they come slowly the plant loves

1078
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:13,980
it like that because it grows super

1079
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:16,559
slowly right exactly you can't just

1080
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:19,679
blast in a bunch of phosphorus or or

1081
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:21,900
some kind of radical fulvic acid

1082
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:23,879
solution in there and think everything's

1083
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:26,400
gonna be okay because the first thing

1084
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:29,400
it's going to do is change the ph and

1085
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:32,700
the soil radically yeah now if you're a

1086
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:35,280
human you might go cool more food but if

1087
00:43:32,699 --> 00:43:38,578
you're microlife in the soil you die

1088
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:40,619
yeah and it takes a whole two weeks for

1089
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:43,140
that to come back to where it should be

1090
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:45,539
after a mistake like that and if that

1091
00:43:43,139 --> 00:43:47,460
two weeks is during flowering well as we

1092
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:49,679
discussed before you're taking the way

1093
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:51,659
from resin production yeah yeah

1094
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:53,460
instantly instantly you're you're

1095
00:43:51,659 --> 00:43:55,500
boofing your bud

1096
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:57,780
um yeah I mean I don't get why anybody

1097
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:59,818
would go through all that process of

1098
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:01,800
having this beautiful organic living

1099
00:43:59,818 --> 00:44:03,659
soil and add in just a little thing but

1100
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:05,220
I guess that temptation is always there

1101
00:44:03,659 --> 00:44:06,598
though right like for for people that

1102
00:44:05,219 --> 00:44:08,639
are used to bottles grabbing that bottle

1103
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:11,160
real quick to make a quick adjustment

1104
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:13,259
for sure I understand it my god when I

1105
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:16,858
was making the transformation myself I

1106
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:18,960
boned that one many times myself

1107
00:44:16,858 --> 00:44:21,598
I bet I bet it's got to be a common

1108
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,338
habit so well right out of the gate the

1109
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,838
problem the problem is it's right out of

1110
00:44:23,338 --> 00:44:27,719
the gate when you pour some of that on

1111
00:44:24,838 --> 00:44:30,659
on your plant oh your plant looks wicked

1112
00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:32,519
happy for a week maybe 10 day oh yeah it

1113
00:44:30,659 --> 00:44:34,199
loves it you go man I made a great move

1114
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:36,179
then all of a sudden it starts going to

1115
00:44:34,199 --> 00:44:38,639
hell and you're like what's wrong well

1116
00:44:36,179 --> 00:44:40,980
it's because it catches up in time yeah

1117
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:43,679
so if you're going to go TLO stay till

1118
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:45,599
low do not mix yeah give it a fair give

1119
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:47,759
it a fair shot you know don't don't

1120
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:49,800
decide when you've got you know a couple

1121
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,500
or a few weeks left to go before Harvest

1122
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:56,760
that you need a phosphorus boost yeah

1123
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:59,460
yeah okay no kidding yeah so when when

1124
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:01,440
did you start your writing career I mean

1125
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:03,240
this is a big part of your career is

1126
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,440
writing not just growing and writing

1127
00:45:03,239 --> 00:45:07,379
about growing but actually being an

1128
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:09,539
author when did that kind of come about

1129
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:12,240
um I uh

1130
00:45:09,539 --> 00:45:14,579
met up with a guy who was a writer his

1131
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:16,219
name was gooey he just met with him

1132
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:19,140
online right

1133
00:45:16,219 --> 00:45:20,939
I didn't know [ __ ] about writing yeah I

1134
00:45:19,139 --> 00:45:23,759
mean I could I couldn't even spell the

1135
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:25,858
word the word article consistently yeah

1136
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:27,420
right I would spell it wrong I spelled

1137
00:45:25,858 --> 00:45:30,059
all kinds of things wrong my sentence

1138
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:32,579
structure sucked anyway so he proposed

1139
00:45:30,059 --> 00:45:36,000
an idea where he wrote for skunk

1140
00:45:32,579 --> 00:45:37,740
magazine at that time so he proposed an

1141
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,780
idea where we would collaborate right

1142
00:45:37,739 --> 00:45:42,899
and we would just do some stuff together

1143
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:45,060
yeah so I stuck with him for probably I

1144
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:47,400
don't know it was like a year but what

1145
00:45:45,059 --> 00:45:48,900
we would do is I would write then I

1146
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:52,318
would send it to him

1147
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:54,660
then he would he would fix it and then

1148
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:56,338
he would send it back to me and then I

1149
00:45:54,659 --> 00:45:57,598
would say yeah yeah because sometimes if

1150
00:45:56,338 --> 00:45:59,460
you don't know how to grow and you're

1151
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:00,838
editing somebody's writing you screw it

1152
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:03,720
all up because you don't know what

1153
00:46:00,838 --> 00:46:06,119
you're saying absolutely so along with

1154
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:08,399
correcting those kind of things I also

1155
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:11,099
took really careful note on the writing

1156
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:13,200
Corrections he made yeah I started to

1157
00:46:11,099 --> 00:46:15,240
get a grip on how he wrote how he

1158
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:18,118
structured his sentences blah blah blah

1159
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:21,000
so after about two years I guess a year

1160
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:23,338
and a half of that I uh broke out on my

1161
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,440
own and just started writing and I did

1162
00:46:23,338 --> 00:46:26,940
okay for a while and slowly came up more

1163
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,400
and more and more

1164
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:31,980
you know in my skills of writing sure

1165
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:34,619
and then uh at uh at one point when

1166
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:36,300
skunk went digital they got the new I

1167
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:38,818
forgot what it's called but the program

1168
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:41,099
that you uh submit articles in right

1169
00:46:38,818 --> 00:46:43,619
it's okay it's got all its own little

1170
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:45,838
rules right

1171
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:47,760
excuse me like how many you know words

1172
00:46:45,838 --> 00:46:50,099
can be in a paragraph how many

1173
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:52,700
paragraphs can be how many words and

1174
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:55,079
paragraphs can be under a heading

1175
00:46:52,699 --> 00:46:57,059
all this stuff that I wasn't really that

1176
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:59,099
familiar with so that trained me a

1177
00:46:57,059 --> 00:47:01,199
little further so so now I can write

1178
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:02,720
pretty good you know standard issue

1179
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:05,098
pretty good I still have my own

1180
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:07,439
signature moves that I pull off that

1181
00:47:05,099 --> 00:47:09,780
aren't you know classic writing skills

1182
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,700
but yeah for sure you know it's it's

1183
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:14,040
like whenever I'm writing I'm always

1184
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:16,078
imagining that I'm just sitting there

1185
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:18,000
talking to somebody at a pub or

1186
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:19,980
something and I'm explaining whatever

1187
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,780
I'm writing to them and it's funny

1188
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:24,719
because a lot of the people who email me

1189
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:26,400
they say exactly that they go I swear

1190
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:27,838
man I feel like I'm just sitting next to

1191
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,180
you in a pub and you're just telling me

1192
00:47:27,838 --> 00:47:32,159
stuff yeah that's what I enjoy that's

1193
00:47:30,179 --> 00:47:34,019
what that's why early your writing

1194
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:35,699
resonated with me as I was growing up

1195
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:37,380
and reading skunk and doing all that

1196
00:47:35,699 --> 00:47:39,659
like it always resonated with me because

1197
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:41,099
it's how I speak when I'm talking to

1198
00:47:39,659 --> 00:47:43,318
someone it's just familiar you don't

1199
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:45,480
feel like someone's above you talking

1200
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:47,519
down to you just feel like it's a broke

1201
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:49,139
talking about growing you know no I mean

1202
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:51,239
everybody has their own likes and

1203
00:47:49,139 --> 00:47:53,519
dislikes I respect that totally you know

1204
00:47:51,239 --> 00:47:55,559
it's uh it's like music or anything else

1205
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:57,300
or your favorite food you know you have

1206
00:47:55,559 --> 00:47:59,099
your favorites right now your favorites

1207
00:47:57,300 --> 00:48:01,500
change sometimes that's just the way it

1208
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:05,640
is I go through I go through periods

1209
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:07,980
where I'm just like uh oh God yeah I

1210
00:48:05,639 --> 00:48:11,480
made some sash from some Cinderella 99

1211
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:14,519
recently oh that's a good move

1212
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:17,159
that's a really good move so anyway I

1213
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:19,858
just got obliterate I don't really you

1214
00:48:17,159 --> 00:48:21,719
know for uh for a writer of cannabis an

1215
00:48:19,858 --> 00:48:23,818
author and a grower and a breeder I

1216
00:48:21,719 --> 00:48:25,858
don't really smoke as much weed as a lot

1217
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:27,358
of the people I know yeah probably

1218
00:48:25,858 --> 00:48:29,940
because I'm older now because I sure

1219
00:48:27,358 --> 00:48:32,219
used to yeah but when I get something

1220
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:35,220
that's really fine in my hands like that

1221
00:48:32,219 --> 00:48:37,500
Cindy hash I tend to go for you know

1222
00:48:35,219 --> 00:48:39,739
maybe a week just being the stoner from

1223
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,739
hell

1224
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:45,780
all the time

1225
00:48:43,318 --> 00:48:47,279
that's me when I start when I fire up

1226
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:49,019
the puffco

1227
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,119
you know there's a good week or two

1228
00:48:49,019 --> 00:48:52,619
where I'm just stuck on stupid you know

1229
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,660
for a while and then I go back to flower

1230
00:48:52,619 --> 00:48:57,539
and kind of get you can do it slowly but

1231
00:48:54,659 --> 00:49:00,899
yeah yeah that always yeah we go hash

1232
00:48:57,539 --> 00:49:03,480
also blows your whole ability to smoke

1233
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:05,099
flowers too because it brings it raises

1234
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:08,579
your tolerance to a really high level

1235
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:10,079
super fast super fast yeah and that and

1236
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:12,300
that that's no fun when you can't really

1237
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:15,119
enjoy the fine complexities of a high in

1238
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:17,160
a flower right because exactly exactly

1239
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:19,559
because I I test stuff out you know

1240
00:49:17,159 --> 00:49:22,199
where where sometimes the route I take

1241
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:24,480
for breeding is I will use uh since I'm

1242
00:49:22,199 --> 00:49:27,000
really good and fast at making hash I'll

1243
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,800
take four plants four females that I've

1244
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,079
never seen all the way through flowering

1245
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,700
right and I'll have my male or two or

1246
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:35,339
three however many I'm using in there

1247
00:49:32,699 --> 00:49:37,379
then since I've seen this so many times

1248
00:49:35,338 --> 00:49:39,900
and especially if I'm using something I

1249
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:42,358
know I can look at the plants as they

1250
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:45,180
seat up watch them very closely under

1251
00:49:42,358 --> 00:49:47,098
magnification as they finish and I can

1252
00:49:45,179 --> 00:49:49,440
tell who's got the most resin production

1253
00:49:47,099 --> 00:49:52,079
and of course the turpins become obvious

1254
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:54,420
to me yeah yeah and uh so what I do is

1255
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:58,318
is I make separate hash balls from each

1256
00:49:54,420 --> 00:50:00,838
female because beyond the resin count

1257
00:49:58,318 --> 00:50:03,779
the resin production you have the resin

1258
00:50:00,838 --> 00:50:05,519
coating right the profile itself yeah so

1259
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:08,579
and that's what I'm really all about I

1260
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:10,858
love that so I just take days where for

1261
00:50:08,579 --> 00:50:14,339
three days I smoke just hash from one

1262
00:50:10,858 --> 00:50:17,098
you know in the morning noon night then

1263
00:50:14,338 --> 00:50:19,139
the next day or the next set of days I

1264
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:20,818
smoke and it takes me you know a week or

1265
00:50:19,139 --> 00:50:23,699
two to go through four or five different

1266
00:50:20,818 --> 00:50:25,500
females sure but by the end of that I

1267
00:50:23,699 --> 00:50:27,419
damn sure know which ones I like best

1268
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,920
yeah you have a good idea how it gets

1269
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:30,659
you because a lot of people like I mean

1270
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:32,880
I'm sure people realize this but I don't

1271
00:50:30,659 --> 00:50:34,980
know that they consciously realize it

1272
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:36,720
a strain doesn't always affect the same

1273
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:39,119
person the same way at the same time of

1274
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:41,159
the day when you smoke in the morning in

1275
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:44,220
fact nor will it affect you the same way

1276
00:50:41,159 --> 00:50:47,519
under two different situations exactly

1277
00:50:44,219 --> 00:50:49,558
right it's it's it's so variant how a

1278
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:51,480
high will make you feel it could you

1279
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:53,519
could be smoking the exact same Terps

1280
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:55,619
cannabinoid content everything but time

1281
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:58,380
of day mood everything matters when it

1282
00:50:55,619 --> 00:51:00,838
comes to cannabis everything I agree 100

1283
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:03,300
it's like uh one of my favorite things

1284
00:51:00,838 --> 00:51:05,759
to do to test out especially sativas

1285
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:07,920
ones are sativa dominant they're all

1286
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:10,200
just blaze of doobie or a couple hits or

1287
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:12,480
whatever and I'll but I'll Blaze out on

1288
00:51:10,199 --> 00:51:14,879
my bicycle and go riding around see see

1289
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:17,039
what's up yeah dude I'll see what kind

1290
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,380
of energy motivations weed it really is

1291
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:21,779
a lot of times I don't even get to

1292
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:23,760
really truly experience a high until I

1293
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:25,319
get up and move around and start you

1294
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,819
know getting some getting some action

1295
00:51:25,318 --> 00:51:31,440
going that's usually when I figure out a

1296
00:51:26,818 --> 00:51:33,239
house truly stoned I am exactly and you

1297
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:36,059
can take note of things along the away

1298
00:51:33,239 --> 00:51:38,338
like some things stay consistent like oh

1299
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:39,900
this is well I ate that whole box of

1300
00:51:38,338 --> 00:51:42,058
cookies so I guess it gives you the

1301
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:44,818
munchies pretty hardcore exactly yeah

1302
00:51:42,059 --> 00:51:46,500
yeah exactly yeah yeah so you could tell

1303
00:51:44,818 --> 00:51:49,019
some things stay the same but as far as

1304
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:51,239
your attitude as far as how it hits you

1305
00:51:49,019 --> 00:51:53,400
mentally when you're on it there's some

1306
00:51:51,239 --> 00:51:56,098
that are just like I say those bhutanese

1307
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:58,380
or the Blue Rhino 1947 there's a few

1308
00:51:56,099 --> 00:52:01,318
others I have that just make me have

1309
00:51:58,380 --> 00:52:03,480
that golden the life is beautiful thing

1310
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:06,000
yeah and then there's then there's those

1311
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:07,920
strains where a stupid joke will make

1312
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,500
you laugh to where you almost choke to

1313
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:12,900
death yeah I mean it's just there's so

1314
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:14,880
many different kinds out there and you

1315
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:16,740
know I run across somebody a couple

1316
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,960
years ago and man I'll always remember

1317
00:52:16,739 --> 00:52:21,299
this guy he comes up to me wants to

1318
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,039
smoke a doobie with me and I'm like dude

1319
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:24,380
is it organic or whatever he goes I

1320
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:27,719
don't know it's pot

1321
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:29,760
he goes but it's really really powerful

1322
00:52:27,719 --> 00:52:31,500
and and I said all right well let me

1323
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,480
have a hit of it I smell it it smelled

1324
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:36,119
good you know I was like okay my first

1325
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:38,940
hit I could see it was gnarly synthetic

1326
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:42,059
grown like so bad it was like Miracle

1327
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:43,679
Grow yeah right it was like oh [ __ ] I'm

1328
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:46,200
sorry don't want to piss you off but

1329
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:48,539
that sucks right yeah yeah and uh he

1330
00:52:46,199 --> 00:52:50,338
goes dude you won't believe how high it

1331
00:52:48,539 --> 00:52:53,159
gets you and I go let me let you in on a

1332
00:52:50,338 --> 00:52:54,838
little secret here I could spray the bud

1333
00:52:53,159 --> 00:52:57,960
with raid

1334
00:52:54,838 --> 00:53:01,380
and if you smoked it you would get so

1335
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:04,500
[ __ ] up yes so it's not just about

1336
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:06,059
that right you know that they actually

1337
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:09,000
um I've talked about this before on the

1338
00:53:06,059 --> 00:53:11,400
show back when I was in my teens in

1339
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,500
Bakersfield most of the time we were

1340
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:15,000
getting in Mexican compressed during

1341
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:16,619
that during the 90s we're getting

1342
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,119
Mexican compressed and we're young we

1343
00:53:16,619 --> 00:53:20,099
didn't have access to dank up and

1344
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:22,920
Humboldt we'd have cars to drive around

1345
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:25,559
we were young poor kids but in a certain

1346
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:27,358
area of town you could go get Mexican

1347
00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:29,880
and it always had this weird floral

1348
00:53:27,358 --> 00:53:31,078
perfumey smell to it later on I found

1349
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:32,220
out they were spraying it with raid

1350
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:33,660
because they would they would sell it

1351
00:53:32,219 --> 00:53:35,098
and they'd call it nade so I thought

1352
00:53:33,659 --> 00:53:36,358
that was the Stray name but later on I

1353
00:53:35,099 --> 00:53:39,300
found out they're spraying it literally

1354
00:53:36,358 --> 00:53:43,679
with raid well it will get you really

1355
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:45,960
really high it sure will [ __ ] just just

1356
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:48,598
take a shortcut and inhale some rain if

1357
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:51,838
that's it right up on some raid yeah

1358
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:53,119
don't have fun right no no no if I'm

1359
00:53:51,838 --> 00:53:55,920
right kids

1360
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:58,200
but yeah I know I I it's shocking what

1361
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:00,539
people will do to their weed just to

1362
00:53:58,199 --> 00:54:02,338
to give an effect even if it has nothing

1363
00:54:00,539 --> 00:54:04,380
to do with the natural processes of the

1364
00:54:02,338 --> 00:54:07,078
plant or the high of cannabis right

1365
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:09,539
right I've converted many many people

1366
00:54:07,079 --> 00:54:12,119
just by giving them some weed right

1367
00:54:09,539 --> 00:54:14,460
because they'll hit me with a weed and

1368
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:17,880
they'll go oh this is the best weed and

1369
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:21,179
and I say compared to what yeah not

1370
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:23,099
compared to this yeah this little number

1371
00:54:21,179 --> 00:54:25,078
and I'll give them like a quarter ounce

1372
00:54:23,099 --> 00:54:27,780
of it or something right and within the

1373
00:54:25,079 --> 00:54:29,579
time of no more than a few days it never

1374
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:31,500
takes more than a few days

1375
00:54:29,579 --> 00:54:33,240
next thing they're doing man they're

1376
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:35,338
asking me how to do this they want

1377
00:54:33,239 --> 00:54:38,239
details they're selling all their other

1378
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:41,219
[ __ ] they think it's crap now because

1379
00:54:38,239 --> 00:54:42,659
especially synthetics I mean if you're

1380
00:54:41,219 --> 00:54:45,539
someone who can't tell the difference

1381
00:54:42,659 --> 00:54:47,759
between synthetic grown weed and organic

1382
00:54:45,539 --> 00:54:49,500
or all natural grown weed

1383
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,660
you need to solve that problem first

1384
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:53,400
because there is a hell of a difference

1385
00:54:51,659 --> 00:54:55,920
it means you're not smoking enough

1386
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:58,019
different good Growers if you don't know

1387
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:00,358
the difference absolutely because man

1388
00:54:58,019 --> 00:55:02,699
that's synthetic weed I could take one

1389
00:55:00,358 --> 00:55:04,558
hit of real shitty synthetic weed oh

1390
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:06,899
yeah and my throat's through for the

1391
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:08,819
rest of the day yeah yeah you're blowing

1392
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:10,980
out blowing out coughs out the throat

1393
00:55:08,818 --> 00:55:12,539
all day yeah it's all hot and shitty

1394
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:14,579
yeah yeah

1395
00:55:12,539 --> 00:55:17,338
it's pretty typical for it

1396
00:55:14,579 --> 00:55:18,720
so I mean you know if that's your gig if

1397
00:55:17,338 --> 00:55:21,838
that's what you like and that's yeah

1398
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:23,699
right fine you know but don't don't

1399
00:55:21,838 --> 00:55:25,799
throw it on me and try to tell me it's

1400
00:55:23,699 --> 00:55:27,719
organic I don't tell me it's the best

1401
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:29,818
you know like if you haven't smoked a

1402
00:55:27,719 --> 00:55:31,379
good sampling of all that's out there

1403
00:55:29,818 --> 00:55:33,058
and a lot of different types of growing

1404
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:35,579
stuff you really don't truly know until

1405
00:55:33,059 --> 00:55:36,900
you have that experience and if got the

1406
00:55:35,579 --> 00:55:39,260
breadth until you can tell the

1407
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:41,880
difference between organic you know

1408
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:43,619
shitty synthetic and the and the

1409
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:45,838
difference in between it's not just

1410
00:55:43,619 --> 00:55:47,760
looking at the ash you know it's just

1411
00:55:45,838 --> 00:55:49,440
that yeah but and that's just the

1412
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:51,720
Elegance of the smoke you know how

1413
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:54,539
elegant and smooth it is yeah when

1414
00:55:51,719 --> 00:55:57,000
you're organic or all natural your your

1415
00:55:54,539 --> 00:56:00,239
miles above anything synthetic all all

1416
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:02,699
the way yeah but from you know I've

1417
00:56:00,239 --> 00:56:05,239
never smoked really organically grown

1418
00:56:02,699 --> 00:56:08,338
bottle weed I call it soup style

1419
00:56:05,239 --> 00:56:11,578
organically grown weed with bottles that

1420
00:56:08,338 --> 00:56:14,219
has been really offensive unless the

1421
00:56:11,579 --> 00:56:16,260
person has decided to Goose their plants

1422
00:56:14,219 --> 00:56:19,558
at the end with a bunch of potassium and

1423
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:22,680
phosphorus you know yeah if they don't

1424
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:25,019
fade an organic bottle grow well it can

1425
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:27,659
be harsh nothing like synthetics can be

1426
00:56:25,019 --> 00:56:29,159
yeah but still you can pick it up there

1427
00:56:27,659 --> 00:56:32,098
you know I'm sure you've smoked those

1428
00:56:29,159 --> 00:56:34,920
dummies where the the Cherry will Sizzle

1429
00:56:32,099 --> 00:56:37,640
like a sparkler a little bit yes that's

1430
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:40,858
Mega potassium still in there yeah yeah

1431
00:56:37,639 --> 00:56:43,558
I love Mega potassium

1432
00:56:40,858 --> 00:56:45,598
yeah and yeah I mean if you're gonna

1433
00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:47,519
pour like heavy potassium or like

1434
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:50,220
phospho load on your plants at the end

1435
00:56:47,519 --> 00:56:51,719
of an organ or a TLO grow just just

1436
00:56:50,219 --> 00:56:54,419
don't just don't you're not going to

1437
00:56:51,719 --> 00:56:56,399
fool anyone just you're not I mean

1438
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:59,579
potassium and phosphorus are both

1439
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:01,680
elements that you absolutely do not want

1440
00:56:59,579 --> 00:57:03,480
to Goose your plants with pretty much

1441
00:57:01,679 --> 00:57:06,000
ever if you're in soil no matter what

1442
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:08,760
you're doing yeah exactly in nature

1443
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:11,519
potassium and phosphorus don't come in

1444
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:14,160
highly available forms they're taken in

1445
00:57:11,519 --> 00:57:16,199
very slowly stored and that's another

1446
00:57:14,159 --> 00:57:18,358
thing with breeding that I also notice

1447
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:21,539
is along with like what we were talking

1448
00:57:18,358 --> 00:57:23,279
about before with how vigorous and what

1449
00:57:21,539 --> 00:57:26,639
I used to call the growth hormone right

1450
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:28,200
yeah how how adaptable they are another

1451
00:57:26,639 --> 00:57:30,480
thing with it what was I just talking

1452
00:57:28,199 --> 00:57:33,799
about see how I am

1453
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,800
see how I am

1454
00:57:35,338 --> 00:57:41,880
um this is the curse of the old person

1455
00:57:37,699 --> 00:57:43,919
it's okay Mr Magoo what am I doing where

1456
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:46,318
did I go

1457
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:49,318
oh okay what was I talking about oh yeah

1458
00:57:46,318 --> 00:57:51,179
so yeah so it's potassium and phosphorus

1459
00:57:49,318 --> 00:57:53,338
are just meant to be taken up super

1460
00:57:51,179 --> 00:57:55,440
slowly over time right like I said and

1461
00:57:53,338 --> 00:57:57,358
stored in the plant and along with

1462
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:59,818
certain abilities of certain plants over

1463
00:57:57,358 --> 00:58:03,078
other plants one of those abilities is

1464
00:57:59,818 --> 00:58:06,380
to be able to store and acquire

1465
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:08,640
nutrients like potassium calcium

1466
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:10,440
phosphorus something about a breeding

1467
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:14,098
trait here yeah yeah yeah when you're

1468
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:16,740
selecting some plants can store a lot of

1469
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:18,960
those nutrients yeah some plants have a

1470
00:58:16,739 --> 00:58:21,479
hard time getting it some plants don't

1471
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:23,639
you know it's just how well they work in

1472
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:26,159
synchronicity with the soil life it's

1473
00:58:23,639 --> 00:58:28,199
how how adaptable I guess it's kind of

1474
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:31,500
their more Wilder side coming back to

1475
00:58:28,199 --> 00:58:32,759
them yeah so one thing I noticed going

1476
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:35,818
through your stuff I don't think you

1477
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:37,980
have any OG cush in your lines do you no

1478
00:58:35,818 --> 00:58:40,139
I do not I love that I love that I mean

1479
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:40,980
I like OG Kush but at the same time the

1480
00:58:40,139 --> 00:58:43,199
past

1481
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:45,019
20 years has been bombarded everything

1482
00:58:43,199 --> 00:58:47,460
has OG in it now so you always yeah

1483
00:58:45,019 --> 00:58:50,159
profile somewhere in it and I just

1484
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:52,858
realizing wait a minute this is this is

1485
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:55,558
an enigma this is a a thing you don't

1486
00:58:52,858 --> 00:58:58,380
find very often a breeder that's still

1487
00:58:55,559 --> 00:59:00,480
going didn't work OG Kush in their lines

1488
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:03,358
in a still successful making great lines

1489
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:05,818
I mean that's special I like OG Kush

1490
00:59:03,358 --> 00:59:08,039
right yeah it kicks my ass I think it's

1491
00:59:05,818 --> 00:59:09,779
that the guys who first made that were

1492
00:59:08,039 --> 00:59:11,900
guys from Northern California who went

1493
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:15,059
down to LA right yeah

1494
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:17,519
those are the guys who built that so uh

1495
00:59:15,059 --> 00:59:19,798
that was uh that was a devastating

1496
00:59:17,519 --> 00:59:21,539
that's that's a that's a not a day

1497
00:59:19,798 --> 00:59:23,159
record because the legs aren't super

1498
00:59:21,539 --> 00:59:25,019
long but I mean it would be a day

1499
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:27,298
wrecker if the legs were longer yeah

1500
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:29,519
because it's just disabling I mean it

1501
00:59:27,298 --> 00:59:31,380
just if if I'm in bed and I feel like

1502
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:32,298
[ __ ] OG Kush would be perfect you know

1503
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:34,440
just

1504
00:59:32,298 --> 00:59:38,280
because I'm not gonna be doing much else

1505
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:41,220
besides maybe get a haircut and watch a

1506
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:43,920
movie and and not follow it yeah exactly

1507
00:59:41,219 --> 00:59:46,019
exactly I mean there's a time and place

1508
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:48,240
for that weed but that's not usually my

1509
00:59:46,019 --> 00:59:50,280
go-to type so I didn't want to use it

1510
00:59:48,239 --> 00:59:53,338
because I mostly breed with stuff I like

1511
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:55,200
and even though I'm not the usual I'm

1512
00:59:53,338 --> 00:59:58,318
not the regular I'm not the majority

1513
00:59:55,199 --> 01:00:00,480
most people like strains and and

1514
00:59:58,318 --> 01:00:02,699
varieties that are different than the

1515
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:05,519
ones I like the most I tend to lean a

1516
01:00:02,699 --> 01:00:07,139
little more sativa in my likes or most

1517
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:08,940
people lean a little more Indica in

1518
01:00:07,139 --> 01:00:10,858
their likes and it's not that I don't

1519
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:12,960
like it because it's just if I'm gonna

1520
01:00:10,858 --> 01:00:14,818
have a go-to weed that I'm gonna I'm a

1521
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:16,920
busy guy I do a lot of [ __ ] all the time

1522
01:00:14,818 --> 01:00:18,480
yeah we don't need something to hammer

1523
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:20,400
me down and make me eat some pancakes

1524
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,960
and go to sleep yeah no that don't help

1525
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:24,180
nothing I want something where I could

1526
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:26,760
be high and happy still functional and

1527
01:00:24,179 --> 01:00:31,199
I'm stoned as hell but I'm still good to

1528
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:33,240
operate it's not like da right yeah I I

1529
01:00:31,199 --> 01:00:34,858
just I I admired that I admire that

1530
01:00:33,239 --> 01:00:37,078
because it's so easy to go with the

1531
01:00:34,858 --> 01:00:38,400
crowd I you know push oh geez uh things

1532
01:00:37,079 --> 01:00:39,960
are going a little bit slower let's push

1533
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,460
some OG in there that's what's hip now

1534
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:43,019
you know you just never did it and I and

1535
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:46,199
I admire that that's that punk rock

1536
01:00:43,019 --> 01:00:48,719
ethos that I love about the Rev thank

1537
01:00:46,199 --> 01:00:51,960
you I sure got offered enough of it you

1538
01:00:48,719 --> 01:00:53,338
know I guarantee you did yeah for sure I

1539
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:56,400
mean you were there for the beginning of

1540
01:00:53,338 --> 01:00:58,199
it the you know all of it and you just I

1541
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:01,880
love that you stuck to your guns that's

1542
01:00:58,199 --> 01:01:04,558
what makes you special oh

1543
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:07,260
what's the revs white whale what's a

1544
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:09,180
strain that you that you either you've

1545
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:11,040
had and lost or a strain that you're

1546
01:01:09,179 --> 01:01:13,679
hunting a strain that you just always

1547
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:16,858
wanted or a terp profile that you've

1548
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:19,919
always wanted well I'm pretty good with

1549
01:01:16,858 --> 01:01:21,539
making terp profiles I mean I'm usually

1550
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:23,460
pretty close I've seen enough of them

1551
01:01:21,539 --> 01:01:25,798
blend so I know

1552
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:27,838
close to where they're gonna go and then

1553
01:01:25,798 --> 01:01:30,358
individuals in that batch I can usually

1554
01:01:27,838 --> 01:01:32,159
find it you know yeah but as far as the

1555
01:01:30,358 --> 01:01:35,279
The Strain I would love to have back

1556
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:39,000
that the police got from me

1557
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:42,240
after I first moved here was my Panama

1558
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:44,280
Red Clone oh I bet one of the craziest

1559
01:01:42,239 --> 01:01:46,618
[ __ ] plants you've ever seen a jungle

1560
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:48,359
sativa right this thing would grow roots

1561
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:50,460
that would shoot straight up out of the

1562
01:01:48,358 --> 01:01:52,019
ground for a couple inches then they

1563
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:53,940
would turn around and go straight back

1564
01:01:52,019 --> 01:01:55,460
into the ground so you'd have all these

1565
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:58,019
root loops

1566
01:01:55,460 --> 01:02:01,199
and then new plants would start growing

1567
01:01:58,019 --> 01:02:02,940
off of those of the what that's crazy

1568
01:02:01,199 --> 01:02:04,739
all right do you think that's weird let

1569
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:06,720
me tell you something else you know how

1570
01:02:04,739 --> 01:02:08,939
the male plants in some strange some

1571
01:02:06,719 --> 01:02:12,058
rare varieties they're usually land race

1572
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:13,559
heirloom types they have those Nubs at

1573
01:02:12,059 --> 01:02:15,960
the base of the stem I don't mean it

1574
01:02:13,559 --> 01:02:17,640
from being too humid yeah I mean they

1575
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:19,679
actually have little Nubs like they

1576
01:02:17,639 --> 01:02:22,519
reinforce the bottom third of their

1577
01:02:19,679 --> 01:02:28,318
steps these like armor Nubs right sure

1578
01:02:22,519 --> 01:02:32,280
the Panama Red had spikes on those Nubs

1579
01:02:28,318 --> 01:02:34,558
still a pointy little like thorns on

1580
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:37,019
those Nubs I mean you talk about a

1581
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:40,440
dinosaur freaking plant and DJ Short

1582
01:02:37,019 --> 01:02:42,239
absolutely described it to a t it is the

1583
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:45,119
tequila of weed

1584
01:02:42,239 --> 01:02:49,139
what makes you say that right it is

1585
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:51,240
psychoactive man it is it is it is off

1586
01:02:49,139 --> 01:02:54,000
your rock or down the rabbit hole

1587
01:02:51,239 --> 01:02:56,578
complete takeover of everything this is

1588
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:59,039
like it it warms you so thoroughly you

1589
01:02:56,579 --> 01:03:01,500
were like it's almost like mushrooms it

1590
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:04,440
really is wow yeah I mean it just your

1591
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:07,199
auto Tory or your visual everything is

1592
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:09,659
affected hardcore your brain is just

1593
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:12,179
going 20 directions at once it's like

1594
01:03:09,659 --> 01:03:13,739
it's like your head is zooming through

1595
01:03:12,179 --> 01:03:15,838
space really fast you know you're just

1596
01:03:13,739 --> 01:03:17,459
like whoa like that ad for those

1597
01:03:15,838 --> 01:03:19,619
speakers that time yeah oh yeah yeah

1598
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:22,798
yeah yeah yeah just like that you're

1599
01:03:19,619 --> 01:03:26,039
like whoa It's just kicking your ass and

1600
01:03:22,798 --> 01:03:28,440
like a Durban Poison it has waves right

1601
01:03:26,039 --> 01:03:30,480
then it's creeper so the first 10

1602
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:33,480
minutes after you smoke it you go damn

1603
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:36,000
damn and then five minutes left there

1604
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:38,960
you go oh whoa it's not done 10 minutes

1605
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:43,318
after that holy [ __ ]

1606
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:45,659
it it just keeps bumping and you just go

1607
01:03:43,318 --> 01:03:48,659
deeper and deeper it's a great great

1608
01:03:45,659 --> 01:03:51,779
I've never seen the true clone of it or

1609
01:03:48,659 --> 01:03:54,838
what looks to me like a true offspring

1610
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:56,940
of it anywhere yeah so I haven't dabbled

1611
01:03:54,838 --> 01:04:00,000
but I never gave the Clone to anybody so

1612
01:03:56,940 --> 01:04:01,920
I don't have any backup so yeah the cops

1613
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,199
the cops have gotten a lot of really

1614
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,980
good strains where did you source that

1615
01:04:04,199 --> 01:04:07,439
one

1616
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:11,579
from a friend of mine down in uh

1617
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:13,440
Nicaragua oh why yeah him and I did well

1618
01:04:11,579 --> 01:04:15,599
a long time ago

1619
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:16,559
I used to get this hash right from

1620
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:19,140
Jamaica

1621
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:21,480
this is red hash and we used to take the

1622
01:04:19,139 --> 01:04:24,598
boat and go down to the uh one of those

1623
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:25,798
islands just off just off in Mexican not

1624
01:04:24,599 --> 01:04:27,539
Catalina

1625
01:04:25,798 --> 01:04:29,639
you know that I was just south of San

1626
01:04:27,539 --> 01:04:31,679
Diego across the border the ones that

1627
01:04:29,639 --> 01:04:34,078
are named after the squid

1628
01:04:31,679 --> 01:04:36,239
Coronado Islands Coronado oh Coronado

1629
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:37,579
yeah yeah yeah yeah not Coronado San

1630
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:40,318
Diego but yeah

1631
01:04:37,579 --> 01:04:42,599
well we used to Rendezvous there and I'd

1632
01:04:40,318 --> 01:04:44,159
I'd always get the hash there well he

1633
01:04:42,599 --> 01:04:46,559
was the one who was always talking about

1634
01:04:44,159 --> 01:04:48,618
this so yeah blah blah Panama Red and

1635
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:51,540
Susie said that of course I was like

1636
01:04:48,619 --> 01:04:53,700
yeah I bet you know Panama Red and he

1637
01:04:51,539 --> 01:04:56,460
goes yeah yeah he goes yeah I have a

1638
01:04:53,699 --> 01:04:58,919
clone so I was like well can you bring

1639
01:04:56,460 --> 01:05:00,599
that with you next time yeah and he was

1640
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:03,000
like yeah yeah sure I'll do that he was

1641
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:07,039
real nonchalant about it for such a whoa

1642
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:09,440
yeah what year was this uh

1643
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:13,798
uh

1644
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:15,720
82 oh my gosh that's awesome yeah legit

1645
01:05:13,798 --> 01:05:17,460
[ __ ] legit time for Panama Red to be

1646
01:05:15,719 --> 01:05:20,939
going around and everything oh well you

1647
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:23,039
know the closest thing to it now that if

1648
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:25,318
you could source as far as I know would

1649
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:27,358
be what was that stuff the Big Sir

1650
01:05:25,318 --> 01:05:30,318
hollyweed remember this movie yeah yeah

1651
01:05:27,358 --> 01:05:33,659
yeah that has real Panama red in it okay

1652
01:05:30,318 --> 01:05:35,940
nice [ __ ] potent potent old sativa

1653
01:05:33,659 --> 01:05:38,519
type oh yeah

1654
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:40,500
yeah Panama Red The way you describe it

1655
01:05:38,519 --> 01:05:43,559
reminds me of how Tom Hill talks about

1656
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:47,519
his Haze a specific Vino in his Haze uh

1657
01:05:43,559 --> 01:05:50,579
it is a lot like killer hazes right it's

1658
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:53,519
got same psychoactive just blo I mean

1659
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:54,720
blow your mind High yeah yeah that's

1660
01:05:53,519 --> 01:05:56,219
when he was talking to her he's like I

1661
01:05:54,719 --> 01:05:58,318
don't even know why anybody grows

1662
01:05:56,219 --> 01:06:01,019
anything but that he's like I don't care

1663
01:05:58,318 --> 01:06:04,139
if it's if it takes 10 and 500 to find

1664
01:06:01,019 --> 01:06:05,519
one of them because it's better than any

1665
01:06:04,139 --> 01:06:07,139
weed you'll ever smoke he's like

1666
01:06:05,519 --> 01:06:09,420
everybody's an idiot for not working

1667
01:06:07,139 --> 01:06:10,798
with it and I I was like wow really but

1668
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:12,960
I mean it sounds like that this High

1669
01:06:10,798 --> 01:06:16,079
truly does exist in cannabis in some

1670
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:17,220
forms it's incredibly impressive and I

1671
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:20,160
say that

1672
01:06:17,219 --> 01:06:22,618
as an understatement I mean yeah if you

1673
01:06:20,159 --> 01:06:24,179
ever smoke it it will I I hope it's

1674
01:06:22,619 --> 01:06:25,680
still right I hope somebody has a hybrid

1675
01:06:24,179 --> 01:06:28,259
of it somewhere or something you know

1676
01:06:25,679 --> 01:06:30,838
yeah or somebody resources the real deal

1677
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:33,299
because it legit comes from the edges of

1678
01:06:30,838 --> 01:06:34,679
the Panamanian jungle yeah you know I

1679
01:06:33,298 --> 01:06:36,480
mean just right there they don't go in

1680
01:06:34,679 --> 01:06:38,818
too deep to have to get it he told me a

1681
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:41,940
lot about it but again I'm old and I

1682
01:06:38,818 --> 01:06:43,739
forget a lot of the details but he had a

1683
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:45,838
lot of details about it but just looking

1684
01:06:43,739 --> 01:06:48,779
at the plan it was crazy first of all it

1685
01:06:45,838 --> 01:06:51,960
was red purple I mean

1686
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:53,519
was it a purple flower plant bottoms of

1687
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:56,220
the leaves were purple all the veins

1688
01:06:53,519 --> 01:06:58,679
were purple purple the buds were purple

1689
01:06:56,219 --> 01:06:59,939
and the buds were dark purple you know

1690
01:06:58,679 --> 01:07:01,858
but everything else was kind of a

1691
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:03,420
reddish purple and those roots that

1692
01:07:01,858 --> 01:07:05,759
would go back in the ground start new

1693
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:07,619
plants it was just crazy

1694
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:09,180
that sounds a lot like the Dolores

1695
01:07:07,619 --> 01:07:11,099
strain too that was around a long time

1696
01:07:09,179 --> 01:07:12,419
ago I think that um who talks about

1697
01:07:11,099 --> 01:07:14,460
Dolores

1698
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:16,139
uh Robert Clark maybe one of those guys

1699
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:17,760
they know about it and it's it's an old

1700
01:07:16,139 --> 01:07:20,879
uh I don't know if it's South American

1701
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:23,220
or Mexican hybrid but um similar very

1702
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:25,318
similar in how the the looks

1703
01:07:23,219 --> 01:07:27,419
a lot of it and it's I think it's in Big

1704
01:07:25,318 --> 01:07:29,579
Sur Holy Week the Dolores like is a

1705
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:31,019
portion of it so that's interesting it

1706
01:07:29,579 --> 01:07:33,119
would be interesting to see if we could

1707
01:07:31,019 --> 01:07:37,139
find a way to find a strain similar to

1708
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:41,160
that well well well a haze a really good

1709
01:07:37,139 --> 01:07:42,900
Haze is very similar very similar so Tom

1710
01:07:41,159 --> 01:07:45,298
was nailing it on the head with his Haze

1711
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:47,818
maybe oh yeah I mean yeah if you find a

1712
01:07:45,298 --> 01:07:50,639
good Haze some are easier than others

1713
01:07:47,818 --> 01:07:52,818
it's like yeah we went through some uh

1714
01:07:50,639 --> 01:07:56,519
the first Haze I remember

1715
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:59,099
it was like 18 weeks flowering indoors

1716
01:07:56,519 --> 01:08:02,460
it's crazy but remember where it was

1717
01:07:59,099 --> 01:08:05,280
sourced from that one no that came from

1718
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:07,559
the Surfers in Northern California so it

1719
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:09,480
wasn't a good source those came from my

1720
01:08:07,559 --> 01:08:12,960
buddy's Surfer connection they had those

1721
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:16,020
but uh that one was just even and just

1722
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:19,380
the seeds from like any hybrid of that

1723
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:23,160
one you know they never inbred it but

1724
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:25,380
they hybridized it a lot but like the

1725
01:08:23,159 --> 01:08:28,559
the like the Vietnam Black the jungle

1726
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:30,960
sativa yeah it walks all over anything

1727
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:34,859
you would cross it with like 90 percent

1728
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:37,859
yes something would have to be an IBL 10

1729
01:08:34,859 --> 01:08:40,140
or 15 or greater to even have a chance

1730
01:08:37,859 --> 01:08:43,319
to play a little bit in The Offspring

1731
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:45,539
recombination yeah yeah that makes sense

1732
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:47,940
um so this is a personal question just

1733
01:08:45,539 --> 01:08:49,140
for me did you keep seeds pure of the

1734
01:08:47,939 --> 01:08:52,318
Vietnam Black

1735
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:54,060
yes I did that's awesome that's what I

1736
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:57,600
just that's what I just did the soft

1737
01:08:54,060 --> 01:09:00,839
back cross I just released the uh Black

1738
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:04,620
Forest F2 right yeah I think brackets it

1739
01:09:00,838 --> 01:09:07,818
says bx1 small bx1 yeah because I didn't

1740
01:09:04,619 --> 01:09:11,519
take it back to the original individual

1741
01:09:07,819 --> 01:09:14,819
uh Vietnam Black then I took it back to

1742
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:17,160
uh super superior male that had all the

1743
01:09:14,819 --> 01:09:19,798
good signs on them so I back crossed it

1744
01:09:17,159 --> 01:09:21,778
to the line not the individual such a

1745
01:09:19,798 --> 01:09:25,439
generation of black forest that I just

1746
01:09:21,779 --> 01:09:29,640
released right it's gonna be wamping

1747
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:31,379
wamping Vietnam Black sativa so you're

1748
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:33,779
it's going to require not much looking

1749
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:35,819
through because again I've never seen a

1750
01:09:33,779 --> 01:09:38,640
bad one of those they're all they're all

1751
01:09:35,819 --> 01:09:42,259
decent but there are probably three out

1752
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:46,739
of ten two out of ten in our

1753
01:09:42,259 --> 01:09:48,359
extreme I mean extreme that is so cool I

1754
01:09:46,738 --> 01:09:50,698
because I know most of the people have

1755
01:09:48,359 --> 01:09:51,660
only been sourcing Vietnam Black via I

1756
01:09:50,698 --> 01:09:53,879
can't remember who brought it to the

1757
01:09:51,659 --> 01:09:55,979
scene but I know JoJo passed it

1758
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:57,840
um the Vietnam Black that was in Willie

1759
01:09:55,979 --> 01:09:59,419
Nelson and Billy Goat also used one but

1760
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:02,699
the fact that there's a whole nother

1761
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:04,739
separate Vietnam black line from back in

1762
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:06,059
the day like that super interesting and

1763
01:10:04,738 --> 01:10:08,698
I think a lot of people are going to be

1764
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:11,039
interested to know that yeah that came

1765
01:10:08,698 --> 01:10:13,379
from my cousin in Vietnam he sent those

1766
01:10:11,039 --> 01:10:14,819
to me that's that is sick that is super

1767
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:16,319
sick I always assumed it was the same

1768
01:10:14,819 --> 01:10:17,639
one as the billy goat one knowing that

1769
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:19,439
just has me a thousand times more

1770
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:22,980
interested to see more of what Vietnam

1771
01:10:19,439 --> 01:10:25,259
has to hold oh God Vietnamese the some

1772
01:10:22,979 --> 01:10:27,238
of the the cambodians there's just so

1773
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:29,640
many Southeast Asians I Love Actually

1774
01:10:27,238 --> 01:10:31,738
bhutanese is the Southeast Asian but

1775
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:33,960
they're far from Hayes like you know

1776
01:10:31,738 --> 01:10:36,238
they're just of course that that is a

1777
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:38,340
unique one Bhutan was a closed Kingdom

1778
01:10:36,238 --> 01:10:40,139
for a long time yeah yeah I got those I

1779
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:42,420
have a buddy of mine in China well he's

1780
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:44,940
he's kind of a buddy we email back and

1781
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:47,399
forth about stuff and he gets me stuff

1782
01:10:44,939 --> 01:10:49,859
sent out of there he's done it twice and

1783
01:10:47,399 --> 01:10:53,639
one of the things he sent me was this uh

1784
01:10:49,859 --> 01:10:56,039
what was it it was Bhutan he called it

1785
01:10:53,640 --> 01:11:00,300
gold Bhutan

1786
01:10:56,039 --> 01:11:02,819
anyway it was it was right from the uh

1787
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:04,920
that that it was at the base of the

1788
01:11:02,819 --> 01:11:07,198
potato of the Tibetan Mountain there

1789
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:11,100
right that's where it was harvested at

1790
01:11:07,198 --> 01:11:14,698
and it smelled just like fuel right oh

1791
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:18,000
wow like strong honey oil fuel it was so

1792
01:11:14,698 --> 01:11:21,178
accurate and gnarly but we called it uh

1793
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:23,640
butane gas you know boots on gas because

1794
01:11:21,179 --> 01:11:27,000
it smelled like fuel yeah so we called

1795
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:29,600
it butane gas that that line yeah and

1796
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:33,658
that's what I crossed with the Hemingway

1797
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:35,880
and then I crossed that with the Cherry

1798
01:11:33,658 --> 01:11:38,519
Bomb and made the Cherry Hemi

1799
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:41,579
so the Cherry Hemi is a real cool

1800
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:44,400
collaboration of a lot of strange exotic

1801
01:11:41,579 --> 01:11:46,619
[ __ ] but there's a real wild side to

1802
01:11:44,399 --> 01:11:48,179
that boots and knees if you piss off

1803
01:11:46,619 --> 01:11:50,279
that boots and knees or anything with

1804
01:11:48,179 --> 01:11:52,020
boots and knees in it yeah she's gonna

1805
01:11:50,279 --> 01:11:53,639
hurt me and get pissed on you yeah I

1806
01:11:52,020 --> 01:11:55,440
would I would imagine so it's a wild

1807
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:57,420
jungly place with her I've seen their

1808
01:11:55,439 --> 01:12:00,479
strains like because I

1809
01:11:57,420 --> 01:12:02,158
um in in Bhutan I know that like they're

1810
01:12:00,479 --> 01:12:04,738
they're wild cannabis growing at

1811
01:12:02,158 --> 01:12:06,960
literally all over randomly and and

1812
01:12:04,738 --> 01:12:08,819
different little even from house to

1813
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:10,800
house you know 100 meters apart might

1814
01:12:08,819 --> 01:12:12,658
have different little cultivars or

1815
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:15,179
strains or whatever they have going on

1816
01:12:12,658 --> 01:12:17,460
but they tend to be pretty jungly wild

1817
01:12:15,179 --> 01:12:19,980
stuff yeah yeah same same with South

1818
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:22,380
Africa from Farm to farm or Jamaica from

1819
01:12:19,979 --> 01:12:24,599
yeah you know you can have slight

1820
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:26,579
variations on stuff because of whatever

1821
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:28,800
their breeding practices are you know

1822
01:12:26,579 --> 01:12:30,119
yeah and elevation all of it especially

1823
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,400
in some of those Island places where

1824
01:12:30,119 --> 01:12:35,279
elevation goes from see Florida you know

1825
01:12:32,399 --> 01:12:38,759
High super fast more UV is always good

1826
01:12:35,279 --> 01:12:40,920
up to a point Point yeah right so too

1827
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:43,020
much Evie it's like if you grow plants

1828
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:45,060
in all day full sunshine

1829
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:47,580
and then you grow the set a clone of

1830
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:50,640
that plant under all day laughing

1831
01:12:47,579 --> 01:12:53,340
sunshine or dappled Sunshine you're

1832
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:55,980
probably gonna get a 10 bigger yield or

1833
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:58,619
15 bigger yield on your all-day Sunshine

1834
01:12:55,979 --> 01:13:00,899
plant yeah but that 10 or 15 percent is

1835
01:12:58,619 --> 01:13:03,479
just pure vegetable fiber from the UV

1836
01:13:00,899 --> 01:13:06,719
yeah it just makes everything bigger not

1837
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:08,879
better yeah it actually reduces the

1838
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:11,100
potency of the resin because it swells

1839
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:13,199
up everything so gnarly you know all the

1840
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:16,199
UV is just promoting that vegetable

1841
01:13:13,198 --> 01:13:18,178
growth so we used to take for our

1842
01:13:16,198 --> 01:13:20,819
commercial interest we would grow full

1843
01:13:18,179 --> 01:13:22,800
sun yeah but for our plants that we

1844
01:13:20,819 --> 01:13:25,439
smoked we would either we build

1845
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:27,719
laughings over them or we kept them we

1846
01:13:25,439 --> 01:13:29,099
kept them positioned around trees so

1847
01:13:27,719 --> 01:13:31,198
they would only get half a day of full

1848
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:33,840
sunshine and then half a day of dappled

1849
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:35,698
Sunshine that's really good advice too

1850
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:38,219
um for some of these longer flowering

1851
01:13:35,698 --> 01:13:39,419
indoor streams that you have would you

1852
01:13:38,219 --> 01:13:41,760
recommend

1853
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:43,560
um a Different Light hour time for

1854
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:45,900
indoors on some of your longer flying

1855
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:47,219
strings a different what light flowering

1856
01:13:45,899 --> 01:13:49,738
time you know how most people go to 12

1857
01:13:47,219 --> 01:13:51,600
hours as a standard do you ever

1858
01:13:49,738 --> 01:13:53,579
recommend different flowering times for

1859
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:56,640
any of your strains well if it comes

1860
01:13:53,579 --> 01:13:59,640
from the the equator anywhere around the

1861
01:13:56,640 --> 01:14:02,699
equator what I will always do to it is

1862
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:05,699
during the second half of flowering I'll

1863
01:14:02,698 --> 01:14:08,819
either drop my photo period to 12 5 11 5

1864
01:14:05,698 --> 01:14:12,419
or 13 11. you know there you go yeah or

1865
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:14,639
11 13 I mean 13 hours of Darkness right

1866
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:17,399
yeah because they grow pretty much year

1867
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:20,159
round with very slight photo period

1868
01:14:17,399 --> 01:14:22,500
changes yeah so sometimes I've had

1869
01:14:20,158 --> 01:14:25,379
people have long flowering sativas all

1870
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:28,979
day many times that have told me it

1871
01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:32,039
won't stop flowering yeah yeah yeah okay

1872
01:14:28,979 --> 01:14:34,738
you just cut your cut your legs from 12

1873
01:14:32,039 --> 01:14:37,619
to 11 and that'll fix that in two weeks

1874
01:14:34,738 --> 01:14:38,759
I remember I ran into a Malawi this is

1875
01:14:37,619 --> 01:14:40,859
the first time I ever ran into something

1876
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:42,000
like this and I had it in 12 hours of

1877
01:14:40,859 --> 01:14:44,099
light and this is the first time I ever

1878
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:46,800
learned about light out hours moving

1879
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:49,140
them or fluctuating them and I thought

1880
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:51,480
it was like three months in nothing no

1881
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:53,460
no flower formations and I I hit a body

1882
01:14:51,479 --> 01:14:54,839
I'm like Bodhi what is going on what do

1883
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:56,640
I not know and he's like reduce your

1884
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:58,679
light hours dummy you know it's like

1885
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:00,060
reduce them watch it watch and then you

1886
01:14:58,679 --> 01:15:01,980
know start reducing and we ended up

1887
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:03,539
moving down to eight and by the end of

1888
01:15:01,979 --> 01:15:04,500
eight it would finish eight hours of

1889
01:15:03,539 --> 01:15:06,179
light and it doesn't seem like it's

1890
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:07,619
enough it's counterintuitive you think

1891
01:15:06,179 --> 01:15:10,319
it won't yield enough but it was perfect

1892
01:15:07,619 --> 01:15:12,000
for that Malawi it wasn't and you only

1893
01:15:10,319 --> 01:15:14,639
really have to do it for the last few

1894
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,319
weeks right just so if you know about

1895
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:19,260
that that's why I like sourcing

1896
01:15:16,319 --> 01:15:20,279
geographical varieties and strains

1897
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:22,500
because

1898
01:15:20,279 --> 01:15:25,139
I know a lot about different strains

1899
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:26,640
from different locales yeah so if I know

1900
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:29,820
where it's from or where it's

1901
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:31,380
constituents of the hybrid or from I can

1902
01:15:29,819 --> 01:15:33,299
assess all kinds of things right off the

1903
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:35,579
bat I can assume a lot of things yeah

1904
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:37,320
yeah you know so that helps me a lot but

1905
01:15:35,579 --> 01:15:39,119
if I'm just

1906
01:15:37,319 --> 01:15:40,920
if somebody's offered me some seeds I'm

1907
01:15:39,119 --> 01:15:42,658
like well where is this from where where

1908
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:46,560
do the genetics come from and they go

1909
01:15:42,658 --> 01:15:49,500
well it's blue pups blue Boingo and

1910
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:52,140
gorilla Funk cookie mask and you know

1911
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:53,880
that tells me nothing zero because you

1912
01:15:52,140 --> 01:15:55,320
know nothing about anything about it you

1913
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:56,819
don't even know if it's in Afghani if

1914
01:15:55,319 --> 01:15:58,859
it's if you don't know those specific

1915
01:15:56,819 --> 01:16:02,039
names for those strains you have no clue

1916
01:15:58,859 --> 01:16:04,439
at all nor do I really trust people who

1917
01:16:02,039 --> 01:16:06,479
I don't know to tell me what's real and

1918
01:16:04,439 --> 01:16:08,698
they may in fact not know shade on them

1919
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:11,459
they may believe it's true because

1920
01:16:08,698 --> 01:16:13,319
somebody told them that they believed

1921
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:15,359
that it and it wasn't true like I've

1922
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:18,119
heard I've heard some good fantastic

1923
01:16:15,359 --> 01:16:20,880
stories that I just don't think are true

1924
01:16:18,119 --> 01:16:22,319
yeah yeah and yeah the road to hell is

1925
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:24,420
paved with good intentions there's a lot

1926
01:16:22,319 --> 01:16:26,519
of people who are great people just

1927
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:28,199
warm-hearted people that will tell you

1928
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:29,640
information that isn't correct because

1929
01:16:28,198 --> 01:16:31,079
they truly believe it to be true and

1930
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:32,940
they trusted the person who gave it to

1931
01:16:31,079 --> 01:16:34,619
them and that person might be a great

1932
01:16:32,939 --> 01:16:36,839
trustworthy person but the person that

1933
01:16:34,619 --> 01:16:38,899
you know just got it wrong once we

1934
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:41,159
didn't

1935
01:16:38,899 --> 01:16:43,379
I'm just going to use an example here or

1936
01:16:41,158 --> 01:16:45,719
something let's say a Cinderella 99

1937
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:47,579
right yeah they'll grow Cinderella 99

1938
01:16:45,719 --> 01:16:50,399
and they'll end up with yeah I don't

1939
01:16:47,579 --> 01:16:52,198
know let's say five females right so one

1940
01:16:50,399 --> 01:16:55,500
of the females will be outstanding like

1941
01:16:52,198 --> 01:16:58,019
in my c99 line now if you want to look

1942
01:16:55,500 --> 01:17:00,300
for something really outstanding what

1943
01:16:58,020 --> 01:17:03,239
you're looking for is an extra beefy

1944
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:06,060
female okay she is vigorous and extra

1945
01:17:03,238 --> 01:17:09,359
beefy to the max she yields about 20

1946
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:12,800
percent more than any other Cindy and

1947
01:17:09,359 --> 01:17:17,279
she is the most great or the most uh

1948
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:20,039
pineappley delicious resin so killer

1949
01:17:17,279 --> 01:17:22,079
ever okay that's my favorite cut right

1950
01:17:20,039 --> 01:17:24,719
so let's say somebody grows them and

1951
01:17:22,079 --> 01:17:27,238
they find that that female right yeah

1952
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:28,158
well that's special right so they name

1953
01:17:27,238 --> 01:17:31,738
her

1954
01:17:28,158 --> 01:17:34,319
Griselda yeah right yeah so then they

1955
01:17:31,738 --> 01:17:36,779
decide [ __ ] I need to breed this so then

1956
01:17:34,319 --> 01:17:41,460
what is the hybrid X cross with

1957
01:17:36,779 --> 01:17:45,059
griselves not c99 no so you lose a bunch

1958
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:47,158
of the strain limits you don't know

1959
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:48,380
it kills the anthropology of it all

1960
01:17:47,158 --> 01:17:51,299
right

1961
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:52,679
you have to you know I mean I run it

1962
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:54,000
backwards in my head and go oh it's

1963
01:17:52,679 --> 01:17:55,380
probably gonna be like this but you know

1964
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,840
there's a lot of stuff I can assess with

1965
01:17:55,380 --> 01:18:00,239
you tell me it's gooey cookie Funk and I

1966
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:02,699
don't know yeah I mean with with if we

1967
01:18:00,238 --> 01:18:05,519
know that a c99 we can go okay Jack

1968
01:18:02,698 --> 01:18:07,139
error type uh skunk one Haze Northern

1969
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:09,060
Lights five okay we can you know you can

1970
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:10,679
easily break it down but yeah once they

1971
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:12,300
start playing around past the bass lines

1972
01:18:10,679 --> 01:18:13,980
and it's just random names and they

1973
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:16,199
aren't really there's not a lot you can

1974
01:18:13,979 --> 01:18:17,399
get from that and to be honest if I see

1975
01:18:16,198 --> 01:18:19,139
something

1976
01:18:17,399 --> 01:18:21,059
um a line that is like eight things in

1977
01:18:19,140 --> 01:18:22,679
it like some people get all excited the

1978
01:18:21,060 --> 01:18:24,840
more hype strains are it the more

1979
01:18:22,679 --> 01:18:26,699
excited they get because it but I me I

1980
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:27,719
walk away this the second I see too many

1981
01:18:26,698 --> 01:18:29,339
because I'm like I don't even know what

1982
01:18:27,719 --> 01:18:30,239
I'm gonna get from this nor would I want

1983
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:33,060
to breathe with that because it's going

1984
01:18:30,238 --> 01:18:35,099
to be completely unpredictable

1985
01:18:33,060 --> 01:18:38,539
you know unpredictable is an

1986
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:38,539
understatement right yeah

1987
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:44,579
it's just it's a totally different way

1988
01:18:41,179 --> 01:18:47,819
if you look on my site you'll see that I

1989
01:18:44,579 --> 01:18:52,079
do have poly hybrids for sure but I have

1990
01:18:47,819 --> 01:18:55,139
a lot that are true two-way f1s true

1991
01:18:52,079 --> 01:18:57,658
three-way f1s and true four-way F1 yes

1992
01:18:55,140 --> 01:19:00,780
once you have a five way or above of an

1993
01:18:57,658 --> 01:19:04,099
F1 then it starts to become a poly but a

1994
01:19:00,779 --> 01:19:07,559
lot of the ones these days are like 10.

1995
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:10,199
yeah I remember if not more someone

1996
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:11,760
showed me the seed finder page for

1997
01:19:10,198 --> 01:19:13,139
animal mints and I went and looked at

1998
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:15,360
like because you can do the strain map

1999
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:18,300
and see all the stuff in it listed it

2000
01:19:15,359 --> 01:19:20,279
was like four pages long of of

2001
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:22,380
everything laid out because it's just

2002
01:19:20,279 --> 01:19:23,479
poly hybrid polyhybrid polyhybrid

2003
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:26,400
cookies

2004
01:19:23,479 --> 01:19:28,500
right it all ends up being OG Kush in

2005
01:19:26,399 --> 01:19:30,658
the end but none of that really matters

2006
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:32,399
because they've crammed OG cushion to

2007
01:19:30,658 --> 01:19:35,279
itself and all of its Expressions 90

2008
01:19:32,399 --> 01:19:37,319
times over you know right and you know I

2009
01:19:35,279 --> 01:19:39,658
like to keep everything separate too I

2010
01:19:37,319 --> 01:19:42,899
like to know when I'm not double dip it

2011
01:19:39,658 --> 01:19:46,319
in some Gene pools so if I if I have a a

2012
01:19:42,899 --> 01:19:49,859
c99 cross with an OG Kush and a c99

2013
01:19:46,319 --> 01:19:51,599
crossed with a metal Haze okay I have

2014
01:19:49,859 --> 01:19:53,039
those two strains

2015
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:55,140
now

2016
01:19:53,039 --> 01:19:59,819
oh I did it again

2017
01:19:55,140 --> 01:20:01,619
c99 metal Haze c99 and I was gonna say

2018
01:19:59,819 --> 01:20:04,500
you see what happens when you have resin

2019
01:20:01,619 --> 01:20:06,619
on your brain I do I'm seeing my future

2020
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:09,899
right here

2021
01:20:06,619 --> 01:20:12,420
because I was such a such a forgetful

2022
01:20:09,899 --> 01:20:14,879
person oh yeah okay now

2023
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:16,920
all right so if you have those two those

2024
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:19,260
two varieties those two hybrids right

2025
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:21,359
right now you smoke one oh yeah this is

2026
01:20:19,260 --> 01:20:22,980
really good oh it gets me hot then you

2027
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:25,619
go to smoke the other one you go yeah

2028
01:20:22,979 --> 01:20:28,439
that's pretty good well it could be

2029
01:20:25,619 --> 01:20:30,059
every bit as good as the first one but

2030
01:20:28,439 --> 01:20:32,759
you've already built up some tolerance

2031
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:35,640
to the c99 in the first one yeah the

2032
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:37,739
second c99 hybrid is going to be a

2033
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:40,260
little less impressive to you yeah so

2034
01:20:37,738 --> 01:20:41,579
when I'm testing things or sampling them

2035
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:43,980
and want to know really more about them

2036
01:20:41,579 --> 01:20:47,340
I got to make sure that I'm not cross

2037
01:20:43,979 --> 01:20:49,319
cross encountering some things in two

2038
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:51,480
different ones because then I have to

2039
01:20:49,319 --> 01:20:53,158
adjust that into my whole deal yeah

2040
01:20:51,479 --> 01:20:55,379
that's not an obvious thing to think of

2041
01:20:53,158 --> 01:20:57,299
either like uh building tolerance to a

2042
01:20:55,380 --> 01:20:59,219
specific strainer type when you're doing

2043
01:20:57,300 --> 01:21:01,079
testing so would you recommend like

2044
01:20:59,219 --> 01:21:02,698
maybe the next day the following day

2045
01:21:01,079 --> 01:21:05,519
maybe smoking one in the morning and one

2046
01:21:02,698 --> 01:21:07,678
at night and vice versa the next day or

2047
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:09,719
or you can or you can clean your palette

2048
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:13,380
if you've got if you've got a couple of

2049
01:21:09,719 --> 01:21:15,600
hybrids that have a common P1 right then

2050
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:18,900
you could just clean your palate in

2051
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:20,760
between right yeah you could sample one

2052
01:21:18,899 --> 01:21:23,399
check it out and then go for something

2053
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:25,320
way out of the bandwidth

2054
01:21:23,399 --> 01:21:27,379
then come back to the second one and

2055
01:21:25,319 --> 01:21:27,380
then

2056
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:32,279
that makes sense that makes a lot of

2057
01:21:30,479 --> 01:21:35,099
sense give your give your receptors time

2058
01:21:32,279 --> 01:21:37,139
to change a little bit

2059
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:40,020
yeah one of my favorites to clean my

2060
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:42,060
palette with is Congo right yeah why is

2061
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:43,860
that the Cindy Kong go super well

2062
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:45,659
because it's one of those you know you

2063
01:21:43,859 --> 01:21:47,399
know the strains that you could be

2064
01:21:45,658 --> 01:21:49,319
smoking different weed all day you can

2065
01:21:47,399 --> 01:21:51,238
be kind of baked you know hanging around

2066
01:21:49,319 --> 01:21:53,399
it and then you smoke that weed where

2067
01:21:51,238 --> 01:21:55,799
you take a few hits and it just wipes

2068
01:21:53,399 --> 01:21:58,139
Out All the Rest of anything you've ever

2069
01:21:55,800 --> 01:22:01,020
smoked and capacity just takes over with

2070
01:21:58,140 --> 01:22:02,400
a new high that's combo yeah the

2071
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:04,679
Breakthrough highs I always call this

2072
01:22:02,399 --> 01:22:08,658
breakthroughs and everything else it

2073
01:22:04,679 --> 01:22:10,739
just Stomps out any kind of mild effects

2074
01:22:08,658 --> 01:22:12,179
what kind of smells come out of the

2075
01:22:10,738 --> 01:22:15,539
Congo that you work with

2076
01:22:12,179 --> 01:22:19,460
they are real uh like kind of rotten

2077
01:22:15,539 --> 01:22:23,039
meat with uh like a sickening sweet

2078
01:22:19,460 --> 01:22:25,380
background interesting it's uh it's

2079
01:22:23,039 --> 01:22:28,140
acrid but it's not Fury you know what I

2080
01:22:25,380 --> 01:22:29,640
mean it's like it's like rotting meat is

2081
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:32,640
the best way I could do it it's sweet

2082
01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:34,380
but in a kind of a sickeningly sweet way

2083
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:36,539
kind of like the matinees could Thunder

2084
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:39,239
[ __ ] it's weird that they smell a lot

2085
01:22:36,539 --> 01:22:41,519
alike but they do I wonder I mean does

2086
01:22:39,238 --> 01:22:43,859
it smell like a dead body Maybe

2087
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:45,840
because sweet like I remember yeah yeah

2088
01:22:43,859 --> 01:22:47,639
yeah but yeah but you have to imagine

2089
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:50,420
what I mean when I say that there's a

2090
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:54,360
sweet component to it it's not like oh

2091
01:22:50,420 --> 01:22:57,719
yeah I mean it's like it's like ooh but

2092
01:22:54,359 --> 01:22:59,219
it's strangely compelling someone I knew

2093
01:22:57,719 --> 01:23:01,500
that worked in a in a funeral home

2094
01:22:59,219 --> 01:23:03,119
always describe the debt and they

2095
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:05,158
described this to me before I smelled it

2096
01:23:03,119 --> 01:23:07,439
because I I would do I would help them

2097
01:23:05,158 --> 01:23:09,839
in the in the funeral home but um they

2098
01:23:07,439 --> 01:23:12,479
said bodies dead bodies smell like sweet

2099
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:13,860
[ __ ] sweet running meat it's there's a

2100
01:23:12,479 --> 01:23:15,379
sweetness to it though that's really

2101
01:23:13,859 --> 01:23:18,420
freaking weird

2102
01:23:15,380 --> 01:23:21,359
it's sort of like sugar cookies you know

2103
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:22,920
oh wow oh my gosh so it's almost wow

2104
01:23:21,359 --> 01:23:24,719
that would be a really weird but

2105
01:23:22,920 --> 01:23:27,960
attractive smell I mean I've smelled

2106
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:29,819
body odor smells in um cannabis like uh

2107
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:32,158
what was it bodies he had a string

2108
01:23:29,819 --> 01:23:34,139
called hippie Slayer 33 I think and it

2109
01:23:32,158 --> 01:23:36,000
smelled like straight Bo but it tasted

2110
01:23:34,140 --> 01:23:37,199
it smelled yummy like I wanted to eat it

2111
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,960
like why would you want to eat human

2112
01:23:37,198 --> 01:23:43,259
beer but I did I'm with you I'm with you

2113
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:46,319
the metal Haze was pure cat piss I mean

2114
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:48,360
just just pissy bit you would think if

2115
01:23:46,319 --> 01:23:49,799
you opened a bag of that anyone who

2116
01:23:48,359 --> 01:23:53,099
walked in would think well did the cat

2117
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:56,100
just pee in here yeah it was pure pests

2118
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:58,560
but again strangely attractive and

2119
01:23:56,100 --> 01:24:00,960
compelling

2120
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:01,620
yeah do you still keep that little Haze

2121
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:05,179
cut

2122
01:24:01,619 --> 01:24:07,140
no I lost the metal Haze cut to police

2123
01:24:05,179 --> 01:24:08,520
metal Hayes

2124
01:24:07,140 --> 01:24:10,920
[ __ ] police

2125
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:12,360
[ __ ] pigs they always get them I mean

2126
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:14,880
that cut was really special I got to

2127
01:24:12,359 --> 01:24:19,500
work with it a few times and I it

2128
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:21,659
reminded me of a um maybe a more in the

2129
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:24,719
structure NL skunk one dominant because

2130
01:24:21,658 --> 01:24:27,359
it wasn't super super super like lanky

2131
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:29,579
Haze but it had a good structure to it

2132
01:24:27,359 --> 01:24:31,319
right it did good bud structure and

2133
01:24:29,579 --> 01:24:33,059
stuff that was such a cool line man that

2134
01:24:31,319 --> 01:24:34,979
was such I loved it well the reason the

2135
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:36,420
re one of the main reasons I crossed it

2136
01:24:34,979 --> 01:24:41,279
to the uh

2137
01:24:36,420 --> 01:24:44,279
iron Cindy was to preserve it to some

2138
01:24:41,279 --> 01:24:46,460
extent because they're very similar yeah

2139
01:24:44,279 --> 01:24:48,658
right they're very yeah yeah yeah

2140
01:24:46,460 --> 01:24:50,340
definitely it's that skunk one or like

2141
01:24:48,658 --> 01:24:52,500
five Haze combo that you can see in both

2142
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:55,619
of them well I could yeah because I did

2143
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:59,158
it to make the iron Cindy I combined the

2144
01:24:55,619 --> 01:25:02,340
metal Haze and the c99 because the c99

2145
01:24:59,158 --> 01:25:06,119
is like a little metal Haze kind of a

2146
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:08,460
faster uh c99 is really unique I really

2147
01:25:06,119 --> 01:25:11,640
love it I mean it has a kind of a it's

2148
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:14,760
like a poor man's Haze definitely a lot

2149
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:18,060
of hazy sativa qualities to it not all

2150
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:20,219
but a surprising amount for a eight or

2151
01:25:18,060 --> 01:25:23,280
nine week plan you know I think that's

2152
01:25:20,219 --> 01:25:26,399
why c99 c99 gained such popularity

2153
01:25:23,279 --> 01:25:27,779
because people want that type of high in

2154
01:25:26,399 --> 01:25:29,339
the same kind of flowering time they

2155
01:25:27,779 --> 01:25:31,198
could get from some of these afghanis

2156
01:25:29,340 --> 01:25:33,420
and it's one of the few lines other than

2157
01:25:31,198 --> 01:25:35,519
like high in lonesome's Appalachia that

2158
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:37,739
I found that really captured the ability

2159
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:40,739
to capture sativity short flowering time

2160
01:25:37,738 --> 01:25:42,299
like that it's like c99 is the only one

2161
01:25:40,738 --> 01:25:44,158
I've ever seen that did it that's why I

2162
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:46,560
grabbed it up so fast I was like oh my

2163
01:25:44,158 --> 01:25:50,279
God this is this is really like a fast

2164
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:52,980
sativa with some definite longer satima

2165
01:25:50,279 --> 01:25:55,979
flowering qualities yeah yeah especially

2166
01:25:52,979 --> 01:25:58,619
in the eye I love the c99 I think she's

2167
01:25:55,979 --> 01:26:02,638
fantastic especially now that I found

2168
01:25:58,619 --> 01:26:04,800
that buku grapefruit Mama yeah no

2169
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:06,000
kidding I see I'm a sucker for that Pine

2170
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,980
all right not grapefruit I'm sorry

2171
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:10,800
pineapple oh yeah the pineapple one man

2172
01:26:07,979 --> 01:26:12,238
that's your penalene that that that what

2173
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:15,060
you would refer to as like cat pissy

2174
01:26:12,238 --> 01:26:17,759
smell but like mixed with the pineapple

2175
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:19,980
makes the flavor translate so well like

2176
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:22,860
it actually tastes like pineapple sharp

2177
01:26:19,979 --> 01:26:24,899
Citrus pineapple Sharps Citrus pineapple

2178
01:26:22,859 --> 01:26:26,519
right yeah it would it would it would be

2179
01:26:24,899 --> 01:26:28,979
so hard for someone to intentionally

2180
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:30,360
make that again from scratch I think it

2181
01:26:28,979 --> 01:26:33,000
is one of the most pineappley things

2182
01:26:30,359 --> 01:26:34,738
there are in cannabis super cool it it

2183
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,779
really really is pineapple I mean

2184
01:26:34,738 --> 01:26:38,879
especially with a little cure on it two

2185
01:26:36,779 --> 01:26:42,359
weeks of a cure and you open the jar and

2186
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:44,819
it's like damn yeah yeah that's one that

2187
01:26:42,359 --> 01:26:46,439
I I do miss a lot and I've actually been

2188
01:26:44,819 --> 01:26:48,000
trying to look for it I think CSI

2189
01:26:46,439 --> 01:26:50,039
Humboldt might have grabbed it recently

2190
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:53,359
so hopefully that that one's going to

2191
01:26:50,039 --> 01:26:53,359
come back in rotation soon

2192
01:26:54,679 --> 01:26:59,399
you can always get the pineapple I mean

2193
01:26:57,179 --> 01:27:01,679
I'm not sure I don't know what the

2194
01:26:59,399 --> 01:27:05,359
ratios are the percentages of chance

2195
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:09,079
that she pops up but I did find her

2196
01:27:05,359 --> 01:27:14,399
within uh probably

2197
01:27:09,079 --> 01:27:16,500
15 females okay I found one and I've had

2198
01:27:14,399 --> 01:27:18,179
friends of mine that have found them so

2199
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:19,619
they're not super hard to find no no

2200
01:27:18,179 --> 01:27:21,480
they're in there definitely they're

2201
01:27:19,619 --> 01:27:24,179
probably one we're probably one in eight

2202
01:27:21,479 --> 01:27:26,039
maybe one in 12 something like that so

2203
01:27:24,179 --> 01:27:28,079
if if people are interested do you still

2204
01:27:26,039 --> 01:27:33,260
carry that line in seed form and sell it

2205
01:27:28,079 --> 01:27:33,260
on your site absolutely awesome awesome

2206
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:40,560
c99 they're still like the F5s yeah that

2207
01:27:38,399 --> 01:27:43,799
I have made and what happened was last

2208
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:46,500
time I made them I made a shitload and I

2209
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:49,560
put most of them in deep freeze cryo

2210
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:52,380
good good so now I just tap from a

2211
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:54,360
smaller Source once they run out I bust

2212
01:27:52,380 --> 01:27:57,179
into the deep freeze cry I'll bring a

2213
01:27:54,359 --> 01:27:58,439
bunch out and do it again it can stay

2214
01:27:57,179 --> 01:27:59,819
the same I don't have to keep in

2215
01:27:58,439 --> 01:28:01,019
bringing them and inbreeding them and

2216
01:27:59,819 --> 01:28:02,399
you don't have to keep yanking them in

2217
01:28:01,020 --> 01:28:03,840
and out of the cryo constantly every

2218
01:28:02,399 --> 01:28:06,119
time you want to take out pack and

2219
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:08,159
fluctuating right right and I love this

2220
01:28:06,119 --> 01:28:11,158
pie I love a couple of the Finos but the

2221
01:28:08,158 --> 01:28:13,259
pineapple Beast is my favorite and I'll

2222
01:28:11,158 --> 01:28:14,819
always want to be able to get her so I

2223
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:17,100
didn't want to risk it on the off chance

2224
01:28:14,819 --> 01:28:20,039
that because sometimes it's like with

2225
01:28:17,100 --> 01:28:23,659
the skunk man sometimes it's just

2226
01:28:20,039 --> 01:28:26,158
cannabis Mother Nature just goes

2227
01:28:23,658 --> 01:28:27,899
yeah there's just nothing you could do

2228
01:28:26,158 --> 01:28:29,460
you try to combine what you think is

2229
01:28:27,899 --> 01:28:32,099
going to work in a certain way and it

2230
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:34,139
comes out almost opposite yeah I can't

2231
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:37,020
tell you now twice now I've combined

2232
01:28:34,139 --> 01:28:40,319
roadkill skunk mail with Road skill kill

2233
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:42,000
skunk female and I get all the same

2234
01:28:40,319 --> 01:28:43,799
spread that I would have if I would have

2235
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:46,139
pretty much crossed anything any other

2236
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:47,880
two yeah you know it always comes out

2237
01:28:46,139 --> 01:28:50,579
spreading the spread I can't get to

2238
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:53,159
isolate it down what I what I just did

2239
01:28:50,579 --> 01:28:56,939
recently for uh just because that pisses

2240
01:28:53,158 --> 01:29:00,238
me off yeah yeah as I took uh the

2241
01:28:56,939 --> 01:29:02,939
Vietnam Black jungle sativa since I had

2242
01:29:00,238 --> 01:29:05,879
the male flowering right yeah and I had

2243
01:29:02,939 --> 01:29:07,439
a roadkill skunk candy it was only a

2244
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:09,840
little clone right I had a little clone

2245
01:29:07,439 --> 01:29:12,419
I was like yeah yeah okay I popped it in

2246
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:14,039
the flowering tent you know yeah made a

2247
01:29:12,420 --> 01:29:15,779
flower and it only ended up about this

2248
01:29:14,039 --> 01:29:17,279
big but it got pollinated with that

2249
01:29:15,779 --> 01:29:19,079
gnarly

2250
01:29:17,279 --> 01:29:21,779
if you've never smelled the V black

2251
01:29:19,079 --> 01:29:24,779
before let me tell you it's it's not

2252
01:29:21,779 --> 01:29:27,119
like anything else ever I've smelled in

2253
01:29:24,779 --> 01:29:30,779
my life it's it's sort of like nag

2254
01:29:27,119 --> 01:29:33,719
Champa incense yeah and it's real sharp

2255
01:29:30,779 --> 01:29:36,359
oh it's just god-awful exotic and

2256
01:29:33,719 --> 01:29:39,719
delicious but I mean so I crossed it

2257
01:29:36,359 --> 01:29:43,019
with that right it's a sharp acrid

2258
01:29:39,719 --> 01:29:45,420
terpene profile right yeah so I brought

2259
01:29:43,020 --> 01:29:47,100
the the roadkill skunk up against it now

2260
01:29:45,420 --> 01:29:49,560
I'm gonna end up with a long flowering

2261
01:29:47,100 --> 01:29:51,300
son of a [ __ ] it's gonna be 12 weeks at

2262
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:54,420
least yeah but

2263
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:56,820
If I Grow these out and I get a high

2264
01:29:54,420 --> 01:29:59,100
percentage of roadkill skunks you can

2265
01:29:56,819 --> 01:30:00,960
bet I'll be waiting them down to Shorter

2266
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:03,600
flowering and be able to keep that

2267
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:06,060
roadkill scone because I'm sure that'd

2268
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:07,980
be black will rule dominant in many of

2269
01:30:06,060 --> 01:30:11,520
the things especially the terp combo

2270
01:30:07,979 --> 01:30:14,879
right yeah yeah I should be able to in

2271
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:17,580
theory inbreed days yes with the right

2272
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:19,679
combo and get all roadkill skunk they

2273
01:30:17,579 --> 01:30:22,139
might be 11 weeks they might be 10 weeks

2274
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:24,420
but I should be able to do it because I

2275
01:30:22,139 --> 01:30:26,760
can't I can't get my skunk line to come

2276
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:28,560
all roadkill it just it won't I've tried

2277
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:31,500
three different ways and I always get

2278
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:33,480
the same spread no matter what I do I've

2279
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:35,639
tried two different ways with a few

2280
01:30:33,479 --> 01:30:38,519
different lines and it is very hard

2281
01:30:35,639 --> 01:30:40,260
especially once the butt is dry to lock

2282
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:44,580
in that smell once the bud dries it's

2283
01:30:40,260 --> 01:30:47,820
like that smells gone sometimes it's the

2284
01:30:44,579 --> 01:30:49,559
case yeah sometimes you know it depends

2285
01:30:47,819 --> 01:30:52,380
on a lot of things it's like what I do

2286
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:54,179
now more recently only for the last I

2287
01:30:52,380 --> 01:30:57,480
don't know three years maybe four years

2288
01:30:54,179 --> 01:30:59,760
or so is I used to never dry my weed too

2289
01:30:57,479 --> 01:31:02,099
dry because I like to smoke it when it

2290
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:04,139
has just a scose of moisture still in it

2291
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:06,840
right yeah yeah it's much much smoother

2292
01:31:04,139 --> 01:31:09,420
absolutely you smoke super super dry

2293
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:11,639
weed it's a little hot right yeah man so

2294
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:14,039
I always like my weed like that so it's

2295
01:31:11,639 --> 01:31:17,760
hard to store weed like that without

2296
01:31:14,039 --> 01:31:20,880
consistently burping it exactly or else

2297
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:23,400
it loses the smells faster right yeah so

2298
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:26,639
what what I do now is oh and this works

2299
01:31:23,399 --> 01:31:29,460
good buddy I take and I mummify it right

2300
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:32,520
I mean I dry it so [ __ ] bad you touch

2301
01:31:29,460 --> 01:31:35,100
it it'll just crumble okay that's how

2302
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:36,900
dry I dried yeah I very carefully put it

2303
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:38,699
in big jars and put it in a big

2304
01:31:36,899 --> 01:31:40,799
insulated cooler and I store it right

2305
01:31:38,698 --> 01:31:43,319
yeah when I want to hit that weed or

2306
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:45,840
check it out or smoke it or whatever I

2307
01:31:43,319 --> 01:31:48,000
just open the jar up my humidity around

2308
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:51,300
here is usually around 50 percent which

2309
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:54,119
is fine 50 60 that's fine and I take

2310
01:31:51,300 --> 01:31:56,520
some very carefully out of the jar I set

2311
01:31:54,119 --> 01:31:58,859
it in an open Bowl close the jar put it

2312
01:31:56,520 --> 01:32:01,020
back and then I let it just set out in

2313
01:31:58,859 --> 01:32:03,719
my room for about a few hours usually

2314
01:32:01,020 --> 01:32:06,199
check the moisture level because fast

2315
01:32:03,719 --> 01:32:08,760
it'll start soaking that up

2316
01:32:06,198 --> 01:32:10,500
moisture from there right yeah and then

2317
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:13,020
it gets to that perfect consistency

2318
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:14,819
within several hours sometimes it takes

2319
01:32:13,020 --> 01:32:17,699
overnight it depends if the humidity is

2320
01:32:14,819 --> 01:32:20,340
low yeah but uh but by the next day or

2321
01:32:17,698 --> 01:32:23,158
within a few hours boom you not only

2322
01:32:20,340 --> 01:32:25,800
have the perfect moisture level in your

2323
01:32:23,158 --> 01:32:27,539
buds but the smells just come out with a

2324
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:29,880
Vengeance then right there because it

2325
01:32:27,539 --> 01:32:32,519
all starts processing again yeah once

2326
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:33,840
you mummified it you've stopped it yeah

2327
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:35,880
you've stopped everything it's doing

2328
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:38,639
there's no moisture in there right yeah

2329
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:40,560
so it preserves your buds for a super

2330
01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:42,659
long time so I take them all I put them

2331
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:44,699
in all smaller containers like like

2332
01:32:42,658 --> 01:32:47,460
either pint jars or what are they quart

2333
01:32:44,698 --> 01:32:49,678
jars yeah I save them all in that so

2334
01:32:47,460 --> 01:32:51,600
that I never have to bust One open and

2335
01:32:49,679 --> 01:32:53,340
keep opening it you know that way I can

2336
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:55,199
burn through one in a relatively short

2337
01:32:53,340 --> 01:32:56,639
amount of time and now you have to keep

2338
01:32:55,198 --> 01:32:59,178
opening it and close it having more

2339
01:32:56,639 --> 01:33:03,000
moisture get in there yeah

2340
01:32:59,179 --> 01:33:06,359
I opened up some Blue Rhino 1947 a few

2341
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:09,119
days ago that was five years old it's

2342
01:33:06,359 --> 01:33:11,119
been in storage for five years I did

2343
01:33:09,119 --> 01:33:13,738
that to it

2344
01:33:11,119 --> 01:33:17,219
five years and it wasn't Frozen or

2345
01:33:13,738 --> 01:33:20,158
anything it perfect no no it was just

2346
01:33:17,219 --> 01:33:23,460
now understand I store them in a big

2347
01:33:20,158 --> 01:33:25,198
gnarly insulated cooler okay this cooler

2348
01:33:23,460 --> 01:33:28,079
is in a place that is pretty cool never

2349
01:33:25,198 --> 01:33:30,779
gets really warm gotcha so the real key

2350
01:33:28,079 --> 01:33:33,420
to the long-term storage is having your

2351
01:33:30,779 --> 01:33:35,579
degree variance be very small in any

2352
01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:37,380
24-hour period right that makes sense

2353
01:33:35,579 --> 01:33:40,559
well you only want that to change like a

2354
01:33:37,380 --> 01:33:42,480
degree or two Max Max and then that will

2355
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:44,820
store it as long as it's cool for a

2356
01:33:42,479 --> 01:33:47,099
super long time all by itself so mine

2357
01:33:44,819 --> 01:33:50,279
stays like that in the cooler Five Years

2358
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:52,139
buddy five years I broke it up left it

2359
01:33:50,279 --> 01:33:54,019
let the moisture absorber I squeezed in

2360
01:33:52,139 --> 01:33:56,880
one mama

2361
01:33:54,020 --> 01:34:00,300
you know who else is is blown my mind is

2362
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:02,639
Bodhi he has like this this barn with um

2363
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:04,980
buds hanging in it and

2364
01:34:02,639 --> 01:34:06,659
for years you can have buds in here and

2365
01:34:04,979 --> 01:34:07,799
and just of all different land racing

2366
01:34:06,658 --> 01:34:09,479
stuff and go ahead and pick it off but

2367
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:11,400
because Santa Cruz's humidity is so

2368
01:34:09,479 --> 01:34:14,939
perfect it's just like a humidor for bud

2369
01:34:11,399 --> 01:34:17,638
in the last years it's crazy absolutely

2370
01:34:14,939 --> 01:34:19,198
crazy that is nice you know if you've

2371
01:34:17,639 --> 01:34:21,239
got like here

2372
01:34:19,198 --> 01:34:24,359
it's really a lot of times here in

2373
01:34:21,238 --> 01:34:26,218
Oregon it's too wet to really I mean I

2374
01:34:24,359 --> 01:34:28,259
can pop them in the room since I don't

2375
01:34:26,219 --> 01:34:30,000
trim the plant at Harvest now I just

2376
01:34:28,260 --> 01:34:31,440
take the whole plant right yeah yeah all

2377
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,960
the big leaves will come down and

2378
01:34:31,439 --> 01:34:35,099
protect most of the buds from the light

2379
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:36,658
sometimes man I just have to hang them

2380
01:34:35,100 --> 01:34:39,060
in the grow room to let them dry you

2381
01:34:36,658 --> 01:34:41,219
know and they're not in any direct light

2382
01:34:39,060 --> 01:34:43,739
but there's a lot of reflected light

2383
01:34:41,219 --> 01:34:45,960
which is not my favorite but I sometimes

2384
01:34:43,738 --> 01:34:50,039
have to do it because my humidity is 90

2385
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:52,020
Plus for a week yeah I mean and I can't

2386
01:34:50,039 --> 01:34:54,479
dry anything like that if I put it in

2387
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:58,679
the jars I'll be mold City fast oh yeah

2388
01:34:54,479 --> 01:35:01,559
yes my girl who I have uh I have uh Kai

2389
01:34:58,679 --> 01:35:04,460
found this tool of hers she had a uh a

2390
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:04,460
dehydrator right

2391
01:35:06,260 --> 01:35:10,560
right when I pull them down I take them

2392
01:35:08,399 --> 01:35:12,960
on a little buds I stack them on that

2393
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:16,860
dehydrator I let that [ __ ] roll for

2394
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:19,198
about an hour to get a mummy dry yeah

2395
01:35:16,859 --> 01:35:21,539
very carefully put them in the jars and

2396
01:35:19,198 --> 01:35:23,399
put them away and that works like a

2397
01:35:21,539 --> 01:35:25,560
champ but during the summer I don't need

2398
01:35:23,399 --> 01:35:27,359
it I can I can mummy dry them just

2399
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:28,320
hanging them out in the closet you know

2400
01:35:27,359 --> 01:35:31,679
yeah

2401
01:35:28,319 --> 01:35:34,619
so you have a new book coming out

2402
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:37,500
um we we have the TLO uh version one and

2403
01:35:34,619 --> 01:35:39,179
two correct yes is this the V3 or is

2404
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:41,279
this a whole new book whole new book

2405
01:35:39,179 --> 01:35:43,199
what do we got tell us about that man

2406
01:35:41,279 --> 01:35:45,479
it's uh

2407
01:35:43,198 --> 01:35:48,178
I've leaned away from the whole tease

2408
01:35:45,479 --> 01:35:51,059
thing right I don't like teas anymore

2409
01:35:48,179 --> 01:35:53,940
all right what I like is a Perpetual tea

2410
01:35:51,060 --> 01:35:55,800
I call it the churn right okay it's a

2411
01:35:53,939 --> 01:35:57,960
constant addition to your water that you

2412
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:59,940
back off when it's near harvest the

2413
01:35:57,960 --> 01:36:02,579
whole book will explain it but it is the

2414
01:35:59,939 --> 01:36:06,059
[ __ ] bomb right okay that's how I

2415
01:36:02,579 --> 01:36:07,979
keep I adjust my water and uh I give in

2416
01:36:06,060 --> 01:36:10,860
the new book there's like I don't know

2417
01:36:07,979 --> 01:36:12,899
probably 10 soil recipes for any

2418
01:36:10,859 --> 01:36:15,119
situation no matter what you can get and

2419
01:36:12,899 --> 01:36:17,519
what you can't get with tons of options

2420
01:36:15,119 --> 01:36:19,260
for what you can sub in that was a point

2421
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:21,600
of problem for some people where they

2422
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:24,719
would not be able to get something in

2423
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:28,020
the original recipes and they would sub

2424
01:36:24,719 --> 01:36:30,060
in something else that's not good right

2425
01:36:28,020 --> 01:36:31,679
or or they would just leave it out

2426
01:36:30,060 --> 01:36:33,300
completely and with some things you can

2427
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:35,579
leave out it's no big deal with other

2428
01:36:33,300 --> 01:36:37,760
things that's not the case you know yeah

2429
01:36:35,579 --> 01:36:41,100
yeah

2430
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:43,920
so it's all these new soil recipes it's

2431
01:36:41,100 --> 01:36:46,199
all the new Dynamics around growing in

2432
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:48,420
general it shows new microphone style

2433
01:36:46,198 --> 01:36:51,119
right which is essentially using the

2434
01:36:48,420 --> 01:36:53,219
catch trays as little micro ponds yeah

2435
01:36:51,119 --> 01:36:55,139
yeah where the water sits in for a while

2436
01:36:53,219 --> 01:36:57,359
you have some Alfalfa and whatnot in

2437
01:36:55,139 --> 01:36:58,859
there all the microlife Bros and then

2438
01:36:57,359 --> 01:37:00,839
get stuck back into the plant and

2439
01:36:58,859 --> 01:37:02,819
everything is beautiful that method

2440
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:03,960
works like unbelievably good I'll have

2441
01:37:02,819 --> 01:37:06,479
to check that out I've never heard that

2442
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:09,060
oh it's so Kick-Ass man it's so easy

2443
01:37:06,479 --> 01:37:11,279
it's like it's like top dressing but

2444
01:37:09,060 --> 01:37:13,560
it's probably but it's like top dressing

2445
01:37:11,279 --> 01:37:15,539
that works much faster right it's like

2446
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:17,880
you get results with it within days you

2447
01:37:15,539 --> 01:37:19,738
can see the effects of what you've done

2448
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:21,119
and so that's a that's a new component

2449
01:37:19,738 --> 01:37:23,939
to the book what else are you adding in

2450
01:37:21,119 --> 01:37:26,939
what else are we covering oh my god I've

2451
01:37:23,939 --> 01:37:30,178
got so many new things about lighting

2452
01:37:26,939 --> 01:37:32,099
and sprouting and vegging and some

2453
01:37:30,179 --> 01:37:35,219
detailed information about the lighting

2454
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:38,699
and photo periods like you said how to

2455
01:37:35,219 --> 01:37:42,179
do Sprouts clones uh all keeping with

2456
01:37:38,698 --> 01:37:44,099
the TLO methodology you know yeah I have

2457
01:37:42,179 --> 01:37:47,340
an extensive troubleshooting section

2458
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:50,100
that I believe will handle any freaking

2459
01:37:47,340 --> 01:37:52,619
problem anybody can have that's killer

2460
01:37:50,100 --> 01:37:55,500
I'm pretty sure because I've seen for

2461
01:37:52,619 --> 01:37:58,738
the first two books I've seen a lot of

2462
01:37:55,500 --> 01:38:00,719
specific issues people have yeah it's

2463
01:37:58,738 --> 01:38:02,519
their own fault it's usually because of

2464
01:38:00,719 --> 01:38:06,359
they can't Source something you know

2465
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:09,000
along those lines yeah well or they use

2466
01:38:06,359 --> 01:38:10,920
something that's not what I said to use

2467
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:13,800
like a couple of people have really

2468
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:16,139
boned themselves using kelp extract to

2469
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:19,260
mix with their soil mix instead of kelp

2470
01:38:16,139 --> 01:38:21,719
meal ah yep do and that's a synthetic

2471
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:24,719
process to make the extract right no no

2472
01:38:21,719 --> 01:38:26,939
no no no no kelp extract is it's all not

2473
01:38:24,719 --> 01:38:30,300
it's fine it's just

2474
01:38:26,939 --> 01:38:32,879
highly yeah obviously highly

2475
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:37,460
concentrated okay you start adding four

2476
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:37,460
cups of that to your soil you're done

2477
01:38:38,479 --> 01:38:43,678
potassium overdose is one of the ugliest

2478
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:46,380
most horrible ways to lose your plants

2479
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:49,139
because yeah it is it is an ugly ugly

2480
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:51,119
death so now I know people are going to

2481
01:38:49,139 --> 01:38:53,100
kick my ass if I don't ask you about

2482
01:38:51,119 --> 01:38:55,500
your roadkill skunk you mentioned it

2483
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:57,000
briefly where did you Source it uh what

2484
01:38:55,500 --> 01:38:59,399
was it like can you describe it a little

2485
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:03,238
bit okay long ago in Northern California

2486
01:38:59,399 --> 01:39:05,238
I made lots of friends yeah when I went

2487
01:39:03,238 --> 01:39:08,399
to the uh

2488
01:39:05,238 --> 01:39:11,638
uh what was the cup the emerald Cup in

2489
01:39:08,399 --> 01:39:13,198
2013. yeah I uh got a hold of an old

2490
01:39:11,639 --> 01:39:15,359
friend of mine in Willits that I knew

2491
01:39:13,198 --> 01:39:16,738
had the skunk I knew he was a gatekeeper

2492
01:39:15,359 --> 01:39:20,759
of it I knew yeah

2493
01:39:16,738 --> 01:39:23,879
so he was you know paranoid skeptical he

2494
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:26,280
kept calling me worldwide rev why is

2495
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:28,739
that you know he just didn't dig the

2496
01:39:26,279 --> 01:39:31,559
fact that I was uh

2497
01:39:28,738 --> 01:39:34,198
uh so out of hiding yeah oh yeah yeah

2498
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:36,179
for sure you know so he so there was

2499
01:39:34,198 --> 01:39:37,678
that aspect so anyway I worked on him

2500
01:39:36,179 --> 01:39:39,539
for a while about six months and we

2501
01:39:37,679 --> 01:39:41,579
finally made a deal I would trade him

2502
01:39:39,539 --> 01:39:42,899
some of my mohawken for some of his

2503
01:39:41,579 --> 01:39:45,119
skunk right

2504
01:39:42,899 --> 01:39:46,859
so we finally got together and he

2505
01:39:45,119 --> 01:39:48,960
finally did it he assured me that he

2506
01:39:46,859 --> 01:39:50,819
hadn't bastardized it you know it was

2507
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:53,460
the original skunk line which I remember

2508
01:39:50,819 --> 01:39:55,679
when it was first before it was skunk it

2509
01:39:53,460 --> 01:39:57,359
was called red Russian right red Russian

2510
01:39:55,679 --> 01:39:59,819
okay that's what it was before everybody

2511
01:39:57,359 --> 01:40:01,439
realized how skunky it was and the rest

2512
01:39:59,819 --> 01:40:02,698
is history was there a Russian River up

2513
01:40:01,439 --> 01:40:04,319
there in North Carolina yeah that's

2514
01:40:02,698 --> 01:40:06,839
where that's part of why it was named

2515
01:40:04,319 --> 01:40:10,259
that yeah right off the Russian River

2516
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:13,739
and uh and it was very red yeah makes

2517
01:40:10,260 --> 01:40:16,619
sense so uh so anyway so it's always had

2518
01:40:13,738 --> 01:40:19,138
from seeds from it it's always had kind

2519
01:40:16,619 --> 01:40:23,939
of a spread there's always some sweeter

2520
01:40:19,139 --> 01:40:25,920
some like body odor stinky feet ones and

2521
01:40:23,939 --> 01:40:28,079
then there's like really skunk you have

2522
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:30,179
roadkill skunky ones there's pissier

2523
01:40:28,079 --> 01:40:32,219
ones there's even some with a little bit

2524
01:40:30,179 --> 01:40:34,380
of a sweet component to them although

2525
01:40:32,219 --> 01:40:36,719
those were very rare yeah with this plan

2526
01:40:34,380 --> 01:40:40,020
I've I've grown some of these out

2527
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:42,539
several times now and I've get I'd get a

2528
01:40:40,020 --> 01:40:46,260
nice spread I get roadkill pretty often

2529
01:40:42,539 --> 01:40:48,899
I would say one in eight maybe yeah

2530
01:40:46,260 --> 01:40:51,000
but but I don't have enough of a numbers

2531
01:40:48,899 --> 01:40:53,879
of those spreads really say that for

2532
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:56,100
sure yet yeah I've gotten it about one

2533
01:40:53,880 --> 01:41:00,840
and eight so far from three runs right

2534
01:40:56,100 --> 01:41:03,239
yeah so the roadkills the problem with

2535
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:05,159
the skunk is that there's no way to tell

2536
01:41:03,238 --> 01:41:07,979
it's roadkill until two weeks before

2537
01:41:05,158 --> 01:41:09,719
Harvest yeah I know of no way yeah right

2538
01:41:07,979 --> 01:41:12,419
because there's no indicators nothing

2539
01:41:09,719 --> 01:41:14,399
else the all the turpents Stay Stay

2540
01:41:12,420 --> 01:41:15,480
changing oh I'm gonna have to plug this

2541
01:41:14,399 --> 01:41:17,339
in

2542
01:41:15,479 --> 01:41:20,819
that's all right I'm running a low

2543
01:41:17,340 --> 01:41:24,239
battery hang on we'll keep it going

2544
01:41:20,819 --> 01:41:28,399
let me see if I can

2545
01:41:24,238 --> 01:41:31,138
do this and not screw things up

2546
01:41:28,399 --> 01:41:33,839
I'm sure it'll be cool oh I'm a techno

2547
01:41:31,139 --> 01:41:36,380
wizard it'll be fine don't worry I got

2548
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:36,380
this handled

2549
01:41:43,020 --> 01:41:45,800
come on baby

2550
01:41:46,439 --> 01:41:50,399
okay how's my audio perfect

2551
01:41:48,779 --> 01:41:52,738
all right because sometimes when you

2552
01:41:50,399 --> 01:41:55,198
plug it in the audio goes to hell yeah I

2553
01:41:52,738 --> 01:41:57,718
know you're good so let's talk about the

2554
01:41:55,198 --> 01:42:00,000
morphology of this skunk was it a a pure

2555
01:41:57,719 --> 01:42:02,698
Afghani was it a hybrid what did you see

2556
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:05,399
from it I've heard three what I consider

2557
01:42:02,698 --> 01:42:07,678
to be legit stories for people I

2558
01:42:05,399 --> 01:42:11,399
consider to be trustworthy yeah so I'm

2559
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:13,500
not really sure what it is yeah I the

2560
01:42:11,399 --> 01:42:16,738
one consistency that I have heard a lot

2561
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:19,079
is that it was a South American cross to

2562
01:42:16,738 --> 01:42:21,599
the original Indica that came to

2563
01:42:19,079 --> 01:42:24,960
Northern California okay there was that

2564
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:27,600
kind remember with the leafy florets yes

2565
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:30,118
yeah right yeah that was all over

2566
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:32,520
suddenly everybody had it right

2567
01:42:30,118 --> 01:42:35,639
and it was real purple and real gnarly

2568
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:37,920
but uh somebody now the best I know is

2569
01:42:35,639 --> 01:42:40,440
that was crossed with a South American

2570
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:42,779
okay that's what that's what originally

2571
01:42:40,439 --> 01:42:44,939
brought up the skunk line which was when

2572
01:42:42,779 --> 01:42:48,359
it was red Russian it was I hadn't even

2573
01:42:44,939 --> 01:42:52,138
skunk it was very resistant to things

2574
01:42:48,359 --> 01:42:53,960
like mold and Pottery mildew it didn't

2575
01:42:52,139 --> 01:42:57,779
have a problem with any of that stuff

2576
01:42:53,960 --> 01:43:01,560
and uh as it now that it's an IBL I

2577
01:42:57,779 --> 01:43:03,238
don't know 13 or 15 or 20. now it's got

2578
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:06,060
some of those standard weaknesses that

2579
01:43:03,238 --> 01:43:08,279
go with it it's not so not so resistant

2580
01:43:06,060 --> 01:43:10,199
to everything anymore but it's still

2581
01:43:08,279 --> 01:43:12,059
pretty much the plant I remember you

2582
01:43:10,198 --> 01:43:15,000
know I mean granted that was a long time

2583
01:43:12,060 --> 01:43:18,239
ago and I am Mr Magoo yeah but from what

2584
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:20,639
I remember it I would my best my best

2585
01:43:18,238 --> 01:43:22,319
estimate and feeling is that he did give

2586
01:43:20,639 --> 01:43:24,900
me the true one that he has inbred

2587
01:43:22,319 --> 01:43:26,340
himself yeah but like I said the skunk

2588
01:43:24,899 --> 01:43:28,559
has a thing where

2589
01:43:26,340 --> 01:43:30,179
it just won't it won't go where you

2590
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:33,000
think it will go when you breed it it

2591
01:43:30,179 --> 01:43:36,658
won't yes it'll just do its standard

2592
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:37,859
it'll just whip out bandwidths of the

2593
01:43:36,658 --> 01:43:39,899
different Terps the different

2594
01:43:37,859 --> 01:43:42,899
morphologies you know all of the

2595
01:43:39,899 --> 01:43:44,939
morphologies are close yeah Terps are

2596
01:43:42,899 --> 01:43:48,000
wide ranging you know there's there's a

2597
01:43:44,939 --> 01:43:51,839
lot the two killers are the body odor

2598
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:53,639
stinky feet and the skunk yeah they are

2599
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:56,219
soup now there's another one that I

2600
01:43:53,639 --> 01:43:58,679
remember that is also in these a Piney

2601
01:43:56,219 --> 01:44:01,679
one right yeah people love Pine super

2602
01:43:58,679 --> 01:44:05,460
Pine resin I mean really sharp it's

2603
01:44:01,679 --> 01:44:08,039
almost skunk yeah but Pine yeah yeah and

2604
01:44:05,460 --> 01:44:10,020
those are probably the most potent in

2605
01:44:08,039 --> 01:44:12,000
the bunch do you do you notice any

2606
01:44:10,020 --> 01:44:14,040
intersex traits specifically in that

2607
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:16,979
line or any of the skunky stuff do you

2608
01:44:14,039 --> 01:44:19,679
ever notice that like for example

2609
01:44:16,979 --> 01:44:20,759
um so a lot of the the the lines that

2610
01:44:19,679 --> 01:44:22,319
we're seeing that have a lot of the

2611
01:44:20,760 --> 01:44:24,060
skunky traits whether it's me or CSI

2612
01:44:22,319 --> 01:44:25,979
we've been doing a lot of stuff almost

2613
01:44:24,060 --> 01:44:27,900
all of them are freaking full intersex

2614
01:44:25,979 --> 01:44:29,698
every time we run into that same terpene

2615
01:44:27,899 --> 01:44:32,399
profile a lot of the times it comes with

2616
01:44:29,698 --> 01:44:34,379
intersex traits heavy

2617
01:44:32,399 --> 01:44:36,198
I'm not sure I understand what you mean

2618
01:44:34,380 --> 01:44:39,420
by intersections

2619
01:44:36,198 --> 01:44:42,059
oh oh no no there no no there's no

2620
01:44:39,420 --> 01:44:43,679
there's my skunk is sexually healthy but

2621
01:44:42,060 --> 01:44:45,960
that's good to know that would not

2622
01:44:43,679 --> 01:44:48,779
surprise me because

2623
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:50,698
when the skunk came out of course you

2624
01:44:48,779 --> 01:44:53,279
had to have it yeah of course yeah yeah

2625
01:44:50,698 --> 01:44:56,399
you had to have it yeah so everybody had

2626
01:44:53,279 --> 01:44:58,019
it and while I was associated with some

2627
01:44:56,399 --> 01:45:00,238
pretty damn decent breeders who were

2628
01:44:58,020 --> 01:45:02,280
teaching me stuff yeah that wasn't the

2629
01:45:00,238 --> 01:45:04,979
same for everyone right yeah of course

2630
01:45:02,279 --> 01:45:07,380
and so everybody and their mom was

2631
01:45:04,979 --> 01:45:11,399
breeding it I mean it just everybody did

2632
01:45:07,380 --> 01:45:14,219
so tons of it tons of the seeds of skunk

2633
01:45:11,399 --> 01:45:16,859
yeah flooded the market but you know you

2634
01:45:14,219 --> 01:45:18,420
got people who just uh they just can't

2635
01:45:16,859 --> 01:45:20,639
uh seem to

2636
01:45:18,420 --> 01:45:23,039
put in the work it takes to make sure

2637
01:45:20,639 --> 01:45:25,618
that you're not blowing Hermes or you

2638
01:45:23,039 --> 01:45:27,479
know any of it testing the line and

2639
01:45:25,618 --> 01:45:30,539
seeing what you've made any of it yeah

2640
01:45:27,479 --> 01:45:33,178
that's a lost art [ __ ] I do I do the

2641
01:45:30,539 --> 01:45:35,460
most deep inspection on unknown plants

2642
01:45:33,179 --> 01:45:37,500
if I have anything that I don't that I'm

2643
01:45:35,460 --> 01:45:39,840
not already totally familiar with man

2644
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:42,380
I'm in there with my 30 times super

2645
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:44,760
light magnifying glass every day

2646
01:45:42,380 --> 01:45:46,679
you know I'm looking close I'm seeing

2647
01:45:44,760 --> 01:45:48,960
because I can recognize what Hermes are

2648
01:45:46,679 --> 01:45:50,880
about to happen but right before they do

2649
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:53,600
you know there's a little mutant growth

2650
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:56,460
that occurs down at the axial intersects

2651
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:59,159
you could see it's like a mutant growth

2652
01:45:56,460 --> 01:46:01,679
a mutant Leaf growth kind of

2653
01:45:59,158 --> 01:46:03,599
because it's not it it's different than

2654
01:46:01,679 --> 01:46:05,399
how a female typically grows when you

2655
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:08,100
can see that yeah sort of like it's

2656
01:46:05,399 --> 01:46:10,799
trying to re-vege a little

2657
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:12,360
so I for the viewers watching this I

2658
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:14,400
want I want people to take note because

2659
01:46:12,359 --> 01:46:16,019
I often talk about like different things

2660
01:46:14,399 --> 01:46:17,579
you learn only through experience and

2661
01:46:16,020 --> 01:46:18,780
breeding and one of those if you'll

2662
01:46:17,579 --> 01:46:20,399
notice when when I'm sitting here

2663
01:46:18,779 --> 01:46:22,139
talking with my friend the rep he's

2664
01:46:20,399 --> 01:46:25,079
talking about you know I know this line

2665
01:46:22,139 --> 01:46:27,840
it's because I know the line I know what

2666
01:46:25,079 --> 01:46:30,059
I can see from it and it for someone who

2667
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:31,380
isn't super experienced running a bunch

2668
01:46:30,060 --> 01:46:32,520
of different lines not only a bunch of

2669
01:46:31,380 --> 01:46:34,859
different lines but a bunch of the

2670
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:36,600
different bass lines meaning Northern

2671
01:46:34,859 --> 01:46:38,819
Lights skunk one Haze a lot of these

2672
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:41,820
land races it's hard to truly understand

2673
01:46:38,819 --> 01:46:43,439
until you've run them what it is when

2674
01:46:41,819 --> 01:46:45,238
you can truly start predicting and

2675
01:46:43,439 --> 01:46:49,019
that's what breeding is when you're able

2676
01:46:45,238 --> 01:46:50,698
to predict you know uh to to run your

2677
01:46:49,020 --> 01:46:52,080
lines and then to see it in action and

2678
01:46:50,698 --> 01:46:53,698
to realize okay I was either right or

2679
01:46:52,079 --> 01:46:56,100
wrong at this and make the next move

2680
01:46:53,698 --> 01:46:57,539
that's that's all breeding is and and

2681
01:46:56,100 --> 01:46:59,699
when you get to this point in your

2682
01:46:57,539 --> 01:47:02,100
career when you've been breeding 40 you

2683
01:46:59,698 --> 01:47:04,079
know 30 years a lot of this stuff comes

2684
01:47:02,100 --> 01:47:05,520
second hand and a lot of it becomes a

2685
01:47:04,079 --> 01:47:07,139
natural instinct as you're going through

2686
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:08,639
these these things and there's there's

2687
01:47:07,139 --> 01:47:10,319
even stuff you're telling me about

2688
01:47:08,639 --> 01:47:11,940
different traits of the of the leaf

2689
01:47:10,319 --> 01:47:14,939
hairs on the cotyledons and stuff like

2690
01:47:11,939 --> 01:47:16,439
that I have never even thought of and I

2691
01:47:14,939 --> 01:47:18,238
spend all of my time looking at the

2692
01:47:16,439 --> 01:47:20,039
plants you know just constantly

2693
01:47:18,238 --> 01:47:21,299
observing and that's how you learn it's

2694
01:47:20,039 --> 01:47:23,100
constantly observing you don't want to

2695
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:25,139
just let your plants you know leave them

2696
01:47:23,100 --> 01:47:27,239
in a room let it auto run for a week or

2697
01:47:25,139 --> 01:47:29,520
whatever if you're really into it learn

2698
01:47:27,238 --> 01:47:32,158
your plants every freaking stage that's

2699
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:33,300
how you know and uh where rev is a great

2700
01:47:32,158 --> 01:47:35,039
example of that everything you've been

2701
01:47:33,300 --> 01:47:37,739
saying about that just reinforces that

2702
01:47:35,039 --> 01:47:39,420
100 right it's like when I was telling

2703
01:47:37,738 --> 01:47:42,178
you about my little hash trick earlier

2704
01:47:39,420 --> 01:47:44,639
it's like if you are a breeder who

2705
01:47:42,179 --> 01:47:46,380
doesn't really know your [ __ ] yet and

2706
01:47:44,639 --> 01:47:48,600
you're dealing with lines that you're

2707
01:47:46,380 --> 01:47:50,940
not really familiar with yet

2708
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:53,760
the easiest way to do it is to pick

2709
01:47:50,939 --> 01:47:57,238
let's say four of the strongest best

2710
01:47:53,760 --> 01:48:00,780
vigorous females right yep grab a couple

2711
01:47:57,238 --> 01:48:02,519
of the strongest biggest best males

2712
01:48:00,779 --> 01:48:03,779
throw them all in and let them breed now

2713
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:05,219
when they're about two weeks from

2714
01:48:03,779 --> 01:48:07,319
finishing

2715
01:48:05,219 --> 01:48:09,420
just go over them all with a magnifying

2716
01:48:07,319 --> 01:48:11,279
glass see who has the most resin get a

2717
01:48:09,420 --> 01:48:12,960
grip on them smell them you'll know the

2718
01:48:11,279 --> 01:48:14,759
smells by then right yeah everything

2719
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:16,800
will be less because they'll be full of

2720
01:48:14,760 --> 01:48:18,659
seeds but you could take that into

2721
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:20,579
consideration you

2722
01:48:18,658 --> 01:48:22,079
then go in and check them out then you

2723
01:48:20,579 --> 01:48:24,059
get a really good idea of what you're

2724
01:48:22,079 --> 01:48:26,579
dealing with who's better than who who's

2725
01:48:24,060 --> 01:48:27,560
likely to be the king who sucks right

2726
01:48:26,579 --> 01:48:30,179
yeah

2727
01:48:27,560 --> 01:48:31,739
you just recycle the plants that suck or

2728
01:48:30,179 --> 01:48:34,500
make hash or do whatever you want right

2729
01:48:31,738 --> 01:48:36,118
exactly make cash from those plants that

2730
01:48:34,500 --> 01:48:38,760
turn out good that I don't know anything

2731
01:48:36,118 --> 01:48:41,279
about but they're killer yeah I'll make

2732
01:48:38,760 --> 01:48:45,060
cash from so that I can further dissect

2733
01:48:41,279 --> 01:48:47,279
the exact resin profile relating to the

2734
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:48,960
high type itself which is which is what

2735
01:48:47,279 --> 01:48:52,380
I cherish over everything else because

2736
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:54,779
some weed just it makes me aggro train

2737
01:48:52,380 --> 01:48:56,460
wreck do that uh you know there's

2738
01:48:54,779 --> 01:49:00,179
different hash plants that can do that

2739
01:48:56,460 --> 01:49:02,340
for me the the the really super fast

2740
01:49:00,179 --> 01:49:04,859
flowering plants the ones that flower in

2741
01:49:02,340 --> 01:49:07,139
like six or seven weeks yeah yeah

2742
01:49:04,859 --> 01:49:10,859
those all have the exact same quality

2743
01:49:07,139 --> 01:49:13,260
for me of what I call aggro Weed right

2744
01:49:10,859 --> 01:49:15,599
yeah it's like I smoke them I get really

2745
01:49:13,260 --> 01:49:17,400
high really baked I'm all whoa this it

2746
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:19,260
doesn't last long it only lasts like an

2747
01:49:17,399 --> 01:49:22,079
hour or something right yeah yeah then

2748
01:49:19,260 --> 01:49:25,739
you come out of it and man I'm like [ __ ]

2749
01:49:22,079 --> 01:49:29,100
I just said he mood yeah you know it's

2750
01:49:25,738 --> 01:49:31,319
like oh I just I don't like that yeah no

2751
01:49:29,100 --> 01:49:33,539
that's why we feel super fast flowering

2752
01:49:31,319 --> 01:49:35,519
ones man I just do do you think it's

2753
01:49:33,539 --> 01:49:38,579
maybe like it just hasn't had enough

2754
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:39,900
time for the resin glands to mature in

2755
01:49:38,579 --> 01:49:41,100
different oils obviously because they're

2756
01:49:39,899 --> 01:49:43,379
afghanis they'll have different oils

2757
01:49:41,100 --> 01:49:45,060
than than these longer flowering sativas

2758
01:49:43,380 --> 01:49:46,980
but maybe that's what has something to

2759
01:49:45,060 --> 01:49:50,340
do with the high just not enough time

2760
01:49:46,979 --> 01:49:52,379
well certainly it has to do with uh you

2761
01:49:50,340 --> 01:49:55,139
know the type of high generally speaking

2762
01:49:52,380 --> 01:49:57,900
sure you know you have that to high I

2763
01:49:55,139 --> 01:49:59,699
just described that super up super fast

2764
01:49:57,899 --> 01:50:02,819
really [ __ ] up and then you're down

2765
01:49:59,698 --> 01:50:05,698
there I hate that yeah yeah it just bugs

2766
01:50:02,819 --> 01:50:07,439
me butts on a longer flowering Divas you

2767
01:50:05,698 --> 01:50:10,138
have much more different kinds of highs

2768
01:50:07,439 --> 01:50:12,238
yeah a lot of them come across much

2769
01:50:10,139 --> 01:50:14,940
different some are very evil some are

2770
01:50:12,238 --> 01:50:16,500
very happy you know some are very you

2771
01:50:14,939 --> 01:50:17,939
can't read a book because you have to

2772
01:50:16,500 --> 01:50:19,698
keep rereading the first paragraph 100

2773
01:50:17,939 --> 01:50:22,198
times that's my life

2774
01:50:19,698 --> 01:50:24,238
you know some are just like that so yeah

2775
01:50:22,198 --> 01:50:26,519
I like to get a grip on those smaller

2776
01:50:24,238 --> 01:50:29,399
assets of it I agree with you you

2777
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:33,060
accidentally you absolutely I think it's

2778
01:50:29,399 --> 01:50:36,238
impossible to get a sativa

2779
01:50:33,060 --> 01:50:38,940
10 week plus high from anything that's

2780
01:50:36,238 --> 01:50:41,399
below seven weeks yeah no I could

2781
01:50:38,939 --> 01:50:42,979
believe you could do it in eight I can't

2782
01:50:41,399 --> 01:50:45,299
believe that yeah

2783
01:50:42,979 --> 01:50:48,178
the closest thing I've ever seen is a

2784
01:50:45,300 --> 01:50:50,159
Cindy right yeah yeah but so it would be

2785
01:50:48,179 --> 01:50:52,500
rare but yeah in order to get the kind

2786
01:50:50,158 --> 01:50:55,738
of highs I really like and I really look

2787
01:50:52,500 --> 01:50:57,899
for it's got to be a 10 weaker nine week

2788
01:50:55,738 --> 01:50:58,919
nine week exceptions I've seen twice in

2789
01:50:57,899 --> 01:51:03,118
my life

2790
01:50:58,920 --> 01:51:04,739
almost every single breeder or someone I

2791
01:51:03,118 --> 01:51:06,420
would consider a connoisseur weed that

2792
01:51:04,738 --> 01:51:08,039
has the experience has smoked a lot of

2793
01:51:06,420 --> 01:51:09,899
different strains like and knows what

2794
01:51:08,039 --> 01:51:11,460
they've been smoking they all tend to

2795
01:51:09,899 --> 01:51:13,500
lean to that 10 to 11 week high

2796
01:51:11,460 --> 01:51:16,020
everybody seems to kind of as we get

2797
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:17,819
older I think also our bodies mature the

2798
01:51:16,020 --> 01:51:19,380
chemicals in our brains change and I

2799
01:51:17,819 --> 01:51:20,939
think we all tend to just kind of

2800
01:51:19,380 --> 01:51:22,800
navigate to that certain kind of high

2801
01:51:20,939 --> 01:51:24,779
typing and it's really really bizarre

2802
01:51:22,800 --> 01:51:26,219
but I've noticed it it's the best of

2803
01:51:24,779 --> 01:51:28,380
both worlds it's really where the

2804
01:51:26,219 --> 01:51:31,079
entertains meet you can it can go either

2805
01:51:28,380 --> 01:51:33,118
way that way yeah you can find anything

2806
01:51:31,079 --> 01:51:36,420
you like Plus

2807
01:51:33,118 --> 01:51:39,059
at 10 weeks you generally speaking

2808
01:51:36,420 --> 01:51:40,920
almost always have much longer legs

2809
01:51:39,060 --> 01:51:44,100
right yeah yeah the legs will be much

2810
01:51:40,920 --> 01:51:46,440
longer you get that six that via that V

2811
01:51:44,100 --> 01:51:50,159
black I'm telling you about not only

2812
01:51:46,439 --> 01:51:52,859
does that take 20 minutes to set in oh I

2813
01:51:50,158 --> 01:51:54,599
bet yeah 20 minutes that's wow it's

2814
01:51:52,859 --> 01:51:57,420
gonna be 20 minutes before you're like

2815
01:51:54,600 --> 01:52:00,600
holy [ __ ] before the rights like truly

2816
01:51:57,420 --> 01:52:03,380
starts yeah right yeah but then you're

2817
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:05,639
gonna stay exactly that high there's no

2818
01:52:03,380 --> 01:52:07,920
wobbling it's gonna be like a freight

2819
01:52:05,639 --> 01:52:09,600
train it's going to go up slow and then

2820
01:52:07,920 --> 01:52:12,480
man you're not going to get off of that

2821
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:14,699
for maybe five hours that's crazy yeah

2822
01:52:12,479 --> 01:52:17,579
cook you all day long

2823
01:52:14,698 --> 01:52:19,618
that is awesome it is it's one of my

2824
01:52:17,579 --> 01:52:22,260
favorites for going you know out on bike

2825
01:52:19,618 --> 01:52:24,118
rides or something you know oh I bet I

2826
01:52:22,260 --> 01:52:27,600
love that super long flowering sativa

2827
01:52:24,118 --> 01:52:29,939
tie V black anything like that the metal

2828
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:32,400
Haze was killer for that the chunky

2829
01:52:29,939 --> 01:52:33,899
Cherry tie oh yes

2830
01:52:32,399 --> 01:52:35,219
so what's what's some of the current

2831
01:52:33,899 --> 01:52:36,420
work you're working on what is what's

2832
01:52:35,219 --> 01:52:39,480
some stuff you're really excited about

2833
01:52:36,420 --> 01:52:41,100
right now right now I'm just kind of in

2834
01:52:39,479 --> 01:52:43,559
a blurb where I'm just bringing up some

2835
01:52:41,100 --> 01:52:45,420
stuff to look at yeah I just I just

2836
01:52:43,560 --> 01:52:48,840
switched over my lights for winter so

2837
01:52:45,420 --> 01:52:52,440
I'm all back to my eye blue 6500 Kelvin

2838
01:52:48,840 --> 01:52:54,360
metal halide lamps yeah so once I once I

2839
01:52:52,439 --> 01:52:56,219
get those in I have to do a little

2840
01:52:54,359 --> 01:52:57,479
adjusting to my environment to make sure

2841
01:52:56,219 --> 01:53:00,359
I can run everything right because

2842
01:52:57,479 --> 01:53:03,419
they're freaking hot right yeah yeah and

2843
01:53:00,359 --> 01:53:05,639
I run tents so yeah so anyway I'm Donald

2844
01:53:03,420 --> 01:53:08,219
in so what I thought I would do was pop

2845
01:53:05,639 --> 01:53:10,800
up a few I've got uh right now just my

2846
01:53:08,219 --> 01:53:14,520
ones to have a look at right now that I

2847
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:17,100
have up are some Afghani orange that's

2848
01:53:14,520 --> 01:53:19,199
so old I'm not sure if it's a hybrid of

2849
01:53:17,100 --> 01:53:20,940
Afghani oranges something else and I'm

2850
01:53:19,198 --> 01:53:24,779
not sure who gave it to me but I had it

2851
01:53:20,939 --> 01:53:27,118
in my four star can oh wow but it's so

2852
01:53:24,779 --> 01:53:29,039
old that the label wore off and all I

2853
01:53:27,118 --> 01:53:31,679
can read is Afghani orange was part of

2854
01:53:29,039 --> 01:53:33,600
it so I had to see what those were yeah

2855
01:53:31,679 --> 01:53:35,340
yeah and they look they look cool they

2856
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:38,760
look good and then of course the G13

2857
01:53:35,340 --> 01:53:41,100
Haze right yeah oh yeah and I ended up I

2858
01:53:38,760 --> 01:53:44,520
planted like six I still got two more

2859
01:53:41,100 --> 01:53:47,460
seeds yeah if I had six I got four to

2860
01:53:44,520 --> 01:53:50,100
come up two died just you know how they

2861
01:53:47,460 --> 01:53:52,679
are with super super old seeds yeah it

2862
01:53:50,100 --> 01:53:54,780
just kind of came up and went in no yep

2863
01:53:52,679 --> 01:53:56,760
and then the other two which are a male

2864
01:53:54,779 --> 01:53:58,859
and a female and you know I don't wanna

2865
01:53:56,760 --> 01:54:00,480
jinx myself or any but they both look

2866
01:53:58,859 --> 01:54:02,399
really good yeah

2867
01:54:00,479 --> 01:54:04,379
so I'm testing though now I just popped

2868
01:54:02,399 --> 01:54:07,019
that G13 of flowering oh you bet I did

2869
01:54:04,380 --> 01:54:09,239
oh that's awesome I need to be I need to

2870
01:54:07,020 --> 01:54:11,219
be looking at that right and then on the

2871
01:54:09,238 --> 01:54:14,698
uh in the other 10 I started up some

2872
01:54:11,219 --> 01:54:16,198
cherry Thunder [ __ ] oh nice and some uh

2873
01:54:14,698 --> 01:54:21,238
Cindy black

2874
01:54:16,198 --> 01:54:23,698
which with the screen yeah nice yeah so

2875
01:54:21,238 --> 01:54:27,839
it so with my so here's what why because

2876
01:54:23,698 --> 01:54:31,138
in my head if my Vietnam Black skunk

2877
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:33,960
doesn't work out how I think yeah then

2878
01:54:31,139 --> 01:54:35,880
I'm gonna try the Cindy black skunk and

2879
01:54:33,960 --> 01:54:38,939
see if I can lock in those [ __ ] skunk

2880
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:40,920
turbines because something will do it

2881
01:54:38,939 --> 01:54:43,198
eventually we'll do it

2882
01:54:40,920 --> 01:54:45,060
I just have to find a gene that goes in

2883
01:54:43,198 --> 01:54:47,039
there and knocks them all cattywampus

2884
01:54:45,060 --> 01:54:49,199
and gets them to line up more uniform

2885
01:54:47,039 --> 01:54:51,479
for me yeah or a gene that somehow in

2886
01:54:49,198 --> 01:54:52,979
one strain makes that link trait to the

2887
01:54:51,479 --> 01:54:54,238
skunk smell have something you know what

2888
01:54:52,979 --> 01:54:56,539
I mean like a link trait that's good

2889
01:54:54,238 --> 01:54:59,039
with it brings it out

2890
01:54:56,539 --> 01:55:00,779
something that'll just stick right to it

2891
01:54:59,039 --> 01:55:03,060
and make it so I can recognize when it's

2892
01:55:00,779 --> 01:55:05,579
there exactly something visual a visual

2893
01:55:03,060 --> 01:55:07,500
marker visual early on a

2894
01:55:05,579 --> 01:55:09,420
marker expression is what I call them

2895
01:55:07,500 --> 01:55:12,118
and that would be super nice to have

2896
01:55:09,420 --> 01:55:15,179
because with the skunks at present

2897
01:55:12,118 --> 01:55:16,679
the Phoenix the morphology is you know

2898
01:55:15,179 --> 01:55:18,118
pretty random they're not they don't

2899
01:55:16,679 --> 01:55:20,460
have a wide range but there's a lot

2900
01:55:18,118 --> 01:55:23,158
different ones it's not an indicator if

2901
01:55:20,460 --> 01:55:25,399
nothing is locked to the roadkill and as

2902
01:55:23,158 --> 01:55:29,460
far as any patterns Leaf patterns

2903
01:55:25,399 --> 01:55:33,479
petiole patterns root size root density

2904
01:55:29,460 --> 01:55:35,819
root I cannot find anything that is only

2905
01:55:33,479 --> 01:55:38,638
visible with the roadkill skunk right

2906
01:55:35,819 --> 01:55:39,658
nothing so I'm like that pisses me off

2907
01:55:38,639 --> 01:55:42,000
because

2908
01:55:39,658 --> 01:55:45,599
as much as I don't mind flowering some

2909
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:48,238
plants yeah I am used to and I do like

2910
01:55:45,600 --> 01:55:49,980
knowing early at least having a grip on

2911
01:55:48,238 --> 01:55:52,500
what I'm dealing with you know yeah yeah

2912
01:55:49,979 --> 01:55:54,000
yeah it's it I mean as a breeder and as

2913
01:55:52,500 --> 01:55:56,760
someone who has goals in their breeding

2914
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:58,920
that's like that's the main part it's

2915
01:55:56,760 --> 01:56:00,900
never seen enough to know if I have to

2916
01:55:58,920 --> 01:56:03,899
take up 10 if I have to flower 10

2917
01:56:00,899 --> 01:56:05,819
females to find my my roadkill skunk

2918
01:56:03,899 --> 01:56:09,059
every time well that's not how I do

2919
01:56:05,819 --> 01:56:10,799
things yeah yeah that's it the whole

2920
01:56:09,060 --> 01:56:12,239
idea of becoming better and getting to

2921
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:14,460
know what you're doing is to be able to

2922
01:56:12,238 --> 01:56:16,859
take shortcuts right right yeah yeah

2923
01:56:14,460 --> 01:56:19,439
yeah and that's that's the whole point

2924
01:56:16,859 --> 01:56:21,238
of the experience yeah

2925
01:56:19,439 --> 01:56:23,158
as I mean if you if you don't know

2926
01:56:21,238 --> 01:56:25,500
anything about breeding you can probably

2927
01:56:23,158 --> 01:56:28,319
do really well if you're just willing to

2928
01:56:25,500 --> 01:56:31,198
do the work flour out all the plants

2929
01:56:28,319 --> 01:56:33,599
first harvest them all sample them all

2930
01:56:31,198 --> 01:56:35,759
and then bring house save clones and

2931
01:56:33,600 --> 01:56:37,800
then just breed with those and you'll

2932
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:39,719
probably have learned more than any most

2933
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:42,239
other breeders out there in just that

2934
01:56:39,719 --> 01:56:44,340
one experience by going through taking

2935
01:56:42,238 --> 01:56:46,198
good notes smoking everything and

2936
01:56:44,340 --> 01:56:48,779
testing you'll you'll be more advanced

2937
01:56:46,198 --> 01:56:51,178
than 99 of seed makers I should say out

2938
01:56:48,779 --> 01:56:52,559
there I agree I agree and I I tell

2939
01:56:51,179 --> 01:56:53,760
people a million times you know you're

2940
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:55,380
going to start out it's going to seem

2941
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:57,000
like allow you know maybe take a lot of

2942
01:56:55,380 --> 01:56:59,219
notes to be able to but pretty soon

2943
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:01,198
you're going to start to know a lot of

2944
01:56:59,219 --> 01:57:04,560
things just intuitively from what yes

2945
01:57:01,198 --> 01:57:06,238
you know it's you know it becomes much

2946
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:08,100
easier especially like I said with mine

2947
01:57:06,238 --> 01:57:09,779
that I'm familiar with you know I can

2948
01:57:08,100 --> 01:57:12,380
tell when they're a month old a lot of

2949
01:57:09,779 --> 01:57:15,479
things I need to know right then

2950
01:57:12,380 --> 01:57:17,340
no I know which expressions are linked I

2951
01:57:15,479 --> 01:57:19,019
know which markers I'm looking for I

2952
01:57:17,340 --> 01:57:20,819
know which markers equal something I

2953
01:57:19,020 --> 01:57:22,020
don't want you know yeah and that's a

2954
01:57:20,819 --> 01:57:24,719
cool thing about keeping your little

2955
01:57:22,020 --> 01:57:26,580
Galapagos Island of gene pool it really

2956
01:57:24,719 --> 01:57:28,260
is because you've had all this time to

2957
01:57:26,579 --> 01:57:31,559
learn these specific strains to learn

2958
01:57:28,260 --> 01:57:33,060
how they breed and um when I tell people

2959
01:57:31,560 --> 01:57:34,260
to note your breeder this is what I'm

2960
01:57:33,060 --> 01:57:35,760
talking about you should be able to have

2961
01:57:34,260 --> 01:57:38,039
a competent conversation with your

2962
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:39,480
breeder about their lines about the

2963
01:57:38,039 --> 01:57:41,340
history of their lines and if they're

2964
01:57:39,479 --> 01:57:42,899
passionate breeders if this is what they

2965
01:57:41,340 --> 01:57:44,940
love you should be able to have a

2966
01:57:42,899 --> 01:57:47,039
conversation like this and and this has

2967
01:57:44,939 --> 01:57:49,019
been an exceptional exceptional

2968
01:57:47,039 --> 01:57:51,779
conversation with you is there anything

2969
01:57:49,020 --> 01:57:53,699
else you want to get in and plug or talk

2970
01:57:51,779 --> 01:57:54,960
pardon me now is there anything else you

2971
01:57:53,698 --> 01:57:56,879
want to get in before the end of the

2972
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:59,219
show and unplug or

2973
01:57:56,880 --> 01:58:00,960
well let's see with the new book I

2974
01:57:59,219 --> 01:58:03,779
should be able I should be submitting

2975
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:06,840
the manuscript around I'm thinking first

2976
01:58:03,779 --> 01:58:10,439
half of December okay so that should be

2977
01:58:06,840 --> 01:58:13,199
able to put it in print by the spring I

2978
01:58:10,439 --> 01:58:14,939
think that's awesome so that would be

2979
01:58:13,198 --> 01:58:17,638
super cool if you want to get copy that

2980
01:58:14,939 --> 01:58:19,079
I mean with this book I you know in the

2981
01:58:17,639 --> 01:58:21,659
first two books one of the first things

2982
01:58:19,079 --> 01:58:23,819
I start out by saying is this is not a

2983
01:58:21,658 --> 01:58:25,738
girl book this is not to teach you how

2984
01:58:23,819 --> 01:58:27,479
to grow weed yes yes right this is

2985
01:58:25,738 --> 01:58:29,218
assuming you already know how to grow

2986
01:58:27,479 --> 01:58:30,839
weed and you want to grow it all

2987
01:58:29,219 --> 01:58:33,719
naturally and you want to grow up better

2988
01:58:30,840 --> 01:58:37,020
yeah yeah so but now in this book

2989
01:58:33,719 --> 01:58:39,300
I was able to not only organize it

2990
01:58:37,020 --> 01:58:41,159
better so after you've read it

2991
01:58:39,300 --> 01:58:43,020
as you're growing you can go wait a

2992
01:58:41,158 --> 01:58:45,420
minute what was you can actually find

2993
01:58:43,020 --> 01:58:48,540
what you're looking for because I kept

2994
01:58:45,420 --> 01:58:50,880
it all very Iceland to Chapters now good

2995
01:58:48,539 --> 01:58:52,260
so you can go and look and reference it

2996
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:54,179
which is something the first two were

2997
01:58:52,260 --> 01:58:56,099
lacking because you know I'm kind of a

2998
01:58:54,179 --> 01:58:59,099
bozo I've never written a book before oh

2999
01:58:56,099 --> 01:59:01,440
it's hard man like whoa I can't even

3000
01:58:59,099 --> 01:59:02,880
imagine where you started but you think

3001
01:59:01,439 --> 01:59:05,399
it's going to be too you know together

3002
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:07,920
yeah and the saddest part the saddest

3003
01:59:05,399 --> 01:59:11,598
part is that the easiest part is

3004
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:14,940
actually writing the book yeah

3005
01:59:11,599 --> 01:59:17,219
billions and millions of times you have

3006
01:59:14,939 --> 01:59:19,919
to go back through it and rewrite

3007
01:59:17,219 --> 01:59:21,658
recheck update everything gets make sure

3008
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:24,480
everything's you know you on track

3009
01:59:21,658 --> 01:59:26,819
because with TLO I mean I'm learning

3010
01:59:24,479 --> 01:59:29,939
things new things a couple times a month

3011
01:59:26,819 --> 01:59:31,799
I learned whoa the new you know because

3012
01:59:29,939 --> 01:59:34,039
I try new stuff all the time well you're

3013
01:59:31,800 --> 01:59:37,679
a pioneer of TLO

3014
01:59:34,039 --> 01:59:39,359
yeah and so so you know I'll be in the

3015
01:59:37,679 --> 01:59:41,158
book like I was halfway through the book

3016
01:59:39,359 --> 01:59:45,960
and I discovered something and I was

3017
01:59:41,158 --> 01:59:48,238
like oh [ __ ] so that's like that huh I

3018
01:59:45,960 --> 01:59:50,939
go oh so now I have to go through the

3019
01:59:48,238 --> 01:59:53,638
whole book read it front to halfway and

3020
01:59:50,939 --> 01:59:56,098
correct every reference I've made that's

3021
01:59:53,639 --> 01:59:57,900
relative to that and any spin-off

3022
01:59:56,099 --> 02:00:01,440
references that are relative to that

3023
01:59:57,899 --> 02:00:03,539
yeah so it becomes a lot of tedious work

3024
02:00:01,439 --> 02:00:05,219
but now it's I'm in my favorite part now

3025
02:00:03,539 --> 02:00:07,198
I love this part this is the home run

3026
02:00:05,219 --> 02:00:08,819
right here this is this is where I'm

3027
02:00:07,198 --> 02:00:10,979
just rolling through it from front to

3028
02:00:08,819 --> 02:00:13,439
back I'm correct in punctuation adding

3029
02:00:10,979 --> 02:00:14,879
photos just making sure everything is

3030
02:00:13,439 --> 02:00:17,339
you know paragraphs are good my

3031
02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:20,099
Punctuation is good I've said clearly

3032
02:00:17,340 --> 02:00:22,079
what I want to say yada yada so this is

3033
02:00:20,099 --> 02:00:23,940
the fun times this is all fun work now

3034
02:00:22,079 --> 02:00:25,500
do you have to do all the formatting

3035
02:00:23,939 --> 02:00:27,419
when writing your books and like where

3036
02:00:25,500 --> 02:00:28,800
the pictures go and formatting of the

3037
02:00:27,420 --> 02:00:31,158
text and everything or does someone else

3038
02:00:28,800 --> 02:00:33,719
do that I give a general format location

3039
02:00:31,158 --> 02:00:35,098
excuse me like a lot of times you know

3040
02:00:33,719 --> 02:00:36,840
when I'm talking about something and I'm

3041
02:00:35,099 --> 02:00:39,480
showing a picture reference to it yeah

3042
02:00:36,840 --> 02:00:42,300
yeah in the manuscript I note the photo

3043
02:00:39,479 --> 02:00:44,759
at that point yeah you know so that they

3044
02:00:42,300 --> 02:00:47,760
know I want to be somewhere real close

3045
02:00:44,760 --> 02:00:49,500
to that statement gotcha okay so so yeah

3046
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:51,539
that works out good but they're they're

3047
02:00:49,500 --> 02:00:53,219
pretty good about just keeping it my way

3048
02:00:51,539 --> 02:00:55,319
you know they they try to work out

3049
02:00:53,219 --> 02:00:57,779
things what I do is I I give them like a

3050
02:00:55,319 --> 02:00:59,819
bunch of extra like bud shots that are

3051
02:00:57,779 --> 02:01:01,319
just I don't have any place for them I

3052
02:00:59,819 --> 02:01:03,479
just put them in an extra folder for

3053
02:01:01,319 --> 02:01:06,118
them and I go if you need to make space

3054
02:01:03,479 --> 02:01:07,859
to you know say so my paragraphs are

3055
02:01:06,118 --> 02:01:10,319
closer to my pictures I put in there

3056
02:01:07,859 --> 02:01:12,899
just use one of these bud shots to even

3057
02:01:10,319 --> 02:01:15,420
it all out you know yeah yeah yeah so so

3058
02:01:12,899 --> 02:01:17,098
that works out good for both of us shout

3059
02:01:15,420 --> 02:01:18,840
out to Green candy press they're they're

3078
02:01:54,539 --> 02:01:59,340
yeah I met them through you and when I

3079
02:01:57,840 --> 02:02:01,319
worked with them in the Cannabis indica

3080
02:01:59,340 --> 02:02:02,940
and sativa stuff they were fascinating I

3081
02:02:01,319 --> 02:02:04,679
mean they were just so kind and generous

3082
02:02:02,939 --> 02:02:06,000
and if I ever work with the book

3083
02:02:04,679 --> 02:02:07,679
publisher that's going to be the number

3084
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:09,238
one one I go through because it's just

3085
02:02:07,679 --> 02:02:12,060
they're they're great people so I wanted

3086
02:02:09,238 --> 02:02:13,799
to give them a plug super easy to work

3087
02:02:12,060 --> 02:02:15,719
with and you know like he knows that I

3088
02:02:13,800 --> 02:02:17,099
would uh I've been struggling with

3089
02:02:15,719 --> 02:02:19,739
trying to finish the book you know I

3090
02:02:17,099 --> 02:02:23,520
just got my last hit from coven not too

3091
02:02:19,738 --> 02:02:25,439
long ago and uh [ __ ] it spun me hard I

3092
02:02:23,520 --> 02:02:27,900
didn't even get I just got like flu from

3093

the first one you know but this one man

3094
02:02:27,899 --> 02:02:32,039
this last one and it gave me kind of

3095
02:02:29,639 --> 02:02:34,560
long covet I'm like extra fuzzy and

3096
02:02:32,039 --> 02:02:36,840
sleepy all right let's cover

3097
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:39,060
um let's go over the the website before

3098
02:02:36,840 --> 02:02:40,500
we're done kingdomorganicseats.com can

3099
02:02:39,060 --> 02:02:42,780
you talk about it

3100
02:02:40,500 --> 02:02:45,359
okay yeah so something when you go to

3101
02:02:42,779 --> 02:02:47,519
Kingdom organic seeds there's a wide

3102
02:02:45,359 --> 02:02:49,500
variety of stuff there right yeah we

3103
02:02:47,520 --> 02:02:52,139
read closely because you know I'm

3104
02:02:49,500 --> 02:02:54,539
telling you the real deal here uh when

3105
02:02:52,139 --> 02:02:56,460
you read this take them seriously it's

3106
02:02:54,539 --> 02:02:58,500
not just a bunch of [ __ ] I've written on

3107
02:02:56,460 --> 02:03:01,260
there to make it sound good yeah it's

3108
02:02:58,500 --> 02:03:03,899
just it's the real deal so when you get

3109
02:03:01,260 --> 02:03:06,119
to the site you'll notice that up on the

3110
02:03:03,899 --> 02:03:09,179
top bar there'll be the strains right

3111
02:03:06,118 --> 02:03:11,460
that's all the strains well right next

3112
02:03:09,179 --> 02:03:14,219
to that is a button called Gambler

3113
02:03:11,460 --> 02:03:17,399
section yeah in this section is where

3114
02:03:14,219 --> 02:03:20,219
you can get basically untestedish stuff

3115
02:03:17,399 --> 02:03:22,259
that I know because I'm familiar with

3116
02:03:20,219 --> 02:03:24,239
it's probably gonna work out I don't

3117
02:03:22,260 --> 02:03:26,039
think I've ever had a bad Gambler so far

3118
02:03:24,238 --> 02:03:28,738
and there's been a lot of them yeah so

3119
02:03:26,039 --> 02:03:30,599
so you can get really good deals on

3120
02:03:28,738 --> 02:03:32,759
stuff before I really know what it's

3121
02:03:30,599 --> 02:03:34,860
what it's about you know whether it's a

3122
02:03:32,760 --> 02:03:36,780
a full head or a Miss but there's

3123
02:03:34,859 --> 02:03:39,059
nothing bad on there and you can get

3124
02:03:36,779 --> 02:03:41,698
some really good stuff on there a lot of

3125
02:03:39,060 --> 02:03:44,219
people just exclusive possibly hunt that

3126
02:03:41,698 --> 02:03:46,198
zone to get stuff for a good deal before

3127
02:03:44,219 --> 02:03:48,118
it comes in at the real price later down

3128
02:03:46,198 --> 02:03:50,519
the road so make sure and check that out

3129
02:03:48,118 --> 02:03:52,198
I bet I mean the thing is a gambler

3130
02:03:50,520 --> 02:03:54,420
section the way you word it is going to

3131
02:03:52,198 --> 02:03:56,039
be totally different from like a person

3132
02:03:54,420 --> 02:03:57,960
getting their clone their first time

3133
02:03:56,039 --> 02:03:59,579
Crossing it not testing it releasing it

3134
02:03:57,960 --> 02:04:00,779
these are clones you've worked with for

3135
02:03:59,579 --> 02:04:02,698
a long time so you have a pretty good

3136
02:04:00,779 --> 02:04:04,920
idea with these lights these are ones I

3137
02:04:02,698 --> 02:04:07,319
have high confidence are going to be

3138
02:04:04,920 --> 02:04:10,440
great they're going to be fine they're

3139
02:04:07,319 --> 02:04:12,899
going to be excellent and I have like I

3140
02:04:10,439 --> 02:04:14,819
said I have I haven't thrown a dud into

3141
02:04:12,899 --> 02:04:17,879
the Gambler section yet and I've thrown

3142
02:04:14,819 --> 02:04:21,000
I don't know 30 yeah

3143
02:04:17,880 --> 02:04:23,579
that's killer so um are you gonna

3144
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:25,380
Venture into feminized seeds at all I

3145
02:04:23,579 --> 02:04:29,279
haven't asked you that let me see how do

3146
02:04:25,380 --> 02:04:31,039
I put this hell no oh no

3147
02:04:29,279 --> 02:04:34,380
no no no

3148
02:04:31,039 --> 02:04:38,399
hell hell no because

3149
02:04:34,380 --> 02:04:41,340
feminized seeds to me are sexually

3150
02:04:38,399 --> 02:04:45,138
unhealthy genetics there you go that's

3151
02:04:41,340 --> 02:04:49,260
that's all it's about to me and besides

3152
02:04:45,139 --> 02:04:52,199
Femme seeds are are bad because of their

3153
02:04:49,260 --> 02:04:54,780
sexual health to me yeah as a breeder

3154
02:04:52,198 --> 02:04:57,779
especially but I'm not a big fan of them

3155
02:04:54,779 --> 02:05:00,960
anyway they grow that's probably a

3156
02:04:57,779 --> 02:05:03,899
unfair bias because it was 15 or 20

3157
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:05,698
years ago when I grew up and they sucked

3158
02:05:03,899 --> 02:05:09,059
pretty bad yeah they did so they've come

3159
02:05:05,698 --> 02:05:10,979
a long ways now but the one thing that I

3160
02:05:09,060 --> 02:05:14,159
really don't like and I have never liked

3161
02:05:10,979 --> 02:05:16,559
are Auto flowers oh Jesus yeah it's just

3162
02:05:14,158 --> 02:05:18,299
it's you know why because no matter what

3163
02:05:16,560 --> 02:05:20,159
it is all the ones I've ever tried

3164
02:05:18,300 --> 02:05:23,219
anyway remember when I told you about

3165
02:05:20,158 --> 02:05:25,079
those six or seven week plants yeah yeah

3166
02:05:23,219 --> 02:05:28,260
yeah flower six they all have the same

3167
02:05:25,079 --> 02:05:31,139
high type yep all auto flowers I don't

3168
02:05:28,260 --> 02:05:34,139
care if it's Thai Autoflower it all has

3169
02:05:31,139 --> 02:05:36,300
that exact same high to it so I just

3170
02:05:34,139 --> 02:05:37,980
think those are a great option for

3171
02:05:36,300 --> 02:05:39,900
somebody who needs them and just needs

3172
02:05:37,979 --> 02:05:42,658
to grow a little weed I could totally

3173
02:05:39,899 --> 02:05:45,598
see it but as a breeder or a connoisseur

3174
02:05:42,658 --> 02:05:47,039
I poo poo those yeah for sure yeah you

3175
02:05:45,599 --> 02:05:48,420
know I remember Neville said the same

3176
02:05:47,039 --> 02:05:49,920
thing that he just couldn't do anything

3177
02:05:48,420 --> 02:05:52,260
good with ruderalis everything just

3178
02:05:49,920 --> 02:05:54,359
turned into [ __ ] and I found this I

3179
02:05:52,260 --> 02:05:55,679
don't want to see [ __ ] because it would

3180
02:05:54,359 --> 02:05:57,779
be offensive to the people whose stuff I

3181
02:05:55,679 --> 02:05:59,880
used but it wasn't as good as the stuff

3182
02:05:57,779 --> 02:06:03,000
I was able to do with regular photo

3183
02:05:59,880 --> 02:06:05,279
period lines it is always subpar yeah

3184
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:07,020
right it's always just below what it

3185
02:06:05,279 --> 02:06:09,840
should be it's like it reminds me of

3186
02:06:07,020 --> 02:06:12,060
back about a decade ago there was a

3187
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:14,340
bunch of sativa that was suddenly

3188
02:06:12,060 --> 02:06:17,039
released from Sweden or something right

3189
02:06:14,340 --> 02:06:19,079
yeah yeah it was uh Acapulco Gold and

3190
02:06:17,039 --> 02:06:21,960
all this stuff right I got a pack of

3191
02:06:19,079 --> 02:06:23,819
that right away yeah and I grew it and I

3192
02:06:21,960 --> 02:06:27,658
thought you know this stuff looks pretty

3193
02:06:23,819 --> 02:06:30,899
legit to me but it's all watered down

3194
02:06:27,658 --> 02:06:33,839
yeah right whoever made it either was

3195
02:06:30,899 --> 02:06:36,658
hideous at selecting lazy at selecting

3196
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:39,480
or just didn't care and just yeah

3197
02:06:36,658 --> 02:06:41,098
floured and bread whatever they grew you

3198
02:06:39,479 --> 02:06:43,979
know without really ever looking at it

3199
02:06:41,099 --> 02:06:45,900
because if you do it that way your resin

3200
02:06:43,979 --> 02:06:47,759
production will go down because you'll

3201
02:06:45,899 --> 02:06:50,399
be selecting for the strongest best

3202
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:53,039
plants and the two don't really mix

3203
02:06:50,399 --> 02:06:56,039
right you're right yeah seldom have a

3204
02:06:53,039 --> 02:06:58,439
super vigorous wickedly beast-like plant

3205
02:06:56,039 --> 02:07:00,899
that is also incredibly potent yeah

3206
02:06:58,439 --> 02:07:03,059
exactly right usually they're they're

3207
02:07:00,899 --> 02:07:05,039
the medium or you know they're very

3208
02:07:03,060 --> 02:07:07,619
vigorous very uh and they're very very

3209
02:07:05,039 --> 02:07:09,719
potent you know yeah it's that energy on

3210
02:07:07,618 --> 02:07:12,380
the other end of the scale I run across

3211
02:07:09,719 --> 02:07:15,380
plants fairly often that are

3212
02:07:12,380 --> 02:07:18,000
psychopotent insane resin production but

3213
02:07:15,380 --> 02:07:19,500
[ __ ] talk about hard to grow they have

3214
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:22,800
problems with everything just like with

3215
02:07:19,500 --> 02:07:26,219
anything people cows dogs you have you

3216
02:07:22,800 --> 02:07:27,719
have offspring that just suck yeah they

3217
02:07:26,219 --> 02:07:30,599
just they have problems you know

3218
02:07:27,719 --> 02:07:32,520
genetically heart defects nutrient

3219
02:07:30,599 --> 02:07:34,319
defects you know just the same with

3220
02:07:32,520 --> 02:07:36,360
plants you have individuals that just

3221
02:07:34,319 --> 02:07:38,698
never make the grade but a lot of times

3222
02:07:36,359 --> 02:07:40,618
those ones that [ __ ] them up are the

3223
02:07:38,698 --> 02:07:44,118
same ones that make them have massive

3224
02:07:40,618 --> 02:07:44,118
resin production yeah

3225
02:07:44,279 --> 02:07:49,439
well it's been an absolute pleasure

3226
02:07:47,340 --> 02:07:50,819
having you on here like I said you were

3227
02:07:49,439 --> 02:07:53,219
one of the people I looked up when I

3228
02:07:50,819 --> 02:07:56,099
looked up to when I got into this and I

3229
02:07:53,219 --> 02:07:57,899
still look up to and learn from you and

3230
02:07:56,099 --> 02:07:59,520
and it's an absolute privilege and a

3231
02:07:57,899 --> 02:08:01,799
pleasure to have you on I know people

3232
02:07:59,520 --> 02:08:03,659
will be begging to have you back and

3233
02:08:01,800 --> 02:08:04,920
again do we have the name of your new

3234
02:08:03,658 --> 02:08:06,598
book coming out and where it will be

3235
02:08:04,920 --> 02:08:09,300
available yeah it'll be true living

3236
02:08:06,599 --> 02:08:11,880
Organics it'll be the Druid guy the

3237
02:08:09,300 --> 02:08:13,739
Druid guy yeah it shows along with your

3238
02:08:11,880 --> 02:08:15,900
basic stuff like I said teaches you how

3239
02:08:13,738 --> 02:08:17,339
to grow in a lot more ways than the last

3240
02:08:15,899 --> 02:08:19,618
one did

3241
02:08:17,340 --> 02:08:22,980
it also shows

3242
02:08:19,618 --> 02:08:26,279
very high order High connoisseur High

3243
02:08:22,979 --> 02:08:28,019
Artisan value methods yeah ones that you

3244
02:08:26,279 --> 02:08:31,500
probably don't want to start out trying

3245
02:08:28,020 --> 02:08:33,659
to do to jump right into yeah basic the

3246
02:08:31,500 --> 02:08:36,060
basic lessons I show you in the book it

3247
02:08:33,658 --> 02:08:39,539
will come much easier like you said to

3248
02:08:36,060 --> 02:08:41,219
be a breeder isn't nearly as hard as you

3249
02:08:39,539 --> 02:08:43,198
think it's going to be reading about it

3250
02:08:41,219 --> 02:08:45,480
as when you actually get down and start

3251
02:08:43,198 --> 02:08:47,939
to do it you can actually you're like oh

3252
02:08:45,479 --> 02:08:49,979
that but you look at it on paper you're

3253
02:08:47,939 --> 02:08:52,319
like holy [ __ ] I'll never be able to do

3254
02:08:49,979 --> 02:08:55,019
this exactly yeah no you just got to

3255
02:08:52,319 --> 02:08:56,880
jump in and and learn and experience and

3256
02:08:55,020 --> 02:08:58,500
screw up and keep screwing up because

3257
02:08:56,880 --> 02:09:00,060
that's a lot of breeding is screw-ups

3258
02:08:58,500 --> 02:09:01,139
and if you're not screwing up then

3259
02:09:00,060 --> 02:09:03,900
you're not really breeding you're not

3260
02:09:01,139 --> 02:09:05,400
really doing real selections and then a

3261
02:09:03,899 --> 02:09:07,319
lot of people can't handle that they

3262
02:09:05,399 --> 02:09:10,738
screw up that they're human so they

3263
02:09:07,319 --> 02:09:12,118
blame the seeds or or the white or or

3264
02:09:10,738 --> 02:09:14,819
you know what they'll blame something

3265
02:09:12,118 --> 02:09:17,460
else anything yeah anything but them

3266
02:09:14,819 --> 02:09:20,039
right anything we've seen these emails

3267
02:09:17,460 --> 02:09:22,079
for years we know we're eye on the other

3268
02:09:20,039 --> 02:09:24,899
hand when I see something [ __ ] up I go

3269
02:09:22,079 --> 02:09:27,539
all right what have I done yeah yeah

3270
02:09:24,899 --> 02:09:30,179
that's my first instinct what have I

3271
02:09:27,539 --> 02:09:31,679
done yeah it's a different mindset it's

3272
02:09:30,179 --> 02:09:33,899
a different mindset well you learn

3273
02:09:31,679 --> 02:09:35,340
faster that way take example take

3274
02:09:33,899 --> 02:09:38,039
responsibility you're going to make

3275
02:09:35,340 --> 02:09:39,920
mistakes take responsibility and go how

3276
02:09:38,039 --> 02:09:42,658
can I not make this mistake again

3277
02:09:39,920 --> 02:09:44,579
exactly exactly that's what it's all

3278
02:09:42,658 --> 02:09:47,519
about these are the lessons from the

3279
02:09:44,579 --> 02:09:49,500
wise absolutely for sure if you want to

3280
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:52,199
learn faster and actually learn stuff

3281
02:09:49,500 --> 02:09:53,639
that's the way to go [ __ ] it up don't be

3282
02:09:52,198 --> 02:09:55,500
scared to [ __ ] up don't be scared to

3283
02:09:53,639 --> 02:09:57,300
[ __ ] it up take responsibility learn how

3284
02:09:55,500 --> 02:09:59,639
not to [ __ ] it up next time and don't

3285
02:09:57,300 --> 02:10:01,279
cross the streams and don't cross the

3286
02:09:59,639 --> 02:10:04,020
stream

3287
02:10:01,279 --> 02:10:06,000
this is advice from the Rev thank you
