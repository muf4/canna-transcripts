00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:48,839
quick. Hey, you sick [ __ ] It's me,

16
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:50,599

top. Be

18
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:57,039
quiet. We're looking for a super booth

19
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:59,519
today. We're going to do a review on it.

20
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:03,840
You may or may not like that, but it is

21
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,840
what it is. Michigan,

22
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:11,230
[Music]

23
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:18,649
[Music]

24
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:27,079
baby, fam.

25
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:33,359
Oh, I didn't even realize you guys were

26
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:34,799
there. You got me caught me off my game

27
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,840
and caught me off guard a little bit,

28
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,840
but uh I was just making sure his Mars

29
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,719
Mars hydro tent is going to hold up my

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,439
weight uh for my lights and stuff. So,

31
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:47,438
I'm, you know, close to 200 lb. So, I

32
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:49,279
figure if it can hold me up, it'll hold

33
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:52,000
up these lights. So, yeah, that's what

34
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,239
you saw there. Just uh quality control.

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,239
You know what I'm saying? QC QC. But

36
00:01:55,239 --> 00:02:00,319
anyways, thanks for coming back, hanging

37
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:03,759
out with me for a minute on my little

38
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:06,559
videos. Uh, it's sure does mean a lot to

39
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,399
me. It's It's been really cool. Uh, you

40
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,560
know, all the support and stuff. So, I

41
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,159
really appreciate it. That being said,

42
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,560
drop me a like and comment on this

43
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:18,079
video. A subscribe would be great. But

44
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,319
today, we got a couple things to do. I

45
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,800
know you're saying, "Super Boo, fam.

46
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:25,519
What the? I thought you smoke real weed,

47
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,599
Chucky." Well, we, you know, we going to

48
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,599
get to that, but I figure why not build

49
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,598
up the channel a little bit on the back

50
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:34,159
of some super boos, permanent markers,

51
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:35,839
things like this. And then when we get a

52
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:39,039
nice little audience built up, we'll

53
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:43,920
drop some good stuff like some Kim dog

54
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:46,719
baby, some OG, baby, some Haze, baby,

55
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:48,878
and some sour. We're working on it, fam.

56
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:51,039
But today, we we we working on some new

57
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:54,239
stuff. Like I been saying, I'm going to

58
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:56,079
get a tent set up for you guys. Got the

59
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,439
tent set up, or we're about to have the

60
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,760
tent set up, I should say. We're working

61
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:01,919
on it. We got a platform set up is what

62
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:04,318
I meant to say. So, we've been out

63
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:05,839
working hard. Not the not the best thing

64
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:07,759
in the world. I had a little guy on

65
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,080
Facebook talking about how he had some

66
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:12,479
4ft plastic pallets I was going to go

67
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,040
pick up. I had the money in hand, fam. I

68
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:17,119
was out recycling cans all weekend

69
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:18,959
trying to get this money for these

70
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,800
little pallets. and dude takes a week to

71
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,360
write me. And by the time he wrote me

72
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,280
back, I said, "Chuck dog, fam. I can't

73
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,200
I'm I got to go get it, fam. I got to

74
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,919
get after. I can't be waiting around for

75
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:33,280
you to message me back on Facebook." So,

76
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:36,318
I did some redneck ingenuity out here.

77
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,360
And we got got ourselves a little

78
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:41,359
dancing platform, aka a grow tent

79
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,879
platform. So, what I want to talk about

80
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,120
today is Super Booth. We're going to do

81
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:46,798
a review. I'm going to build this little

82
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,039
tent up here, little 8 by8. going to

83
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,840
work on that. Maybe do a little montage

84
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:54,239
or uh you know, what do you call it?

85
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,759
Like a time I don't know what you call

86
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,799
this. A little thing or word for I'm

87
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:00,479
bait y'all. Uh time lapse video. Might

88
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,000
do that. I don't really know yet. This

89
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:06,798
is before I go to edit anything. So, but

90
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,519
we going to build out the the the tent,

91
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,040
fam. We going to put the tent down and

92
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,560
we're going to work on that and then

93
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,959
we're going to do some trap stories.

94
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,439
Like I you guys love trap stories for

95
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,720
some reason. Uh, so we going to do some

96
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:20,719
trap stories. We're going to do the

97
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,800
super booth for review and we going to

98
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,040

in the past over the last few years.

115

Check those out. Uh, but anyways, that's

116
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,439

117
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,600
going to rock out. Go check out Matt

118
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:08,000
website as well. If you want some

119
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,479
blueberry turpps, I can't say what it is

120
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,120
on here cuz YouTube don't like it. But

121
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:16,639
we going to work on a tent. We gonna get

122
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,240
jacked up, jacked off. We gonna get

123
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,800
jiggy with it, fam. You know what I'm

124
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,280
saying? Get real jiggy with that [ __ ]

125
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,680
All right. Grow tip number one for

126
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:28,000
today's pretty easy. As soon as we're

127
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,280
kind of setting up a tent, we should

128
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,240
talk about tents. I feel like, right, so

129
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:36,399
Chuck Dog going to have to I'm I'm going

130
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,680
to be real with you guys. The the most

131
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:42,399
expensive tent I've ever bought was a AC

132
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,478
Infinity tent, right? They got the

133
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,079
better poles. They got a better

134
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:48,240
material. I think even a thicker

135
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,079
material supposedly. They got a pretty

136
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,079
good tint. There's better tents than

137
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:54,079
that at a higher price range, but I have

138
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:55,918
no experience with them. So, if there's

139
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:57,918
some better tints out there like Gorilla

140
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:59,758
tint or Gorilla Grow tents, whatever,

141
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:01,359
all that stuff. Uh, you know, drop them

142
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,759
in the comments for me. Let me know,

143
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,439
fam. I don't I don't know uh what a good

144
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,600
tint is. I know they make some taller

145
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:09,839
ones that make different styles, but for

146
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,919
me, I like to save a dollar or two cuz

147
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:14,560
I'm pretty cheap. I'm pretty hard on my

148
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:15,918
stuff. I got pets, things like that. I

149
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,280
keep them out of the garden most of the

150
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:18,560
time. I keep them out of the grow room

151
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:21,198
most of the time. But you never know

152
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,879
when a little uh zebra or little

153
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,800
crocodiles or whatever, you know, that

154
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:27,199
kind of thing. Uh come up out of the

155
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,960
swamp out back and and get up in the

156
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,800
grow tent and mess it up. So, you want

157
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:32,638
to make sure you're spending your money

158
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,759
wisely. you know, if you got a really

159
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,879
clean space, uh, that's, you know, you

160
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,080
don't have to worry about too many

161
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:42,560
problems like mold and and animals and

162
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:44,478
stuff like that. It's okay to get you a

163
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,000
better tent. Who am I? I'm not a

164
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:47,599
professional. Don't listen to me. I'm

165
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,519
just truck dog, fam. I'm just telling

166
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,600
you what I do. You know, you don't have

167
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:53,120
to do what I do. Uh, I'm not a

168
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,280
scientist. I'm not a professional. I'm

169
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,280
just a semi-professional amateur. So,

170
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:59,198
just follow along. I I basically throw

171
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:02,478
[ __ ] at a wall until something sticks,

172
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,720
fam. So we we we learn as we go. We make

173
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:06,719
mistakes, but hey, that's life. If you

174
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,800
don't fail in life, you never going to

175
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,240
grow. So if you never going to fail and

176
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,680
grow, you're never really going to grow,

177
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,960
fam. So that's what we're here today.

178
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,959
We're here to make mistakes. We're here

179
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:16,478
to make some wins, get some losses if we

180
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:19,279
have to. I don't really know, but we're

181
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:21,839
going to get it on the road. So, you

182
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:24,000
know, if you got the space, get a better

183
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,598
tent if you want to, but you don't have

184
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,918
to. You know, is that going to make you

185
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:30,000
a better grower? Uh, probably not. you

186
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:31,680
know, is it gonna, you know, at the end

187
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,319
of the day is it gonna last longer?

188
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,120
Maybe. It just depends on how you are,

189
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,800
you know, how hard you are, how many

190
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,399
runs you're doing, like whatever. You

191
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,680
know, you got to you got to plan for

192
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:43,279
that kind of stuff. So, if you're hard

193
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,959
on your stuff, I'd say just go with a

194
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:47,279
cheaper tent. You know, Mars Hydro makes

195
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:48,719
a good one. AC's a little bit better uh

196
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:49,918
quality, you know, but you're going to

197
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,199
pay a little bit more for them,

198
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:52,478
especially as you get into the bigger

199
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,800
tents. I mean, they're always going to

200
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:57,279
be more expensive. I think this is a 8

201
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,000
by8 from Mars Hydro. was like with the

202
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:02,559
code and on sale I think it was like 260

203
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,079
bucks versus AC Infinity there are 10

204
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,959
x10s basically like $450 with a code or

205
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:10,560
or 500 bucks. They do got better poles

206
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,918
but you know you you saving a buck you

207
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,439
going you going to give and take a

208
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:15,279
little bit. So like at the end of the

209
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:16,639
day I've been using Mars Hydro tents

210
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:19,198
basically since I've been growing. I've

211
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,879
tried Vivio Sun. I've tried AC Infinity

212
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,038
all the cheap little brands you know

213
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,439
stuff like that. And really the the Mars

214
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:27,038
Hydro of recent years have really

215
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:29,279
treated me well. So that's kind of just

216
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:31,598
what I'll rock with. You know, it works

217
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:33,918
for me, especially something to think

218
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:35,838
about is if you're going to be getting a

219
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:37,038
tent or a brand of tent, make sure you

220
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,039
pick the right one you want to rock

221
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:40,799
with. Cuz as your tents kind of fall

222
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:42,718
apart or if you're hard on your tents

223
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,000
like me, getting jiggy with it up in

224
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,920
there in the tents, you know what I'm

225
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,759
saying? Using it like a freaking strip

226
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:49,439
club, I don't really know. You might

227
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:50,879
break your poles. You might lose a pole.

228
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,959
They might rust out on you, [ __ ] like

229
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:54,799
that. So, it's cool to have the same

230
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,879
brand so you can kind of like hodge

231
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:58,958
podge [ __ ] together. Take a pole from

232
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:00,559
here or there or as your tent degrades,

233
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:03,679
you can even use the poles for other

234
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:04,958
stuff to hang your weeds to dry to hang

235
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:06,879
another light if you're just trying to

236
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,239
have a veg, you know, cuz sometimes

237
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:10,240
y'all know how it is. That's why we're

238
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,959
here today cuz we're talking about

239
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,799
tents, row spaces, bigger spaces, cuz

240
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:17,838
what what I'm trying to get with all

241
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:19,838
this y'all is you want to make sure

242
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,160
you're planning [ __ ] out a little bit.

243
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,920
You don't just be free willying it and

244
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:27,120
pulling everything out and stroking to

245
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:28,958
everything on eBay and Amazon's and uh

246
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,799
whatever website y'all are using to

247
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:32,879
order your grow stuff. Make sure you

248
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:35,919
think ahead. If you got space, please,

249
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:38,720
for the love of God, if you're getting

250
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:41,278
uh into growing, if you got the space,

251
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,440
get the biggest tent you can get, fam.

252
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:45,679
Uh it's going to save you a lot of time.

253
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,600
It's going to save you a lot of zippers

254
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:49,759
and all this other stuff. Do it how you

255
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,360
want. I mean, guy, if I had a room,

256
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:53,120
rooms, sealed good rooms, I'd probably

257
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,879
be rocking with rooms. Tents are great

258
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,240
because you can isolate stuff. You can

259
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:58,240
really control your environment in

260
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,600
there. You can really use them uh for

261
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,680
breeding, controlling pollen

262
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,159
contamination. So, tents are great. Uh

263
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:06,079
but I've been using 4x4s and 5x5s for a

264
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,759
while and and smaller. So, I'm kind of

265
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,680
burned out on and open all these little

266
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:10,720
tents and things like that. So, I've

267
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:12,159
been wanting to switch to bigger

268
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,959
platforms. So, I thought maybe I'll

269
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:16,639
switch over to an 8 by8 or 10x10. I'd go

270
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,319
bigger, fam. They make bigger tents out

271
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:22,078
there. They really do. but they're like

272
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,079
$700 to $2,000 to 3,000, bro. And I

273
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:26,719
ain't trying to pay that. So, at the end

274
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:28,719
of the day, go with whatever you want.

275
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,200
But I'll just speak from, you know, some

276
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,200
of the lower tier tents. They all work,

277
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,640
fam. You going to get buds from all of

278
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,560
them. A tent ain't going to make you a

279
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:38,639
better grower. Uh it's just going to

280
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:40,399
make you a better shower. I don't know,

281
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:42,319
you know. So, pick it whatever you want.

282
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,240
For me, like I said, I'd rock with uh if

283
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,278
you got the money, get a AC infinity. if

284
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,278
you if you don't uh get you L Mars or or

285
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:51,519
whatever. I think even Spider Farmer and

286
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:54,159
Vizio Sun stuff like that, they got

287
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,320
pretty comparable prices and and pretty

288
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:58,000
uh comparable tents as well, you know. I

289
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,760
think Vivo Sun's even got some nice

290
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,078
tents nowadays. I'm not sure. I haven't

291
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,838
bought any for a couple years, but from

292
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,759
what I looked online, they look look

293
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,360
like they improving a little bit. I

294
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:08,639
don't know. Tell me what y'all rock with

295
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,560
in I know there's better brands out

296
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:12,078
there. No [ __ ] But tell me what they

297
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:13,518
are and tell me what y'all rock with.

298
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:15,199
Tell me what's a good tint. Maybe one

299
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,120
day when Chuck Dog hit the lottery, fam

300
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,040
up at the gas station, I'll get me some

301
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,879
nice tents. But for right now, I'm going

302
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:22,719
to rock out with the Mars Hydros cuz

303
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,399
they're just kind of cheap. They work.

304
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,160
Uh and I ain't had no problems. I mean,

305
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:30,320
I I literally got uh five, six, seven

306
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:32,879
4x4s over the last couple years from

307
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,040
them and and some 5x5s and I ain't had

308
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:36,958
no problems with them. They're great on

309
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,240
all around. Uh but at the end of the

310
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,599
day, you know, when you're when you're

311
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,399
starting off growing, you really want to

312
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,079
plan ahead. Get you a big space. I was

313
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,600
saying before, if you got the space, get

314
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:48,239
it. Cuz number one problem growing,

315
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,720
sorry my nuts. Number one problem with

316
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,519
growing, fam, is you never have enough

317
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:57,600
space. So why even waste the time buying

318
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:59,440
4 in fans and [ __ ] 4 in in lines and

319
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,040
all this [ __ ] when you just if you got

320
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,640
if you can afford it and you got the

321
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:04,958
space, go with something a little bit

322
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,720
bigger. That way you just always got it.

323
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:09,439
You can always get other little tents

324
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,839
and [ __ ] but try to maximize your

325
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,320
space, you know? Uh, but that being

326
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,920
said, do what you want. Uh, so I'm gonna

327
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,760
get to rocking on putting this tent

328
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:19,278
together. I appreciate the support. Drop

329
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:20,559
me some comments and stuff in there.

330
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:21,679
We're going to be bouncing around. Like

331
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:24,078
I said, we're going to be doing this

332
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:26,000
little review here in just a second or

333
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:27,838
two. Or maybe we've already done it. I

334
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,440
don't really know. Heck, we maybe we'll

335
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,120
put it after this. This a good intro,

336
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,480
right? I don't know. We're going to try.

337
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,399
I appreciate all the likes, the

338
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,000
comments, the support. All to all the

339
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,679
couple little haters out there. I

340
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,320

341
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:42,000

342

343
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,519
and [ __ ] you, you know, you take your

344
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,799
time out. So, I appreciate y'all. I

345
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,720
appreciate everybody else, too, that

346
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,240

347
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,639
day in your life to check out a little

348
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,000
video by by Matt or myself. It really

349
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,360
does mean a lot. We're going to rock

350
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,720
out, fam. We going to bring people

351
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,720
together. We going to get some

352
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,879
positivity, but we also going to have

353
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,480
some fun doing doing it as well. And we

354
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:04,639
ain't going to take no [ __ ] while we

355
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,320
doing it. So, fam, I appreciate y'all.

356
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,680
Shout out Kentucky. Shout out Michigan

357
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,040
and everybody else out there in the

358
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:11,838
world. Y'all know I rocking out with

359
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:13,759
y'all down in Australia as well. So, I

360
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,760
don't know. My cat's meowing. I'm going

361
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:17,439
jump around, get to this uh review.

362
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:22,639
We'll get to the stories. I'm doing it

363
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:26,440
for Kim Dog, man. To beat Chuck Dog,

364
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:30,000
it's a lie. It's a lifestyle, but I love

365
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:32,800
it. Ain't nobody going to stop me. I'm

366
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,879
going straight to the top. I'm on my

367
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:38,199
janitor [ __ ] Yo, go get the

368
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:40,159
mop. I'm doing my

369
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,399
push-ups. I'm getting all this

370
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:45,519
knowledge. I'm learning everything I

371
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:48,320
need to learn, fam. I'm going in for you

372
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:51,919
guys. Hell, I'm going in for my

373
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:55,000
[ __ ] self. You can do it. I can

374
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:58,159
do it. We can do this [ __ ] together,

375
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,120
fam. Hell a tight. What? You thought I

376
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:03,519
forgot about you organic bros out there?

377
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,440
Hell no. We doing some fermentation and

378
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,399
getting some brewing going on. Check

379
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,560
this out. Straight from the

380
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:14,078
penis. All right, fam. Got the frame all

381
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:16,239
set up. Got the the roof pieces on.

382
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:18,638
Ain't really a how-to video. Just kind

383
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,159
of me setting stuff up so you guys can

384
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,919
kind of follow along like I've been

385
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:25,919
saying this whole damn time. So, uh, you

386
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:29,439
know, and I got to be I got to make my

387
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:31,198
[ __ ] clear cuz, uh, I thought these

388
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,399
poles were going to be thicker, fam, but

389
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:34,319
they ain't. They're the same as the

390
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,799
normal ones. I must have got them mixed

391
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,160
up with Vivo Suns. I think some one of

392
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,719
them companies got a little bit thicker

393
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:42,639
of a a pole, but I know AC Infinity

394
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,240
does, but I thought these were going to

395
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,560
be the thick ones, but they're not. But

396
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:50,159
that's fine cuz we got replacements. all

397
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:51,919
of our 4x4s and 5x5s on on the same

398
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:54,879
little system or platform, whatever you

399
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:56,639
want to call it, same size uh stuff. So,

400
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:59,838
you know, we can kind of hodge podge

401
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:03,440
like we were saying earlier. But yeah,

402
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,600
looks pretty good, fam. Kind of a lot

403
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,399
more space than your boy's used to in

404
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,000
this one one little given area. I think

405
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,198
we going to fit on the platform just

406
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,039
right, fam. Damn, look at that. That's

407
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:17,359
looking good.

408
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,120
I clean up in here a little bit and then

409
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,278
we

410
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,759
going rock

411
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:26,559
out. You know, growing tips wise for

412
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:30,078
today, y'all. You know, if I had to give

413
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:32,638
you a good growing tip is never think

414
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:34,239
you know everything. Don't get set in

415
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,560
your ways cuz you can always learn

416
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,720
something new. Uh you know, is there

417
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:40,399
something new you learned recently? If

418
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,920
you if so, let me know in the comment

419
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,720
section. Bro, I'm I'm trying to learn

420
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:48,240
everything I can. I'm not very smart,

421
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:51,040
man. But I do know what good weed is.

422
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,480
So, I'm trying to work on that. Uh,

423
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,240
we're going to get this channel popping,

424
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,639
fam. Like I said, I got video cameras

425
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,198
and stuff on the way, but Amazon super

426
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,799
slow. You know what I'm saying, Jay? So,

427
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:02,078
that is what it is. I'm about to start

428
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,159
trying to see if I can do some pull-ups

429
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:06,559
on this. Man, I kind of want to see if I

430
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:08,480
hang on this sucker for real, fam. I

431
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:11,359
better not, though. They said it was

432
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,278
like I forget how how much weight, but I

433
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,639
don't know, bro. But another thing too

434
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:18,000
is if you get mixed up,

435
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:20,639
fam, make sure you save the little

436
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,360
little grow booklet that they send with

437
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,759
you sending with you with the tent. And

438
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,399
then you go in the back, fam. I think

439
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,000
it's the last page. And you just follow

440
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,240
this little diagram here. It's pretty

441
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,919
easy. I never set one of these up, so it

442
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,759
got me a little screwed up here in the

443
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:36,439
middle. I never really set one up that

444
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,560
has

445
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:43,440
a middle pole like this, but it is what

446
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:44,958
it is. I'm cool with it. It'll give me

447
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,040
something to hang my [ __ ] from. You know

448
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:49,278
what I'm saying, fam? And if my my

449
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:52,278
[ __ ] grow don't good go that good,

450
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:55,120
maybe I put myself up there like

451
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:56,720
freaking, you know, I don't know. Better

452
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,959
not say too much on YouTube. I get

453
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,240
screwed up. You know, YouTube don't like

454
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:04,798
us very much. But man, I think it's

455
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,279
going to be cool, fam. What y'all think?

456
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:09,119
I need to do

457
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:12,240
some thinking here. And I'm going to put

458
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,239
this cover on.

459
00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:15,639
[Music]

460
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,439
Putting the final touches on it. Just

461
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,640
zipping her up. Did it by myself just to

462
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:34,480
prove you can do

463
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:37,759
it. Got her done y'all. Got the 8 by8 up

464
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:40,319
ready to rock [ __ ] strong. I even left a

465
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:43,038
few glory hole ports open to accommodate

466
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:46,439
Denali cuz I know he's giant and his

467
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:50,400
penis. I mean, so pretty

468
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:52,400
cool. Got her all set up, fam. Little

469
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,759
tip or advice, leave the ceiling pieces

470
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,160
off till the end. I'm about to stick

471
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:57,839
those back on. Also, make sure you get

472
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,080
all your zippers undone on this thing

473
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:02,959
before you try to put it on. It's hella

474
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:05,918
confusing by yourself, but if Chuck Dog

475
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,000
can do it by himself, you guys can do it

476
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,400
by myself. You will need a little bit of

477
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,319
upper body strength. So, if you got any

478
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,679
kind of medical issues or disabilities,

479
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:16,240
you probably going to need some help on

480
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,160
this one for real. Uh, but other than

481
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,038
that, we're pretty much ready to rock,

482
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,720
y'all. We got her done. Got her ready to

483
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:25,919
rock. You got to get the lights in here.

484
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,400
All that [ __ ] fam. We popping popping

485
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,799
popping our [ __ ] fam. That shit's

486
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,919
[ __ ] cool, bro. Look at that, man. We

487
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:36,558
can run around in that

488
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:38,640
[ __ ] She Hell yeah. I like that, boy.

489
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:40,079
We can live in this. We going We might

490
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,200
just have to start doing a little

491
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:44,720
podcast in here, bro. Goddamn. Anyways,

492
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,558
let's jump over to another little

493
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,319
segment and we'll keep rocking. We going

494
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:50,240
We'll come back on this one on the next

495
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:51,759
episode. We'll put the lights and stuff

496
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,519
up like that. Just want to kind of put

497
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:54,879
the tent together. You know, your

498
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:56,400
environment is going to be your most

499
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,840
important thing. So, make sure you get

500
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,320
it right the first time so you don't got

501
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:02,639
to [ __ ] with it again. And always get

502
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:04,399
bigger than you can uh you know, maybe

503
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,640
not afford, but just get bigger than you

504
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,840
can uh imagine you going to go cuz

505
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,480
you're always going to need more space

506
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:10,480
when you're trying to

507
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:21,360
grow. Hey, you sick [ __ ] It's me,

508
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:22,119
Chuck, the strain hunter.

509
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:25,079
Be

510
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:28,558
quiet. We're looking for a super booth

511
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:31,038
today. We're going to do a review on it.

512
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:35,359
You may or may not like that, but it is

513
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:35,359
what it is. Michigan,

514
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:42,000
baby. What up, fam? Got some Super Boof

515
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:44,079
with me. About to try it out. Going to

516
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,240
roll something up of it real quick. See

517
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:48,000
if we like it. You know, it's a pretty

518
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,038
popular strain here in Michigan. at

519
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,640
least the part that I am in right now.

520
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:54,720
Uh, you know, some people say it's not

521
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,200
that big of a deal anymore. Whatever. It

522
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,839
is what it is. All I'm saying it's

523
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,080
pretty uh popular in the stores that I

524
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:03,839
go to. I see it all the time. So, I

525
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:05,918
figure I'll pick something up and check

526
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:08,000
it out today with you guys. You know,

527
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,679
we're waiting on harvest. I know you

528
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,919
guys want to see something other than

529
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,519
these wreck weeds and stuff like that.

530
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,759
We're working on it. We're working on

531
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:17,200
it. Trust me. We got some stuff in the

532
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:19,440
works. You know, I'd like to do some of

533
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,440
these strain reviews with a co-host or

534
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,600
something like that or we both can try

535
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,080
it out together and kind of, you know,

536
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:28,000
have a conversation about the strain and

537
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:30,158
kind of go back and forth cuz, you know,

538
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,599
it kind of sucks just having one person,

539
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,840
especially when you guys can't really

540
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:35,678
enjoy it with me or hate it with me. I

541
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:37,439
guess I should say, it'd be kind of cool

542
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,880
to have somebody to have a conversation

543
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,400
about with. So, we're going to plan on

544
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,400
that here soon. We're working on a

545
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,720
harvest and stuff like that. We just got

546
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,400
the grow tent set up. So, I mean, we're

547
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,240
about to rock out. We're about to do

548
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,240
some grow videos. We're working on

549
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,519
sponsorships. We're working on all that

550
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,679
good stuff. Uh, you know, so tune in,

551
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,279
like, subscribe. It helps a lot. But

552
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,280
today, we're going to jump into Super

553
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:01,759
Booth. And I wrote it down this time.

554
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:03,839
Black cherry punch times Tropicana

555
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:06,000
cookies, you know. I'm not sure if

556
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:07,519
that's the actual cross or whatever the

557
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,519
genetics. So, please tell me in the

558
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:11,440
comment section down below if I got it

559
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:13,359
wrong so we can get it right. I'm just

560
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,038
going I don't really I'm not a modern

561
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:17,038
genetic dude. I don't know a lot about

562
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:18,640
modern stuff. I just moved to Michigan

563
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:21,119
about a year ago. So, I'm just trying

564
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,640
stuff out, checking the checking out the

565
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:24,959
market, doing different stuff while I'm

566
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,280
waiting on a harvest. It is what it is,

567
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,960
fam. But today, like I said, we got the

568
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:30,558
super booth. We going to crack it open.

569
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,079
Some people I've seen in the Discord,

570
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:35,119
they don't like super booth. They say

571
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:37,199
that sucks. I don't like citrus turpps.

572
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:39,359
I don't like super booth. That stuff's

573
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,000
poo poo. I'd rather have permanent

574
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:43,759
markers, things like that, you know. Uh

575
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,839
but that being said, we're going to

576
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:48,480
crack this open. See what see what we

577
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:50,480
see what we get from it, you know. Uh

578
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,919
another cookies crossed, so not too much

579
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,919
to be expected,

580
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,360
but damn,

581
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:03,240
fam. This reminds me of I don't know if

582
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:06,558
you guys have ever grown

583
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:08,240
uh forbidden fruit punch from CSI. One

584
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:09,918
of the homies from the Discord has grown

585
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,079
that out and I got to take some home and

586
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,799
smoke on it a little bit and got to

587
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:16,399
smoke on it for a few

588
00:22:13,798 --> 00:22:19,720
days. It smells damn near like that,

589
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:24,440
man. Kind of

590
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:27,679
citrusy cherry kind of

591
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:30,640
tropical maybe. Yeah, citrusy lemon kind

592
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:33,120
of smell, man. Not real uh a bunch of

593
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:35,038
either or just light kind of smells, but

594
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:37,519
real refreshing kind of smelling, bro.

595
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:39,279
like a high sea or something like that.

596
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:40,879
You know, as far as the nugs are

597
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:42,158
concerned, I can't show them off. We're

598
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,440
working on that, y'all, for doing

599
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,799
something on a different channel or

600
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,000
something like that on get some in

601
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:51,480
trouble. But, you know, as far as the

602
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:54,240
nugs, real nice uh not super dense

603
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,319
nugs. Real frosty. Got little specks of

604
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,200
purples and stuff in the inside. Not a

605
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:00,720
whole lot though. And smells pretty

606
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,159
good, man. I'm going to have to try some

607
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,400
out real quick. Sorry, I'm jumping off

608
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,840
camera. Got to roll some up. I know I

609
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,440
should probably have them already rolled

610
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:08,720
up, but I like rolling up with you guys.

611
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,320
Like we kicking in the garage or

612
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,240
something or in the grow tent, whatever,

613
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:14,798
you know? I hope that's okay. I do

614
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,960
appreciate all you guys stopping in,

615
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:19,038
comment, liking, subscribing, stuff like

616
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:23,120
that. While I got you here, go check out

617
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:25,359
the Goat Farm, aka Pac Seeds. Uh, you

618
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:27,519
know, go go pick up a a hat if you need

619
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:29,359

620
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:31,839

hats. Just saying. and go pick up some

622
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:36,639
pocket merch. While we rolling this up,

623
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,440
I figure I might as well go ahead and

624
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,280
tell y'all a

625
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,679
little little thing. Uh, we're working

626
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:45,000
on the AC

627
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:46,880

628

sponsorships. So, here pretty soon

629

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,200

guys out with uh, you know, like the

632
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,080
little codes, discount codes and stuff

633
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,080
like that. But we get demonetized every

634
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:02,399
time we're turn turning around and we're

635
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:04,558
getting screwed with by YouTube and

636
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,159
stuff. So that's probably the route that

637
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:08,558
we're going to be taking. You know,

638
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,559
Matt's done put me in charge of it. And

639
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:12,240
uh me and Matt going to go hard and we

640
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:15,678
going to do what we got to do. Hopefully

641
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:18,159
we land the the uh uh AC Infinity

642
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,840
sponsorships. If we don't, we don't. Uh

643
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:22,480
it'd be cool. Partnerships, I should

644
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:26,240
say. That'd be pretty neat. If not, it

645
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:28,480
is what it is. Uh, but I will have a

646
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,880
little Mars code for you guys. It's like

647
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,798
3% off. And then at the down in the

648
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,039
bottom of the video, uh, there's going

649
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:36,720
to be affiliate code for Mars Hydro. So,

650
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:40,558
if you guys buy some stuff from Mars

651
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:42,880
Hydro, me and Matt get 5%. So, uh, go

652
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:44,158
ahead and click that little uh, link

653
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,200
down there and that'll get you where you

654
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,880
need to go if you're buying something

655
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,038
from them. And like I said, we're

656
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,320
working on the AC Infinity one and then

657
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:52,319
we're going to work on some other stuff.

658
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:54,079
try to get some get if there's anybody

659
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:55,839
out there wants to sponsor a homie with

660
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:58,240
some nutrients. Let's get it popping,

661
00:24:55,839 --> 00:25:00,158
fam. But other than that, let's get back

662
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,759
to the super booth. Just want to give

663
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,120
y'all a quick little update. Let y'all

664
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:04,879
know that I'm rocking out for y'all.

665
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:06,319
We're trying to get stuff going. We're

666
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,760
trying to improve the show. We're trying

667
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:09,678
to improve the channel. We're trying to

668
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:11,200
improve y'all's entertainment. We're

669
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,798
trying to improve everything about the

670
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,558
show, make it more fun. Like I said,

671
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:17,278
from day one, I'm not here to take over.

672
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:19,599
I'm here just to have some fun and

673
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:21,440
really boost the channel and and and

674
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:22,959
just contribute the best way that I can

675
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,320
and this is the best way I know how to

676
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:28,000
do it. Back to the super booth. I don't

677
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:30,480
know if the genetics are correct,

678
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,640
obviously. Uh who the [ __ ] am I? I'm

679
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,159
just a dude that likes to grow weed and

680
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,759
get high. I'm not a scientist.

681
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,120
Everything I say is you need to take

682
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:39,200
with a grain of salt. I don't really

683
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:40,959
know much. I'm just telling y'all what

684
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,558
I'm going through. I'm telling y'all

685
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,480
what I'm learning. I'm telling y'all my

686
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:46,158
failure. So, at the end of the day,

687
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,679
don't take my advice. Go out there and

688
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,440
do your own research. Go out there and

689
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,600
grind it out yourself and and figure

690
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,960
everything out, you know. Uh, but that

691
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:56,798
being said, they, you know, uh, the

692
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,558
Forbidden Fruit Punch pretty close to

693
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:00,119
this. So, if you ever smoked that,

694
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:02,319
pretty much the same

695
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:04,959
deal. One of the dudes in the Discord

696
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:07,439
got a really nice expression of it and

697
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,960
pretty much tastes just like this. I'd

698
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,600
say the structure is obviously

699
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,120
different, but smells and tastes just

700
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:16,879
like this. This is a real refreshing

701
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:19,199
weed when you smoke it. I will say if

702
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,320
you're a real time big time toer, I

703
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,558
don't know if you're going to get super

704
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:25,240
ripped off this all the time obviously.

705
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:27,759
But if you do enjoy some good

706
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:30,519
flavor or if you enjoy that kind of

707
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:33,158
citrusy kind of tropically

708
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:35,839
vibe, this probably going to be for you,

709
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:37,840
fam. I mean that I think it was like 20

710
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:40,240
bucks for the eighth which I'm not a big

711
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:43,158
eighth guy obviously but we going to try

712
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:46,159
stuff out for you guys on the

713
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:49,120
channel. Remind you like some Sunny D or

714
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,120
High Sea or something

715
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:56,558
bro. You know I will say if you don't

716
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,159
smoke uh that often this will probably

717
00:26:56,558 --> 00:27:00,678
rip your head off if you smoke like once

718
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:04,240
a day or something. I don't really

719
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:05,600
know. I smoke pretty much all day. So,

720
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,519
you know, take that with a grain of

721
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:09,038
salt. This might rip your head off. I'm

722
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:11,278
not saying this is bunk. I love the

723
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:12,960
flavor. It's got pretty decent high on

724
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:16,640
it, but it's probably not for me. I'm a

725
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:19,038
more of a OG Kim uh sour uh kind of

726
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,038
dude, you know, bubbish stuff like that.

727
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:22,319
I like some funky runchy turpps. Y'all

728
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:24,960
know me. I want something that smells

729
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:26,319
like tuna, tuna fish, some [ __ ] like

730
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,600
that. I want something that smells

731
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:34,000
freaking funky, bro. rotten, savory,

732
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:35,918
meaty, uh, oniony, garlicky, sulfury,

733
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,079
bro. I don't know. Whatever. I just want

734
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,278
some funky, funky in the booty ho type

735
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:42,399
[ __ ] This is all right, though, for

736
00:27:40,278 --> 00:27:44,079
real. Y'all going to hate me for the

737
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,840
saying this, but I'd rather have this

738
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:48,000
than the permanent marker I had last

739
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:51,278
episode. I know people like permanent

740
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,398
marker, but I mean, for me, permanent

741
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:56,200
marker is just kind of boring, bro. Uh

742
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:58,479
the flavor is kind of

743
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:01,038
predictable. You know, the sherbet

744
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,599
flavor, whatever. I don't know, man.

745
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:06,158
It's never really been for me. I I would

746
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:07,839
actually, you know, if I had to choose

747
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,600
between the two, which one I would take

748
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:10,558
just to smoke like once or twice a week

749
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:12,480
or something like that, I'm probably

750
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:13,599
going to take the super boob. I But I

751
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,440
think most people out there would

752
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:17,199
probably take the permanent marker. But

753
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,038
I think I like this just because it's

754
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,519
different from [ __ ] I normally grow.

755
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:24,000
Like I said, it is nice to smoke every

756
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:25,759
once in a while. Um, they do have a cut

757
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,000
floating around here. They do sell cuts

758
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:30,158
of it. I've never bought a cut of it. I

759
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,759
don't really care to have a cut of it.

760
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,200
You know, if somebody was going to give

761
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:35,519
me one or something, maybe I'd take one

762
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,360
in. But pro probably not for real, fam.

763
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:39,119
Just cuz at the end of the day, I'm not

764
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:41,278
trying to pay for some cuts, especially

765
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:42,959
some modern stuff like that. But it is

766
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:45,679
cool, man. It is cool to check out, you

767
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:48,240
know. Flavor, I'd give it a [ __ ]

768
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:50,240
seven out of 10. Smell, I'd give it a

769
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:54,278
seven out of 10. high. I'd probably give

770
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:57,200
it like a six out of 10.

771
00:28:54,278 --> 00:29:00,200
Uh, but I mean, if you like citrusy

772
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:03,038
orange weed, I wouldn't say this is like

773
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:05,278
oranges like citrusy as like maybe like

774
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:07,359
clementine or something like that. But

775
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:09,119
it does to me have that, you know, you

776
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:10,158
got everybody tastes weed and stuff

777
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:12,079
differently, especially you smoke

778
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:14,159
cigarettes, especially depend how you

779
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:18,079
smoking the weed itself, [ __ ] like that.

780
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:20,080
So, you know, I don't know. I think I I

781
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:22,079
mean so I I probably would pick up a

782
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:22,960
pack of pack of these or a cross or

783
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:25,119
something. I don't know if I care about

784
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,038
the cut so much, but trying to find

785
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:28,639
something like this to maybe work into a

786
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:30,558
cross or something's kind of cool. Like

787
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,520
I said, I've never been a big tangi guy

788
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:35,440
or big

789
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:37,200
um Crockett genetics kind of person or

790
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,720
whatever. You know, I never really uh I

791
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,720
do have some of their genetics and

792
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,798
things like that, but I don't uh I'm not

793
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,558
like a big fan or I just have gotten

794
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:47,278
free packs and or whatever over the

795
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:48,960
years. Uh but yeah, I mean uh that being

796
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:50,839
said, the Super Bowl's kind of all right

797
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:54,240
for real,

798
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:56,000
fam. You know, this be a good some good

799
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,679
weed. Like, you come up here and you

800
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,960
ain't been smoke. You you ain't trying

801
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,120
to get super ripped. You trying to go

802
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,038
out and smoke some weed on the on the

803
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:04,959
lake and do some fishing and stuff like

804
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:06,319
this or you know, some chick weed. You

805
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,759
know, your wife, she wants to smoke but

806
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:10,240
don't want to get super ripped off with

807
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:11,759
some flavorful [ __ ] I could see like my

808
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,319
old lady really liking this kind of

809
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:16,720
weed. But yeah, man. It's It's not even

810
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:18,720
bad for the price point. You know, it

811
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,240
cured pretty good. I'm not gonna say

812
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,278
what brand it is and stuff like that

813
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,798
because I'm not really trying to put

814
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:24,720
people on like that unless they're gonna

815
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:26,639
be cutting us a check or something, fam.

816
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,880
Me and Matt got to get paid or get some

817
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,640
kind of sponsorship or something, fam.

818
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,440
Cuz we're putting a lot of work into

819
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,679
this and we can't ever get uh any kind

820
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,840
of revenue ad monetization or anything

821
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,519
like that just because we're making weed

822
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:41,038
content. So, we are going to try to

823
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:42,639
implement some codes and stuff like

824
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:44,319
that, you know, and try to show off some

825
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,559
products, do some of that. We're going

826
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:48,079
to mainly do that on my own time. We're

827
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:49,599
not going to incorporate that into the

828
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:51,839
main show so much so we can keep that

829
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:54,639
kind of pure and focus on history and

830
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:56,798
breeding and stuff like that. But that

831
00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:00,080
being said, if you want some orangey

832
00:30:56,798 --> 00:31:01,679
kind of citr tropical vibes and you

833
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:03,918
don't want to buy no [ __ ] permanent

834
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,200
markers, maybe try the super booof. I

835
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:07,120
wouldn't say it's the best thing in the

836
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,480
world or nothing like that, but I think

837
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:10,239
it's interesting. You know, if you

838
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,120
haven't had some kind of like forbidden

839
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,640
fruit punch or something like that, uh

840
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:17,519
it's it would be cool to try. That being

841
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,360
said, if you're a grower uh and not a

842
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,639
shower and you want to maybe grow

843
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:23,119
something out this similar to this, I

844
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,559
would definitely probably go to CSI and

845
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:26,239
see what Caleb's got. I mean, I know

846
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:28,000
he's got like the F forbidden fruit

847
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,839
punch and stuff like that. Probably get

848
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,759
you pretty close to this for real, fam.

849
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:33,759
So, you know, if you don't want to go to

850
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:35,599
that hype market way or whatever, if

851
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:37,278
you're not into buying wreck weed, you

852
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:39,199
can go and pop some seeds and probably

853
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:40,480
find something pretty similar, too. You

854
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,080
know, maybe not structure-wise, but

855
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,440
flavor and smells and stuff. You get

856
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:45,918
right on the money with that kind of

857
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,600
stuff. But that being said, some good

858
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:49,240
[ __ ] bro. I'll probably smoke it again.

859
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:53,879
I don't know. Not going to chase her

860
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:53,880
down or nothing like that.

861
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:58,960
But I'm gonna get eight in the comments.

862
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,640
But I definitely would take this over

863
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,480
the permanent marker we smoked last

864
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,159
time. If you like super booof, if you've

865
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,038
tried it before, let me know down in the

866
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:09,679
comment section below. Today's weed

867
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:10,960
eater tips going to be kind of simple. I

868
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:13,120
didn't really talk about this on the

869
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,360
last video, and I probably should, but

870
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:17,359
you see here with my little weater fam,

871
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:19,199
we ain't got no guard on here. I know

872
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:21,839
some of y'all are saying, "Chuck dog."

873
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,600
He's saying last video you you threw

874
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:25,678
rocks and stuff through through the

875
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:28,000
window and stuff like that, fam. Well,

876
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:30,320
that's why I was meaning by walking

877
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,038
left. That way you throwing right so you

878
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:34,558
can kind of guess and kind of aim where

879
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:37,038
you're throwing your debris and things

880
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:39,839
like that, right? But I forgot to

881
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:42,240
mention, if you got a little guard on

882
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:44,558
here, take that bull crap off. It's

883
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,480
going to make your weed eater lighter.

884
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:49,678
uh you know and it's kind of frequencies

885
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,679
anyways. So you don't really need it if

886
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,278
you do if you're rocking walking the

887
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:55,679
right way. We talked about this on the

888
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:57,519
last video. We always going to walk left

889
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,960
and you ain't ever going to walk right

890
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,558
when you're going. Say you looking at a

891
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,919
house, you're always going to walk left.

892
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:03,359
And and here I'll show you what I'm

893
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,960
talking about. If I was going to weed

894
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:07,199
eat this box right here and I wanted to

895
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:10,240
do it the right way, fam. We fire this

896
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,798
son [ __ ] up and basically we approach

897
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:15,038
it from any way. But I I like to really

898
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:17,759
kind of start where I'm I'm gonna start

899
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:20,319
and end where I can most efficiently and

900
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:22,640
easily jump to the next thing. So if I

901
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:24,000
was here and I'm going this way, uh, you

902
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,080
know, I'd probably start there and then

903
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,240
rock out, come around right there and

904
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:31,359
then rock out. But for the sake of the

905
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,278
demonstration, you, you know, we're

906
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:36,079
going to come in like that. You could

907
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:38,319
either walk kind of sideways like this,

908
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:40,240
but I really like to kind of get that

909
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:43,119
angle on there, fam. like you're at the

910
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:45,599
strip club giving a straight pipe and

911
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:46,879
you just freaking bust down like that.

912
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:48,398
You walking backwards, walking

913
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,919
backwards, you're running backwards.

914
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:52,158
You're like a for him. That's all you

915
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:54,240
got to do. You know, it seems weird. It

916
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,840
seems weird and it's awkward at first,

917
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,278
but let me tell you, it'll give you a

918
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:58,959
lot of strength in your calves for

919
00:33:57,278 --> 00:34:00,798
pounding out your wife or husbands or

920
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,880
whatever it is late at night. You might

921
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:05,359
need that [ __ ] sometimes. Leg strength.

922
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,120
I mean, a lot of people go go uh, you

923
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:09,759
know, skip leg day. You got you got get

924
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:11,598
your leg strength up, fam. you know. So,

925
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,280
that's pretty much it. But, I mean,

926
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,359
don't you don't need that freaking guard

927
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,760
on there, fam. Another last thing I

928
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:20,159
should say about that guard is when you

929
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:23,040
got that guard on there, it's it's got a

930
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,559
little uh usually like a little blade on

931
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:27,199
it that'll keep your string from getting

932
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:29,918
a c certain length. So, if you're in

933
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:31,838
like some real tall [ __ ] or you like,

934
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:34,000
you know, maybe you ain't ever really

935
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:35,599
mowed this yard before and they just

936
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,760
want you to clean it up once or twice a

937
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:40,079
year or something like that and you got

938
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,839
some big [ __ ] you going through, bro. I

939
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,679
mean, you can get a disc cutter and [ __ ]

940
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:46,000
like that, but you know, that shit's

941
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,918
dangerous if you got a bunch of freaking

942
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,519
people on drugs and stuff around you.

943
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:50,960
So, usually when I'm rocking it out with

944
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:53,119
three, four guys, we just hit it up with

945
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,280
a weed ear, get some thicker string. You

946
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:56,480
know, pe we me and the guys get into it

947
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,400
all the time. You know, there's just

948
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,639
people on the internet that'll show uh

949
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,280
little videos at like super so slow

950
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:04,960
speeds, tell you the best kind of uh you

951
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,359
know, string for your trimmers and stuff

952
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,679
like that, but I don't really care. I'm

953
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:11,759
I'm all technique, baby. I could I could

954
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:13,598
do I could take a pair of scissors and

955
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,839
cut cut your grass, you know, with like

956
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,760
a like you wouldn't believe. So, it's

957
00:35:15,838 --> 00:35:19,920
that don't really matter to me much. But

958
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,240
that that being said, uh you know, if

959
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,320
you don't have that that guard on there,

960
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:27,199
you can get your string longer, fam,

961
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:29,119
which means you can cut more grass. So

962
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:30,879
you really, you know, you can really

963
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:33,358
take advantage of not having that on

964
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:36,480
there. And you look like a badass doing

965
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:38,799
it, fam. You and two, you you're cutting

966
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,400
your string off, too, with that little

967
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,320
uh that blade on there. If you

968
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,519
accidentally bump your head, if you

969
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,640
accidentally bump that head on the

970
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:46,639
ground, you're cutting your string off,

971
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:48,559
you're wasting string, too. I've seen

972
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:50,319
guys even without that, I've seen guys

973
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:53,039
take a whole brand new roll of string,

974
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:55,119
fam, and run that mug out edging and

975
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:56,639
[ __ ] like that. And I know we always

976
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,800
talking about edging, fam, but I'm

977
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:00,239
talking about edging like this. But we

978
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,599
going to do some edging and stuff when

979
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:03,118
it warms up. The grass ain't really

980
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:05,200
started to grow yet, but we going to do

981
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,760
some uh some here soon. We're going to

982
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:10,319
do some mowing tips, some blowing tips,

983
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,000
some leaf cleaning up tips. Uh I don't

984
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,599
know. We got all kinds of tips. We

985
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,079
giving we giving tips out left and

986
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,000
right. So, uh, but if you like the

987
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,280
weeder tips, if you like the mowing

988
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,880
stuff like that, we're talking about

989
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,480
this kind of stuff, let me know. If you

990
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,640
if it don't make much sense to you, let

991
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,639
me know that, too. Like, I figure, you

992
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:29,279
know, we we all outside rocking out.

993
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:31,838
Might as well talk about some [ __ ]

994
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,519
Who doesn't like mowing equipment, fam?

995
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:35,440
I don't really know. I mean, I know it's

996
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:38,239
the last last video. You guys with

997
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:41,280
electric ones a little bit weird, but

998
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:43,279
you know, if you got a weed ear and you

999
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,960
like doing it, it is what it is. I can't

1000
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,519
judge, fam. I'm out here rocking with

1001
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,920
the Shandawa, so I can't really judge or

1002
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:51,519
say much, but you know, I would like to

1003
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,800
see you by the end of this season with

1004
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:56,719
a, you know, a proper some kind of weed

1005
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,240
ear. It ain't electric battery powered

1006
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:01,838
bull, but it is what it is, fam. But we

1007
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:04,639
going we going to jump around a little

1008
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:06,320
bit like I was saying. So, uh probably

1009
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:09,838
going to jump over into some trap

1010
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:12,559
stories right here real quick and uh go

1011
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:14,159
from there. So, that'll be it for today.

1012
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:15,838
Make sure you take them guards off your

1013
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:17,920
weed eaters, y'all. Unless, the only

1014
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:21,039
time I would ever recommend having that

1015
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,720
guard on there is, you know, if you're

1016
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:24,400
really paranoid about throwing some

1017
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:28,719
stuff and you suck all around it,

1018
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:31,920
weeding uh or you in a real tight uh uh

1019
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:33,838
spot maybe or or maybe you know there's

1020
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,358
a lot of windows, residential areas,

1021
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:37,119
stuff like that. It can help you, I

1022
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:40,559
guess, to a certain degree with that.

1023
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:43,200
But that being said, like I mean if you

1024
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:44,719
I mean if you're like me, you out in the

1025
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:47,759
country, bro, and you need some you need

1026
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:50,159
to haul ass and cut grass, you take that

1027
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,760
freaking guard off there, bro. Raw dog

1028
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:54,078
them. And you let them you let your

1029
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,839
neighbors know how much of a BA you are

1030
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:57,680
and they drive by and they don't see no

1031
00:37:55,838 --> 00:37:59,759
cover on your weed and you just out

1032
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:01,759
there listening to freaking AC/DC or

1033
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,560
whatever you got. freaking Backstreet

1034
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,640
Boys

1035
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:08,960
just freaking pumping, slaying grass and

1036
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:11,879
slaying ass. That's the kind of [ __ ] I'm

1037
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:17,679
into, fam. Growing good weed, cutting

1038
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:21,200
grass, and uh getting getting ass. So,

1039
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:22,879
all right. Well, trapping trap stories.

1040
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:25,439
I know we all been messing with them

1041
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,440
dirty little dab hoes, but I'm going to

1042
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,599
tell y'all a little trap story about how

1043
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:32,240
dab ho probably saved me from going to

1044
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:34,400
jail. So salute to you guys and gals out

1045
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:37,199
there holding it down ratchet style

1046
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:40,400
throwing that P back for us twerking on

1047
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:42,000
a D for me for me fam. I appreciate you.

1048
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,000
You know growing up I didn't really have

1049
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,599
a crew. I didn't really have a whole lot

1050
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
of partners. The one time I did have a

1051
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,838
partner. He ended up get helping not he

1052
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,920
didn't help but basically because of

1053
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:53,679
having a partner uh people found out

1054
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,838
where I was stuff like that when I was

1055
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:58,879
back hustling when I was a kid and I got

1056
00:38:55,838 --> 00:39:01,440
robbed at gunpoint you know took my L

1057
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:04,720
the one L I had in life took the L and

1058
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:07,039
be came back [ __ ] strong learned lessons

1059
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:10,639
batten down the hatches and prepare for

1060
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:13,119
battle fam anyways after that uh you

1061
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:15,598
know I was always on my [ __ ] a lot of

1062
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:17,519
times I was carrying a weapon won't say

1063
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,680
But uh just cuz it's YouTube, but a lot

1064
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:21,679
of times it's carrying a weapon. Uh and

1065
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:23,759
over time I had a lot of success in my

1066
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:26,759
little town making good money selling

1067
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:30,880
really highrade bud for for our area in

1068
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:33,280
Kentucky. And uh obviously over time I I

1069
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,960
got some haters. Most of my competition

1070
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,400
in my town were going through the two

1071
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:41,358
main plugs which were uh a lot of bunk

1072
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,039
weed basically and and uh we'll just

1073
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:44,639
keep it at that. They had a bunch they

1074
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:46,639
they had a bunch of connections. They

1075
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:48,879
had a bunch of weight, but a lot of the

1076
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:50,559
weed kind of sucked. Uh, at the time

1077
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,880
they were calling it all, everybody was

1078
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:54,559
selling [ __ ] 20 a gram. And honestly,

1079
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,800
the [ __ ] that they had was probably like

1080
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:59,039
not even worth 10 a gram, but your boy

1081
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,560
has some good smoke and they were little

1082
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:03,199
haters. Well, anyways, I'm messing with

1083
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:05,920
this dab hoe. Uh, she's basically a

1084
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:09,199
glorified stripper type [ __ ] Uh,

1085
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:11,039
anyways, she was telling me like, uh,

1086
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:12,559
cuz you know how people are, bro. Your

1087
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:13,838
customers, they going to buy weed from

1088
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:15,279
whoever. You know, you had good

1089
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:16,639
customers that buy weed from you, your

1090
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,480
loyal ones, but then you had them ones

1091
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:20,159
that getting a gram or half quarter or

1092
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,480
whatever. You know, they're they're

1093
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:23,920
hopping around where whoever's around or

1094
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,719
closest or most convenient, they're

1095
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:29,200
going to hit them up first. So,

1096
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:31,439
naturally, uh I'm I'm hanging out with

1097
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:33,759
this girl that I'm smashing or whatever,

1098
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:36,159
and uh she tells me like, "Hey, you

1099
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,000
know, this crew uh I know who these

1100
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:40,159
people are. Matter of fact, we'll go

1101
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,000
into deeper dive into some of the

1102
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:44,000
stories with this other crew, but this

1103
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,920
crew years before when Reggie was a

1104
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
thing had blocked me. Basically, they

1105
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:50,000
had really great Reggie uh through some

1106
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,559
cartel [ __ ] I don't really know, but

1107
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,679
they had really good Reggie at the time.

1108
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:57,920
Uh and uh I had gotten a few QPS and

1109
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:59,838
stuff like that from them. And uh I was

1110
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:03,119
I was doing my little flippy flippy

1111
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:05,119
thing, you know, and uh basically I was

1112
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,960
going through a middleman uh that was

1113
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:08,318
going through them and then when they

1114
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,318
found out I was going through their

1115
00:41:08,318 --> 00:41:13,279
middleman to get their [ __ ] they like

1116
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:14,880
cut me off and they start if they they

1117
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,560
sold a few more bags to me with their

1118
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,160
real dog [ __ ] and then eventually they

1119
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:20,400
just cut me off all together because

1120
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:22,318
they were little haters. So years later

1121
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,079
when I switched up and you know, boy, we

1122
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:26,960
got a good plug and we got some good

1123
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:28,560
smoke. uh you know, naturally they

1124
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,000
wanted to [ __ ] with me, not like in a

1125
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:32,639
negative way, but they wanted to make

1126
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,599
money with me and uh you know, I had to

1127
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:37,838
say no because you guys done blocked me

1128
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:39,359
uh the first time uh when I needed help.

1129
00:41:37,838 --> 00:41:41,199
So why the [ __ ] am I going to help you

1130
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:42,880
guys? You know what I'm saying? So

1131
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:45,439
naturally, this they didn't like that

1132
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,880
too much cuz they, you know, anyways,

1133
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,240
time goes on, I'm messing with this

1134
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,920
girl. Well, anyway, she tells me one

1135
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:51,759
day, "Hey, I went over to such and

1136
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,760
such's house. This where this other crew

1137
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,160
usually hung out." And the story on the

1138
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,960
street was this dude's a little rat and

1139
00:41:56,159 --> 00:42:00,799
uh working with the police cuz he got

1140
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,400
raided all his stuff and none of his

1141
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,560
stuff got taken. He was still in

1142
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,079
business. He he went to jail for like a

1143
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:07,599
night and was out the next night. I

1144
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:09,519
don't really know. I didn't know the guy

1145
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,119
a whole lot. I I end up meeting this guy

1146
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:13,358
like two or three times in person. We'll

1147
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:14,880
go into that more as we go on. But he

1148
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:19,119
was like the leader. Let's just let's

1149
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:22,559
call him Lance. Uh Lance Bass. uh red

1150
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:24,160
hair, gingered, pale, demon of a skinny

1151
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:26,078
twig man. You've you ever seen your

1152
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:28,000
life? A little hater, you know. Anyway,

1153
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:29,760
so come to find out, he's trying to get

1154
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,960
with this girl that I'm messing around

1155
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,319
with, right? As the girl tells me, and

1156
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,760
she's telling me like, "Hey, you know,

1157
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:37,599
every time I go over there and and try

1158
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,359
to get a bag from them, they're always

1159
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:41,200
asking about you and asking about your

1160
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:43,519
whereabouts and what you're doing and

1161
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:44,960
who your people are and all this stuff.

1162
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,800
They're always like asking about you." I

1163
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,039
said, "Oh, they are for real." And she's

1164
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,119
like, "Yeah." And uh so I was like, "All

1165
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:52,719
right." So now naturally I know because

1166
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,400
this girl telling giving me the insight.

1167
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:56,879
I know these [ __ ] are out trying to

1168
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:59,440
get me and [ __ ] And I do sell to some

1169
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:01,838
of see like this Lance Bass, he's got

1170
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,440
his little uh middleman and people, you

1171
00:43:01,838 --> 00:43:04,639
know, everybody's got, you know, the

1172
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,639
main plug, they always got little

1173
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:08,400
middlemen and and and then under that

1174
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:10,239
they got people eating off of him and

1175
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,240
all this [ __ ] So like their whole they

1176
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:14,239
had like a whole crew and a whole setup

1177
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:15,759
and little little little dudes under him

1178
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:17,838
and stuff. And some of them dudes I was

1179
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,520
selling to though. So, come to find out

1180
00:43:17,838 --> 00:43:21,199
though, some of them guys were going

1181
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:23,759
back and telling do my business and

1182
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:24,879
showing the bud and I'm kind of sketched

1183
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,880
out because I had already had

1184
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,880
altercations with uh you know,

1185
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,838
previously before a few years ago. So,

1186
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:33,039
I'm on my P's and Q's

1187
00:43:30,838 --> 00:43:35,199
fam, you know, walking around with

1188
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:37,119
protection if you know what I'm saying.

1189
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:41,919
I ain't talking about no condoms. So,

1190
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:44,400
I'm ready for my [ __ ] right? And uh so

1191
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:46,960
we'll go how do I there's so many things

1192
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,800
to this story. So, one of his this

1193
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,639
dude's little lieutenant guys, whatever

1194
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,880
you call him, little [ __ ] middleman

1195
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:56,279
dude. He's a little dweeb. Uh, we'll

1196
00:43:52,880 --> 00:44:00,400
call him uh I don't know, we'll call him

1197
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:01,680
uh John, whatever. John's him and his

1198
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,519
little girlfriend or whatever. They

1199
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:05,440
always run around together and uh

1200
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:07,039
basically he's trying to make money and

1201
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,039
he he's trying to go through me and he's

1202
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:10,639
trying and he goes through the Lance

1203
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:12,800
Bass already. And I didn't know all

1204
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:14,318
this, but I come come to find out later.

1205
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,440
At first, everything's all cool and he's

1206
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:17,199
one of them dudes that every time he

1207
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,400
gets in the in the [ __ ] whip with you

1208
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:19,519
and meets up with you, whatever, he's

1209
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,519
like, you know, why don't you knock off

1210
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:23,358
20 for me? Da da da. Why don't you knock

1211
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:25,440
off all a little bit for me? I [ __ ]

1212
00:44:23,358 --> 00:44:27,119
you know, so annoying, bro. The price is

1213
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,119
the price. This ain't like negotiation

1214
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:30,800
when I show up. So, that's already

1215
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:32,880
annoying me with this dude anyways. And

1216
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:35,119
we get to a point where I finally just

1217
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,720
lose it cuz I had so much other uh

1218
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:39,039
business and customers. I didn't really

1219
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:40,639
[ __ ] need his ass anyways. And I was

1220
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:42,719
already giving like a discount because

1221
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:44,639
you're getting a bulk bulk uh bulk

1222
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:46,239
amount anyway. So it's like, bro, I'm

1223
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:48,318
already hooking you up. Like I'm not

1224
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:50,399
making money really here. I'm making

1225
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:52,400
[ __ ] nothing basically by the time

1226
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,440
you what what you want me to do. So I

1227
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,880
didn't do that with him. So he didn't

1228
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:58,400
like that. So naturally, he's talking

1229
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:00,160
[ __ ] to Lance Bass's daddy uh whenever

1230
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,599
uh you know, whenever he goes and hangs

1231
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:03,519
out with them and they have parties and

1232
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:05,119
[ __ ] So I'm like, "All right, so these

1233
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:08,079
cats I feel like these cats trying out

1234
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:11,920
to get me somehow some way, right?" And

1235
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:15,200
the kicker is is I'm living with one of

1236
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:17,760
the old like middlemen and I'm sharing a

1237
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:19,199
room with this dude. I just crashed into

1238
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,680
renting a room from this dude for a

1239
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:23,598
while and they're friends but they they

1240
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:25,039
used to be friends but Lance Bass

1241
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:26,960
screwed my roommate over and hadn't

1242
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:28,719
talked for years. Well, anyways, they

1243
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,920
start up their friendship again, right?

1244
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:31,519
Of course, little buddy's trying to

1245
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,358
figure out all my [ __ ] trying to get

1246
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:35,119
in, you know, trying to trying to get

1247
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:36,559
close to me. Lance Bash trying to get

1248
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:38,640
close to me. So he's he's making

1249
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:40,239
connections with my roommate again and

1250
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:41,759
you know giving them weed and like

1251
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:43,838
getting in close with him and [ __ ]

1252
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,359
right? So I'm sitting here like these

1253
00:45:43,838 --> 00:45:48,279
[ __ ] are trying to do something,

1254
00:45:46,358 --> 00:45:50,119
right?

1255
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:53,040
Anyways,

1256
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:54,800
John, me and him, we finally just had

1257
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:56,318
our got to go different ways cuz I told

1258
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,400
him I was like, "Dude, you can't keep

1259
00:45:56,318 --> 00:46:00,079
[ __ ] asking me." And he kind of got

1260
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,599
smart about, you know, not giving him

1261
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:02,640
discounts and all [ __ ] And finally, I

1262
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,960
was just like, "Look, dude, we can't

1263
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:06,078
really do business anymore together." He

1264
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,440
kept texting me and [ __ ] being like,

1265
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,640
"Come on, man." A few weeks after that,

1266
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,358
he still text me like, "Come on, let's

1267
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:14,400
work out. Let's work it out." Da da da.

1268
00:46:11,358 --> 00:46:16,639
And we didn't. Anyways, like a month

1269
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,240
goes by, bro. And I know this guy's car,

1270
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:19,759
right? Cuz I've seen him before. I met

1271
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:24,399
up with him. I know which car he drives.

1272
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:26,079
He drive a real uh uh easy to identify

1273
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,318
identify car. So, you can see it from

1274
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:30,000
coming a mile away. Well, anyways, I'm

1275
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:32,159
going out to the flea market, bro. One

1276
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,159
day there's a smoke shop in there to get

1277
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:36,078
uh get like stuff for smoking like a

1278
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:37,920
pipe or something like that. And I'm

1279
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:39,920
going down the straight stretch. It's

1280
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,599
like 20 minutes away from my where I

1281
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:45,400
live. And I got to go from my town to

1282
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:49,119
another town to get to this flea market,

1283
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:50,720
right? And this is like a month after

1284
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:52,480
all this other shit's been going on. All

1285
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:54,078
this weird [ __ ] Old girls telling me

1286
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,480
that they're like asking about me and

1287
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:58,720
wondering what I'm doing and all [ __ ]

1288
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:01,119
So I'm going to the flea market, bro.

1289
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:03,118
I'm in the Monte Carlo and uh I'm going

1290
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:05,200
across this I'm like halfway there. I'm

1291
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:07,838
going across a straight stretch that's

1292
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:10,078
about like a half mile, quarter mile

1293
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:11,358
long and it goes into two lanes for just

1294
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,039
a little bit and you're out in the

1295
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:15,759
country and that way somebody can pass

1296
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:19,519
you, right? Well, let me get a drink. My

1297
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:21,599
freaking throat's going dry, fam. Uh, so

1298
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:23,759
I'm driving out to flea market going

1299
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:29,039
down this straight stretch and I'm in an

1300
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:29,040
old like 98 Monte Carlo fam. And

1301
00:47:30,358 --> 00:47:34,559
uh, and I was never a big speeder, bro.

1302
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:37,280
I was always going speed limit,

1303
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:39,480
especially when I'm doing doing stuff.

1304
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:43,119
So, I'm just going

1305
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:45,920
55 and for like a mile behind me, you

1306
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:47,519
could see I'm pretty straight, right?

1307
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,720
And I look, I'm always looking in my

1308
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:51,039
rearview mirror. I'm always looking

1309
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:53,159
around. I'm always watching, you know,

1310
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:56,639
watching from or my surroundings and

1311
00:47:53,159 --> 00:47:58,399
[ __ ] And I kid you not, dude, from like

1312
00:47:56,639 --> 00:48:00,960
half mile away, I look in the rearview

1313
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:03,599
mirror and what do I see? I see the

1314
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,880
front end of old John's car coming down

1315
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:07,280
through there. I forget what it was.

1316
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:09,200
Like a Dodge, a Challenger, something

1317
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,800
like that. Dodge Charger, something like

1318
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:14,480
that. I don't know. I think it's a

1319
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:16,160
Challenger, not a Charger. Uh, but I can

1320
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:19,039
recognize this car because it's a old

1321
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:21,920
navy blue or like a not old navy but

1322
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:24,800
like navy blue uh a navy blue color that

1323
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:26,880
dark ugly blue you see sometimes on cars

1324
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:29,280
so I can tell I worked in auto mechanic

1325
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,559
industry for many years and you know I

1326
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,559
know what cars look like so I can

1327
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:34,559
recognize it's him. It's only only car

1328
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:36,720
that color in the whole town, right? So

1329
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:39,680
I I know John's coming, right? And he's

1330
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:41,759
hauling ass, right? And I'm like, "This

1331
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:43,358
[ __ ] what's he doing?" In my

1332
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,880
mind, you know, at the time, I'm

1333
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:50,078
listening to [ __ ] uh, you know, some

1334
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:51,440
pretty sketchy music, thinking I'm Tupac

1335
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:54,000
or something. So, I'm thinking like,

1336
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:56,800
damn, dude. This guy, he's coming to

1337
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:59,039
either [ __ ] shoot me, bro, or he's

1338
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:01,400
coming to do something to me, [ __ ] with

1339
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:04,960
me somehow, run me off a road,

1340
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:07,838
whatever. So, I just gun it, bro. Start

1341
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:09,880
gunning it. And uh we're coming up this

1342
00:49:07,838 --> 00:49:12,558
two two lane uh

1343
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:15,920
deal and uh like where the road splits

1344
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:18,400
and you could pass somebody. So I'm

1345
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:21,159
thinking to myself like all right bro

1346
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:24,240
like what the hell we going to do here?

1347
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:26,159
So didn't have the strap on me right? So

1348
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:28,399
I nothing uh nothing I can really do

1349
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:29,679
other than just try to protect myself or

1350
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,559
get out of the way whatever. I didn't

1351
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:32,719
know I don't know what's going to

1352
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:34,800
happen. So he gets he's coming fast as

1353
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:37,759
[ __ ] and we're basically soon as I hit

1354
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:40,318
the two-lane split, John's on my ass,

1355
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:42,559
bro. Up on my ass, honking his horn,

1356
00:49:40,318 --> 00:49:45,519
doing all this [ __ ] like that. So I just

1357
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:46,960
stay in the main lane and cuz I'm not

1358
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:48,719
I'm not going to try to move over into

1359
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,000
the lanes and then him [ __ ]

1360
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:51,439
accidentally hit me or something like

1361
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
that. So I'm just staying in that main

1362
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:55,760
lane and my windows are tinted as [ __ ]

1363
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,838
you know, and I'm sitting low in the

1364
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:00,640
Monte Carlo, bro. I'm playing it cool

1365
00:49:57,838 --> 00:50:02,799
though. Everything is cool. And uh this

1366
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:04,318
[ __ ] he tries to go around me.

1367
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:06,960
He's doing all doing all this like

1368
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:08,800
halfway through this [ __ ] uh two-lane

1369
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,800
deal. He's he's swerving on me and then

1370
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:12,400
he he goes around me, bro. And this

1371
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,760
shit's pissing me off, right? I'm

1372
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,920
getting pissed cuz I'm like, dude, he's

1373
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:18,880
[ __ ] with me. Like, this is damn near

1374
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:20,559
He's like, he could kill somebody or me

1375
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,720
or somebody coming the other way,

1376
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:24,480
whatever, bro. So, I was just like made

1377
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:26,239
that decision in that moment like [ __ ]

1378
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:27,920
him. He ain't passing my [ __ ] I'm done

1379
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:29,919
[ __ ] around, dude. So, I just gunned

1380
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,358
it, bro. And as he's coming around me,

1381
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,119
he's trying to pass me, bro. And I'm

1382
00:50:31,358 --> 00:50:35,598
still in that main lane and I'm gunning

1383
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:37,119
it. And we're [ __ ] running out of uh

1384
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:39,440
two lanes. It's going to eventually come

1385
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:42,079
back to a one lane. And then basically

1386
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:44,960
you're in town and there's the flea

1387
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:46,800
market and [ __ ] And uh usually there's

1388
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:49,199
police posted up right there cuz it's

1389
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:51,280
like that they have a lot of tax money

1390
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:53,118
and [ __ ] in that town. They're there

1391
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,400
basically there's just a lot of police

1392
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:56,720
presence right there, especially right

1393
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,559
as you come in cuz it goes from 55 to

1394
00:50:56,719 --> 00:50:59,838
like 35 speed limit. So it's like

1395
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:01,200
they're always posted up hiding right

1396
00:50:59,838 --> 00:51:02,880
there in this parking lot. So I'm

1397
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:04,239
thinking to myself like [ __ ] like I got

1398
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,160
to slow down or what? We got to do

1399
00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:08,078
something here cuz the shit's shit's all

1400
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:10,480
coming to a head and and getting to this

1401
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:12,559
boiling point, right? So dude, he back

1402
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:15,519
to dude. He's trying to pass me, bro.

1403
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:19,280
And he's in a more modern car. My my 98

1404
00:51:15,519 --> 00:51:20,960
Monte Carlo was sixcylinder, but uh or

1405
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,800
whatever, but so it wasn't like souped

1406
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:24,159
up or nothing. So I didn't, you know, it

1407
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,480
is what it is. This car is a little bit

1408
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:28,399
newer, but I'm gunning it, bro. I got it

1409
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,480
floored and he's trying to pass me. He's

1410
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:33,240
got it floored. But my car is keeping up

1411
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:37,838
with his, bro. And we're neck and neck,

1412
00:51:33,239 --> 00:51:39,919
dude. And like we're coming out to to

1413
00:51:37,838 --> 00:51:41,599
where both lanes are about to end, bro.

1414
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:44,240
And I'm flooring it with everything I

1415
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:46,800
got. And so is he, bro. And his car

1416
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:49,919
finally he's taking me uh overtaking me

1417
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:52,720
just cuz he got a a newer car. And uh he

1418
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:56,000
as he's coming he comes over and and his

1419
00:51:52,719 --> 00:51:58,159
[ __ ] wheels bro as that road ends his

1420
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,119
back wheels I watch as they hit like the

1421
00:51:58,159 --> 00:52:03,279
grass as it comes off and his back and

1422
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:06,160
goes like that bro and he bounces you

1423
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:08,160
know and he uh slams on his brakes real

1424
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:10,159
quick to try to get me to run into him.

1425
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:12,159
But bro, like I said, I'm on my [ __ ]

1426
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:14,960
I'm ready to kill this guy, bro. With

1427
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:18,000
love, of course. And uh so I slam on my

1428
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:19,519
brakes and uh and I'm ready, dude. I'm

1429
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,760
ready. this guy getting out of car,

1430
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:24,559
whatever. And I put my [ __ ] in park,

1431
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:27,040
dude. And uh he just takes off real fast

1432
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:29,760
and [ __ ] floors it, bro. I'm like,

1433
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:30,880
"What the [ __ ] This guy's a [ __ ]

1434
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,480
idiot, bro." And I'm sitting there

1435
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:34,079
thinking like, "You lucky, dude, cuz

1436
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:37,920
this could have ended really bad, you

1437
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:41,280
know?" And uh uh so I go to the flea

1438
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:43,200
market, dude, and I go to the [ __ ] uh

1439
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:45,920
little weed shop in there. They got like

1440
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:47,759
uh beads coming down in front and

1441
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:49,920
there's like black lights inside and

1442
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:52,480
everything. It's pretty cool cool spot.

1443
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:54,159
And uh I go in there, bro. And this

1444
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:57,039
[ __ ] and his girlfriend are

1445
00:52:54,159 --> 00:52:58,480
there at the cash register, bro. And he

1446
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:01,039
don't see me. She don't see me. It's

1447
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,559
kind of dark in there, bro. And there's

1448
00:53:01,039 --> 00:53:03,920
police all up at this [ __ ] flea

1449
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:05,200
market just cuz there's a [ __ ] ton of

1450
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,358
people there and stuff. So I'm thinking

1451
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:09,759
like I can stick this guy right here,

1452
00:53:07,358 --> 00:53:11,759
bro, and [ __ ] just take off running.

1453
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:13,280
But I was like, "Man, I'm trying to I'm

1454
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,960
just trying to chill. I want to go home

1455
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,880
today. I ain't had no problems. I like,

1456
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:18,559
[ __ ] this guy anyways. I I'll do

1457
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:20,400
something. I'll get him back some way or

1458
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:22,000
for him or however, whatever, you know?

1459
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,240
I'll kiss his girlfriend when he ain't

1460
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,599
looking." Some [ __ ] like that, you know?

1461
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:27,919
So, anyways, I'm thinking, "What kind of

1462
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:30,079
noodle [ __ ] with this guy?" So I

1463
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,599
literally, bro, as I'm walking to like

1464
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:32,800
the cash register, he's on the left at

1465
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:34,720
the counter talking to one of the

1466
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,800
employees and [ __ ] and the employee

1467
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:38,078
turns around and as I'm walking by, bro,

1468
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,000
I just take my I don't know why I did

1469
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:42,000
this, but I took my thumb and I bring it

1470
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,838
around the front of his neck, bro, and I

1471
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,318
just go real lightly across his throat

1472
00:53:43,838 --> 00:53:48,078
as I walk by. And I didn't say nothing,

1473
00:53:46,318 --> 00:53:50,079
dude. And he didn't say nothing. I look

1474
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:51,760
I look back and he looked at me, bro,

1475
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:54,000
and like didn't say nothing. Didn't do

1476
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:57,760
nothing. Just sat there like a little,

1477
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,599
you know, little [ __ ] And then uh uh

1478
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:01,839
yeah, and then I I bought my pipe and

1479
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:03,680
[ __ ] and they left. I left. And that was

1480
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:05,599
really like the end of the story for for

1481
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:08,239
that guy in particular. The only time I

1482
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:10,880
ever seen John ever again when he showed

1483
00:54:08,239 --> 00:54:13,279
up uh with Lance Bass at a party one

1484
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:15,200
time that I was at. And uh we'll talk

1485
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:17,760

00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:31,759
got to count on YouTube no more. It's

1518
