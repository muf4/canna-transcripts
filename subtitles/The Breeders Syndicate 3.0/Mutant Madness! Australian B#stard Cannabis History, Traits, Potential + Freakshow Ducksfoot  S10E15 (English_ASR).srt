00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,359
started as a one-man mission for strain

history and breeding science over time

7
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:19,600
it's evolved into something bigger

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,960
better and more of a team effort we will

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,640
be joined by members of the can

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,920
Illuminati and other friends throughout

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,039

Syndicate welcome to breeder Syndicate

19
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:45,840
I'm Matthew here today with thousandfold

20
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:48,679
and our friend Ben chicken who is uh one

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,199
of my favorite masters of the mutants uh

22
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:52,558
out of Australia so with that I'm going

23
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:53,519
to kick this over to thousandfold to

24
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:55,919
start the

25
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,559
show yeah uh I think we're having like

26
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,879
an interesting moment with ABC feels

27
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:03,679
like you know Matt's obviously

28
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:07,079
released some testers with the sub fuge

29
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:10,640
we know that Caleb has had um various

30
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:13,118
foray into that territory so yeah quite

31
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,118
very very interested to to hear from Ben

32
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:18,478
here um about his time working with it

33
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:20,359
so maybe to start us off uh Ben I'm just

34
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:23,200
gonna call you Ben I know it's weird you

35
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:25,159
thought I was saying Ben earlier but um

36
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,640
how did you get why were you interested

37
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:29,960
in ABC to start with and and when did

38
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,879
you start jumping in or even hear of it

39
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:35,478
ABC because it it is one of those weird

40
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,359
Legends yeah thanks for having me guys

41
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:42,118
so

42
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:43,840
um my journey with ABC um we always in

43
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:46,239
Australia was it was known that it was

44
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,560
getting around but it was quite hard to

45
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:51,399
obtain and I always had an attraction to

46
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,478
it because it's such a stealth variety

47
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:55,280
and I always thought if you could get

48
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:57,920
your hands on the stealth variety it'd

49
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,439
be pretty good to be able to grow and

50
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,680
just have that extra layer of

51
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:03,679
um

52
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,000
disguise getting abbc in Australia and I

53
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,680
did try and I tried multiple methods of

54
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,560
doing so I looked at all the forums and

55
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,480
I did find some people who had

56
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,479
ABC quite recently before the releases

57
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:22,959
but I was never able to acquire any

58
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:25,238
physical seed of them as it turns out

59
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,199
the person who held ABC for all this

60
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:30,640
time uh was definitely very much offline

61
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:34,159
all throughout that period just being an

62
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,159
older an older fell up

63
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:40,799
north um I had one one promp to which

64
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:43,598
was does the fact that it's called

65
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,360
Australian basted cannabis like did that

66
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:46,518
resonate with you at all is it even from

67
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,959
like I don't know much about it I think

68
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:49,800
you two know quite a lot more about the

69
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:52,640
backstory and I know we're gonna

70
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,760
probably dig into that a bit um does it

71
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:59,199
actually how does this all begin someone

72
00:02:54,759 --> 00:03:01,359
tell me so this is just my um

73
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:03,199
understanding of it and I'll admit I

74
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,080
don't really understand what happened

75
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,359
before this point but I've spoken to a

76
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:11,360
fellow from up North and he's held it he

77
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,440
acquired it um in a small town north New

78
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,720
South

79
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:18,079
Wales at a a tip which is a dump what

80
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:20,598
we' would call it America and he

81
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,920
acquired those seeds around 1990 from

82
00:03:20,598 --> 00:03:25,878
just a local fell um and he grew those

83
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:28,399
seeds and he found what we call now

84
00:03:25,878 --> 00:03:31,079
Australian bastard cannabis it had

85
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,519
different names back then

86
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,799
so then he grew this plant and preserved

87
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:38,239
it in a sense where he he wasn't he's

88
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,760
just an aid Gardener and he's always

89
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,519
Keen he grows a lot of plants and he was

90
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:45,000
always just keeping it pure quite simple

91
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,400
and he was growing it throughout he

92
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,959
actually told some funny stories where

93
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,120
there was a a gardening show that came

94
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:53,479
to his house and in the background of

95
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,200
the film because they're filming his

96
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:59,840
Gardens he had ABC growing so that's

97
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:04,759
quite really shows the the stealth of

98
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:07,239
this plant yeah um and he attempted to

99
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:09,560
make a few hybrids with it but he had no

100
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:10,959
success he he didn't really have the the

101
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,120
breeding knowledge as it wasn't really

102
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,680
shared at that time and he was

103
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,519
completely offline and he did hand it

104
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,600
out to a lot of people and I imagine

105
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:21,478
this is where ABC surfaced here and

106
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,080
there on the forums with different

107
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:27,360
people probably acquiring it from him

108
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:29,120
would be a guess yeah if you want to

109
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,000
touch on what you know Matt yeah from

110
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,800
the American point of view like we it

111
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,439
wasn't really well known until Mark

112
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,478
Emory dropped it in um I can't always

113
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,519
forget what the Canadian it's like the

114
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:41,359
Canadian version of High Times and there

115
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:45,000
was an ad in there for being able to buy

116
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,560
ABC cross the flow and I want to say I

117
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,120
don't remember if there was any ABC pier

118
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,519
in there but he had a story about it and

119
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,560
he was the first person as I'm aware to

120
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:55,399
call it uh Australian bastard cannabis

121
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,000
um and that's when most of us Americans

122
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:59,719
were aware of it and a few of those

123
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,800
people one being H um received those

124
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,120
original seeds um but it was very

125
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,520
limited super limited and a lot of

126
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:09,160
people throughout the years up until up

127
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:13,079
until as recent as the the big release

128
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:14,479
with CSI and uh painted Forest it nobody

129
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:16,399
a lot of people didn't believe that it

130
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:18,159
was even a plant that existed or that it

131
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,599
was even cannabis you know there's been

132
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,120
a lot of arguments about that over the

133
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,240
years um I think we touch in a later

134
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,478
episode too that's coming out maybe

135
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,720
before this one but recorded before um

136
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:31,359
about uh you know fet from Spice

137
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,080
brothers having a plant called dizzy

138
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,879
that was very very similar and that also

139
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:36,159
showed up on the forums not sure where

140
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:37,560
he got his from but he always said it

141
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,600
wasn't related to ABC but it was

142
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,639
obviously the same mutation so that's

143
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,240
kind of like how the Americans took on

144
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:46,000
to this and it's been a big myth and

145
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,240
only a few people had it and like you'd

146
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,918
have to pay you know $500,000 for a

147
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,720
clone if you wanted it some absurd

148
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:55,359
amount yeah but a lot of us were

149
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,600
obsessed with chasing it um buddy resen

150
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,720
lung tried flying out to Australia a few

151
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,280
at a few different points to pick it up

152
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,039
and was never able to find the person

153
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:05,679
who had it you know asking around in

154
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:08,120
nimon and elsewhere yeah that's that's

155
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,680
kind of how uh the American backstory

156
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,879
goes as opposed to uh the

157
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:17,000
Australian I kind of want to ask you

158
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:18,759
Matt what are your impressions of it uh

159
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,199
given that you've recently done some

160
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:23,240
work with

161
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:25,199
it it's it's what I expected except for

162
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,079
that I didn't expect it to be longer

163
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,680
flowering looking at it you think of it

164
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:31,159
as like this little slow gring plant so

165
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,918
think it must be some kind of Afghani

166
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,319
off shoot but I think it's a a much

167
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:39,399
longer flowering typically sativa uh

168
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:42,280
type variety um it has thicker thicker

169
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:46,079
leaves like Ivy and looks more like an

170
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:47,719
ivy plant to me or or basil as it were

171
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:49,959
um but yeah that's that's the first

172
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,840
impressions we can get into TPS and all

173
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:54,000
that stuff

174
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:56,719
later and of course I'm from a hybrid

175
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,160
perspective so

176
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,440
yeah I can touch on a funny story when

177
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:06,240
you me mentioned the flow F1 seeds

178
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:11,439
released by Markem so the old mate upth

179
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:15,120
of me he was aware of this release

180
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:18,519
um and he had a friend who actually

181
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:21,639
purchased these seeds from Mark emry and

182
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:24,159
he purchased it for the flow which I

183
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:27,840
thought was quite funny that is funny

184
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,639
flow was not available in Australia yeah

185
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:32,758
I thought that was quite an interesting

186
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:35,879
take on that's how Australians perceived

187
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:38,038
it so people were buying this ultra rare

188
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:42,240
mutation and they were searching through

189
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:44,399
the population to remake flow that is

190
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,639
funny I never would have guessed that

191
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,918
Mark Mark said he used flow to increase

192
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,560
the potency of ABC which I thought was a

193
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:54,000
weird choice for a potency increase on

194
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,918
anything to be

195
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,639
honest so just just so I can get this

196
00:07:56,918 --> 00:08:01,359
right um you were saying that originally

197
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:02,918
seeds were from Australia but then some

198
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,840
other people from Australia got it from

199
00:08:02,918 --> 00:08:08,680
Canada as well is this correct that's

200
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:11,399
correct from Mark and that would have

201
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:15,519
been late 90s early 2000s if I remember

202
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:19,198
correctly fascinating yeah

203
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:22,680
um okay well how about you tell us a bit

204
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,840
more about your actual Journey um how

205
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,759
long has it been that you've been

206
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:30,359
working with it with ABC I've been

207
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:32,000
working so I acquired ABC from CSI

208
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:36,759
Humbolt through that painted Forest

209
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,759
Farms collab in 2019 so I was pretty

210
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:42,240
quick off the gates I saw it I knew it

211
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:45,080
was coming and that was the first first

212
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,120
purchase through CSI that I made and my

213
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:51,278
first uh seeds I actually bought from

214
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,200
America I've been waiting to get ABC so

215
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:54,679
I was definitely going to grab them and

216
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,040
then it's pretty much as soon as I got

217
00:08:54,679 --> 00:09:00,599
them I did a small open pollination seed

218
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:01,719
in crease Style

219
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,040
uh and then I dug through that

220
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:08,680
population and I did my first outcross

221
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:10,838
to uh a plant from W duck and that's a

222
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:13,759
double sour zaml so it's a good plant

223
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:18,120
and it really suits the Australian

224
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:19,759
climate I looking back I I did a lot of

225
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,399
work with ABC that ended up being dead

226
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:24,000
ends and you'll find that when you're

227
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:25,440
working with ABC it really sometimes it

228
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,958
doesn't hurt to just take a step back

229
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:31,000
and realize what I've done here doesn't

230
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:34,838
really work so I did a freak Show hybrid

231
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,759
with ABC just to see what combinations

232
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:40,000
those two plants would result in and I

233
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:42,720
grew out quite a large amount of the f2s

234
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,200
f3s and then I started into the

235
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:49,959
f4s and I found the best plants in there

236
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,560
were sub diffuse one leaning oh this is

237
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:55,799
a sub diffuse one hybrid I did later

238
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:58,679
sorry not pure ABC and then

239
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:59,919
the the plants that combined both

240
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:02,759
mutations

241
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:04,759
were actually worse than ABC and worse

242
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:06,240
than freak Show so I kind of just called

243
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:08,360
that quit because they just didn't want

244
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,000
to grow it was just that doubling up of

245
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,240
mutations and these plants were just

246
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,200
yeah too funky to function they're just

247
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,079
no good y but it was

248
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:21,720
interesting

249
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:24,879
yeah yeah good line

250
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,879
yeah slight tangent here just to give us

251
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:29,399
a bit more backstory how much reading

252
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:31,519
had you done before this and what what

253
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:34,679
kind of had you worked with prior

254
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:38,078
to I'm relatively young and I worked

255
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:41,319
with Aussie bushweed so the first plants

256
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:43,319
that I grew were and in hindsight

257
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,720
extremely difficult plants to grow so

258
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,278
I'm not sure if you're aware of the kind

259
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,079
of seeds that get around Australia in

260
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:52,919
the bush scene this is and they were

261
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:54,759
essentially Southeast Asian genetics

262
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:56,838
that are kind of a climatized to

263
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:59,799
Australia so you'd almost compare it to

264
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:02,680
a tie so these plants were flowering 20

265
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:04,919
plus they were very interex

266
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:06,479
prone just difficult to grow in general

267
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:09,679
and they grew like bamboo these things

268
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:13,480
grew humongous so I I go completely

269
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:14,838
outdoors and the first kind of project I

270
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,720
did kind

271
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:19,200
of was to I I really like these plants

272
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,480
they quite trippy and had really good

273
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,480
effects and I actually preferred spoking

274
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,320
that over anything I would

275
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,600
buy and I combined that with another

276
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,720
Bush strain which is just unnamed bag

277
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,959
seed with an a

278
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,120
and I found it completely tamed the

279
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:39,159
interex traits and it kind of brought

280
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,360
that flaring time down to about 15 weeks

281
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:44,519
which still is long but it's a lot more

282
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,240
manageable and it then from there it was

283
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:48,078
kind of a deep dive because I realized

284
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,399
oh hang on I can actually I've actually

285
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:52,199
created a plant that in my opinion is

286
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,440
better than both of these two parent

287
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:57,759
lines and then from there I kind of got

288
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,480
into the forums having a look around and

289
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:01,480
then I kind of discovered ABC and then I

290
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:05,000
was trying to chase that down with no

291
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:07,720
luck for many years and then I kind of

292
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,240
fell down that classic advertisement

293
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:13,199
trap for about a year which is you know

294
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,759
the the whole European feedbanks I think

295
00:12:13,198 --> 00:12:18,120
it's kind of a given for everyone who's

296
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:20,519
new part of everyone's Journey for sure

297
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:24,679
yep so I grew plenty of those and then I

298
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:26,198
kind of dropped all that work and then

299
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:27,958
through the forums came across Wally

300
00:12:26,198 --> 00:12:29,679
duck and I started growing his work for

301
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:31,958
a while and

302
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:34,359
that was kind of my first project I was

303
00:12:31,958 --> 00:12:38,319
really proud of so I combined a couple

304
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:41,560
of his lines and that was uh the z99

305
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:44,839
hybrids I did which was Sour z99 cross

306
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:46,799
to a allow type plant and it created

307
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:48,920
something that you need a good climate

308
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:51,240
for it's definitely an outdoor variety

309
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:53,879
but it was kind of like Aussie bushweed

310
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,399
reworked and I found it was just that

311
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:58,039
little bit better than all the bags se

312
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,799
you were getting around it was just so

313
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:01,879
hard you drought Hollow

314
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:04,319
just really suitable for our climate and

315
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:06,600
that Sour Diesel really kind of bumped

316
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,160
up the flavor just make it a little bit

317
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:11,759
more interesting yeah so that was like

318
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:14,600
my early work and

319
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:17,439
then not long after a couple years after

320
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:19,040
that CSI did the release and then since

321
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,880
then I've just been on a really deep

322
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:25,679
dive into ABC and there been growing ABC

323
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:27,799
and other clone only and stuff in

324
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:29,479
Australia Australia is starting to form

325
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:31,919
its own clone scene which is quite

326
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:34,720
interesting so I'm going a bunch of um

327
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:37,439
heavy days' work and I really rate his

328
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,160
work he's got um some really good

329
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:44,120
genetics and I've actually using one of

330
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:46,039
his um well-known Minds the jelly breath

331
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:49,560
which is like a meno breath leaning

332
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:52,599
hybrid or cookie hybrid into improving

333
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:54,119
the uh the new work ABC line I'm doing

334
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,639
just take that step further and try to

335
00:13:54,120 --> 00:14:00,320
increase the the density so yeah that's

336
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:05,399
kind of where I'm now so I know that

337
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:06,920
CSI uh also did some ABC cookies stuff

338
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:10,720
why

339
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:14,838
cookies so I personally go on M no go

340
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:16,800
ahead I I personally chose cookies so

341
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,800
originally I I'll give you a backstory

342
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:20,719
of where I'm at so I've made this dualar

343
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:23,198
plant which is an extreme outlier within

344
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,759
the ABC population so it grows like a

345
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:28,479
normal plant it's very SAA dominant if

346
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:29,600
you know ABC like like Matt was saying

347
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,920
earlier

348
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,199
um it kind of looks like an Inda but it

349
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:36,240
is not it comes from Aussie bushweed

350
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:38,319
which I was saying is a really long

351
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,959
flowering a climatized Southeast Asian

352
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:43,440
varieties so I imagine that the um

353
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:47,439
genetic origin of this

354
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,959
mutation so I introduced cookies later

355
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,320
on because I really want to increase the

356
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:55,439
flower density there there is pretty

357
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,639
significant issues with pure ABC flower

358
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,320
density and it could definitely use a

359
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:01,839
little bit of a potency boost well the

360
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:05,079
potency is not as bad as people give it

361
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:07,959
like the credit I would say a cookie

362
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:09,879
type hybrid could definitely improve a

363
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:11,958
few characteristics and I think that's

364
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:14,360
kind of the obvious goals with working

365
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:16,838
with ABC and I think that's probably why

366
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:19,879
CSI has gone down a similar path and you

367
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:23,680
also use the TK which I think offers

368
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:25,919
quite similar um you know benefits to

369
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:28,439
bring into ABC so basically you're just

370
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:30,639
selecting trait that ABC lacks and

371
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:33,279
you're picking out cross

372
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,919
that you know does exceptionally well

373
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:37,639
with those traits and trying to just

374
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:40,439
bring them in while keeping that ABC

375
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:42,919
Leaf if that makes yeah if that covers

376
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,000
it yeah yeah Matt what was what was your

377
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:45,958
take on that Matt no I that's that's

378
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,198
exactly what I was going to say it was

379
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:49,198
the calx leaf ratio and

380
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:55,399
density um the other thing that you know

381
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:57,600
maybe a bit of a stereotype or no it's

382
00:15:55,399 --> 00:16:00,440
probably a true thing I know that um it

383
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,360
tends to lean towards toin the ABC and

384
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,279
then I've talked you a little bit about

385
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,360
you know what it's like with your newer

386
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:08,799
hybrids what are both of your thoughts

387
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:11,278
on the you know it's it's high to

388
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:11,278
pinoline

389
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,519
Bent yeah if you want to go first Matt I

390
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,879
mean I can't really comment because I

391
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:21,839
only have the hybrid like a later

392
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:25,879
hybrid true true okay sure so with pure

393
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:28,000
ABC pure ABC has is 100% of the

394
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:30,078
population in my opinion I've grown

395
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,399
quite a few of them and in the pure form

396
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:34,599
and they're all to penal and they're

397
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,039
quite a two two-dimensional to penal

398
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,360
I'll add it's quite a boring flat to

399
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:42,519
penene yeah and that's where the hybrid

400
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:46,159
kind of what i' say subfuse one it's

401
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:47,600
still to penene mostly um although it is

402
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:49,120
a little bit more I like like

403
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,879
threedimensional be one way to put it

404
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,720
it's a little bit more interesting you

405
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:57,958
can tell there's um other plants within

406
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:59,399
it but recently I've actually managed to

407
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:01,719
budge this to

408
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:04,199
dominance like this link trait so I do

409
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,919
have plants in the garden right now that

410
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:10,160
smell nothing like to penine and they

411
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:12,799
wreak of almost a garlic kind of smell

412
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,480
so that's interesting to finally

413
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:17,078
breaking that and I have the theory that

414
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,519
once this trait's broken I think it'll

415
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:21,678
be quite easy to introduce other tpine

416
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:24,759
profiles i'

417
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:27,798
agree yeah so we'll see how that goes

418
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:29,839
yep real quick exciting before we go

419
00:17:27,798 --> 00:17:32,240
away too far and also because it keeps

420
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:35,319
closing on my phone the longer it takes

421
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,160
I I brought up the page from um resin

422
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:39,038
long when I first asked him when we were

423
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,200
going to do this episode probably when

424
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:45,000
we first started talking about doing it

425
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:47,880
I asked him for his the backstory on

426
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,519
like the American version and his uh his

427
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:52,960
travels to the ABC thing and he kind of

428
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:54,918
told me more about the history with Mark

429
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,159
Emory too and how Mark Emory got it so I

430
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:59,280
wanted to toss it in before we get

431
00:17:56,159 --> 00:18:00,919
further in um uh and this is direct

432
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:02,759
quotes it says first to bring it to the

433
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:04,840
table was Mark Emory his magazine

434
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:06,679
cannabis culture at an article about a

435
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:10,839
Harvest Festival in nimin Australia in

436
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:12,720
like 98 99 most TR most Pro Drug Town in

437
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:15,279
Australia I guess I don't know if that's

438
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,558
correct but uh Dana Larson Chief editor

439
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:18,399
of the magazine at the time wrote the

440
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:19,960
story and took the pictures after the

441
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,000
Harvest Festival Dana hooked up with

442
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,200
someone that called himself Mr Avery if

443
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,759
I remember right that drove him a couple

444
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,798
hours away but still in north south

445
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:29,960
Welles to his secret grow out in the

446
00:18:27,798 --> 00:18:32,879
bush to check it out out Dana left

447
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:34,360
Australia with 200 seeds um and believe

448
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,360
some of the seeds were uncrossed and

449
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:38,158
some were crossed with flow the mutant

450
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:40,199
article ended with Emory offering those

451
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:42,720
seeds as a giveaway to subscribers first

452
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,519
come first serve that's how hve got his

453
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,079
I believe he said A friend had of his

454
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:48,480
had subscribed and gave him the seeds uh

455
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:49,918
cannab culture had like two little

456
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,679
updates in the following years on the

457
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,038
progress which wasn't all that great but

458
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,159
proved that the line was still alive

459
00:18:54,038 --> 00:18:58,200
eventually Fett came up uh and showed

460
00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:00,120
the pcks with the backstory and that was

461
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,440
Fett from spce brothers who worked with

462
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:04,719
d man that's going to be on our show um

463
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,759
he claimed to have gotten the line in

464
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,400
the early to mid 90s after seeing a huge

465
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:11,038
grow uh grow bust of some new super

466
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,000
potent mutant weed on the news that had

467
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:14,798
happened to be close to where he lived

468
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,519
uh I believe he claimed he went there

469
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:18,798
and was able to steal it plants cut

470
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:20,200
seeds I don't know I remember reading

471
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:21,679
posts from people that had claimed to

472
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,720
have seen reports of the bust and

473
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,440
supposedly The Growers were so confident

474
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:28,000
about its ability to not be recognized

475
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,679
as weed that they went way way too big

476
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,679
and uh

477
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,080
and and and screwed themselves uh Fett

478
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:36,280
could have found fields of it I guess

479
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:38,759
who knows not long after I starts

480
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:41,720
posting pics and messing with Fett uh

481
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:43,319
Fett claimed that what Emory was able to

482
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,079
get out of Australia was bunked and not

483
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:48,359
related to what he had fet claimed his

484
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:50,480
was a tropical plant and what Hyde was

485
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:52,119
working with was more indicia fet

486
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,159
claimed his line was super potent and

487
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:56,918
didn't display the dwarf phenotypes that

488
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:58,360
hies line did uh Hive would crush Fett

489
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:01,000
with real Botanical knowledge whenever

490
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:02,918
Fett would start in on him I've also had

491
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,480
just busted out the whole fem seed deal

492
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:06,880
and seemed to butt heads with fed about

493
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,400
that too Fett was not into fem seeds uh

494
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,520
Fett seemed like such a whiny [ __ ]

495
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,880
about everything and then it goes on to

496
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:15,879
mongy man a few years later after Hy and

497
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,480
Fett started in on each other another

498
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,880
dude from Australia popped up with what

499
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,480
I believe to be a pretty interesting

500
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,440
story and I'm gonna have Ben chime in on

501
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,120
this if he knows anything after uh he

502
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,720
claimed to have known two elderly people

503
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:29,879
who had been the original discoverers of

504
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,839
the mutant MIM man or mongi man or mangi

505
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,280
man claimed that these two elderly

506
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:34,519
Growers had taken him under their wing

507
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:36,279
and taught him everything they knew

508
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:38,359
about growing and when they had grown

509
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:39,759
too old to grow and because he had shown

510
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:41,678
interest in the mutant they gave him all

511
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:43,558
their seed stock of it he claimed to

512
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,120
have grown it everywhere in plain sight

513
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:47,079
for years he had crossed it with

514
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:50,199
everything available the available at

515
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:51,639
the time all the sativas um he said that

516
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,440
they gave the seed away for years to

517
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,080
anyone who wanted it until he eventually

518
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,038
noticed it was being sold by a few

519
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:58,798
people at that point he disappeared and

520
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:00,279
planned to never mention the line again

521
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:02,319
until the internet was invented and he

522
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:04,798
noticed two guys arguing about mongi

523
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:06,720
Madness that's when he told his story

524
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:08,359
and he said oh mongi claimed that the

525
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,720
elderly couple had stumbled upon the

526
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:13,079
mutant plants while hunting for weed in

527
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,880
Hunter Valley a place famous for wild

528
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:16,439
marijuana growing all over the region

529
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,520
and young Australian hippies making the

530
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:21,000
trench or the Tre early each year to

531
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:23,359
load up on the free weed in like the

532
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,159
late 60s and 70s supposedly they walked

533
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:27,719
into a patch of the mutant weed growing

534
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:29,240
and were uh educated enough to recognize

535
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,278
it as cannabis and collect living

536
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:33,200
samples and Seed coolest of all the

537
00:21:31,278 --> 00:21:35,359
stories but recessive genes and [ __ ] a

538
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,440
patch in the wild uh with all that

539
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:40,038
non-mutant pollen flying around not

540
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,679
impossible but and and then he lists the

541
00:21:40,038 --> 00:21:44,359
names and he just said basically said

542
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:47,200
nobody liked it uh mutant Bindy weed

543
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:50,319
Bindy uh Parsley Pot basil buds mangi

544
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,360
weed Mary gold and Clayton um when he

545
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:53,960
went to nimon he spoke to the mayor who

546
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:55,759
runs the Cannabis Museum there and he

547
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,880
knew all about it not where he could get

548
00:21:55,759 --> 00:22:00,839
seed of it but everything else uh yeah

549
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,440
that's that's the backstory from someone

550
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:05,439
who is much more educated than I am from

551
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,360
the American version I have a very like

552
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,600
not important question to ask which is

553
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:11,759
Ben do you think that's like Mong like

554
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,199
not mongi but like Mong like you know

555
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:16,000
your

556
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,798
Mong good question I don't know I I've

557
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,359
always just read it online so I just

558
00:22:17,798 --> 00:22:22,798
read it as mongi Madness but mongi to me

559
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:27,519
kind of refers to something that's a bit

560
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:30,558
like obscure and like you know uh

561
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:32,839
deformed be away mongi

562
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:35,798
Mong we know where it comes from I think

563
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:37,918
we won't say that on the show yeah yeah

564
00:22:35,798 --> 00:22:39,639
exactly but sorry anyway I'll let you

565
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,038
reflect more broadly on what Matt said

566
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,679
yeah what do you think of that St on

567
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:44,519
that I love this I just got to say I

568
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:46,640
love the we have like a bit of a murder

569
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:47,960
mystery who done it vibe to this one

570
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,600
this the way it's always been with this

571
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:52,200
[ __ ] plant I swear to God that's why

572
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:55,038
there was so much Chase for it because

573
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,880
it was just a mystery plant from the

574
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:59,839
beginning exactly so you mentioned the

575
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:03,480
huntter valley

576
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:06,038
um wild cannabis fields and that is

577
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:08,360
recorded as something that was real and

578
00:23:06,038 --> 00:23:10,319
the government did a pretty intensive

579
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:12,719
job of making sure that was

580
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:14,439
eradicated that's too bad but they did

581
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,640
struggle for a while I believe to

582
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:18,159
actually wipe it out because Australia

583
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,559
has a quite a good climate in that area

584
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:22,960
in particular is it's relatively

585
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:27,519
suitable for

586
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:29,319
growing for the the whole elderly topic

587
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:31,119
of you know people taking him under his

588
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:33,000
wing I'm actually not too sure cuz I I

589
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:34,639
probably know just as much as you I've

590
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,599
all I've done is read that online that

591
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:42,000
was well before my my time but what I

592
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:44,199
can say is I have tried to document

593
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,278
everything that I can actually prove

594
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,679
from this point forward and that was

595
00:23:46,278 --> 00:23:54,159
talking to that old fell up North so

596
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:56,759
he's had ABC for um over 30 years and he

597
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,559
said he passed it out to multiple people

598
00:23:56,759 --> 00:24:00,400
throughout having it and he said no no

599
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:03,119
one actually really held on to it for

600
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,880
very long so I think it takes a certain

601
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:07,798
type of person in in

602
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:11,400
Australia it's a little bit different

603
00:24:07,798 --> 00:24:14,038
especially back then like um how do you

604
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:16,600
explain it um these

605
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:19,158
people might not have understood exactly

606
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:20,918
what they were working with or

607
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:22,760
approached it it's it's not quite it's

608
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:24,200
not very productive why would I grow

609
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:27,158
this and not actually seeing it as a

610
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:29,120
breeding tool rather than just seeing it

611
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:30,679
for what it is at that point in time

612
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:33,319
because it obviously has the potential

613
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:35,278
to be pushed a lot further just as a

614
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:38,359
naturally occurring mutation is probably

615
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:40,919
what I would say it's origin is and I

616
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:43,199
can also I've spoken to Painted Forest

617
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:44,600
farms and this older guy up north and

618
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,640
he's actually the fellow who gave

619
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:50,199
painted Forest the farms and that ended

620
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:52,120
up in csi's hands doing the reproduction

621
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,798
so connected all those dots so that's

622
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:57,519
kind of good to have at least recent

623
00:24:53,798 --> 00:25:00,639
history for once something about ABC is

624
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:04,798
solid recorded and that

625
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:08,038
was painted Forest Farms was on like a a

626
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:10,079
vacation holiday in Australia and he was

627
00:25:08,038 --> 00:25:10,839
in a small town I won't mention the name

628
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:13,879
up

629
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:16,720
north and he met an old grower at the

630
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:19,200
back of a pub around a

631
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,839
pub because he was smoking a joint and

632
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,319
he was you obviously drawn to that and

633
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:25,439
then he ended up going on a hike with

634
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:27,519
him around the national parks and he

635
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,960
showed him a few of his grows and he

636
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:33,200
showed him that hi been growing this

637
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:35,038
mutant plant ABC as we know now know

638
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,000
it

639
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:41,519
and P Forest Farms obviously got seeds

640
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,159
from this old fellow up North and then

641
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:44,879
because this old fell wasn't actually he

642
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:46,200
wasn't holding it tight that's the funny

643
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:50,278
thing he was just

644
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:52,640
offline so he wasn't hoarding it he just

645
00:25:50,278 --> 00:25:54,519
didn't really know that people wanted it

646
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,640
because he'd given it out multiple times

647
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:57,558
throughout history and he just grew it

648
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,880
in his garden grew it in the National

649
00:25:57,558 --> 00:26:01,240
Park

650
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,520
and never thought much of it so it's

651
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:06,839
quite a I think it's quite lucky that

652
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:09,879
ped Forest Farms got seeds and and of

653
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:11,038
all the people to give that to it

654
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:14,559
couldn't be much better than giving it

655
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:17,599
to CSI who was able to do like a legit

656
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:20,759
open pollination and then send these out

657
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:23,240
at a reasonable price I think you could

658
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:25,599
more the timing on it was in insane

659
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:27,278
because during those prior maybe three

660
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:30,038
years before that happened me him and

661
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:32,798
resen lung run a massive Chase to try to

662
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:34,759
figure the history out and get the seeds

663
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:37,038
so when he showed up with them I was

664
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:39,558
[ __ ] skeptical as [ __ ] because I

665
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:41,558
already knew that hve had had them and

666
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:42,918
that you know hyve had a grow in Oregon

667
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:44,079
and that people were working on it and

668
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:45,799
it would have been possible for him to

669
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:46,918
get it that way so I was definitely

670
00:26:45,798 --> 00:26:49,879
skeptical when I heard the painted

671
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:51,200
Forest painted Forest Farm Story like oh

672
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,000
you just happen to have it when we're

673
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,720
looking to buy it you know like kind of

674
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,640
thing but it it's very much faded I

675
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:01,399
think in the end you know like it had to

676
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:04,120
it's so weird how the universe works

677
00:27:01,398 --> 00:27:05,839
sometimes so I wanted to ask like a

678
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:09,678
really obvious question just to kind of

679
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:13,959
sign post the like the significance of

680
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:16,399
ABC because obviously for Matt resin and

681
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:19,519
Kaleb to be chasing this it must have

682
00:27:16,398 --> 00:27:21,319
some great potential impact um and I

683
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:23,679
know we we've kind of implied it but can

684
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:26,839
we spill it out a bit more like what do

685
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:32,038
you two see as the potential impact of

686
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:34,000
ABC go ahead yeah so for me like I kind

687
00:27:32,038 --> 00:27:36,599
of refer this to it kind of relates to

688
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,558
breeding goals with ABC so you kind of

689
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:42,558
see this not for what it is at its

690
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:44,678
current point of a pure ABC plan but I

691
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:47,720
believe it's just full of potential like

692
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:48,919
there's so much variation within it and

693
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,399
that's quite interesting we actually

694
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:53,840
don't really understand what this

695
00:27:51,398 --> 00:27:55,678
mutation is or how it works and I've

696
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:57,678
actually experienced it affecting other

697
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,440
parts of the plant so you see that the

698
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:03,440
growth structure of ABC is completely

699
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:06,278
different to non-abc

700
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,278
types so I'll first I'll point out like

701
00:28:06,278 --> 00:28:10,359
the obvious traits that You' be like oh

702
00:28:08,278 --> 00:28:12,640
you see this plant I want to improve the

703
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:15,240
flower quality and growth habits while

704
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,200
retaining those stealth of the plant so

705
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,200
you can kind of grow it in your backyard

706
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:22,399
without nosy neighbors so that's

707
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,440
improving the flower density flavor

708
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:25,239
effects but then I'd like to take it a

709
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:28,120
step

710
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:29,679
further and think about what ABC like

711
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:33,558
what else it might actually have to

712
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:36,000
offer and I think it has because of all

713
00:28:33,558 --> 00:28:38,000
these unique traits within its mutation

714
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,798
we might not actually

715
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,798
understand how beneficial

716
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:48,759
ABC for example you just cut out for one

717
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:50,798
second oh sorry that sentence over real

718
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:53,640
quick you're good we don't really know

719
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:56,000
what ABC might have to offer and it's

720
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,600
quite drought tolerant would be one one

721
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,599
trait that I've noticed within my garden

722
00:28:57,599 --> 00:28:59,879
and I

723
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:03,278
link that

724
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:06,919
to smaller Leaf surface area maybe the

725
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:10,839
thicker leaves slightly waxier Leaf so

726
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:13,399
we don't know it might actually end up

727
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:16,359
producing more drought tolerant plants

728
00:29:13,398 --> 00:29:19,079
that can grow into more arid climate or

729
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:21,359
be frost tolerant um it could

730
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:23,158
potentially have some unique cannaboids

731
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:24,240
hidden within its Jee pool that we don't

732
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:26,799
actually know

733
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,079
about and then another thing just even

734
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:32,359
take it one step further would be is

735
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:35,158
there any value in the non-abc types of

736
00:29:32,359 --> 00:29:38,798
the F2 population and I say this so I

737
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:41,360
grew a bunch of Girl Scout cookies times

738
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:46,240
ABC F2 population from

739
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:48,000
CSI and I kept some of the non-abc types

740
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,558
in that F2 population just out of

741
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,079
curiosity and one individual in

742
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:55,000
particular

743
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:58,720
grew like a normal plan but it had

744
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:01,440
traits from the ABC so it had extremely

745
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:06,000
long pedol it

746
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:07,240
had an almost red black stem it had

747
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,720
fingers coming out of the center of the

748
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:11,720
leaves and a really complex webbing you

749
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:14,159
wouldn't call it Ducks foot but it was

750
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,319
more complex than Ducks foot and while

751
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,600
those traits in particular aren't very

752
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:20,639
beneficial that was one plant and you

753
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:23,158
could run through thousands of these

754
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,038
non-mutant types and you could find

755
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:26,880
something that grows like a normal plant

756
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:29,240
is a normal plant but it's drought

757
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,440
tolerant because of a thick belief so we

758
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,240
don't actually really

759
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,480
understand how

760
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,440
beneficial ABC might become and we might

761
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,759
view ABC in the future

762
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,200
as something completely different to

763
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:43,759
what we view it today of what it's

764
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:47,159
brought to the market and that could be

765
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:48,558
compared to let's say AO flowers and how

766
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:52,080
they're filled a niche Within These

767
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:55,519
Northern climates with the the daylength

768
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:58,599
Cycles so exactly that's kind of where I

769
00:30:55,519 --> 00:31:00,278
would say I think it's got an unknown

770
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:04,599
potential but I think it's got a lot of

771
00:31:00,278 --> 00:31:05,759
potential the comes goad oh sorry man I

772
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:07,158
was just going to say a little thing and

773
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:09,759
then I'll pass it over to you I was

774
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:12,799
going to say that um it's a really

775
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:13,960
really nice breakdown and to me really

776
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:16,158
interesting because you're kind of also

777
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,919
making a distinction between like Known

778
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,600
Unknown and then unknown unknown

779
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:22,679
potential if that makes sense um but

780
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:25,798
yeah sorry Matt please take take take it

781
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:28,759
away um what what goes along with the uh

782
00:31:25,798 --> 00:31:30,079
drought resistance um and I I think

783
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:31,278
you're dead on when you say about the

784
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:32,558
leaf thickness and stuff there's

785
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:35,720
obviously better water retention in

786
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:37,839
these leaves smaller Leaf surface is

787
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:39,120
pest resistance you'll find that like

788
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:42,240
things like spidermites are going to

789
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:44,518
have a trouble penetrating to a a deeper

790
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,319
uh thickness of the leaf so you get

791
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:48,319
major pest resistance with a lot of this

792
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:50,240
stuff and I think especially for outdoor

793
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:52,918
growers in the US that's like the number

794
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:55,120
one other than mold and I've watched

795
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:58,880
these things go through a a complete

796
00:31:55,119 --> 00:32:01,000
Frost cycle where I'm at outdoors and it

797
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,840
it pummels through it it has no problem

798
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,119
with it so for outdoor Growers this

799
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:08,240
could be a complete Game Cher and to

800
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:10,079
touch on the other part I truly truly

801
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,638
think that when you find things that

802
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:13,599
aren't in our current gene pool being

803
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:16,319
used whether it's something like this

804
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:18,719
obvious mutation or it's an old line

805
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:20,839
with a a trait that's not necessarily

806
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,798
seen in in other stuff being used or

807
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:25,000
just not used you always have the

808
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:28,038
potential for cannaboids that don't

809
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,880
exist in our current gene pool and

810
00:32:28,038 --> 00:32:31,480
testing for these kind of canabo like we

811
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,799
only test for a few of them but there's

812
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,120
like several hundred as I understand it

813
00:32:33,798 --> 00:32:36,440
um when testing gets to the point where

814
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:38,038
it's affordable to test for all these

815
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:40,200
other cannaboids and our understanding

816
00:32:38,038 --> 00:32:41,480
is better of them I have a feeling these

817
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,360
are the kind of things that we want to

818
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:45,000
hold on to because they're not going to

819
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:46,879
be the norm they're always going to be

820
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,079
the outliers or they at least have the

821
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,919
potential to have those outliers of

822
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:53,720
canabo that could have medical relevance

823
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:56,840
or value so that that's that's a lot of

824
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:58,399
what uh pushed me for it that the look

825
00:32:56,839 --> 00:32:59,599
and the stealth I mean

826
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:01,439
if you're growing in an urban

827
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:03,599
environment like you you have to hide

828
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,200
stuff from Neighbors or whoever may be

829
00:33:03,599 --> 00:33:08,398
there you know thieves even and uh

830
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:10,840
looking at this plant most people that

831
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:12,879
aren't cannabis Growers and even most

832
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:14,839
cannabis Growers wouldn't immediately

833
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,880
look at it and think it's cannabis you

834
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:19,439
know so that yeah you you touched on

835
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:22,200
pretty good uh points

836
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,919
there um I wondered if we could do a

837
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:26,278
little tangent here and compare the

838
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:29,360
other mutants we know um you mentioned

839
00:33:26,278 --> 00:33:30,720
freak Show Ducks foot already we should

840
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:32,798
go over Ducks foot because that's one of

841
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,120
the least understood and overused terms

842
00:33:32,798 --> 00:33:37,638
and people don't even understand that it

843
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:40,239
was a strain in a specific trait Ben do

844
00:33:37,638 --> 00:33:42,359
you you are you friends with Wally I am

845
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,679
mates with Wally and I spoken to him

846
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:47,719
about ducks foot and his story behind

847
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:49,679
Ducks foot so he acquired it through a

848
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:53,038
mate and he just had some plants growing

849
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:54,278
and he explained to him quite poorly and

850
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:56,960
then he actually went to his house and

851
00:33:54,278 --> 00:33:58,919
was like wow look at these he a pretty

852
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,880
indistinguishable from Cannabis

853
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:05,399
seedlings so he saw the the stealth

854
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:08,559
characteristics straight away and he was

855
00:34:05,398 --> 00:34:10,398
quite new to breeding at that point and

856
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:12,078
he he admitted that he did quite a poor

857
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:14,598
job because he didn't understand what he

858
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:16,200
was working with and he wishes he could

859
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:19,280
take a step back and get those original

860
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:21,118
seeds and start again yeah he's not sure

861
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:24,200
where it came from from that point and

862
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:25,559
you know did repop up back in Hawaii at

863
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:28,480
a certain point and that was brought

864
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:30,119
across and he made a hybrid from that so

865
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,440
the one in Australia that popped up was

866
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:35,280
actually quite an Inda type plant and it

867
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:38,240
was really skunky yeah and the one in

868
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,119
Hawaii was a more sativa type and he he

869
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:42,439
reported that those hybrids were really

870
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:44,519
good um and he said it was actually some

871
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,960
of the most potent weedies ever smoked

872
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:48,599
was the original Duckwood which is quite

873
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,559
interesting because I'm sure he's gone

874
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:55,760
through some yeah interesting plants

875
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:57,358
yeah yeah um so in in modern times I see

876
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,160
a lot of people using it to refer to

877
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:02,480
like OG G KB leaves as ducksfoot there's

878
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:04,519
a story from um an idiot in Hawaii who

879
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,880
thinks that ducksfoot is the creation of

880
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:09,280
uh OG Kush you know um there's a lot of

881
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,079
stories out there there was as as Ben

882
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,720
referred to um there was the Hawaiian

883
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:15,440
web indicia and I don't know if it was

884
00:35:13,719 --> 00:35:17,959
more sativa necessarily but it was

885
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,960
definitely crossed to things like c992

886
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,280
before it came to the states and that

887
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,320
would make sense you know because those

888
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,000
are the seeds that were out there I

889
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,519
don't think anybody got the Hawaiian web

890
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,039
pure um but what we're talking about

891
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:31,519
with ducksfoot it is a leaf that is

892
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:34,320
fanned out and it's called a webbed Leaf

893
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:37,920
because there's no there's no individual

894
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,519
leaves it's one big leaf and um you can

895
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,280
tell that it's meant to have IND

896
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:43,159
individual leaves but they don't there's

897
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,880
no serrations between them if that makes

898
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:48,078
sense and that's an actual webbed trait

899
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,559
and that trait has been seen in Hawaii

900
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,480
which may be from the Ducks foot or may

901
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:54,960
be a completely separate plant and then

902
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:56,800
there's the Ducks foot from Australia um

903
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,240
but yeah it's very very unique and and

904
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,760
people use the term and I've talked to a

905
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:02,479
lot of people nowadays that didn't know

906
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,400
that ducksfoot was a strain and a trait

907
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,000
they thought that it was just a a

908
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,000
reference to things that have weird

909
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,480
looking leaves inside like URL so yeah I

910
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,199
wanted to clarify that part for a lot of

911
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,639
the newer Growers that aren't familiar

912
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:18,439
with it with the

913
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:21,239
Ducks so beyond the superficial fact

914
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:24,039
that these two Mutant types look

915
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:25,799
different from conventional cannabis um

916
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:27,119
are there other connections between them

917
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,880
like in terms of the traits are there

918
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:34,440
overlaps in the traits or like uh

919
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:38,318
similar types of potential in both of

920
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:40,440
these so firstly I'll say just for

921
00:36:38,318 --> 00:36:42,358
anyone who doesn't know ABC and Ducks

922
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,400
foot in my opinion are completely

923
00:36:42,358 --> 00:36:46,440
unrelated and if you gr them side by

924
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,440
side you see the very different plans so

925
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:52,720
I'd say I'm not I'm not no definitely no

926
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,800
expert on Duck foot but I don't actually

927
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:56,719
know what it could bring to the table

928
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:58,800
it's kind of a similar argument with ABC

929
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:01,239
where it could offer some sort of things

930
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:04,160
we don't actually understand it could

931
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:06,239
create a more beneficial Leaf shape not

932
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:08,279
too sure

933
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:12,318
um

934
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:16,280
although when growing ducks for like

935
00:37:12,318 --> 00:37:19,440
when Wally first uh received it his

936
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:21,560
initial um thoughts were that it could

937
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,280
be used as an incognito plant and I

938
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:26,799
think that's a good value that Duckwood

939
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:29,760
has especially back then when ABC and

940
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,440
freak Show were not available or frer

941
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,680
hadn't been bred

942
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,159
yet okay

943
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:38,598
yeah I wanted to do with it was make the

944
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:40,960
autoflowering Ducks foot that was my um

945
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:43,240
original goal with it and I was actually

946
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,400
growing ducksfoot out like in the

947
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:46,239
apartment complex that I had at the time

948
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:48,000
when we were running a bunch of

949
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:50,559
different apartments I would keep it

950
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,519
outside on a Ledge next to this big

951
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:53,838
condo thing and you could see it on 8th

952
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:55,920
Avenue if you walked by you would see

953
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:58,119
these plants and nobody would identify

954
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,838
them as cannabis except in the morning

955
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:03,119
because when the sun hit it smelled like

956
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:04,559
straight skunk like skunk skunk but I

957
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,519
remember when smoking these and these

958
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:09,239
were um I want to say these were f2s or

959
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:11,000
f3s from seed Bay back then I don't

960
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:12,719
remember if it was via direct Wall-E or

961
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,920
someone else that used them to to make

962
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:17,679
the F2 there was no potency whatsoever

963
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:20,760
to him by that point it was very

964
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:22,759
um uh hempy for for lack of a better

965
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,359
term so I ended up not going through

966
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,400
with it but the idea was to make like an

967
00:38:24,358 --> 00:38:28,199
autoflowering stealth plant for people

968
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,240
to be able to grow outdoor

969
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:32,838
in in urban environments so yeah that

970
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:35,838
was my main point with

971
00:38:32,838 --> 00:38:38,920
that that's cool no thanks thanks to

972
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:40,559
both of you for that um can we talk

973
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:43,559
about freak Show for a bit as well since

974
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:45,719
we're here um you know how how do either

975
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:48,239
if you think that that lines up against

976
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:49,598
the other two as far as the mutant been

977
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:52,479
I have no experience with this one this

978
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:54,680
is all I've grown a fair bit of fra show

979
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,920
I find it quite fascinating and I find

980
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:59,799
it's a really good accomplishment for

981
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,760
someone to actually create a mutant

982
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:05,000
which in my opinion is it's a very

983
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,400
extreme serration of a leaf it makes it

984
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,760
for those who don't know it almost

985
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:13,519
appears like a fern and it grows quite

986
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:17,760
well especially in um High rainfall

987
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:21,039
areas it's quite mold and pest

988
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:23,440
resistant and to the untrained eye you

989
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:25,239
just don't pass it off as cannabis kind

990
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,960
of that similar thing with ABC where I

991
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:31,799
actually think most people identify

992
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:34,400
cannabis from the traditional Leaf shape

993
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:37,119
and not actually the flower or any other

994
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:40,358
traits or the way it's growing but just

995
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:42,358
a classic five finger or you know that

996
00:39:40,358 --> 00:39:45,719
just that typical cannabis leaf that's

997
00:39:42,358 --> 00:39:47,679
what 99% the people when they think of

998
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:51,399
cannabis that's what they view yeah it's

999
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:53,639
iconic and yeah exactly and it's I grew

1000
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,960
freak Show and a few hybrids of freak

1001
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:59,759
Show obviously I did a pure ABC and a

1002
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:02,838
sub diffuse Freak Show hybrid and autoed

1003
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:06,440
hybrid but

1004
00:40:02,838 --> 00:40:09,920
I I found it was actually quite hard to

1005
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:12,519
work with to an extent freak Show is

1006
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:16,838
it's a mutation but it's not quite like

1007
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:20,039
ABC where it's ABC or not ABC freak show

1008
00:40:16,838 --> 00:40:23,239
has these intermediate types within the

1009
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:25,239
F2 I thought was interesting and it's

1010
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:27,399
actually I'm getting a bit of a tangent

1011
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:29,559
here but it's also quite a potent flower

1012
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:32,000
I found not overly potent but it's not

1013
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:34,239
like ABC or like those Ducks you were

1014
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:39,719
talking about Matt like it's quite

1015
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:42,358
comparable um it has a interesting a

1016
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:45,078
topenish but different kind of skunky

1017
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:47,719
terpenol smell to it and I know there's

1018
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:50,039
some hybrids out there now that are like

1019
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:52,519
the berry freak and they're pushing away

1020
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:54,759
from that profile and still retaining

1021
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:58,440
that leaf shape and that's the work I'm

1022
00:40:54,760 --> 00:41:01,760
not 100% sure but I believe it's the son

1023
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:04,318
of the the guy who originally read um

1024
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:07,560
freak Show The Shape Shifter I'm not too

1025
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:09,920
sure in the 100% backstory of FR show

1026
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:12,559
but growing they either it's a great

1027
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:16,400
plant and a it really shows what can be

1028
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:20,519
pulled out of cannabis like it's a very

1029
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,519
extreme outlier it's yeah really

1030
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:25,239
interesting very cool no this was a I

1031
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:27,960
think this is a good tangent um just

1032
00:41:25,239 --> 00:41:29,838
because it it gives more context ABC

1033
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:32,318
right comparing it to these other types

1034
00:41:29,838 --> 00:41:34,799
and also I think it might

1035
00:41:32,318 --> 00:41:36,159
disambiguate uh I think for some people

1036
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,599
like these these mutant types are kind

1037
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:39,118
of all like rolled up together or

1038
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,519
they're like you know they might seem

1039
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,599
like they're overlapping but they're all

1040
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:45,199
actually quite distinct um types it

1041
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:47,519
takes a it takes a certain type of

1042
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:50,919
person also to chase mutants I really I

1043
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:52,920
really think so like it's not big in the

1044
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:54,838
niche well it's not big in the niche

1045
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:57,519
cannabis collection genetics Community

1046
00:41:54,838 --> 00:41:59,679
even like everybody who's in interested

1047
00:41:57,519 --> 00:42:01,920
in genetics like and and zeros in on

1048
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:04,838
that you know not everyone is also

1049
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,440
centering in on mutants it takes it

1050
00:42:04,838 --> 00:42:09,440
takes certain kinds of minds and I don't

1051
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:11,519
know how to explain it any better but we

1052
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,200
I think one way I can see it is that

1053
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:16,199
there's like a longer view right it's a

1054
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:18,318
long play yeah um and you have to be

1055
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:20,199
ready to commit to that and have the

1056
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:22,719
patience and have the dedication to

1057
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:24,239
commit to that to be able to look at a

1058
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:26,279
plant for more than it's what it's

1059
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:27,679
showing you and not everybody's ready

1060
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:30,160
for that

1061
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:31,759
I can frame it a bit more like brutally

1062
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:34,759
uh it's more than just what the plant

1063
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:37,520
can give you in the short term

1064
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:40,319
exactly yeah and I'll P push that even

1065
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:42,880
further by saying ABC comes with a lot

1066
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:45,358
of challenges it's not like growing

1067
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:48,599
typical plans especially in its pure

1068
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:51,279
form and I'll also note that a lot of

1069
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:55,039
and I might be wrong a lot of the seeds

1070
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:58,160
in America are sub auge one hybrids yes

1071
00:42:55,039 --> 00:43:02,039
so the a lot of people haven't actually

1072
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:04,519
how painful and how interesting pure ABC

1073
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:06,599
is these plants barely grow vertical

1074
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:09,719
they grow sometimes wider than they do

1075
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:11,800
tall and there's some serious challenges

1076
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:13,838
with those traits and they go extremely

1077
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:16,119
slow and they're all kind of linked

1078
00:43:13,838 --> 00:43:17,759
traits like if you do an outcross and

1079
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:21,318
you bring it back to the

1080
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:24,160
F2 a lot of I'll say almost all of your

1081
00:43:21,318 --> 00:43:27,679
ABC types will revert back to that

1082
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:31,199
growth habit so that really dwarf

1083
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:33,759
um really small Leaf low flower density

1084
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:35,719
to penline dominance low potency all

1085
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,960
those traits kind of come with this

1086
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:41,439
bundle of what is

1087
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,800
ABC and I'd also like to say how you

1088
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,039
were saying a lot of people don't work

1089
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:48,440
with it and I think that's because it

1090
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:50,358
takes so long to get results so I've

1091
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:53,079
done like I was saying that freak Show

1092
00:43:50,358 --> 00:43:55,679
hybrid I've done multiple ABC hybrids

1093
00:43:53,079 --> 00:43:58,519
and I've grow like that freeo hybrid I

1094
00:43:55,679 --> 00:44:01,279
sprouted thousand and thousands of

1095
00:43:58,519 --> 00:44:04,000
seedlings and I completely just

1096
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:06,240
abandoned that project and so there's

1097
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,838
four generations of breeding and I kind

1098
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:09,399
of just came to a dead end and then I

1099
00:44:07,838 --> 00:44:11,480
had to start again and try something

1100
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,720
else so it's definitely takes a lot of

1101
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,400
patience and it takes a certain type of

1102
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:16,439
person someone who's doing it because

1103
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:19,400
they want to do it not because they're

1104
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:20,800
trying to get an immediate result it's

1105
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:23,440
definitely a long game like you were

1106
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:27,280
saying

1107
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:30,159
old yeah and also add one more thing AB

1108
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,559
is super unpredictable like I'll come up

1109
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:34,159
with these theories and I'll get this

1110
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:36,200
giant door gar type plan so I'll touch

1111
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:38,598
on where I'm at now I've pretty much

1112
00:44:36,199 --> 00:44:41,358
found this outlier male plant and it

1113
00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:43,920
grows like a normal plant it produces

1114
00:44:41,358 --> 00:44:47,078
offspring it's an ABC type but the

1115
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:50,079
leaves are about the same size as a

1116
00:44:47,079 --> 00:44:52,920
normal cannabis plant slightly smaller

1117
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:55,599
it grows it grew about three over I

1118
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:58,159
think it was 3.2 m in a single season

1119
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:01,359
tall so it it's definitely not like

1120
00:44:58,159 --> 00:45:03,558
normal ABC in The Offspring offspring

1121
00:45:01,358 --> 00:45:06,199
that It produced it actually passes

1122
00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:08,880
these traits of the large leaf to any

1123
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:10,879
small Leaf ABC it's hybridized with

1124
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,519
which is really interesting so it's a

1125
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:16,440
really rare phenotype but it breeds

1126
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:19,239
dominant so I think that's quite

1127
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:22,679
interesting and then when I say it's

1128
00:45:19,239 --> 00:45:26,279
unpredictable if I've recently done some

1129
00:45:22,679 --> 00:45:28,199
jelly Beth 3 bx1 hybrids with this plant

1130
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,599
and I've taken that currently to the F3

1131
00:45:28,199 --> 00:45:31,838
but I'm digging through the F2

1132
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:33,359
population and I've found plants that

1133
00:45:31,838 --> 00:45:36,078
are

1134
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:39,078
completely comparable to pure ABC Once

1135
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:41,599
Again within this pool which is amazing

1136
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:44,559
because this thing is multiple

1137
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:47,280
outcrosses separated from P ABC and it's

1138
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:49,880
still popping its head up on occasion

1139
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:53,000
which I find is that's extremely

1140
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:55,240
stubborn and while I am finding the

1141
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,679
average I'm finding some really nice

1142
00:45:55,239 --> 00:46:02,199
plants but I I really am surprised to

1143
00:45:57,679 --> 00:46:05,239
see these fewer ABC types poking back

1144
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:09,078
up yeah anyway that's about all I can

1145
00:46:05,239 --> 00:46:13,078
say for the challenges with

1146
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:15,559
ABC no that's really cool um uh one

1147
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:18,440
thing I actually wanted to ask earlier

1148
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:20,400
was um what have your conversations with

1149
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:22,599
CSI been like I know that you've had a

1150
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,119
few exchanges with him in in your

1151
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:26,119
process and I'm quite curious to know

1152
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:28,119
like what what you guys talked about if

1153
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:30,760
you if you're Keen to

1154
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:34,000
yeah for sure so when he first announced

1155
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:35,160
that he was doing an ABC reproduction I

1156
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,358
hit him up

1157
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:38,719
immediately because I was pretty I was

1158
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:41,799
pretty shocked to be honest I like oh

1159
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:44,838
it's finally happening and

1160
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:47,000
then I think I might be wrongly saying

1161
00:46:44,838 --> 00:46:49,400
this but I think initially not that many

1162
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,760
people gravitated towards working with

1163
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:53,639
ABC for those same reasons I just

1164
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,960
mentioned it's just it's not a fast

1165
00:46:53,639 --> 00:46:59,598
process it takes a certain type of

1166
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:04,760
person and I think I originally shared

1167
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:08,880
my ABC and subdus freak Show hybrids um

1168
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:11,200
with CSI I I think yeah he did uh at

1169
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:14,200
least an F1 hybrid of freak Show and ABC

1170
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:15,078
just to see if um those traits appeared

1171
00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:17,519
in the

1172
00:47:15,079 --> 00:47:19,440
F1 um and I took that a step further by

1173
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:21,880
taking it to

1174
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:24,559
F4 um I think he was quite interested in

1175
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:27,838
that and then as soon as I found this

1176
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:30,000
dualar maale which is a

1177
00:47:27,838 --> 00:47:32,838
it was quite an interesting plan it

1178
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,639
was to do with a failed reversal than

1179
00:47:32,838 --> 00:47:38,599
introducing a male from another ABC gene

1180
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:42,400
pool as a replacement so it was actually

1181
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:45,599
a double sour zaml times ABC site 4 I

1182
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:48,039
did a an f2r of those and then I re

1183
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:50,000
reved my favorite female from that

1184
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:51,759
population and it was a sour diesel

1185
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,880
leading

1186
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:56,680
F1 and then I was planning on doing

1187
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,680
another reversal with another plant onto

1188
00:47:56,679 --> 00:48:03,679
this and that didn't reverse well um and

1189
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:05,598
I had luckily I had a Kut butter breath

1190
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:08,000
times subus one I actually got that off

1191
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:10,599
a mate Captain Nemo

1192
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,318
cannabis and that was a male and I

1193
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:17,720
pollinated a large branch of this double

1194
00:48:13,318 --> 00:48:19,719
sour ZL F1 ABC and from that was I just

1195
00:48:17,719 --> 00:48:21,719
found that extreme outlier and I

1196
00:48:19,719 --> 00:48:23,639
immediately when I saw that plant it as

1197
00:48:21,719 --> 00:48:26,799
a Seedling I was like who what do we got

1198
00:48:23,639 --> 00:48:28,159
here because it was growing faster like

1199
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,039
I'm not even lying it was actually going

1200
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:32,679
faster than everything in the garden

1201
00:48:30,039 --> 00:48:35,519
non- mutants and mutants so it was a

1202
00:48:32,679 --> 00:48:38,239
super vigorous plant large leaves so

1203
00:48:35,519 --> 00:48:41,239
immediately sent CSI an email saying oh

1204
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:42,879
this could be kind of like an outli that

1205
00:48:41,239 --> 00:48:45,199
would be very beneficial to the

1206
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:48,519
population and luckily the year before

1207
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:50,960
that he sent me the Girl Scout f2s the

1208
00:48:48,519 --> 00:48:52,599
TK f3s and then I had a few of my

1209
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,639
hybrids which I was all growing and I

1210
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:57,359
was also growing a pine T cush sub to

1211
00:48:54,639 --> 00:49:00,838
fuge one hybrid from a buddy on

1212
00:48:57,358 --> 00:49:03,119
overgrow and I pollinated everything in

1213
00:49:00,838 --> 00:49:04,798
the garden I had I can't exactly

1214
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:08,599
remember how many but I had a bunch of

1215
00:49:04,798 --> 00:49:11,838
the TK f3s and one of them was really

1216
00:49:08,599 --> 00:49:14,440
nice um ABC type it was definitely an OG

1217
00:49:11,838 --> 00:49:17,358
kushen and I had a Girl Scout cookie

1218
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:20,358
Lena in the F2 population and then I had

1219
00:49:17,358 --> 00:49:22,960
one of the pine tush that was really

1220
00:49:20,358 --> 00:49:25,119
nice and that kind of created what has

1221
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:29,519
been the most well-received hybrid which

1222
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:31,440
is the pinear DGA cross and it um in my

1223
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:33,400
opinion produces plants that are

1224
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,400
probably the best ABCs out there I would

1225
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:37,760
say while it is taline it's kind of a

1226
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:40,920
very complex to penelene it's like a

1227
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:42,200
lime syrupy fizzy kind of smell and the

1228
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:43,720
effects are really nice and it's

1229
00:49:42,199 --> 00:49:46,558
actually quite potent which is

1230
00:49:43,719 --> 00:49:50,879
surprising or comparable to Pine tacle

1231
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:53,839
potency so yeah with CSI I'm curious to

1232
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:56,760
see what his next move is I know he's

1233
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:58,400
just done an an F2 like grew out an F2

1234
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,680
of the Girl Scout cookies and that looks

1235
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,880
pretty nice and he tested on the purple

1236
00:50:00,679 --> 00:50:05,399
Pro and you could see that it bumped up

1237
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:07,400
the potency to 15% by

1238
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:10,480
memory

1239
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:12,880
and I'll be curious to see if he digs

1240
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:16,280
deeper into which direction he takes it

1241
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:19,119
I think I think we've been talking and

1242
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:21,359
feminized breeding is probably the key

1243
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:24,079
to

1244
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:26,159
stabilizing different turine profiles

1245
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:29,559
within the ABC so that's going to be

1246
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:31,838
probably my next move and I've recently

1247
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:33,480
pollinated um a very popular clone in

1248
00:50:31,838 --> 00:50:36,358
Australia which is the jelly birth 3

1249
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:41,000
Clone that's from heavy days so I've got

1250
00:50:36,358 --> 00:50:43,679
my jb3 bx1 times duar F2 back cross to

1251
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,559
the Jelly breath 3 so that's kind of a

1252
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:47,960
double outcross to the Jelly breath

1253
00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:49,760
types and then I'm going to inbreed that

1254
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:51,720
and just filial breed that and I'm just

1255
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:54,599
going to use feminizing practices from

1256
00:50:51,719 --> 00:50:56,399
here as advice from CSI because I think

1257
00:50:54,599 --> 00:50:59,440
I think he's right by saying you don't

1258
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:01,280
really know what your males are offering

1259
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,599
as terms of if they're carrying the tip

1260
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,400
penene so it' be good to just eliminate

1261
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:08,760
that

1262
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,760
entirely yeah that's all I can say there

1263
00:51:09,639 --> 00:51:15,920
thanks Matt any thoughts on that yeah

1264
00:51:12,838 --> 00:51:19,798
the the feminized breeding part of ABC

1265
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:21,680
we kind of stumbled on on accident um I

1266
00:51:19,798 --> 00:51:24,519
had I had been doing my creamy punch

1267
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:28,759
project outdoors and I had pollinated a

1268
00:51:24,519 --> 00:51:31,639
um subterfuge plant and and it ended up

1269
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:34,400
herming and pollinating one of the other

1270
00:51:31,639 --> 00:51:35,798
creamy punch plants and I remember you

1271
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,880
know I hadn't I hadn't tested them and

1272
00:51:35,798 --> 00:51:38,759
some other people were running through

1273
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,480
them and these ABC types were popping up

1274
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:43,520
and I was like wait a minute that's not

1275
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:45,519
the ABC cross one and if it was it

1276
00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:46,679
wouldn't be showing any of the mutations

1277
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,960
what's going on here and I remember

1278
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:50,440
taking it to B chick and I was like what

1279
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:52,639
the hell is going on and that's when we

1280
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:55,119
kind of because we had been advised by

1281
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:57,159
other people that had done subterfuge

1282
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:59,119
breeding that it wasn't possible in

1283
00:51:57,159 --> 00:52:01,039
reversals for it to show up so fast so

1284
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:03,760
when it showed up I showed it to CSI was

1285
00:52:01,039 --> 00:52:06,039
like uh I think we know exactly like

1286
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,520
what's going on here and um it looks

1287
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:09,279
like it shows up in the next Generation

1288
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:12,280
makes it speed through the uh

1289
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:14,400
Generations real fast so uh we not only

1290
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:16,440
did we kind of figured that out with ABC

1291
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:18,480
but we can apply it then further to um

1292
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:20,720
autof flowering and everything else so

1293
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:22,838
that's kind of like this weird little uh

1294
00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:24,239
twist of fate again like as we were

1295
00:52:22,838 --> 00:52:27,639
talking about doing some other weird

1296
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:29,959
projects together with CSI that the ABC

1297
00:52:27,639 --> 00:52:31,558
projects lended itself to like that kind

1298
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:34,240
of trait also carries over to other

1299
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:35,480
traits in reversals and yeah bchi and

1300
00:52:34,239 --> 00:52:37,399
helped me figure it out and make sure

1301
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:40,079
that I I wasn't losing my [ __ ] mind

1302
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:42,000
either that was really weird and

1303
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:44,559
unexpected yeah that's that's about all

1304
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,559
I can add to

1305
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:52,199
that super interesting yeah um you did

1306
00:52:49,318 --> 00:52:54,318
you did mention their Auto ABC or some

1307
00:52:52,199 --> 00:52:57,480
one of you did at some point and uh kind

1308
00:52:54,318 --> 00:53:00,759
of like to hear a bit more about that

1309
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:03,920
yeah so I've grown hyperx Auto bastard

1310
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:06,799
one and to be honest I could immediately

1311
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:08,920
tell and I might be wrong but I think he

1312
00:53:06,798 --> 00:53:12,199
worked the auto bastard a lot more than

1313
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:15,039
he worked at subfuse one the auto

1314
00:53:12,199 --> 00:53:20,118
bastard is the closest thing I can

1315
00:53:15,039 --> 00:53:22,079
compare to the JB hybrids and the pine D

1316
00:53:20,119 --> 00:53:24,838
that I've been working on you could tell

1317
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:27,240
that they're kind of more separated from

1318
00:53:24,838 --> 00:53:28,519
ABC the the res production and the

1319
00:53:27,239 --> 00:53:30,798
flower

1320
00:53:28,519 --> 00:53:32,960
density um has been significantly

1321
00:53:30,798 --> 00:53:35,599
improved and even the growth habits have

1322
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:37,838
been um drastically improved from the

1323
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:41,720
sub diffuse

1324
00:53:37,838 --> 00:53:45,279
one with the auto ABC I did come across

1325
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:49,279
some issues that occur just by combining

1326
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:52,640
because in a sense it's two mutations

1327
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:54,400
combined into one and because ABC is

1328
00:53:52,639 --> 00:53:58,358
inherently slower

1329
00:53:54,400 --> 00:54:01,440
growing um these PL don't get very

1330
00:53:58,358 --> 00:54:03,279
large cuz the auto flowering kind of

1331
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:08,039
just makes them go into flow as soon as

1332
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:10,240
they're sexually mature to as a sense

1333
00:54:08,039 --> 00:54:12,400
and I'm not surey to explain that very

1334
00:54:10,239 --> 00:54:14,479
well but a traditional plant will grow

1335
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:17,720
faster and reach a decent height before

1336
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:21,079
it starts flowering where the ABC has a

1337
00:54:17,719 --> 00:54:24,118
a slower growth exactly but overall I

1338
00:54:21,079 --> 00:54:27,480
could definitely shout out HTE on that

1339
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:30,280
one there were some really good abc hbds

1340
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:33,599
and I'd say they're much better than sub

1341
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:33,599
diffuse one and obviously

1342
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:41,240
pabc really cool

1343
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:45,119
yeah um Matt did you have any thoughts

1344
00:54:41,239 --> 00:54:46,318
on auto auto bastard or like I I you

1345
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:48,760
know I

1346
00:54:46,318 --> 00:54:51,318
think I think it's probably the future

1347
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:52,799
is is reversals like he was saying um

1348
00:54:51,318 --> 00:54:54,079
speeding through generations to make

1349
00:54:52,798 --> 00:54:56,679
Auto bastards would probably be the

1350
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:58,318
quickest way to do it and and what we

1351
00:54:56,679 --> 00:55:01,358
were talking about even with autoflowers

1352
00:54:58,318 --> 00:55:04,279
in general we realized that because you

1353
00:55:01,358 --> 00:55:06,039
cannot rev these things or clone them a

1354
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:08,119
lot of the pollinations done in

1355
00:55:06,039 --> 00:55:12,279
autoflowering is

1356
00:55:08,119 --> 00:55:13,920
just it's really gun like shotgun style

1357
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:15,160
like you got to hope that you hit

1358
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,599
something right and most people just

1359
00:55:15,159 --> 00:55:19,039
take it a few Generations whether they

1360
00:55:16,599 --> 00:55:22,119
hit something they wanted or not and

1361
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:23,920
just release it so yeah I mean I like

1362
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:26,519
the idea of fing in that in that sense

1363
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:28,639
for autof flowers too and auto ABC seems

1364
00:55:26,519 --> 00:55:31,599
be quite the ticket with two uh two

1365
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:31,598
different traits of breed

1366
00:55:32,318 --> 00:55:36,639
similar good

1367
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:38,160
point

1368
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:41,118
yeah

1369
00:55:38,159 --> 00:55:43,519
um yeah I don't really know what else do

1370
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:47,000
you guys think we could cover here yeah

1371
00:55:43,519 --> 00:55:48,880
so one thing I was thinking about was as

1372
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:52,000
we've kind of covered a little bit but

1373
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:54,280
techniques in breeding with ABC yeah

1374
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:57,798
there when I first started breeding with

1375
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:59,760
ABC it was very hard to get a grasp on

1376
00:55:57,798 --> 00:56:02,119
what am I actually working with here how

1377
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:03,480
does it inherit and while to me at this

1378
00:56:02,119 --> 00:56:06,160
point it kind of seems like general

1379
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:08,960
knowledge um for a lot of people they

1380
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:12,318
don't actually understand how ABC traits

1381
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:15,240
pass on through generation to generation

1382
00:56:12,318 --> 00:56:17,318
so I'll firstly start by just saying if

1383
00:56:15,239 --> 00:56:21,519
you have a pure ABC plant and you cross

1384
00:56:17,318 --> 00:56:24,199
that with a non-abc type 0% of your F1

1385
00:56:21,519 --> 00:56:26,759
population will be ABC from what I've

1386
00:56:24,199 --> 00:56:31,118
seen and I've grown a lot of f1s from

1387
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:33,440
the F2 you'll pull out 25% ABC types and

1388
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:37,519
you'll find that this number is actually

1389
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:40,318
a little bit closer to 20 20 to 22% and

1390
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:42,639
that's just because ABC seeds are

1391
00:56:40,318 --> 00:56:43,759
inherently harder to germinate so you

1392
00:56:42,639 --> 00:56:45,920
will have a few seeds that won't

1393
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:47,760
germinate and those ones will most

1394
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:49,960
likely or more likely than not be the

1395
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:54,039
ABC types so that will kind of throw up

1396
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:57,240
your ratios but 25% of your ABC seeds

1397
00:56:54,039 --> 00:57:01,160
will be the doubling up of the ABC

1398
00:56:57,239 --> 00:57:03,639
um trait in your F3 population if you

1399
00:57:01,159 --> 00:57:08,318
cross an ABC type with an ABC type

1400
00:57:03,639 --> 00:57:12,480
you'll get 100% ABC type within that

1401
00:57:08,318 --> 00:57:14,880
F3 and and and obviously F4 and onwards

1402
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:16,920
if you cross another situation which a

1403
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:19,400
lot of people have been doing I've seen

1404
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:22,000
is you'll have an ABC F1 and you'll

1405
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:24,480
cross it back to an ABC and that will

1406
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,639
result in 50% ABC types in that

1407
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:28,599
following generation I'm not too sure

1408
00:57:26,639 --> 00:57:30,239
how you would label that it's like an F1

1409
00:57:28,599 --> 00:57:32,519
back cross to

1410
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:34,000
ABC and something that I've been coing

1411
00:57:32,519 --> 00:57:38,159
with and I've actually spoken to CSI

1412
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:41,440
about a little bit is doing an F1 hybrid

1413
00:57:38,159 --> 00:57:44,679
so let's just say ABC hybrid

1414
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:46,400
times a non-abc type like a clone only

1415
00:57:44,679 --> 00:57:49,480
something that you want desirable traits

1416
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:52,440
from getting that F1 population which is

1417
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:54,159
carrying one set of the ABC Gene and

1418
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:56,960
then Crossing that back to that clone

1419
00:57:54,159 --> 00:58:00,078
only so that will produce

1420
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:03,000
50% of your plants will have no ABC

1421
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:04,920
trait and then the other 50% will have

1422
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,318
like have one set so none of them will

1423
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:09,920
look like ABC and half of them will

1424
00:58:07,318 --> 00:58:12,159
carry the tray so then you do an open

1425
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:14,280
pollination of those and you segregate

1426
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:18,038
your mail separate them into each so you

1427
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:20,200
do different lots and then from those

1428
00:58:18,039 --> 00:58:22,559
when you pull out it will be a very

1429
00:58:20,199 --> 00:58:24,318
small percentage maybe about 5% ABC

1430
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:27,480
types in that next Generation depending

1431
00:58:24,318 --> 00:58:30,679
on where your males lie

1432
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:32,440
you'll do a double outcross so you're

1433
00:58:30,679 --> 00:58:34,440
kind of attempting to speed up the

1434
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:37,798
process of locking down some trade so

1435
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:39,240
I'm going to experiment with that um so

1436
00:58:37,798 --> 00:58:41,280
that'll be quite interesting to see how

1437
00:58:39,239 --> 00:58:43,038
that goes because that's all just

1438
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,798
theoretical and that could also be

1439
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:46,359
applied to other sets of breing such as

1440
00:58:44,798 --> 00:58:48,838
Auto flowers if you were trying to speed

1441
00:58:46,358 --> 00:58:51,920
up out Crossing but the good thing about

1442
00:58:48,838 --> 00:58:54,558
ABC is is you can pull out your ABC

1443
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:57,200
types or your non-abc types in the

1444
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:59,000
seedling stage unlike Auto flowers where

1445
00:58:57,199 --> 00:59:01,439
you don't actually know if it's an auto

1446
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:03,480
so you can have a th seedlings and you

1447
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:06,358
can automatically pull out the 50 that

1448
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:08,280
are ABC types within week two so that's

1449
00:59:06,358 --> 00:59:11,159
quite handy so you can really speed up

1450
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:11,160
that selection

1451
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:16,599
process and another thing I'd like to

1452
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:20,919
say with the techniques I think it's

1453
00:59:16,599 --> 00:59:25,318
very important to choose your outcross

1454
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:28,000
um your outcross non-abc type carefully

1455
00:59:25,318 --> 00:59:30,239
and think about what does ABC need and

1456
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:34,079
what can this outcross

1457
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:35,719
give um to ABC that will improve those

1458
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:36,839
traits that you're after whether you're

1459
00:59:35,719 --> 00:59:39,159
trying

1460
00:59:36,838 --> 00:59:40,318
to increase the flower density like I

1461
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:42,639
was saying with the cookies hybrid I

1462
00:59:40,318 --> 00:59:45,920
typically don't work with cookies but I

1463
00:59:42,639 --> 00:59:48,960
I do notice that it has very good low

1464
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:50,400
density and if let's say you're a big

1465
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:52,679
fan of

1466
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:54,838
depine uh something like train wreck

1467
00:59:52,679 --> 00:59:57,279
might be a perfect out cross and it

1468
00:59:54,838 --> 00:59:59,519
might just uh enhance what you've

1469
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:02,400
already got so it really depends on what

1470
00:59:59,519 --> 01:00:03,679
your goal is and then once you've done

1471
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,599
this out Crossing you really need to

1472
01:00:03,679 --> 01:00:08,919
fill your breed it and you really want

1473
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:11,680
to do careful selections through your F2

1474
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:13,200
F3 and because you'll find that your F3

1475
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:14,838
will still be extremely variable and

1476
01:00:13,199 --> 01:00:17,798
you'll still be getting those pure ABC

1477
01:00:14,838 --> 01:00:20,119
types popping up and the last point

1478
01:00:17,798 --> 01:00:21,519
would be you're going to need numbers

1479
01:00:20,119 --> 01:00:23,599
that's just the reality with working

1480
01:00:21,519 --> 01:00:25,358
with ABC you

1481
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:28,400
can't like obviously you can get a

1482
01:00:25,358 --> 01:00:29,960
lottery ticket win but You' be a lot

1483
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,798
more likely to find a good plant if

1484
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:34,838
you're running good numbers and you see

1485
01:00:31,798 --> 01:00:36,599
that with csi's kind of work he's got

1486
01:00:34,838 --> 01:00:37,838
reasonable numbers to dig through and I

1487
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:39,280
think that's pretty essential and that's

1488
01:00:37,838 --> 01:00:41,239
definitely what I found especially when

1489
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:43,400
you're trying to find outliers within

1490
01:00:41,239 --> 01:00:43,399
the

1491
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:49,599
population I like the idea of like

1492
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:51,079
doubling down on the toin just kind I

1493
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:53,160
find that really funny but it also makes

1494
01:00:51,079 --> 01:00:56,039
sense some people you know a lot of our

1495
01:00:53,159 --> 01:00:58,719
a lot of our guys like love to penine so

1496
01:00:56,039 --> 01:00:59,599
I guess you can like you said uh earlier

1497
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:03,519
try to make it more like

1498
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:05,599
multi-dimensional to pinoline than yeah

1499
01:01:03,519 --> 01:01:08,880
exactly and that's what that pinear

1500
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:11,880
jigar has done it's it's it's definitely

1501
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:13,039
toeline but it's like I don't know other

1502
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:15,480
ways to put it but it's threedimensional

1503
01:01:13,039 --> 01:01:18,039
it's got like a fizziness to it and it's

1504
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:20,039
got this syrupy to it and it's almost

1505
01:01:18,039 --> 01:01:23,920
sweet and it's a little bit gross but in

1506
01:01:20,039 --> 01:01:26,640
a good way it's just um in comparison in

1507
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:28,039
comparison to Pure ABC which is this

1508
01:01:26,639 --> 01:01:29,759
in the other words like it's flat and

1509
01:01:28,039 --> 01:01:30,920
it's quite boring so you're kind of just

1510
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:33,000
working with what you got and just

1511
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:34,559
pumping it up and that's another way

1512
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,119
instead of just going I'm going to

1513
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:38,519
completely scrap to penal and I think

1514
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:42,200
you could probably

1515
01:01:38,519 --> 01:01:44,599
say maybe that's what hk's done maybe

1516
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:46,759
not but his plants are definitely still

1517
01:01:44,599 --> 01:01:49,760
to penine I know he's on a lot of outc

1518
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:52,640
Crossing so much out Crossing so much

1519
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:54,720
exactly but they're still talene so it

1520
01:01:52,639 --> 01:01:56,759
goes to show how stubborn talene is so

1521
01:01:54,719 --> 01:01:58,558
if you just wanted to just work with

1522
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:00,720
what you got is another option if you do

1523
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:03,798
like to penine I'm a fan of to penine

1524
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:06,318
I'll proudly admit that yeah but I'd

1525
01:02:03,798 --> 01:02:08,639
like to create variations within the ABC

1526
01:02:06,318 --> 01:02:09,838
I don't want just one ABC that's dep

1527
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:11,598
pendal in and that's all you're going to

1528
01:02:09,838 --> 01:02:14,880
get it would be good to have some

1529
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:17,720
variety and create different strains if

1530
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:19,680
you would call it of ABC which I've

1531
01:02:17,719 --> 01:02:23,679
started

1532
01:02:19,679 --> 01:02:24,838
doing hash team to pinoline that's right

1533
01:02:23,679 --> 01:02:26,960
that's

1534
01:02:24,838 --> 01:02:28,159
right

1535
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:30,199
I think there's a lot of value in it

1536
01:02:28,159 --> 01:02:33,759
especially with like like I noticed with

1537
01:02:30,199 --> 01:02:35,239
sweet things or or fruity it's easy to

1538
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:37,278
find things that are fruity and sweet

1539
01:02:35,239 --> 01:02:39,838
that don't carry that to the flavor

1540
01:02:37,278 --> 01:02:41,599
whereas when you cross these things to

1541
01:02:39,838 --> 01:02:43,880
terpinolene a lot of times the flavor

1542
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:45,760
will then carry with the trinoline so it

1543
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:49,559
be like a it's hard to explain like a

1544
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:51,520
menthol version of that flavor yeah yeah

1545
01:02:49,559 --> 01:02:54,200
it clearly is a very nice Counterpoint

1546
01:02:51,519 --> 01:02:57,519
to other yeah other flavors and it makes

1547
01:02:54,199 --> 01:02:59,078
amazing extracts in extracts for those

1548
01:02:57,519 --> 01:03:02,119
who like

1549
01:02:59,079 --> 01:03:04,798
extracts yes like with that jigar for

1550
01:03:02,119 --> 01:03:07,278
example which is a toen dominant I ran

1551
01:03:04,798 --> 01:03:10,318
out it was 80 plants and it was around

1552
01:03:07,278 --> 01:03:12,079
40 females give or take and I narrowed

1553
01:03:10,318 --> 01:03:14,880
it down to four

1554
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:16,559
females and they're all got different

1555
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:18,599
characteristics like you were saying one

1556
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:21,160
of them has a menthol flavor to it which

1557
01:03:18,599 --> 01:03:23,838
I think's like it was one outli and it's

1558
01:03:21,159 --> 01:03:27,078
quite interesting it's it's almost fresh

1559
01:03:23,838 --> 01:03:30,358
breath kind of yes

1560
01:03:27,079 --> 01:03:33,359
feel to it and then another one is just

1561
01:03:30,358 --> 01:03:35,880
extreme resin like just a what you know

1562
01:03:33,358 --> 01:03:38,078
classic resin bomb it's just this gluey

1563
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:40,838
sticky thing and then I've got one which

1564
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:44,599
is a which be named the club lime cut

1565
01:03:40,838 --> 01:03:48,199
and it say baseball B ABC not very dense

1566
01:03:44,599 --> 01:03:50,519
but just insane yielding plant yeah also

1567
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:52,038
very lime centered and then there's the

1568
01:03:50,519 --> 01:03:54,480
allrounder which I'm using the next

1569
01:03:52,039 --> 01:03:55,880
round of breeding and that's just the

1570
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:58,240
bin chicken which has been getting

1571
01:03:55,880 --> 01:04:00,240
around Australia so it's it's pretty

1572
01:03:58,239 --> 01:04:02,479
funny to actually have a ABC clone

1573
01:04:00,239 --> 01:04:06,919
that's starting to will be circulating

1574
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:10,240
Australia soon it should it's a you

1575
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:11,400
know yeah I remember when when Caleb

1576
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:13,159
brought these out there was a person

1577
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:15,358
from Australia that we knew and he was

1578
01:04:13,159 --> 01:04:17,199
raging one because it was called

1579
01:04:15,358 --> 01:04:19,078
Australian bastard he did not like that

1580
01:04:17,199 --> 01:04:20,919
name and two because he said it was

1581
01:04:19,079 --> 01:04:22,960
totally fake he'd never seen it

1582
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:24,838
therefore it wasn't from Australia and

1583
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:27,039
to that point like it's an Australian

1584
01:04:24,838 --> 01:04:29,000
Heritage strain I I I think it's awesome

1585
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:32,278
that it's circulating there

1586
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:35,679
more yeah and I'm purposely going to try

1587
01:04:32,278 --> 01:04:38,599
and work more Australian varieties into

1588
01:04:35,679 --> 01:04:41,679
Australian bastard that's cool just for

1589
01:04:38,599 --> 01:04:43,599
yeah because Australia has or I've also

1590
01:04:41,679 --> 01:04:45,399
come more into the scene recently but

1591
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:47,200
we've got some seriously good Cuts

1592
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:48,760
getting around Australia now like it's

1593
01:04:47,199 --> 01:04:50,719
just this system that's starting to

1594
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:52,599
circulate I know it's obviously nothing

1595
01:04:50,719 --> 01:04:54,919
in comparison to the US it's almost like

1596
01:04:52,599 --> 01:04:56,559
a baby version but it's just beginning

1597
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:59,720
and I think it's only to get better from

1598
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:01,039
here so I've got I'll just shout out a

1599
01:04:59,719 --> 01:05:03,399
couple cuts I've got just out of

1600
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:05,278
curiosity you guys might be interested

1601
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:08,480
what's getting around there's this one

1602
01:05:05,278 --> 01:05:11,000
it's called hudo and it's a crossroad

1603
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:12,599
chem time skunk plant I'm not 100% sure

1604
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:16,960
on it lineage but it's basically just a

1605
01:05:12,599 --> 01:05:18,440
chem plant and it is it reeks so I

1606
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:20,039
imagine that's something that you would

1607
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:21,920
you guys be pretty familiar with in the

1608
01:05:20,039 --> 01:05:23,799
states and then there's another one

1609
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:25,920
which is just a crazy runs cut which is

1610
01:05:23,798 --> 01:05:28,079
a lemon tree dominant hybrid so it's

1611
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:32,159
just a lemon tree times

1612
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:33,519
runs and it just obviously it's just

1613
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:35,639
it's it's interesting to get these

1614
01:05:33,519 --> 01:05:37,440
standards like I think that's something

1615
01:05:35,639 --> 01:05:39,679
that Australians don't have that people

1616
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:41,920
in the US might have you can grow these

1617
01:05:39,679 --> 01:05:44,558
cuts that you receive and you can have

1618
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:46,920
this kind of a standard that this is TK

1619
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:49,559
and that's a great cut and you can kind

1620
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:51,440
of assess qualities of other plants from

1621
01:05:49,559 --> 01:05:53,519
having these high standards so it's

1622
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:54,960
really good to see The Benchmark plant

1623
01:05:53,519 --> 01:05:56,358
yeah exactly that's the perfect word

1624
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:58,159
benchmark

1625
01:05:56,358 --> 01:06:00,558
so yeah got like this red wine hash

1626
01:05:58,159 --> 01:06:02,480
plant a few interesting cuts that are

1627
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:06,440
getting around that's a deep chunk

1628
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:08,119
hybrid and and rasu M mqueen from heavy

1629
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:13,358
days that's another one that's really

1630
01:06:08,119 --> 01:06:14,480
interesting yeah yeah and also we go on

1631
01:06:13,358 --> 01:06:18,239
I was just going to say you know

1632
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:21,079
obviously on the show uh we we

1633
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:24,558
definitely are proponent of difference

1634
01:06:21,079 --> 01:06:28,318
and uh diversity and so it's great it's

1635
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:31,160
great to hear um that there are new and

1636
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:33,358
interesting things happening over

1637
01:06:31,159 --> 01:06:35,078
there yeah and I'll push in even further

1638
01:06:33,358 --> 01:06:37,960
to say some of the interesting stuff

1639
01:06:35,079 --> 01:06:40,839
I've grown because I do love diversity

1640
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:43,440
and I've been growing SE 1979 xmus Bud

1641
01:06:40,838 --> 01:06:45,960
from csis reproduction and they're

1642
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:48,838
really interesting and I I think maybe

1643
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:51,639
even I find it more interesting the most

1644
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:54,358
because I've been brought up on these

1645
01:06:51,639 --> 01:06:57,118
long flowering tie type plants and this

1646
01:06:54,358 --> 01:06:58,598
is the opposite and of the spectrum so

1647
01:06:57,119 --> 01:06:59,358
that's really that's really cool to see

1648
01:06:58,599 --> 01:07:01,760
and

1649
01:06:59,358 --> 01:07:03,278
obviously it would make a great partner

1650
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:06,839
as well for what's over

1651
01:07:03,278 --> 01:07:09,119
there exactly and the OG Kush purple

1652
01:07:06,838 --> 01:07:11,119
Ural hybrids I've recently done some of

1653
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:12,640
those and I've been doing pink a decent

1654
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:15,160
search through the pinks and perss

1655
01:07:12,639 --> 01:07:18,078
population like lot one lot two lot

1656
01:07:15,159 --> 01:07:20,278
three just gone through them and they're

1657
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:22,318
being actually it's the first plan I've

1658
01:07:20,278 --> 01:07:24,679
grown where I've never been like this is

1659
01:07:22,318 --> 01:07:26,639
like this or this is like this it's

1660
01:07:24,679 --> 01:07:28,960
something that obviously ly doesn't

1661
01:07:26,639 --> 01:07:30,239
circulate in Australia whatever I know

1662
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:34,358
it's the Killer

1663
01:07:30,239 --> 01:07:37,038
Queen Hawaiian combination but whatever

1664
01:07:34,358 --> 01:07:39,000
is in that pinks and perss this is not

1665
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:41,278
something you see in getting around

1666
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Australia so that's quite interesting

1667
01:07:41,278 --> 01:07:46,159
you know the the killer Queens mostly

1668
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:48,920
c99 Romulan um the

1669
01:07:46,159 --> 01:07:50,038
Hawaiian maybe but I tend to think it's

1670
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:51,760
probably what you're seeing in the

1671
01:07:50,039 --> 01:07:54,440
variation in Mendo perss that's coming

1672
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:56,359
through the Blackberry Widow that's in

1673
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:57,838
that

1674
01:07:56,358 --> 01:08:00,798
unique as [ __ ] even over here the

1675
01:07:57,838 --> 01:08:05,920
Blackberry Widow okay yeah I'm getting a

1676
01:08:00,798 --> 01:08:10,519
lot of uh like dark red wine yeah nose

1677
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:14,480
to that one so that's quite interesting

1678
01:08:10,519 --> 01:08:16,359
yeah I wanted to kind of make uh sorry I

1679
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:18,798
kind of want to pose a more speculative

1680
01:08:16,359 --> 01:08:21,039
question to both of you just for fun um

1681
01:08:18,798 --> 01:08:24,439
you know if you could if you could do

1682
01:08:21,039 --> 01:08:26,399
ABC work with any other line or cut you

1683
01:08:24,439 --> 01:08:28,479
know what would you speculate to be fun

1684
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:30,719
to try out beyond the ones that we've

1685
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:33,678
already

1686
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:35,679
tried go ahead I'm predictable too

1687
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:37,600
predictable all right so I've actually

1688
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:39,440
got a buddy who's doing a project which

1689
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:42,759
I'm really invested in I'll be growing

1690
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:46,399
out his F2 population so he's gotten a

1691
01:08:42,759 --> 01:08:51,238
duar hybrid from me and he's crossed it

1692
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:54,439
to a Indonesian land race so it's this

1693
01:08:51,238 --> 01:08:59,559
extremely long flowering sativa

1694
01:08:54,439 --> 01:09:02,198
type and I think in there so the F2 male

1695
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:05,759
that is used is the ABC and it's a

1696
01:09:02,198 --> 01:09:07,238
really resonance male early resin and

1697
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:09,679
it's been outcrossed that's that's one

1698
01:09:07,238 --> 01:09:11,039
of the jelly breath hybrids so it's been

1699
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:13,199
heavily

1700
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:16,278
outcrossed and so that potency should

1701
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:19,719
carry along so this should reintroduce

1702
01:09:16,279 --> 01:09:23,080
the sativa trait that du ABC has but

1703
01:09:19,719 --> 01:09:26,399
this time without a lot of those

1704
01:09:23,079 --> 01:09:28,039
negatively Associated traits hopefully

1705
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:29,519
and in theory you could create something

1706
01:09:28,039 --> 01:09:32,000
that will grow really well in Australia

1707
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:35,159
and Outdoors and grow really big and

1708
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:38,399
also be potent potent and like highly

1709
01:09:35,158 --> 01:09:40,559
resinous which it's kind of has the

1710
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:42,759
potential to be a really good outdoor

1711
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:45,159
crop so I'll be digging through those F2

1712
01:09:42,759 --> 01:09:47,119
populations shortly I'm really looking

1713
01:09:45,158 --> 01:09:50,719
forward to that so that's something that

1714
01:09:47,119 --> 01:09:52,198
so my PN lies with these land race theas

1715
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:55,719
um so I'll

1716
01:09:52,198 --> 01:09:58,000
be doing some Burmese work soon gotten

1717
01:09:55,719 --> 01:09:59,439
those and some panar red let's have a

1718
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:03,000
look at those I've never actually dug

1719
01:09:59,439 --> 01:10:04,719
into those those seed stocks before and

1720
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:07,000
if I find something good I'll be maybe

1721
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:10,480
incorporating that into this

1722
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:13,319
sativa ABC hybrid which will hopefully

1723
01:10:10,479 --> 01:10:16,718
be a sativa hybrid like pure ABC is a

1724
01:10:13,319 --> 01:10:18,039
Southeast Asian hybrid I I'd assume but

1725
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:20,679
this will be a

1726
01:10:18,039 --> 01:10:23,439
refined ABC sativa that is actually

1727
01:10:20,679 --> 01:10:26,480
practical to grow so that that's I'm

1728
01:10:23,439 --> 01:10:28,639
interested in yeah that's unique I like

1729
01:10:26,479 --> 01:10:30,639
that answer I just go bloop on it

1730
01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:33,280
because that's I was gonna say blue

1731
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:36,199
bastard yeah I mean I did the the creamy

1732
01:10:33,279 --> 01:10:39,519
punch one so GNA see how well that turns

1733
01:10:36,198 --> 01:10:42,719
out close enough creamy punch is that a

1734
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:45,679
blue bonnet dominant cross yeah it's a

1735
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:48,439
banana punch Blue Bonnet and um silver

1736
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:50,000
Pearl Blue Bonnet combined so it just

1737
01:10:48,439 --> 01:10:52,639
reinforced the Bonnet which is already

1738
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:56,760
dominant in both you know and just

1739
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:59,860
little slight grapey version of it

1740
01:10:56,760 --> 01:11:01,360
nice yeah we'll see how it

1741
01:10:59,859 --> 01:11:03,279
[Music]

1742
01:11:01,359 --> 01:11:05,198
goes

1743
01:11:03,279 --> 01:11:07,000
yeah we have we have people growing

1744
01:11:05,198 --> 01:11:09,678
those out already right yeah you seen

1745
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:13,119
some yeah oh yeah that's awesome I just

1746
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:15,158
GNA say reflect on BS um you know

1747
01:11:13,119 --> 01:11:17,238
thought that was like man you really are

1748
01:11:15,158 --> 01:11:20,119
working with so many different Fringe

1749
01:11:17,238 --> 01:11:21,879
you know or like peripheral like you

1750
01:11:20,119 --> 01:11:23,439
know threshold types it's really cool

1751
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:27,039
it's actually really amazing to hear

1752
01:11:23,439 --> 01:11:30,039
about yeah and I'll also work in time

1753
01:11:27,039 --> 01:11:32,880
yeah I'll say that I've never sold flow

1754
01:11:30,039 --> 01:11:34,880
that's something that I'll admit um so

1755
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:37,880
I'm always just growing for me and my

1756
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:41,079
friends so I I have no desire yield is

1757
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:44,359
not an issue I'm just all about

1758
01:11:41,079 --> 01:11:46,639
varieties and this is for fun for me and

1759
01:11:44,359 --> 01:11:47,880
hence the breeding with ABC because I

1760
01:11:46,639 --> 01:11:49,359
think you'd have to be like Matt was

1761
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:51,000
saying earlier you really got to be a

1762
01:11:49,359 --> 01:11:53,279
certain type of person to commit to

1763
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:56,639
breeding with ABC like I'll be pushing

1764
01:11:53,279 --> 01:11:59,719
on five years with working with it

1765
01:11:56,639 --> 01:12:01,480
and only in the last year and a half

1766
01:11:59,719 --> 01:12:03,639
have I felt like I've really gotten

1767
01:12:01,479 --> 01:12:08,000
somewhere and finally created something

1768
01:12:03,639 --> 01:12:10,000
that I'm proud of yeah so yeah yeah it's

1769
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:12,319
hard to sell it's it's hard to work

1770
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:14,479
lines truly work them unless you have a

1771
01:12:12,319 --> 01:12:16,439
lot of satellite spaces and be focused

1772
01:12:14,479 --> 01:12:18,439
on flower cells it's almost impossible

1773
01:12:16,439 --> 01:12:20,279
and at some point you have to make that

1774
01:12:18,439 --> 01:12:23,319
decision unless you're wealthy enough to

1775
01:12:20,279 --> 01:12:25,840
have tons of different flower

1776
01:12:23,319 --> 01:12:28,799
sites I appreciate it

1777
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:31,000
absolutely yeah immense amounts of work

1778
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,000
for

1779
01:12:31,119 --> 01:12:36,359
sure all right Ben do you have anything

1780
01:12:33,439 --> 01:12:38,960
else you want to get in or talk about or

1781
01:12:36,359 --> 01:12:42,158
plug

1782
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:45,119
anything good question I think I think

1783
01:12:42,158 --> 01:12:46,759
we've covered covered everything yeah

1784
01:12:45,119 --> 01:12:49,238
unless you guys have got anything else

1785
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:51,400
you wanted to ask uh I had some R you

1786
01:12:49,238 --> 01:12:53,519
know random a random question was has

1787
01:12:51,399 --> 01:12:55,599
anyone on the Discord taken you up on

1788
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:59,040
some of those beans maybe this this show

1789
01:12:55,600 --> 01:13:00,239
will prompt more of them to uh yeah have

1790
01:12:59,039 --> 01:13:02,519
a go at

1791
01:13:00,238 --> 01:13:05,439
it yeah and i' would actually offer some

1792
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:08,000
advice that' be one thing I'd say and I

1793
01:13:05,439 --> 01:13:10,960
don't want to be um

1794
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:13,760
self-advertising but if you're trying to

1795
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:16,920
make an ABC hybrid you're much better

1796
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:19,600
off starting at a point that is already

1797
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:21,319
you sorry I'll reword that you're best

1798
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:24,560
starting off at the point that's the

1799
01:13:21,319 --> 01:13:26,359
highest work stage of the hybrid it it

1800
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:28,639
almost be like if you compare it to Auto

1801
01:13:26,359 --> 01:13:31,519
flowers and if you I'm going to make an

1802
01:13:28,639 --> 01:13:34,039
Autoflower hybrid of wedding

1803
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:36,719
cake you wouldn't want to grab something

1804
01:13:34,039 --> 01:13:40,000
from 20 years ago you would want to grab

1805
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:41,840
the most recent work and I would highly

1806
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:44,719
recommend if anyone was really wanting

1807
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:48,279
to make an ABC hybrid start with a

1808
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:49,800
dualar hybrid because that outli has

1809
01:13:48,279 --> 01:13:52,399
already been found these plants already

1810
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:54,800
grow three times faster than normal ABC

1811
01:13:52,399 --> 01:13:57,359
they produce potent flowers they smell a

1812
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:59,600
lot stronger they have really nice

1813
01:13:57,359 --> 01:14:01,639
effects and they I think they'll be

1814
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:04,239
easier to push into different directions

1815
01:14:01,639 --> 01:14:07,840
because that to penelene trait has been

1816
01:14:04,238 --> 01:14:09,759
broken to an extent and it pops up at a

1817
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:13,159
quite a frequent rate you'll find plants

1818
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:16,560
that smell nothing like the penine so I

1819
01:14:13,158 --> 01:14:18,519
think it's a much a a very good shortcut

1820
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:19,679
and I wouldn't even say a shortcut but

1821
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:23,520
I'll just say it's just kind of a

1822
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:26,440
collaboration with the community to push

1823
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:29,080
this plant further would be just to work

1824
01:14:26,439 --> 01:14:32,319
as a bit of a team because this plan is

1825
01:14:29,079 --> 01:14:34,760
very stubborn very and where where can

1826
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:36,960
people find your seeds if they want them

1827
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:38,560
yeah so in Australia I do stock them

1828
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:41,679
through a little seed bank pop shelf

1829
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:44,719
seed bank otherwise you can hit me up on

1830
01:14:41,679 --> 01:14:46,800
the Discord chat like in uh the bre

1831
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:49,039
Syndicate Discord which I really like

1832
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:50,079
that community and I'm in a few other

1833
01:14:49,039 --> 01:14:52,359
discords I've actually got my own

1834
01:14:50,079 --> 01:14:54,079
Discord going yeah tell us about that

1835
01:14:52,359 --> 01:14:56,479
tell us about it how do people find it

1836
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:57,880
it's it's just a mutant discourse it's

1837
01:14:56,479 --> 01:14:59,359
where people who are breeding mutants

1838
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:02,639
because it is a funny little it's a

1839
01:14:59,359 --> 01:15:05,759
wormhole in a wormhole yeah yeah it's a

1840
01:15:02,639 --> 01:15:08,079
wormhole and a wormhole so you've got

1841
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:10,440
your weed nerds and then you got these

1842
01:15:08,079 --> 01:15:13,039
weed nerds who love mutants so it's a

1843
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:16,439
certain person but I'd love to share

1844
01:15:13,039 --> 01:15:18,000
that um that Discord with people maybe

1845
01:15:16,439 --> 01:15:20,359
you can even post that in the Breeders

1846
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,238
Syndicate just for people who really

1847
01:15:20,359 --> 01:15:24,238
want to Deep dive into it and they can

1848
01:15:22,238 --> 01:15:27,000
grab some duar seeds and there's people

1849
01:15:24,238 --> 01:15:29,479
with ducks fo and Frido hybrids and all

1850
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:32,319
other hybrids that you know might people

1851
01:15:29,479 --> 01:15:34,919
might find interesting for sure yeah

1852
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:36,399
without blooding your breed syndicate

1853
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:39,399
with ABC

1854
01:15:36,399 --> 01:15:40,960
hybrids oh I've Loved I've loved seeing

1855
01:15:39,399 --> 01:15:42,719
like your pictures and like any of the

1856
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:44,880
exchanges you've had on there I just I

1857
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:48,600
think it's fascinating yeah and it's

1858
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:53,600
such a it's such a nice change from you

1859
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:53,600
know the usual The Usual Suspects and

1860
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:59,679
topics

1861
01:15:56,198 --> 01:16:02,119
yeah yeah I'd love to um hear about and

1862
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:05,158
it be a shout out to CSI obviously

1863
01:16:02,119 --> 01:16:07,399
during the initial release but um I'm

1864
01:16:05,158 --> 01:16:10,238
I'm very keen to see where he takes his

1865
01:16:07,399 --> 01:16:13,198
ABC work yeah and I would even challenge

1866
01:16:10,238 --> 01:16:15,439
him to say you should grow a um a duar

1867
01:16:13,198 --> 01:16:16,678
Hybrid next to one so we can see how

1868
01:16:15,439 --> 01:16:19,879
much better it

1869
01:16:16,679 --> 01:16:22,359
grows I'm sure he will sure he will yeah

1870
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:24,639
I think you'd really I was I was going

1871
01:16:22,359 --> 01:16:26,359
to make a a point relative to what you

1872
01:16:24,639 --> 01:16:28,520
were saying say about like you know if

1873
01:16:26,359 --> 01:16:30,759
you want to make a hybrid Don't Take The

1874
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:34,080
Long route uh you know pick something

1875
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:35,560
more a bit further Downstream um I guess

1876
01:16:34,079 --> 01:16:38,880
the Counterpoint of that is unless you

1877
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:40,880
were like super super passionate and you

1878
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:43,039
you wanted to have a good kind of like

1879
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:44,760
revolutionary go at it uh in the way

1880
01:16:43,039 --> 01:16:47,880
that someone might with order flowers at

1881
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:49,520
some point yeah um because you know

1882
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:51,760
there is also an argument to be made

1883
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:54,199
that like okay I don't want to say ABC

1884
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:56,480
here but with autoflowers that like some

1885
01:16:54,198 --> 01:16:58,359
of that ground work potentially could be

1886
01:16:56,479 --> 01:17:01,119
redone and it would be interesting would

1887
01:16:58,359 --> 01:17:02,719
it not I agree and I'll even touch on if

1888
01:17:01,119 --> 01:17:07,399
it's not too late to go back to the

1889
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:09,520
topic pure ABC pure ABC like in saying

1890
01:17:07,399 --> 01:17:12,399
going back I really recommend people

1891
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:14,199
grow it if you don't expect to get any

1892
01:17:12,399 --> 01:17:16,079
decent flower off it but if you wanted

1893
01:17:14,198 --> 01:17:19,519
to see the weirdest and wildest

1894
01:17:16,079 --> 01:17:22,679
Expressions within cannabis pure ABC is

1895
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:25,239
amazing and um I'm Keen to I've actually

1896
01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:28,279
acquired some really old ABC stock from

1897
01:17:25,238 --> 01:17:29,479
that fell up North so just ones that

1898
01:17:28,279 --> 01:17:31,840
have been in this cup I've managed to

1899
01:17:29,479 --> 01:17:33,319
get a couple of them to germ and I'll be

1900
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:35,199
doing a little open pollination with

1901
01:17:33,319 --> 01:17:37,559
just what I can manage to germ from this

1902
01:17:35,198 --> 01:17:40,198
old um bag of seeds that were sitting in

1903
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:41,480
his drawer and that'll be interesting

1904
01:17:40,198 --> 01:17:43,198
just to have a little dig through and

1905
01:17:41,479 --> 01:17:45,959
obviously just for a preservationist

1906
01:17:43,198 --> 01:17:47,439
kind of approach yeah because I do think

1907
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:49,719
it is important to preserve it in its

1908
01:17:47,439 --> 01:17:51,119
pure form just because it is so unique

1909
01:17:49,719 --> 01:17:53,319
and like you say sometimes you want to

1910
01:17:51,119 --> 01:17:55,359
backtrack and maybe we'll lose some of

1911
01:17:53,319 --> 01:17:57,119
these traits that we

1912
01:17:55,359 --> 01:17:59,039
could be advantageous like the drought

1913
01:17:57,119 --> 01:18:01,000
tolerance could be lost if we keep

1914
01:17:59,039 --> 01:18:03,319
hybridizing it and it might be something

1915
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:05,520
we want to reintroduce or just something

1916
01:18:03,319 --> 01:18:09,079
just for a you know a Heritage

1917
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:12,040
borderline kind of approach to cannabis

1918
01:18:09,079 --> 01:18:14,119
it's definitely an interesting plant but

1919
01:18:12,039 --> 01:18:17,158
obviously you know Tak into account all

1920
01:18:14,119 --> 01:18:18,519
the various cautions and uh learnings

1921
01:18:17,158 --> 01:18:20,719
that you you know you've you've already

1922
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:24,920
mentioned uh like you said it would not

1923
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:26,960
be like a an easy or short Journey um no

1924
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:28,880
exactly You' be growing it for fun and

1925
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:30,719
you'd be doing it for passion and even

1926
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:33,560
if you're just growing a pure ABC just

1927
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:35,639
to grow it not to breed with it because

1928
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:37,920
you might want to see I've seen and I

1929
01:18:35,639 --> 01:18:40,960
I'll point out one crazy thing I've seen

1930
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:44,199
in pure ABC I've seen a plant with what

1931
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:46,560
you would call thorns on pure ABC so

1932
01:18:44,198 --> 01:18:49,279
little Nubs on the base of the stems and

1933
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:51,320
almost they're not quite spiky but like

1934
01:18:49,279 --> 01:18:54,039
they rounded Thorns going all the way up

1935
01:18:51,319 --> 01:18:56,359
the the Woody parts of the plant and

1936
01:18:54,039 --> 01:18:59,519
this plant was crawling like it was

1937
01:18:56,359 --> 01:19:03,238
maybe three times wider than it was tall

1938
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:06,159
the leaves were I'm going to say a

1939
01:19:03,238 --> 01:19:09,559
centimeter across in the w point a very

1940
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:11,119
small leav yeah it produced almost no

1941
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:14,840
flower you could

1942
01:19:11,119 --> 01:19:18,119
not it um it flowered for about 20 weeks

1943
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:21,440
and maybe produced enough for half a

1944
01:19:18,119 --> 01:19:23,599
joint yeah that makes sense but just out

1945
01:19:21,439 --> 01:19:24,719
of out of fun it's fun to grow and you

1946
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:26,120
don't have to worry about anyone

1947
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:30,079
recognizing it because no one is going

1948
01:19:26,119 --> 01:19:30,079
to look at that thing and think it's

1949
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:35,439
can I just had a thought that like uh

1950
01:19:34,079 --> 01:19:37,158
kind of zooming out all the way and kind

1951
01:19:35,439 --> 01:19:41,079
of reflecting on this whole topic

1952
01:19:37,158 --> 01:19:41,960
conversation um I think it's such a nice

1953
01:19:41,079 --> 01:19:45,279
uh

1954
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:47,719
contrast um because this is cannabis at

1955
01:19:45,279 --> 01:19:49,880
The Fringe like this is this is what you

1956
01:19:47,719 --> 01:19:52,439
get to see at its Outer Limits like of

1957
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:54,760
its genetic potential and diversity and

1958
01:19:52,439 --> 01:19:56,119
so far away from you know all the modern

1959
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:58,840
stuff that we obviously have to keep

1960
01:19:56,119 --> 01:20:01,760
talking about that are kind of exploited

1961
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:05,520
to [ __ ] uh you could say like uh you

1962
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:08,639
know it we're at the kind of like center

1963
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:10,320
of the world pool I guess of genetics

1964
01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:12,159
like cookies and all that this is kind

1965
01:20:10,319 --> 01:20:14,519
of like the vast you know this is like

1966
01:20:12,158 --> 01:20:17,119
going extreme out all the way to the

1967
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:19,440
edge and it's really nice it's really

1968
01:20:17,119 --> 01:20:21,399
nice to just like hear about talk about

1969
01:20:19,439 --> 01:20:24,198
think about and be like that's right

1970
01:20:21,399 --> 01:20:25,799
even though we all know the Chim and ogs

1971
01:20:24,198 --> 01:20:27,759
and cookies

1972
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:31,440
um it's good to be reminded that the

1973
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:33,920
potential is still vast um out there if

1974
01:20:31,439 --> 01:20:36,399
you want to go for it

1975
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:38,679
yeah well you know I appreciate you

1976
01:20:36,399 --> 01:20:39,759
coming on the show and uh I'm sure we're

1977
01:20:38,679 --> 01:20:42,359
going to have plenty more people

1978
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:43,639
interested in mutant talks and uh like

1979
01:20:42,359 --> 01:20:45,359
you said you have a Discord and we're

1980
01:20:43,639 --> 01:20:46,560
going to try to make that available in

1981
01:20:45,359 --> 01:20:47,559
the show I just got to remember to put

1982
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:49,400
it in the description but I'll

1983
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:51,000
definitely get it there at some point um

1984
01:20:49,399 --> 01:20:53,319
if not you know right when it gets

1985
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:55,359
uploaded I hope and uh we're going to

1986
01:20:53,319 --> 01:20:56,799
offer the the link in our Discord as

1987
01:20:55,359 --> 01:21:00,198
well for the people who want to check it

1988
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:02,039
out um you can get your seeds in

1989
01:21:00,198 --> 01:21:04,439
Australia directly from you and what is

1990
01:21:02,039 --> 01:21:07,399
your in an Instagram

1991
01:21:04,439 --> 01:21:09,638
username I'm actually not using kind of

1992
01:21:07,399 --> 01:21:11,879
starting to fade away from Instagram and

1993
01:21:09,639 --> 01:21:14,199
I actually want to push more towards the

1994
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:17,159
Discord approach so I'd recommend people

1995
01:21:14,198 --> 01:21:20,919
jump on the Discord and in

1996
01:21:17,158 --> 01:21:22,879
Australia top shelf SE bank would be go

1997
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:25,279
the way to go yeah I know that's a

1998
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:28,119
little bit different to way most people

1999
01:21:25,279 --> 01:21:30,439
approach it but I think

2000
01:21:28,119 --> 01:21:33,479
Discord especially being such a small

2001
01:21:30,439 --> 01:21:35,879
Niche I think the people who are looking

2002
01:21:33,479 --> 01:21:38,839
for that stuff will find it and I think

2003
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:40,560
I think it will keep it um more focused

2004
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:42,960
on the topic and I feel like you can

2005
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:45,239
actually talk more about things it's

2006
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:47,800
quite a complex plant and I don't like

2007
01:21:45,238 --> 01:21:49,799
the way Instagram Works where it's you

2008
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:52,360
show a picture and you can't really

2009
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:54,719
explain what you're looking at to the to

2010
01:21:52,359 --> 01:21:57,158
the effect that you want to yeah that's

2011
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:59,198
for sure yeah you got to keep it short

2012
01:21:57,158 --> 01:22:00,759
sweet hope everybody likes what it looks

2013
01:21:59,198 --> 01:22:02,238
like and understands the the

2014
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:04,520
complexities of cannabis which most

2015
01:22:02,238 --> 01:22:06,399
people on Instagram don't tend to gota

2016
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:07,960
deal with the idiots who just want us to

2017
01:22:06,399 --> 01:22:10,759
think that's [ __ ] ugly you know like

2018
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:12,399
they just don't get it yeah totally yeah

2019
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:15,119
I was gonna say basically the same thing

2020
01:22:12,399 --> 01:22:18,519
like Discord is like a good filter for

2021
01:22:15,119 --> 01:22:20,920
idiots it is it is it's

2022
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:24,000
true um but yeah thank you so much it

2023
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:25,399
was such a I think I was quite I think I

2024
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,840
know you and have talked a bit already

2025
01:22:25,399 --> 01:22:28,759
so I think Matt already knew the extent

2026
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:31,079
of your work but I don't think I really

2027
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:33,480
did understand the scale of work that

2028
01:22:31,079 --> 01:22:35,158
you've been doing so yeah really really

2029
