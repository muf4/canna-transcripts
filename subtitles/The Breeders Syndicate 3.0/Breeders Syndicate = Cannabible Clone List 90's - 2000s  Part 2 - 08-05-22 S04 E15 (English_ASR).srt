31
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,560

32
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,560
i mean starting from scratch so

33
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,040
definitely need people to do that so the

34
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,759
more you share it the more reviews you

35
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,640

37
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,320

get seen and recommended to other people

39
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:06,679

you know at some at sometimes like you

106
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,000
have to be somewhat used to isolation

107
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,918
yeah

108
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,040
you know you spend a lot of time kind of

109
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,918
alone

110
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,759

00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,199
yeah it would be good it would i mean

115
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:38,079
but that a lot of times that's weed

116
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,120
people

117
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:41,359
yeah

118
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,959
you know they flow in and out you know

119
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,560
sometimes you only have so much energy

120
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:47,279
for socialization

121
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,478
yep you know the desire to be public

122
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,559
yeah you know yeah somebody said

123
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:53,199
pandemic same thing for me pandemic was

124
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,759
easy i'll spend a lot of time alone and

125
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,759
you know yeah

126
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,959
that was super easy for me

127
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,240
but for a lot of people that are super

128
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:04,478
social you know i mean there's a lot of

129
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,000
people that can't even be quiet yeah you

130
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:07,279
know they get they have to have music on

131
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,639
or they have to have someone talking

132
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:11,439
because it's like they're just not used

133
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,280
to yeah so

134
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:15,519
yeah looks like someone accidentally got

135
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,959
blocked sorry sorry whoever it was i

136
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:18,478
can't unblock you or i'd have to stop

137
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:20,638
the show to do it so

138
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:22,800
um yeah

139
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,879
yeah matt on the not only does he have a

140
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,560
quick block finger he has a fat

141
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:30,319
accidental block thumb i do i do and the

142
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,000
problem is like when people say [ __ ] in

143
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:34,478
here that i want to get rid of i go to

144
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,800
click it and i'll go to hit boot but

145
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,399
sometimes it'll scroll up when i go to

146
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,800
do it and i do it so fast that it's just

147
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,399
like boom and then i told i'm like well

148
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,600
i'm trying to remember stuff and answer

149
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:48,319
and then i'm like i don't even remember

150
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:50,479
who i did it too but before before uh um

151
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:52,879
like uh we jump into like what the show

152
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:55,120
is actually about well you know

153
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:57,360
maybe i'll add one comment onto that

154
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,439
which is that the whole thing about like

155
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,199
i see a lot of people commenting on like

156
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:03,279
how they kind of liked the coveted

157
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,879
lockdowns because it fit their lifestyle

158
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:07,679
you know or like they were prepared for

159
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:09,680
it um you know there's a lot of us

160
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,918
uh who are kind of involved in for a

161
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,680
long time that like the way you stayed

162
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:15,519
safe was like you had a tight group of

163
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,439
friends that knew what you're up to and

164
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:20,000
you stayed quiet you kept your head down

165
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:21,680
and you tried to be invisible right and

166
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,519
i actually do think that played a

167
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,959
massive and you know and then there's a

168
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:26,639
whole thing of like some people like the

169
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,279
plants more than people

170
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,038
uh you know and people had weird quirks

171
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:33,439
and you know one of the things that

172
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:35,279
cannabis allowed was like your weird

173
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:36,879
quirks to get bigger

174
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,799
yeah because you could self-sustain

175
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,800
whether it was seeds or flower or

176
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,800
hustling or whatever it might be

177
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,879
you know and a lot of times like you

178
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,240
know real jobs and stuff they sand those

179
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:48,399
edges

180
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,199
yeah they do and so we get a lot of

181
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:53,439
quirky people in weed and then when the

182
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,038
money came into weed

183
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,478
right so here's the here's the point i

184
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:59,199
wanted to make when the money came into

185
00:06:56,478 --> 00:07:02,318
weed the vast majority of the like

186
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:05,520
slightly invisible suspicious we people

187
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,360
sort of hid and took like a waiting wait

188
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:10,318
and see kind of attitude towards what

189
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:13,038
was going on yeah right which meant like

190
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,160
all the super social hustler bullshitty

191
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:16,399
type people

192
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,599
they all ran to the capitol first

193
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,560
because that's what they wanted was

194
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:22,159
money yeah money and rap and all this

195
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,720
different stuff and all of a sudden

196
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,000
there was like minor weed celebrities

197
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,720
and you know and this and that and

198
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,680
everything else and so as a result like

199
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,520
a lot all the people that all the money

200
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,079
partnered with first

201
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:38,318
weren't like the deep breeders and the

202
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:40,318
people pulling off real [ __ ] and the and

203
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,800
the people that grew exceptional flower

204
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,360
and all that it was like all the people

205
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,598
that were like you know that they were

206
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,520
socially you know they just ran towards

207
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:51,680
it they're from cities they were

208
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:53,598
connected they have rich parents or rich

209
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,720
brother or you know some kind of media

210
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,478
whatever

211
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,280
and so it's kind of been [ __ ] up and

212
00:07:56,478 --> 00:08:01,598
that like a lot of the like the faces of

213
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:02,719
cannabis like they're not the heart of

214
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:05,120
the scene

215
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,800
no no i mean that's that's a given like

216
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,199
a lot of these um corporate guys where

217
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,038
they made the mistake and investors they

218
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,439
made the mistakes in thinking that they

219
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,120
could walk into a black market and talk

220
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:17,199
to talk to the deepest dudes in the

221
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,038
deepest circles because obviously those

222
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,800
are the guys on high times covers and

223
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:22,478
winning cubs obviously those are the

224
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,000
guys that are the deep ones in the deep

225
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:25,758
circles i mean right you know they kind

226
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,680
of they kind of screwed each other and

227
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,120
in the process they lit a bunch of money

228
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,759
on fire because

229
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,918
a lot of the capital like sharky rich

230
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,599
people like you know partnering with

231
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:37,038
some of some terrible people in the

232
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,680
industry

233
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:41,519
each party was trying to screw the other

234
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,799
yeah like the weed hustlers were trying

235
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,080
to get a bunch of money from the rich

236
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,240
people and the rich people were trying

237
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,399
to like steal genetics and sop and then

238
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,240
kick the [ __ ] hustlers out

239
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,600
yeah only like the hustlers couldn't do

240
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,799
what they they couldn't they couldn't

241
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,560
set up

242
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,958
actual large scenes and run them

243
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:58,799
efficiently they had never heard for a

244
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:00,479
long time they didn't understand all

245
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:03,120
that different stuff and so they sort of

246
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,480
learned on the rich people's dime

247
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,720
yeah you know

248
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,080
and honestly like if if someone would

249
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,680
have came to me and said hey you know

250
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,680
what i know you've been doing this x

251
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:13,199
amount of time i want you to scale up

252
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,958
and i want you to run this [ __ ]

253
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,720
massive facility

254
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:18,799
i wouldn't have been able to do it like

255
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,879
i mean scaling up is a hard [ __ ]

256
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:22,719
thing it takes a certain kind of brain

257
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:25,519
to go from being able to blow up houses

258
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,680
to blowing up [ __ ] major facilities

259
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,440
it is not easy it's not the same thing

260
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:31,519
at all it's not it's not necessarily i

261
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,360
mean the one thing that does translate

262
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,839
is that if you're a good pot grower and

263
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,159
you're observant of the plant

264
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,920
that helps because that helps you fine

265
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,519
tune whatever the [ __ ] is going on with

266
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:43,599
your greenhouse or your outdoor or your

267
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,159
room or wherever you might be growing

268
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,680
weed you know but certainly scale and

269
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:48,879
you know and then the other part of it

270
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:50,879
too is like

271
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,000
like everybody agrees that there's craft

272
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:55,600
weed

273
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,879
but nobody agrees where craft stops

274
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,680
yeah

275
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:02,639
you know it's true like so so that way

276
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:04,399
everybody gets to claim craft yeah

277
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,159
you know you have people with a hundred

278
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,399
lighter claiming craft you have people

279
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:10,399
with acres claiming craft you have

280
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,000
people with a ten thousand squid you

281
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,879
know it's all they're all growing the

282
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,720
fire

283
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,639
yep

284
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,639
yeah i was i was watching a video

285
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:21,519
earlier today and i mentioned it to you

286
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:23,679
it was people growing aquaponics on a

287
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,639
large scale for a major

288
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:27,278
um

289
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:29,439
uh retailer in canada and they were just

290
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:30,559
they were growing dank in aquaponics it

291
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,800
was one of the first times i've ever

292
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:35,119
seen that so yeah actually

293
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:37,278
all that 20 years ago

294
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,480
um and it's it's because it's actually

295
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:43,200
like it fit what i was it it's hydro but

296
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,120
with fish yeah kind of

297
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,680
but it's organic you know so it's like

298
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:51,039
if you get it right it's pretty neat

299
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:53,278
you know it's very hard to find really

300
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:55,039
quality like exceptional quality

301
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,639
cannabis grown aquaponically because

302
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:58,879
it's so hard with the inputs you give

303
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,799
the fish what you want them to output

304
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:02,639
you know what i mean like it's hard to

305
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:04,159
get quality quality in that yeah i mean

306
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:05,919
it was it was just never the most

307
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:08,159
efficient thing for almost anyone no

308
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:10,000
matter who you were yeah as a result it

309
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:11,919
wasn't it what you know it's not like

310
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,480
you had a thriving fish business that

311
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:16,240
you sold tilapia and you sold cannabis

312
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,320
like it just didn't really mix

313
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,799
yeah but it's a cool like closed-loop

314
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,920
method in a way yeah you know that's for

315
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:26,879
sure i i admire it it's hard it's hard

316
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:29,039
stuff you have to be fastidious and very

317
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:31,039
attention detail orchid oriented i mean

318
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:33,919
i'll say something too like about craft

319
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:35,838
like even say 20 years ago or 25 years

320
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:37,519
ago like in the when a lot of people

321
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,240
were growing like generator scenes in

322
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,360
the woods around here right yeah um most

323
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,839
of the people that worked there that

324
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,120
were growing at 100 or 200 lighters

325
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,959
almost all of them bought their head

326
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,959
stash from people that had four to ten

327
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,319
lights yeah yeah yeah because it was

328
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,399
just nicer

329
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,920
yeah i mean even 10 000 square feet is

330
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,879
kind of a lot of weed

331
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:57,360
yeah

332
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:58,958
you know so like where is where is craft

333
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,720
where is the amount where and not just

334
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:03,919
like growing it but like

335
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,759
growing it and handling it and drying it

336
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:08,479
and curing it all the right way because

337
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:10,399
you can [ __ ] up at any of those steps

338
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,320
yep and then it's not as good see it's

339
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,399
not just about like growing it it's like

340
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,600
all the way to the end can you manage

341
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,399
that whole thing

342
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
yeah

343
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,440
at scale

344
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,320
you know

345
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,800
so

346
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,800
i don't know

347
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:29,278
it it's interesting on that regard where

348
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:31,120
where is craft you know where's crap

349
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:33,200
what's a craft size indoor what's a

350
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,440
craft sized greenhouse what's a craft

351
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,759
size outdoor that'd be a curious thing

352
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,839
to pose to the community

353
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:43,600
is is someone just typed in there do you

354
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:45,680
know ken blah blah blah isn't that kendo

355
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,200
i don't know blah blah i don't know

356
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:48,638
i'm pretty sure that that's kendo he's

357
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,480
talking about i don't know there's a

358
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,480
bunch of cans but uh

359
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,399
kendo you know kendo right i don't know

360
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,120
if i know kendall yeah kendall is funny

361
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,679
he's like the older me just talks mad

362
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:03,120
[ __ ] to er except he's tough

363
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:05,359
like a tough version of me

364
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,120
yeah you know yeah that's what's cool

365
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,639
that anyway just to close on that that's

366
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,799
what's cool about craft is that

367
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,680
everybody agrees that there is fire and

368
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:16,479
craft and really really excellent weed

369
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:18,159
just no one agrees what that exactly is

370
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,278
so it allows everyone to fight over it

371
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:21,759
and claim it

372
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:23,759
sure and now there's huge ass scenes

373
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:25,519
growing straight meds claiming craft

374
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:27,679
because it's just marketing

375
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,360
yeah it means it's losing its its value

376
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:30,799
in name like calling something craft is

377
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,278
going to lose its value like calling

378
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:34,879
something date you know or kind it

379
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:37,039
happens in any kind of thing it's like

380
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:39,278
people want to attach their not quality

381
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:41,120
onto quality yeah

382
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:43,120
is really what it comes down to

383
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,039
yeah um so we're gonna have we're gonna

384
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,399
have some guests coming up but it didn't

385
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:51,759
pop for this week so we're gonna do uh a

386
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:54,078
uh uh part two of clone list

387
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:55,679
where uh matt you know we go we're gonna

388
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:58,078
go back and maybe i'll give a little bit

389
00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:01,439
background real quick again here so

390
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:05,838
we're mostly talking about 90s to

391
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:08,240
say like 2005 to 2010 clubs yeah right

392
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,079
and the reason for that is that

393
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,440
sort of before then

394
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:13,599
like there was this immense amount of

395
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,079
diversity because weed was rare enough

396
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:19,278
in most places that anybody that grew

397
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:21,599
quote-unquote kind bud it all sold yeah

398
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:23,838
and it was easy to sell which allowed

399
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,240
people to pop seeds get stuff from seed

400
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,880
banks trade with their local friends and

401
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,519
keep this random ass [ __ ] that worked

402
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:33,120
well for them yeah right and what

403
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,879
happened is

404
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,959
you know with the purple wave and then

405
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:39,198
the sour wave and the kush wave and then

406
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:41,599
the skittles and cookies and all that is

407
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:42,958
that every huge wave came along and

408
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,399
instead of a whole bunch of different

409
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,879
people growing

410
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,600
all these things lots of people started

411
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:51,519
growing similar families of stuff yeah

412
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,440
because that's what sold well and a lot

413
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,759
of those other things sort of went by

414
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,000
the wayside so there's this enormous

415
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:59,838
amount of cuttings from like i don't

416
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,639
want to say matt and i's childhood but

417
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,279
like you know a younger time a younger

418
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:08,000
time in cannabis or whatever that like a

419
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:09,679
lot of which have fallen by the wayside

420
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,759
and some of which are still around but a

421
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:12,638
lot of which were super famous at the

422
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:15,679
time

423
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,480
because it hadn't had to be so mono crop

424
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:19,599
yep right and so when when monocrop

425
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,320
didn't happen

426
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,320
uh before monocrop became a thing uh

427
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,800
this is what we all grew

428
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,600
and so that this is part two of that

429
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:33,278
what we grew before mono cropping yeah

430
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:35,120
pretty much is is pretty much it right

431
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:37,039
so that the cannabinoid clone list only

432
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,039
covered so many you know like it was

433
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:40,799
pretty comprehensive but it wasn't

434
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:43,439
all-encompassing there was a lot that

435
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,719
was not on there so i added a bunch um i

436
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,040
also

437
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,278
i don't know if i know not so you hadn't

438
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:51,759
seen these before or didn't have them or

439
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:54,879
whatever uh these are the old strain

440
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,800
books from green candy press my dad my

441
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,360
buddy jack

442
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:02,319
released these a while ago and it has

443
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:05,320
it's pretty much that era of 2006 to

444
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,320
2012

445
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,959
breeders seed makers of all sorts

446
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:10,320
there's [ __ ] in here there's

447
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:12,958
excellent [ __ ] in here there's

448
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,000
everything in between good info bad info

449
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,518
but

450
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,120
it's a good resource for knowing what

451
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,879
was being at least being talked about

452
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,399
growing around these times yeah they did

453
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:22,399
the cannabis indica volume one through

454
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,958
three and then they did the um

455
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,159
the cannabis sativa volume

456
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,679
one through three and these are on

457
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:29,679
amazon still so grab them while they're

458
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:31,278
still around um it's a great question

459
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:32,719
for coming in hard and fast so i'll

460
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:33,919
throw something out there real quick

461
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,600
i'll interject

462
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:37,919
people are talking a ton about the white

463
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,320
family and white widow yeah and we've

464
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:42,639
mentioned this but you know uh when the

465
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,360
white family hit in the mid 90s it was

466
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,360
like a tidal wave in cannabis

467
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,399
uh it became the biggest one of the

468
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,560
biggest most popular cuts and lines in

469
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,919
weed for about five to eight years

470
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:56,078
perhaps

471
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:58,240
and so as a result it got crossed with

472
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:59,039
almost everything else good

473
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,839
right

474
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:02,559
and

475
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,240
it it is there everything white is in

476
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:06,159
this era that we're talking about all

477
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,880
the great white shark and white widow

478
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,360
and white rhino and blue widow and

479
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,360
all the numerous things because that was

480
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,958
one of the first strains that like lots

481
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,198
of people got and then were like i'm

482
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,919
gonna cross it to everything cool i have

483
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,160
yeah so white russian

484
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:25,038
uh you know there's a bunch of the white

485
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,240
family it was like an og kush

486
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:28,480
of its day

487
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,079
yeah where people got it and it was like

488
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,880
the thing

489
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:34,960
you know yes so

490
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,480
that's it it's definitely and it still

491
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,720
percolates around here and there it's

492
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,839
probably in more things than people

493
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,558
realize

494
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:43,759
yeah because the names just got changed

495
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:44,960
you know

496
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:46,558
so

497
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,600
um but we're gonna kind of do this thing

498
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:49,839
with uh

499
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:52,159
with matt where he's got a big

500
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:54,399
[ __ ] list and we're gonna rapid fire

501
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,880
off some stuff and do some off the head

502
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:00,000
what we think about it what we remember

503
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,160
experiences and so forth

504
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,558
and he's got the list so i don't know

505
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,880
what's coming but we'll see

506
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:08,879
yeah one second

507
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,360
i was gonna invite archive on but he's

508
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,200
uh hitting the airplane um

509
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:14,798
yeah so some of these on this list some

510
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,319
of them like i may have no knowledge

511
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:18,079
about it and

512
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:19,119
not so might not either but i put it on

513
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:21,119
the newsletter

514
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:23,439
because it was something going around at

515
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:25,038
the time so at least we can uh kind of

516
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,480
acknowledge it i mean there's there's so

517
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:28,798
many that didn't end up on this list

518
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,038
that that i mean there might be a

519
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:34,160
part three part four part thirty it can

520
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:36,480
grow yeah it's just the framework to

521
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,480
riff off of for the most part about

522
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,599
history and strains of old and their

523
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,319
impact

524
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:43,599
so i also didn't choose specific seed

525
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:44,720
lines

526
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:46,558
unless

527
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,160
they had a clone in it that was well

528
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:50,160
known so there's a lot of seed lines in

529
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,679
here like white rhino where

530
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,000
like in the us i don't remember a

531
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,919
specific white rhino clone going around

532
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,440
there wasn't there wasn't an elite that

533
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,759
like at least that made it onto the

534
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,558
national like forum and like traded

535
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:01,679
scene

536
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:04,319
yeah

537
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,960
okay so last week we left off with

538
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,918
matanuska valley [ __ ] and we did

539
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,319
indeed

540
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:14,160
and right after that comes og kush

541
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:15,839
so one of the things i was thinking when

542
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,320
covering og kush we could just do a

543
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,000
quick rundown of some of the og clones

544
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:22,159
that were some of the more early clones

545
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,038
that were named

546
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,038
okay

547
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:26,720
um

548
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:29,440
so as far as i know

549
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,759
uh i'll start with four and matt can

550
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,200
riff off that if he wants there's

551
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:37,200
obviously whatever you want to call the

552
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:39,600
og kush that uh uh matt bubba and josh

553
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,840
brought west to l.a

554
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:46,240
uh there's that that started the whole

555
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:50,319
la thing yeah um you know there's the tk

556
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:53,599
yep right um there's uh an old one

557
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:55,519
called the master that's not a bubba og

558
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:58,240
that i'm not sure where it came from and

559
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:59,440
there's supposedly the you know the

560
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,120
flowrider

561
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,440
okay um and then

562
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:06,479
from there from a bunch of bag seeds and

563
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,640
everything else it exploded into you

564
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,480
know uh and there's debate on that too

565
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,840
so like you know if i left off some

566
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,558
important thing or whatever don't get

567
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:18,319
all pissy it's like a hugely convoluted

568
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:21,038
family with a lot of weird origins

569
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:22,720
okay um yeah we have uh early on let me

570
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:24,720
see sfv

571
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,640
uh larry

572
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,759
um we have

573
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,919
tahoe

574
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,839
we have the solo assassin one through

575
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,038
three we have um so i have to close my

576
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:35,759
eyes to

577
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:37,919
see it sorry uh the souls has a one

578
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:39,359
through three we have um we have the

579
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,320
face offs i can't remember how many

580
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:45,918
there were the face offs uh archive can

581
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:47,678
say um then of course the 92 which who

582
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,880
knows when that's from there's a whole

583
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,480
like pure kush family yeah there's one

584
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,240
as far as i know there's one pure kush

585
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,839
and then everything else people called

586
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:00,079
pure kush which was a og cut um what

587
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,959
were some of the other ones uh louis of

588
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:02,720
course

589
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,519
um

590
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,120
they're they're like private reserve og

591
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:09,519
the weird ones that that could have been

592
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:12,239
anything the platinum og skywalker og

593
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:14,158
was early fire og thank you uh paris

594
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,038
paris for me was later i don't know that

595
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:19,039
came later there's uh the f-cut

596
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:21,038
i mean yeah so there's an aspect where

597
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:24,798
you could literally walk into a club in

598
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:27,839
la in 2009 or something or eight and it

599
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:29,200
would be like 25 listed ogs from

600
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:32,158
different people

601
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,798
yep like it took over southern

602
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,400
california and as a result of that some

603
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:38,400
of those are probably renamed some of

604
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,240
those are probably bag seeds

605
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,320
you know there was like i mean it was

606
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,400
literally went from like

607
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:46,558
we don't even know how many cuts and if

608
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,360
there were sisters to each other it does

609
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:52,319
seem a few different cushy things came

610
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:54,959
out of florida via different people yeah

611
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:57,519
and hit california and spread from there

612
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,279
yeah and then it exploded into its own

613
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:02,158
family but it's like a whole episode in

614
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:04,960
itself so if we want to keep to like the

615
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,799
the timeline or whatever of uh reading

616
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,200
off more plants we could probably talk

617
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:11,119
about og for an hour yeah those are the

618
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,960
ones like and and there were other ones

619
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:14,639
but uh that people are naming but those

620
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,240
were most of the early ones you know i

621
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,919
hear people constantly saying oh we got

622
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,120
that diamond og you know that old [ __ ]

623
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,000
and i'm like no

624
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:23,759
there was like a very small list of the

625
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,599
og's that were going around and then

626
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:27,679
everything after that was

627
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:29,359
shut off after that like you know the

628
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,880
planetary ogs that people mentioned were

629
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:32,959
later renamed and stuff but it was

630
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,240
during this time the planetarium g's

631
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,720
were going around

632
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,240
um p91

633
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:42,000
p91 um i'll let matt talk about this one

634
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,120
much more than me it's his it's his

635
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,720
wheelhouse

636
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:46,399
it's an old san diego strain there's a

637
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,319
lot of different stories behind it a lot

638
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,960
of different claims to who has made it

639
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:53,439
um everything from saying it was like

640
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,600
the g13 story strapped to a berkeley

641
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,600
story um

642
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:58,879
yeah there's all kinds of crazy crazy

643
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:00,399
different things it could be i think

644
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,679
it's some kind of like

645
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,440
uh

646
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,400
i could see silver pearls super skunks

647
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,840
uh

648
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,600
some kind of afghani somethings

649
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:12,558
but yeah it's a what most people

650
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:14,879
consider a classic old indica pre-dating

651
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:16,480
the og craze in socal it was one of the

652
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,760
big ones like bull rider and all the

653
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,480
others um

654
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:22,720
yeah it's it's it's got its name p91

655
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,919
either from class of 91

656
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,319
or

657
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,480
peanut 91

658
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:30,639
we don't know there's just

659
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,319
endless arguments but it does have a a

660
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,840
weird nutty

661
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:37,599
profile uh nutty kind of

662
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:40,079
accurate it's weird man it's weird it's

663
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:43,038
a good cut though

00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:09,599
90s nl

wheelhouse

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,159
perps

682
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,000
perps maybe talk about your perps and

683
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,640
other perps

684
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,640
um you know uh

685
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,400
yeah perps is just i mean perps has been

686
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,640
with us forever i think

687
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,559
in a way there's a lot of plants up in

688
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,400
my neck of the woods that

689
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:41,119
turn purple with fall

690
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:44,240
um but then sort of the ones that like

691
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:46,158
everybody is kind of familiar with

692
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,599
you know is the mendo p and then all the

693
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,400
stuff that got famous on the purple

694
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:52,558
cribs yeah right uh the urkel the great

695
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,519
babe we chatted about that a bunch and i

696
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:56,000
mentioned

697
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:59,038
most of the story of the mendo p but i

698
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,278
believe it's it's from the late 70s

699
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:03,038
grown in mendocino county and put in

700
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:06,000
this dude's closet for a couple decades

701
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:08,000
until i got it in the late 90s yeah um

702
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,440
and i have no idea what it is except for

703
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,880
he remembered where he grew it because

704
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,200
he said it was the only purple wheat he

705
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,559
ever grew and it was grown in kovalev in

706
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,480
the late 70s

707
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:19,278
uh and i tend to believe him just

708
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:23,038
because it tests like very within the

709
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:25,200
range of most 70s cannabis yeah uh and

710
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:28,000
you you breed with it and it's got just

711
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,440
an enormously wide gene pool so i

712
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,720
remember i had something i wanted to ask

713
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,798
you i thought about it earlier today

714
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,079
with the perps so

715
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:35,839
when you talk when you told the story

716
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:38,399
you were talking about how he gave you

717
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:40,798
some seeds in a bag of weed and the

718
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,240
seeds he gave you were from the 70s but

719
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:43,759
when you brought it back he said oh

720
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,278
that's that purple one do you think it

721
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:47,440
was from the same era

722
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:49,679
so the thing is is that he thought he

723
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,000
was giving me different seeds

724
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,360
yeah and i can't even remember what it

725
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,240
was supposed to be

726
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:55,759
um

727
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,519
and like i said i only there was only

728
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:59,200
two of them that popped one male and one

729
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:01,679
girl the boy died

730
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,000
and when i got this weed it was so royal

731
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,759
purple and smelled so crazy yeah i

732
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
didn't know what it was so i brought it

733
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:10,000
to him and i said this doesn't look like

734
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,919
you know what it was supposed to be and

735
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,599
the only reason why i know the year is

736
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:16,720
because he said

737
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:18,639
that's the only purple weed i ever grew

738
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,798
and i grew it here

739
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,960
okay and so that's really that's really

740
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:24,720
all i know he didn't know jack he just

741
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,880
said it was you know they were playing

742
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,278
around with with like afghans and stuff

743
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,120
that wasn't sativa that was faster

744
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:33,278
guys were starting to mix that in you

745
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:34,798
know or whatever yeah and so they were

746
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:36,880
trying stuff and he said he grew up one

747
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:39,599
year that's it that's all i know

748
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,760
oh no [ __ ] yeah so that's it that yeah

749
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:44,158
that's okay so he the you're applied to

750
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:46,879
the the purse not the other so i got it

751
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,640
and so i got it and yeah i got he didn't

752
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,480
he didn't tell me a year

753
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,159
until and he said the only reason why he

754
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,679
even remembered that year is because it

755
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:57,120
was the only time he grew weed that was

756
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:59,200
purple like that got it you know so

757
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:01,038
um so he remembered the year later when

758
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,919
i actually showed him flour

759
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:04,000
yeah

760
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,000
and you know uh csi's bred with it a

761
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,359
bunch i have other people have it it's

762
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,880
obviously it's it's super super terpy

763
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:14,158
low thc

764
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:16,240
and super wide band as far as diversity

765
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,159
yeah there's a lot in there

766
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:21,038
yeah you know so okay

767
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:23,760
and when i got it in 1998 so at the time

768
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:25,919
those seeds were 21 years old 22 years

769
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:26,879
old yeah 21 years old something like

770
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,200
that

771
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,480
you know and that was now that was 24

772
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,399
years ago

773
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,480
you got people obsessing over your

774
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:36,719
[ __ ] hair it's killing me all right

775
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,640
yeah

776
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,399
all right so um

777
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,399
purple i was going to do purple indica

778
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:43,278
but since fletch is getting on a plane i

779
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:44,558
don't want to cover purple window

780
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:46,319
because i've never grown pure purple

781
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:48,480
indica so i can't really comment on it

782
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:51,278
um but you can see our last

783
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,759
interview with archive and we covered

784
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:56,079
purple indica pretty well there so it's

785
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:57,599
a good uh call back to that episode

786
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:00,480
which is available

787
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:03,678
on youtube and spotify and all that

788
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,278
purple purple

789
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,480
what was your first experience with her

790
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:09,359
when's the first time you saw it and

791
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:13,360
smoked it and your your feelings on it

792
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:17,278
uh probably 2003 2000 2003

793
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:20,639
okay for sure easily 2003 um it started

794
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:22,240
getting passed around mendo as uh you

795
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,480
know the thing to grow

796
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,960
yeah it was super slow growing uh but

797
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,880
there was a huge demand for it yeah you

798
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:32,000
know i still think there's a fairly

799
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:35,440
mysterious origin of it or whatever

800
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,759
uh and uh you know yes so it's one of

801
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,798
the few strains that has gotten that

802
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:41,519
famous

803
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:44,158
that we don't know like a crew that came

804
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:46,158
out with it yeah we only have like some

805
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,039
certain claims that are

806
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,320
not

807
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:49,919
nobody's sure

808
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:51,918
nobody's really there's some claims to

809
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:55,038
it but nobody's really sure

810
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,880
um and you know the lavender and which i

811
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:58,798
think later got attributed to soma but

812
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,559
i'm not sure if it it the one that got

813
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:02,240
famous is yeah yeah

814
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:03,759
um but the lavender and the earth came

815
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,519
at the same time

816
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:08,319
yeah you know and my buddy that gave me

817
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:10,240
the tanjo um he got the lavender from

818
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:11,119
mckinleyville humble

819
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,038
uh

820
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:15,038
in humboldt and i had gotten the urkel

821
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:16,398
from a source in mendo and we showed

822
00:29:15,038 --> 00:29:17,440
each other flour and they were pretty

823
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:19,199
similar

824
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,120
yeah they weren't exactly the same but

825
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,120
like we got the cuts those two cuts

826
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:24,959
within six months of each other

827
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:27,918
i remember my first experience with

828
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,159
urkel was something similar and i saw a

829
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:32,080
cut of lavender around the same time and

830
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,679
they were obviously related the the

831
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:36,480
oracle cut and lavender cut to me were

832
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:38,480
obviously related so from that point on

833
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,399
i always assumed that urkel must have

834
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,399
come from the lavender seedline you know

835
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:45,199
because i saw the clone that must be

836
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:47,038
real lavender but i don't know if if

837
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,720
that was just like an oracle bag seed

838
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:52,398
rename just being sold as lavender

839
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:54,880
because lavender was pop popular um yeah

840
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:56,879
my so my opinion is that the original

841
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,278
urkel and the original lavender were

842
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,520
were somewhat closely related

843
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:03,599
and they popped up on the scene and up

844
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:06,720
here in the basically at the exact same

845
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:09,519
time but then soma has a line that he

846
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,360
sold for years named lavender yes and so

847
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:13,839
anybody that pops seeds of that would

848
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:15,599
obviously call it lavender

849
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:17,839
and so there's different lavenders that

850
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:19,038
float around

851
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:21,278
there's also

852
00:30:19,038 --> 00:30:23,359
someone from oregon that claims they

853
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:24,880
made that lavender i can't remember his

854
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:26,719
name off the top of my head but claims

855
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,320
he made it and that soma hijacked it

856
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,079
from him and the guy was known for

857
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:32,558
making other stuff too so it wasn't like

858
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:34,000
a just a random bold claim it was it was

859
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:36,558
something that might have merit it's

860
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,038
very interesting yeah and then it's so

861
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:40,319
it's like one of those things where um i

862
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:42,079
just think that

863
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:43,918
like the urkel is a little easier

864
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:46,000
because there was one irk

865
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,600
and you know and then the lavender it's

866
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,038
like there was the cut that i remember

867
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:50,879
and then there was

868
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:53,200
soma selling thousands of seeds of

869
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,799
something called lavender yeah

870
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,880
and so a lot of people think that the

871
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:59,038
lavender is somas

872
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,519
yeah a lot of people apparently think

873
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:02,879
it's mad farters too but that's uh

874
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:04,798
that's been

875
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,039
tantamount i mean it's been disproven

876
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:09,359
it's been smashed to the people but i i

877
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:12,158
the first lavender i saw was before soma

878
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:14,639
was selling seeds of it so yeah um i

879
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:16,159
don't i don't think you know

880
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,559
yeah

881
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,679
all right um so someone mentioned this

882
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:20,798
in here and i think it's it's a great

883
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,559
one to bring up do you have experience

884
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:26,158
with permafrost

885
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:28,720
permafrost yeah i actually don't but i

886
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:30,559
do think that that and like coral reef

887
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,558
or something are two things that homey

888
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:36,398
archive has been hunting for

889
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:38,639
yeah and i do remember permafrost from

890
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:40,879
smoking it from some of those uh ron

891
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,960
parties in the early 2000s

892
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,039
but i never grew it myself so i don't

893
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,919
have a bunch of comments on it

894
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:50,000
i only got it and passed it um

895
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,200
to an idiot but um it's a white widow

896
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,798
train wreck if i remember correctly

897
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,399
that's what people said it was that's

898
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:56,558
about all i had to comment on i never

899
00:31:54,398 --> 00:31:59,038
got to grow it like that it was potent

900
00:31:56,558 --> 00:32:00,798
it had a nice flavor it was super frosty

901
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:03,038
uh i just remember

902
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:04,798
snow yeah a little bit in my head well

903
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:06,398
you crossed white widow i mean train

904
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:08,960
wreck and white widow are both pretty

905
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:12,000
crystally things yeah in that era or

906
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:15,038
whatever so it had that half you know i

907
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,480
don't know it it was pretty

908
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:18,480
all right um let's see

909
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,480
purple effects

910
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:27,120
purple effects uh purple effects was uh

911
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:30,240
made by uh me if you can consider

912
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:32,000
accidents uh made by someone uh totally

913
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,759
oh

914
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,480
so i had i had this strain called

915
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:38,798
effects which was a garlic bud um yeah

916
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,200
that tim blatt one of tim blake's main

917
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:42,960
workers gave to me in the late 90s

918
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,640
and um

919
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,079
you know and so

920
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,840
i uh

921
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:50,000
i had this room going of a bunch of

922
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:52,319
different stuff and it was summer and an

923
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,480
air conditioner died and it got hot for

924
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:57,038
a couple of days until we repaired it

925
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,839
and the mendo p as it can sometimes do

926
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:01,200
um it hermed all over the purple effect

927
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:02,959
all of the effects

928
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,440
right so i ended up with these two

929
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,120
effects plants that had hundreds of

930
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,399
mendo p seeds

931
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:11,119
yeah right

932
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:13,678
um and out of that those seeds came what

933
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:16,398
we call the purple effects yes uh it's

934
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:18,720
in the can of bible uh a couple of them

935
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:20,239
i think i don't know we grew up yeah we

936
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,759
we grew it a bunch

937
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,319
uh it had

938
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:27,278
it was it's really killer weed uh the

939
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:28,960
the turpogs used it in rose and in

940
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:30,960
sprite and some stuff like that it's

941
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,960
been floating around laytonville

942
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,319
um it's the first it's the first

943
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,440
breeding that ever happened with the

944
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:39,519
mendo p

945
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:41,600
yeah uh it was it was feminized uh years

946
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,359
before i even knew what that meant

947
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:45,278
yeah in the era that we were even

948
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:46,798
suspect that using the seeds might be

949
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:49,759
[ __ ] [ __ ] up

950
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:51,359
yeah because they were all herm seed

951
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:53,038
but i did it anyway because i loved the

952
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:55,439
plants so much and all i had was two

953
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:57,038
females so yeah you know and it came out

954
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,000
so so yeah that's that's the purple

955
00:33:57,038 --> 00:33:59,679
effects

956
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,440
yeah that's one of those like i don't

957
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:03,840
know if it's necessarily a myth because

958
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,919
it is true that if something hurts it

959
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:08,078
has that trait it may pass it on to the

960
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:09,918
progeny but it also might not it also

961
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:12,480
might not be triggered by something that

962
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:13,918
normally would trigger stuff so it it

963
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,599
you know it that was one of those things

964
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:16,960
for sure that i always heard was oh you

965
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,480
better not pop don't make with the herm

966
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,918
you're gonna get herms

967
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,398
somebody asked how did the accident

968
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:23,598
happen uh the mendo p

969
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:26,480
herms

970
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,240
right and if she undergoes uh

971
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,679
environmental stress

972
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:33,759
it often makes her throw bananas yeah so

973
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,760
uh like i said it was summertime the ac

974
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,399
broke it got hot for a couple of days

975
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,320
until we could get the ac repaired

976
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:41,838
um and she threw some bananas and just

977
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,838
happened to pollinate the plants that

978
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:45,440
were right next door on the tray

979
00:34:43,838 --> 00:34:47,918
whenever you're mad you often throw

980
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,320
bananas too it's really weird you know

981
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:52,158
so yeah so that was that was the purple

982
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,679
effects it floated around it's in any

983
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,280
number of different things it's really

984
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:58,079
it's really terpe

985
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,519
uh and it's pretty potent

986
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:02,000
all right um

987
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:04,880
scentsy star i mean this is one of those

988
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,559
where there's pretty much one

989
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,559
main clone going around that a lot of

990
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:09,599
people had or at least one expression

991
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:11,358
that

992
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:13,760
commonly popped up enough to be passed

993
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:15,920
around as multiple clones maybe um did

994
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,920
you ever grow any scentsy star i grew it

995
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,320
for a little bit and to be perfectly

996
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,440
honest uh i got rid of it

997
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,599
um

998
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,159
and uh i didn't i just thought of it as

999
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:29,280
kind of a boring afghan oh my god one of

1000
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:30,879
our friends is so mad at you right now

1001
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,519
i know that doesn't mean that i grew the

1002
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,599
one you know but that's true later on

1003
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:37,119
later on one version at least became

1004
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:40,480
pretty famous

1005
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:41,838
um and uh luke is one of the people from

1006
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,320
paradise seeds

1007
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:45,920
he's refused to give any lineage or any

1008
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,240
information about it

1009
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,680
it wasn't offered for all that that long

1010
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:52,159
i don't think

1011
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:53,358
uh yeah it was not his regular seats but

1012
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:54,960
his feminized seats i don't think he's

1013
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:56,960
ever stopped offering it you don't think

1014
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,720
he's ever stopped offering his family

1015
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,400
yeah so i just meant i don't you know

1016
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:01,759
the regular seeds was what like it was

1017
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,358
like a four or five year period or

1018
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,200
something not i don't even think it was

1019
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:07,838
a four or five year period i think he

1020
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:10,239
gave someone testers that was a friend

1021
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:11,920
that person reproduced them which caused

1022
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:14,078
him to say [ __ ] that i'm only doing

1023
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,599
femmes from now on as i understand it

1024
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:18,720
wow so

1025
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:20,240
yeah and uh it it it gets claimed to be

1026
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:21,759
so it's it's it seems to be a pretty

1027
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:22,799
good breeder there's a cut that floats

1028
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,640
around

1029
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,720
um i mean there's a there's another cut

1030
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:29,118
that floats around that was called

1031
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:31,118
uh scentsy star but is actually like a

1032
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:33,358
nirvana four-way something something oh

1033
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:34,800
wow i could see that kind of translating

1034
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:36,799
a little bit and confusing people though

1035
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,720
yeah you know and so yeah there's

1036
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,440
there's like a history to it but

1037
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:44,239
unfortunately it uh it wasn't offered

1038
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,440
for very long and um

1039
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:47,519
you know there's a couple cuts that

1040
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,200
float around

1041
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:50,960
you know and that's the other thing too

1042
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:52,879
it's like not everybody thinks

1043
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,440
everything is elite

1044
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,440
yeah so sometimes you might get

1045
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,039
something and grow it and it's not for

1046
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,720
you or it wasn't the right environment

1047
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:02,159
for it and you have better things and

1048
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:04,239
you just move on

1049
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:05,358
and other people it's the bee's knees

1050
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:06,799
yeah

1051
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:09,358
um

1052
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,800
i think we just recently did snow but

1053
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:12,400
you can cover it again real quick just

1054
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,920
to plug it in here

1055
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:18,000
we did uh snow got famous in oregon

1056
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,720
yep it was called it was often called

1057
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,559
oregon snow or eugene snow even

1058
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:25,598
uh it made its way down to humble and

1059
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:28,400
got called humboldt snow yeah uh it was

1060
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:30,000
cropped by a bunch of people uh csi used

1061
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,760
to run it from he's had a cut of it

1062
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,800
since the late 90s

1063
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,640
um and it was brought out from florida

1064
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:39,440
by a couple people i know and it was

1065
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:43,118
called skunk five in florida yeah

1066
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:44,800
and it's a low terp super frosty afghan

1067
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,480
that occasionally can be absolutely

1068
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,119
delicious and at other times can be a

1069
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,039
little bland yeah uh but it's super

1070
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,880
potent it's a great breeder

1071
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:54,480
uh it seems anything you cross it to

1072
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,640
makes nice plants

1073
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,320
and it's a it's a heirloom

1074
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:59,920
yeah

1075
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,200
and it's pretty purple isn't it like

1076
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,119
pretty it can purple up pretty good you

1077
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:05,679
can get purple up at the end sure yeah

1078
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,760
yeah okay

1079
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:09,199
we've done whole episodes on sour but

1080
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,680
might as well

1081
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:14,399
go ahead i mean the the the cool part i

1082
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:16,480
guess about sour is that more people in

1083
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,760
the sauer family are starting to speak

1084
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:22,240
up recently yeah that were involved um

1085
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,640
you know vondo swell manny you know

1086
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:25,439
people that really hadn't spoken up very

1087
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:27,759
much

1088
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:31,519
and so they've confirmed some things

1089
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:33,920
um you know sour sour came according to

1090
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:36,159
them came from diesel 2 which they

1091
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,240
called headband so the first headband

1092
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:40,799
was a very sour type

1093
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:42,879
um skunk type plant

1094
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,359
that they found some seeds in

1095
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:48,559
yeah and they called it our diesel and

1096
00:38:45,358 --> 00:38:48,559
that led to sour diesel

1097
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:53,200
it's been it's been covered but and that

1098
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,280
is and that was something that you know

1099
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:56,559
the headband story and the confusion

1100
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,599
around that

1101
00:38:56,559 --> 00:39:01,440
a lot of tales spawned around it with

1102
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:03,680
people claiming they had the real new

1103
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,639
york city headband they had the real

1104
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:06,559
this

1105
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:08,639
you take a famous story that's light on

1106
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:10,320
detail and you're going to get people to

1107
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:13,279
fill in detail

1108
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,640
sure right you sure will and so with

1109
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,240
manny and some of those other guys

1110
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:18,078
coming out and telling their side of the

1111
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:20,399
story we actually have some stuff that

1112
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:23,200
used to be just a version of the story

1113
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,920
yeah be kind of become the story

1114
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:27,358
yep so that's cool

1115
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,880
and and someone was asking about the

1116
00:39:27,358 --> 00:39:31,039
original new york city diesel that's

1117
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:32,400
exactly what we just talked about yeah

1118
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:35,199
and there's there's a further

1119
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,519
complication and that in that diesel was

1120
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:39,838
slang for fireweed in new york city back

1121
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:42,159
then yes which is why they called the

1122
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:43,199
bag our diesel when they gave it to

1123
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:44,799
homey

1124
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:47,118
because they wanted to differentiate it

1125
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,039
from all the other diesel coming around

1126
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,720
and there's another cut named original

1127
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:53,039
diesel

1128
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:54,639
which may or may not be the cut matt has

1129
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:56,800
but there's a different guy that has it

1130
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:59,920
that's just the first diesel that he got

1131
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:01,680
in vermont and he stuck that label on it

1132
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,119
you know so

1133
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:06,480
um

1134
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:09,440
anyway yeah yeah uh and jesus was called

1135
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:12,240
jesus because it was jesus diesel yeah

1136
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:14,079
one of the people in the chem crew

1137
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:15,679
yeah [ __ ] diesel yes the cop diesel

1138
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:18,000
another great name that nazar calls it

1139
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:19,598
um the cockney so there's all k so yeah

1140
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,280
it's it's it's one of those things where

1141
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,880
it could be an entire episode we're

1142
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,880
trying to condense it

1143
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,599
but and we've talked about it before so

1144
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,280
yeah we have a whole episode about it um

1145
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,359
shoreline did you ever get to try any of

1146
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,119
the recent shoreline from our crew i did

1147
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:35,440

but apparently not so i will let i will

1150
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:43,519
let matt describe the shoreline

1151
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:45,440
so i i got to try outdoor versions and

1152
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:47,679
indoor versions and

1153
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,760
um the indoor was

1154
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:51,358
like hot garbage very well done i don't

1155
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,160
think it would it reminds me a lot of

1156
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:56,960
lemon g in the way the bud is formed in

1157
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:58,639
that it's not as pretty as modern weed

1158
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,358
that people would love but it is very

1159
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:04,078
it's resinous and it's it's not

1160
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:07,440
airy airy but it's not super dense like

1161
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:09,519
uh like cookies or any of those kinds um

1162
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,039
it did smell like hot garbage i wouldn't

1163
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:13,280
say roadkill skunk i would say hot

1164
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:15,279
garbage but that's my nose someone else

1165
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,440
might totally

1166
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,960
smell something skunky as [ __ ] in it and

1167
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,358
i could see how it could lean that way

1168
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,358
because of the hot garbage not there's a

1169
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:24,799
little sweetness to it there's a little

1170
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:27,519
bit of terpenoline somewhere in the

1171
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,760
background i think um now the outdoor

1172
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:32,559
version had the hot garbage but it also

1173
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:35,920
was loud as [ __ ] with piss with and when

1174
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:38,400
i say cat piss or i mean like human piss

1175
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,159
like not like terpinelli it was the

1176
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,559
closest thing to catfish smelling that

1177
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:44,559
actually smelled like urine

1178
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:46,639
so what's funny about weed

1179
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:50,078
is that there are aromas in weed that

1180
00:41:46,639 --> 00:41:52,000
are uh are strangely attractive yeah

1181
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:54,000
that would be horrific in any other

1182
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,800
context yep

1183
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,480
um you know halitosis yeah

1184
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,160
yeah i mean some people liking the chem

1185
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,000
d to a dead body

1186
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:04,078
you know and things of that things that

1187
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,119
would be universally gross

1188
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:09,519
yeah you know uh end up in weed because

1189
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:11,280
that description is sounds horrible to

1190
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:12,559
be honest yeah i mean it's not horrible

1191
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,560
we have a bunch of friends that love it

1192
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:15,920
it's good weed i'm not dissing it but i

1193
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:17,279
just mean that like when matt was

1194
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,079
speaking about it

1195
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,079
yeah

1196
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,200
you know it doesn't sound appealing i

1197
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,280
don't know if you're ordering that on

1198
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:25,039
the menu as the guy prevents the

1199
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:28,800
specials you know

1200
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:30,719
yeah yeah it smells like hot garbage and

1201
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,720
human pee

1202
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:36,719
yeah dead bodies actually smell like

1203
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:38,000
sweet [ __ ] if you didn't know that sweet

1204
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:40,639
sweet

1205
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:45,400
rotten meat feces like when meat rots in

1206
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:45,400
a trash can for too long and sweet

1207
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:50,559
we have some good friends that run it uh

1208
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:52,480
multiple good friends that run it and so

1209
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:54,719
it's in our it's in our uh pretty close

1210
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,519
circle of friends and it's a really good

1211
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:58,078
cut

1212
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:59,838
uh it has a pretty complicated lineage i

1213
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:01,839
like the height too we had a very good

1214
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:04,078
high i wouldn't say it's wickedly potent

1215
00:43:01,838 --> 00:43:06,480
it's not bad it's not bad at all it can

1216
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:09,519
hold its own yeah i mean you know me the

1217
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:12,480
uh good highs are our base one

1218
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:13,679
yeah it's the most important thing so

1219
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,119
what's next

1220
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:17,199
strawberry cough

1221
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:20,160
strawberry cough

1222
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:23,039
um i like the cough quite a bit

1223
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:24,799
the strawberry cough i think grown grown

1224
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:26,559
especially organically it's a really

1225
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:29,200
nice tasting

1226
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:31,838
up energetic buzz yeah

1227
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:33,358
um i don't know how much i believe about

1228
00:43:31,838 --> 00:43:35,039
the story

1229
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:36,799
i don't believe it you know i think the

1230
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:39,119
story is pretty suspect i think the

1231
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:43,200
person that tells it is pretty suspect

1232
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:45,599
uh hi kyle um but uh you know but it is

1233
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:47,519
but it's a great cut yeah it is a good

1234
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:50,079
cut i don't i don't believe much about

1235
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:51,039
the story but i i i like the weed quite

1236
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:53,200
a bit

1237
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:56,800
i've worked a lot with uh the erd beer

1238
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:59,118
lime which is a swiss strawberry sativa

1239
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,000
and i've worked a lot with strawberry

1240
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,240
cough

1241
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,639
expressions in the strawberry cream that

1242
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:06,318
was from a strawberry cough s1

1243
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:08,719
i was positive

1244
00:44:06,318 --> 00:44:10,639
absolutely positive that

1245
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:13,598
that expression is just an herb beer

1246
00:44:10,639 --> 00:44:16,159
expression which is a super strawberry

1247
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:18,318
resinous not necessarily mega potent but

1248
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:19,279
it's not terrible very dense

1249
00:44:18,318 --> 00:44:21,759
um

1250
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:24,160
the the old herb beer and strawberry

1251
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:26,240
cough are damn near identical i i mean

1252
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:27,519
it could be a hybrid of it of some sort

1253
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:29,598
i don't even know if the years match up

1254
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:32,318
but god damn if they're not identical in

1255
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:33,920
every way so who knows who knows i would

1256
00:44:32,318 --> 00:44:36,800
agree with that assessment i think at

1257
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:39,280
its best it tastes really nice it has a

1258
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,880
good uplifting high it's not

1259
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:43,599
overpowering and doesn't have any

1260
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,920
paranoia and it's not knock you down

1261
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:47,680
strong but it's not weak either

1262
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:50,720
yeah it work it works pretty well it

1263
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:52,239
burns nice when done well you know it's

1264
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:53,279
a pretty nice little plant

1265
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:54,559
yeah

1266
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,160
um

1267
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:57,519
train wreck

1268
00:44:56,159 --> 00:45:00,000
train wreck

1269
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:03,838
uh train wreck to me

1270
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,639
is uh is famous for a couple reasons one

1271
00:45:03,838 --> 00:45:08,639
it was one of the first named clones

1272
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:12,239
that got passed around

1273
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:13,920
in humble and mendo as a named clone

1274
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:15,199
yeah like i think caleb would even say

1275
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,400
it's probably one of the first things

1276
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:19,039
that he got

1277
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,639
yes like that was that had a name to it

1278
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:22,079
it wasn't just like seedlines or

1279
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:24,239
whatever right

1280
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:28,480
and it yielded big and it was frosty and

1281
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:30,318
it looked good um and it uh so it got

1282
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:33,199
grown a ton

1283
00:45:30,318 --> 00:45:35,440
and it uh you know it was strong

1284
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:38,000
terpenoline so it was a lot of people's

1285
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,760
first experience with a terpenoline bomb

1286
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,079
type strain yeah

1287
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,760
and it had its moment in the sun and now

1288
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:45,200
there's a bunch of debate about the real

1289
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,359
one or the fake ones we have a good

1290
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:49,358
friend of ours uh we have several good

1291
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:51,598
friends of ours actually that that do

1292
00:45:49,358 --> 00:45:53,759
work with with train wrecks

1293
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:56,000
um and they're a cool plant

1294
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,119
you know it flowers actually pretty fast

1295
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,639
outside

1296
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,480
yeah for all of its sativa

1297
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:02,480
characteristics and all that

1298
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,920
um it actually because i think it

1299
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,800
triggers quick

1300
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,559
yeah

1301
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,560
like is what happens

1302
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:09,519
i love train wreck i love the high from

1303
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:11,440
it

1304
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:14,000
the resin production it does breed

1305
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,880
dominant for those the the heavy terpene

1306
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,880
terps

1307
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,559
but i i love the high from it for me

1308
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,720
it's all ant anxiety some people it

1309

00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,319
yep a lot of people would get two pounds

1318
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,640
of light growing it

1319
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:43,679
uh so it became popular

1320
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:45,838
you know

1321
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:47,199
i i see it coming back and and it's

1322
00:46:45,838 --> 00:46:48,639
going to come back strong i think in

1323
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:51,118
hybrids i think

1324
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:52,400
i think on its own it's very novel for

1325
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:55,519
the first you know if it's new to you

1326
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:57,039
it's novel and cool and different um if

1327
00:46:55,519 --> 00:46:59,599
if you've grown a lot of jack and a lot

1328
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:01,039
of durban a lot of peddling stuff it may

1329
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:03,760
not be as cool but in the hybrids it

1330
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:05,519
[ __ ] it shines it shines

1331
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:08,160
yeah and what's funny about it is in

1332
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:10,400
that era people called terpenoline train

1333
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:13,598
wrecked hers yeah and then that got

1334
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:16,000
dethroned by jack terps it sure did

1335
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:17,119
she did because jack came along and took

1336
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,639
the title

1337
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:20,960
yeah away

1338
00:47:18,639 --> 00:47:22,719
um and and train wreck never didn't get

1339
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:25,119
talked about in that regard but in that

1340
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:27,199
era it was so strong torpedoline

1341
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:29,119
you would talk about train wreck terp

1342
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:30,239
yeah train wreck it smells like train

1343
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:32,318
wreck

1344
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:33,759
it smells like the wreck here's one that

1345
00:47:32,318 --> 00:47:36,000
you have a lot more experience with

1346
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,599
especially the original and that's the

1347
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,239
trinity

1348
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:42,720
the trend

1349
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:44,399
yeah so it it is my introduction to the

1350
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:46,480
trend was basically

1351
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:49,440
um there's some people that know that

1352
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:51,119
are more tied into it than i was but it

1353
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,039
is one of these things where supposedly

1354
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:54,880
it came out of a bag seed that came from

1355
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:58,159
trinity county

1356
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,920
that was traded to a glass blower um

1357
00:47:58,159 --> 00:48:02,639
that was traded to a glass blower for

1358
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:05,838
some some pipes and they sprouted that

1359
00:48:02,639 --> 00:48:07,279
seed in the eugene glassblowing area

1360
00:48:05,838 --> 00:48:08,960
seen right

1361
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,319
and it sort of started spreading around

1362
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,199
that little group

1363
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:12,800
yeah

1364
00:48:11,199 --> 00:48:15,598
you know um and it was kind of a

1365
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,760
dinosaur leaf plant some people got

1366
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:19,519
skunk off it some people got

1367
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,240
burnt rubber some people got like a

1368
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:25,519
sweet pine it seemed to vary

1369
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:26,558
um and it got really popular in oregon

1370
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:28,400
and then

1371
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:29,519
everyone lost it and disappeared for a

1372
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:32,559
long time

1373
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:34,639
yeah um but it's a cool plant

1374
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:36,480
and and people are asking about the goat

1375
00:48:34,639 --> 00:48:39,199
monkey one that's the same one that we

1376
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:41,760
have all gotten and grown in our circle

1377
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:43,358
too and uh i i don't i didn't have

1378
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,040
experience with the original trinity so

1379
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:48,239
i don't know i couldn't say if it's real

1380
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:51,039
or not but i know um csi and inspector

1381
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:52,558
and um and not so or

1382
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:54,079
attempting to figure that out in some

1383
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:56,160
way shape or form by reaching out to the

1384
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:57,680
original dudes yeah and i mean part of

1385
00:48:56,159 --> 00:48:59,838
the part of the issue is too is that i

1386
00:48:57,679 --> 00:49:02,078
have a bunch of friends that had it

1387
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:05,119
but then what is your 15 or 18 year old

1388
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:06,559
memory yeah that's so that really does

1389
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:08,400
play into it when you haven't seen

1390
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:11,280
something in a super long time but you

1391
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,480
had it in 98 or 99 can you absolutely

1392
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,119
guarantee

1393
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:18,480
yeah you know um and most people that

1394
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:21,200
think it's not it uh think it's like uh

1395
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,079
it's it's at the very least the hybrid

1396
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:23,838
yeah

1397
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:25,599
um half my friends think it's it the

1398
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:27,358
other half are and most of the people

1399
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:30,480
that aren't sure it's it is because they

1400
00:49:27,358 --> 00:49:32,159
people can grow it's so nice now it

1401
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:33,039
doesn't look like it

1402
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:34,639
yeah

1403
00:49:33,039 --> 00:49:35,838
in a way it gets a little bigger than

1404
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:37,358
what they remember

1405
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:38,799
yeah and that's the thing we grow so

1406
00:49:37,358 --> 00:49:40,159
much different than we used to and

1407
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,920
people don't realize how vastly

1408
00:49:40,159 --> 00:49:43,440
different people grow than they used to

1409
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,519
but you know what's funny about that is

1410
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,838
so i got it back and then that was the

1411
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:50,639
year that i got evacuated from my spot

1412
00:49:47,838 --> 00:49:52,480
due to a fire yeah and then it froze and

1413
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:54,078
so i had some small trends out there and

1414
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:56,159
they went through hell and almost died

1415
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:58,800
but they came back and finished

1416
00:49:56,159 --> 00:50:01,440
yeah um and every person i showed that

1417
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,880
jar it was like leafy and sparse buds

1418
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,318
and all that everyone thought i had the

1419
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,160
nose to the tee

1420
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:08,719
yeah and

1421
00:50:06,159 --> 00:50:10,239
everyone was convinced it was it

1422
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:12,239
and then the next year i grew it in

1423
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:14,159
perfect conditions in a greenhouse and

1424
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:15,679
fully organic and fed it really nice and

1425
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:17,759
it came out with fat buds and then

1426
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:19,759
people were like oh it looks too nice

1427
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:22,559
yeah it can't be the trend

1428
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:25,359
you got it to get nice buds yeah that's

1429
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:26,800
impossible it's it's a leafy shitty

1430
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:30,480
see-through

1431
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:32,240
type of strain yeah so you know

1432
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,318
the good part is is the one that's the

1433
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:35,199
one that's floating around right now

1434
00:50:34,318 --> 00:50:37,679
yeah

1435
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:39,519
it's strong weed and people are often

1436
00:50:37,679 --> 00:50:40,480
surprised when they smoke it how high

1437
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:42,880
they get

1438
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:45,599
oh interesting regardless so yeah it

1439
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:47,440
knocked pip on his ass that's funny it

1440
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:49,280
did it it surprised him how stoned he

1441
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:51,358
got we didn't even finish the joint

1442
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,720
when he was visiting one time um so

1443
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:54,719
regardless of whether or not it's

1444
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:56,879
actually the real one the one that

1445
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:59,358
floats around is an excellent strain in

1446
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,760
my opinion let's show i'll i'll clown on

1447
00:50:59,358 --> 00:51:04,639
myself to show how different people grew

1448
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:06,960
at least me in 2006 than now this is a

1449
00:51:04,639 --> 00:51:08,719
picture of clockwork of me trying like

1450
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,159
it's vastly different there's no resin

1451
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:11,919
production on this thing you know what i

1452
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:13,598
mean a lot of people are growing like

1453
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,838
that going through these old books like

1454
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:16,720
that is just what we looked like back

1455
00:51:15,838 --> 00:51:18,400
then

1456
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:20,480
nobody

1457
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:22,240
yeah there wasn't really a lot of

1458
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:23,519
self-assessment going on and i have you

1459
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:25,519
know i have friends

1460
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:27,838
that talk about that where you know they

1461
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:28,719
grew in five gallon pots with plain

1462
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:31,440
water

1463
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:34,239
and all in soil amendments

1464
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:38,559
with metal halides in oregon in a

1465
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:39,519
rudimentary 397 you know your 1997 setup

1466
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:42,000
yeah

1467
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:44,239
you know and you know you're obviously

1468
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,159
25 years later if you're still growing

1469
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:48,000
lead you're probably better at it

1470
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:51,039
yeah and then i was growing in 100

1471
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,079
degree rooms like no like no issues just

1472
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:53,039
[ __ ]

1473
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:53,920
um

1474
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:55,920
so

1475
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:58,480
i believe

1476
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,760
oh williams wonder did you go to the mlb

1477
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:02,880
or any of the williams winter cuts going

1478
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:04,559
around i have grown williams wonder

1479
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:07,119
the one i like it

1480
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:10,000
it's not particularly potent but it is a

1481
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:13,119
large yielding and to me like sweet and

1482
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:16,239
very old-school stelling smelling

1483
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:18,400
afghan that stacks yeah it's kind of

1484
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:19,279
it's not brown it's a little tannish

1485
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,680
maybe

1486
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:24,000
in kind of the way that it grows yeah

1487
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:25,598
like the the bud formation or whatever

1488
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,079
um and there's still people in the

1489
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:30,160
pacific northwest or at least was five

1490
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:32,400
or six years ago that we're growing it

1491
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:34,239
selling it to old people getting three

1492
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,760
pounds of light

1493
00:52:34,239 --> 00:52:38,318
so it floats around

1494
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:40,000
yeah um and then you know various

1495
00:52:38,318 --> 00:52:42,159
breeders have used it because anything

1496
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,000
that has a tendency to throw donkey dick

1497
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:45,519
style buds

1498
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,800
they want to mix that into their seed

1499
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:50,079
lines oh sure especially back then yeah

1500
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,039
so

1501
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:52,000
you know

1502
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:53,279
um

1503
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,679
but it's one of i think it's one of

1504
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,359
those old seed lines that like

1505
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:59,118
people get excited about and it would

1506
00:52:57,358 --> 00:53:01,039
probably occasionally throw a really

1507
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:02,720
nice plant but it probably has a decent

1508
00:53:01,039 --> 00:53:03,920
propensity of junk

1509
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:06,480
yeah

1510
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:08,880
and if you want the truth you know a lot

1511
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:11,119
of those 80s and 90s varieties had some

1512
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:13,519
crazy elites in them

1513
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:15,200
but they might have like a 20 of it

1514
00:53:13,519 --> 00:53:16,800
might be trash

1515
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:19,118
that's the way i feel like going back

1516
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:21,359
and looking at a lot of the different um

1517
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:22,720
80s and 90s indicas that were being

1518
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:23,920
pushed out from

1519
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:26,639
um

1520
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:28,639
uh amsterdam the their afghanis the

1521
00:53:26,639 --> 00:53:31,118
different afghani blends and stuff the

1522
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:33,440
hash plants and stuff there was a lot of

1523
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:35,760
uh [ __ ]

1524
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:38,400
just subpar stuff it's hard looking

1525
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:40,559
anyways you know cookies kind of changed

1526
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,960
the game as far as requiring what weed

1527
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:45,280
needs to look like yeah people were

1528
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:46,559
certainly willing to accept much uglier

1529
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,319
cannabis

1530
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:50,400
as long as it worked well

1531
00:53:48,318 --> 00:53:51,679
yeah smoked good

1532
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,760
you know

1533
00:53:51,679 --> 00:53:56,639
okay now we're going to enter the list

1534
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:58,559
of things that we've added in or

1535
00:53:56,639 --> 00:54:00,639
what have you um do you want to start

1536
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:02,240
with your list or mine uh you go for

1537
00:54:00,639 --> 00:54:04,719
yours okay

1538
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:06,558
um first is going to be crystal chunk

1539
00:54:04,719 --> 00:54:08,959
since it's fresh on your memory crystal

1540
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:11,599
chunk uh this one could also be for a

1541
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:14,000
while uh so the crystal chunk i actually

1542
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:16,079
found out a little bit more about just

1543
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,800
this past couple weeks

1544
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:19,119
so

1545
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:21,039
how crystal chunk is important to me is

1546
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:22,400
that it was the first clone that my

1547
00:54:21,039 --> 00:54:25,519
friend gave me

1548
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:26,400
um to grow indoor with yeah in my one

1549
00:54:25,519 --> 00:54:29,199
lighter

1550
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:31,200
right we all remember our first and so

1551
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:32,480
it yeah i grew the crystal chunk and

1552
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:34,318
then there was a number of people in

1553
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:36,000
chicago that grew the crystal chunk it

1554
00:54:34,318 --> 00:54:38,400
made its way out to

1555
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,639
colorado it made its way to montana

1556
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,639
and there was various circles of people

1557
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:45,598
that grew it it was uh

1558
00:54:42,639 --> 00:54:48,400
um it was an nl of some kind it was

1559
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:49,680
popped in 88 or 89 in carbondale

1560
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:52,480
illinois

1561
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:54,719
um and it was a number of things these

1562
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,318
guys used to go to to neville every year

1563
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:57,598
and buy seats

1564
00:54:56,318 --> 00:54:59,440
and then they would come back to

1565
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:01,599
carbondale which is in far southern

1566
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:03,838
illinois it's a college town down there

1567
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:05,440
and they would blow up indoors

1568
00:55:03,838 --> 00:55:06,960
and then in order to not get busted in

1569
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:08,639
their college town

1570
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:11,679
they would sell the weed in the huge

1571
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:13,118
city of chicago like four hours north

1572
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:15,279
right and that cat and that kept them

1573
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:17,680
anonymous in their hometown

1574
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:20,960
right and so that's the chunk the chunk

1575
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:23,279
is some kind of nl from neville in 88 or

1576
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,480
89. i don't know if it's still alive i

1577
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,760
think not

1578
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,199
yeah i have some friends that have

1579
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:29,760
hybrids in it

1580
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:31,519
um i brought it to california in 98 when

1581
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:34,640
i moved out here

1582
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:36,400
i lost it in o3 i think maybe so

1583
00:55:34,639 --> 00:55:38,239
um but it's a cool one

1584
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:41,760
super potent

1585
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:43,759
low odor low low smell low taste do we

1586
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,559
know if that clone's still around i

1587
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,319
don't

1588
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:47,760
my buddies that i just my buddies that i

1589
00:55:46,318 --> 00:55:50,239
just went and visited said that it

1590
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:51,760
existed as late as 2013.

1591
00:55:50,239 --> 00:55:53,598
oh wow so we're still kicking around

1592
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:56,000
till then and there's c and they gave me

1593
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:57,920
some seeds of it uh

1594
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,719
not pure you know not river

1595
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:01,680
but but but mixed with other [ __ ] so

1596
00:56:00,719 --> 00:56:04,318

1605
00:56:18,318 --> 00:56:23,519
than that um um but that the chunk kind

1606
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:25,358
of got spread around a little bit and

1607

became pretty famous in those little

1608
00:56:25,358 --> 00:56:28,960
circles

1609
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:31,838

deep chunk is pretty famous in various

1612
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:38,640
ways i would say uh

1613
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:40,720
it floated around mendocino we were just

1614
00:56:38,639 --> 00:56:42,960
talking about this yesterday

1615
00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:44,639
it floated around mendocino uh because

1616
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:46,480
that's kind of where one of the places

1617
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:48,159
it was developed um

1618
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,440
as monkey balls

1619
00:56:48,159 --> 00:56:51,920
yes

1620
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:53,838
cabbage we all called it monkey balls

1621
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:56,720
back then because it was like golf ball

1622
00:56:53,838 --> 00:56:58,400
size purplish super

1623
00:56:56,719 --> 00:57:00,318

00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:44,880
have a lot of patience for idiocy and

1643
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:46,640
then it might actually be

1644
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,960
uh

1645
00:57:46,639 --> 00:57:50,879
it might actually be one of the only

1646
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:53,280
ibl's out there

1647
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:55,119
yeah that's i noticed someone was saying

1648
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:57,119
that they just have seen people taking

1649
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:58,318
it to f13

1650
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:59,838
on

1651
00:57:58,318 --> 00:58:02,159
selling and selling seeds of it like

1652
00:57:59,838 --> 00:58:03,679
deep chunk was already as close to ibos

1653
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:06,558
you're going to get if people keep

1654
00:58:03,679 --> 00:58:07,838
taking that inwards generations i'm not

1655
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:12,160
sure what they're trying to achieve

1656
00:58:07,838 --> 00:58:14,719
other than making more seed maybe um but

1657
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:18,078
eventually you're gonna suffer from some

1658
00:58:14,719 --> 00:58:19,679
heavy heavy inbred depression no matter

1659
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:20,798
what you do with it at that point it was

1660
00:58:19,679 --> 00:58:22,318
already

1661
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:24,400
it was already where it needed to be

1662
00:58:22,318 --> 00:58:26,239
yeah there's people saying purple monkey

1663
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:28,160
balls monkey balls was pretty common in

1664
00:58:26,239 --> 00:58:29,118
mendo like if you got cold october

1665
00:58:28,159 --> 00:58:31,679
nights

1666
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:35,039
yeah most of the plant would purple up

1667
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:36,480
you know yeah and and in that regard and

1668
00:58:35,039 --> 00:58:37,838
so it was like that's how i got

1669
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,599
introduced to it it's just one of those

1670
00:58:37,838 --> 00:58:40,400
old-time hill strains

1671
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:42,640
yeah

1672
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:45,680
um and the problem with purple chunk in

1673
00:58:42,639 --> 00:58:48,000
my or you know deep chunk in my opinion

1674
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:50,960
is that it is what it is

1675
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,079
and it breeds very much like itself

1676
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,440
yeah and you're not going to be

1677
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:54,720
surprised

1678
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,880
yeah

1679
00:58:54,719 --> 00:58:58,480
yeah so if you like that and that's what

1680
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,480
you want to add in and you want to add

1681
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:02,400
in some of those qualities

1682
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:05,679
um you can

1683
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:06,880
yeah um i've seen very good

1684
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:11,039
um

1685
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:12,559
seedlines of deep chunk i know uh csi

1686
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:16,798
inspector has some

1687
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:19,280
and uh kos the rev has an amazing one

1688
00:59:16,798 --> 00:59:21,119
but i've seen very very

1689
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,920
bad resin less

1690
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:24,160
just

1691
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:27,519
terrible deep chunks which a resin this

1692
00:59:24,159 --> 00:59:29,598
deep chunk is a disappointing thing yeah

1693
00:59:27,519 --> 00:59:32,400
so it can you know on the right the

1694
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:34,400
right hybrid the right outcross

1695
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:36,400
it can pop yeah and it can lend

1696
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:37,680
qualities to it that make it overall

1697
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,920
amazing

1698
00:59:37,679 --> 00:59:43,039
uh and it can also just kind of be a

1699
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:46,480
very boring leafy

1700
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:49,039
not fun high afghan yeah

1701
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:51,599
someone asked it's a good question and

1702
00:59:49,039 --> 00:59:52,480
and it'll be uh good to answer something

1703
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:54,480
a lot of people probably don't

1704
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:55,760
understand this if plants get inbreeding

1705
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:58,000
depression

1706
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:59,520
how do you get land races so land races

1707
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,079
are constant

1708
00:59:59,519 --> 01:00:04,159
big populations wild populations and

1709
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:05,599
there is some inbreeding that goes on

1710
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:07,759
but because it's a wild diverse

1711
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:09,440
population it's always going to be a

1712
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:11,760
little bit diverse as it goes you know

1713
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:14,880
some do get inbreeding depression some

1714
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:19,200
and lots of land races are just pure

1715
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:21,200
like cbd heavy low thc you know herm

1716
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:23,439
machines and that's just what cannabis

1717
01:00:21,199 --> 01:00:25,358
wants to be another another way to

1718
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:27,358
describe the scale of it

1719
01:00:25,358 --> 01:00:29,358
is that um

1720
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:32,480
when we talk about inbreeding depression

1721
01:00:29,358 --> 01:00:35,920
mostly we're talking about small indoor

1722
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:38,159
greenhouse style selections with maybe

1723
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:40,639
you know like you know anywhere from one

1724
01:00:38,159 --> 01:00:42,639
to a few males perhaps and you know

1725
01:00:40,639 --> 01:00:44,239
certain amount of females where what

1726
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:46,078
matt was describing

1727
01:00:44,239 --> 01:00:48,798
if you're in mexico or

1728
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:51,200
thailand or whatever is fields of weed

1729
01:00:48,798 --> 01:00:53,039
yes with thousands of brothers and

1730
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:54,719
sisters

1731
01:00:53,039 --> 01:00:57,759
right yeah and that's where the seeded

1732
01:00:54,719 --> 01:00:59,439
comes from and so as a result of that

1733
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:01,359
you're going to get like a much wider

1734
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:04,318
population it's when we start messing

1735
01:01:01,358 --> 01:01:06,480
with them in much smaller non-field size

1736
01:01:04,318 --> 01:01:08,239
environments yeah that you can get

1737
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:09,519
inbred pretty quick

1738
01:01:08,239 --> 01:01:11,039
oh yeah

1739
01:01:09,519 --> 01:01:13,440
somebody was asking him if we can speak

1740
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:14,880
on tom hill's haze

1741
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:18,240
yeah i mean there's not a clone that

1742
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:20,240
goes around to that so um but yeah it's

1743
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:22,639
a it's a famous strain of his

1744
01:01:20,239 --> 01:01:24,879
um if it was

1745
01:01:22,639 --> 01:01:26,639
pretty notorious for the fact that like

1746
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:29,039
dog would tell people you know you need

1747
01:01:26,639 --> 01:01:30,879
a good 10 packs to find a keeper it just

1748
01:01:29,039 --> 01:01:34,318
is what it is on that um it was from

1749
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:35,599
positronics um their haze 19

1750
01:01:34,318 --> 01:01:37,519
is is

1751
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:40,798
from sam's haze if i remember correctly

1752
01:01:37,519 --> 01:01:43,280
yeah so yeah he positronics is one of

1753
01:01:40,798 --> 01:01:45,920
the three people besides sam that sam

1754
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:49,280
gave hayes to when he went to

1755
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:52,159
um amsterdam yeah he gave it to neville

1756
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:54,880
he gave it to corel from uh super sativa

1757
01:01:52,159 --> 01:01:56,719
seed club and he gave it to pozzi yeah

1758
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:58,880
and he actually worked at pozzi for a

1759
01:01:56,719 --> 01:02:00,719
bit uh as far as like just helping

1760
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:04,400
making breeding selections and things of

1761
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:08,318
that nature so tom hill's haze is from

1762
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:11,920
um the haze that sam gave to pozzi yeah

1763
01:02:08,318 --> 01:02:13,199
and it's i saw a lot of hey hey

1764
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:15,680
would be a great name for it because

1765
01:02:13,199 --> 01:02:17,118
it's very hay and carroty and

1766
01:02:15,679 --> 01:02:18,719
lots of hay

1767
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:19,599
lots of carrot

1768
01:02:18,719 --> 01:02:20,639
hay

1769
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:23,200
but

1770
01:02:20,639 --> 01:02:25,199
i did see some really beautiful um

1771
01:02:23,199 --> 01:02:27,038
uh examples of it from hazy lady over on

1772
01:02:25,199 --> 01:02:29,279
mr nice and i'm not sure she deleted her

1773
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:31,520
account after key play attacked her but

1774
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:32,400
um their those pictures might still be

1775
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:35,559
up there and if you want to see a

1776
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:38,318
beautiful haze look for hazy ladies

1777
01:02:35,559 --> 01:02:40,960
h-a-z-y-l-a-d-y or uh grove tom hill's

1778
01:02:38,318 --> 01:02:43,199
hayes and there's an aspect too where

1779
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:45,280
like even when even when like the flying

1780
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:48,960
dutchman or whatever was selling sam's

1781
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:51,839
haze yes his ohays or whatever you know

1782
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:53,199
um they even said that like only 10 of

1783
01:02:51,838 --> 01:02:56,000
them are gonna be

1784
01:02:53,199 --> 01:02:58,719
you kind of have to hunt a lot and

1785
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,480
there's a lot of junk in that haze

1786
01:02:58,719 --> 01:03:03,598
and the problem with haze is that since

1787
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:05,199
most of it goes 16 to 24 weeks

1788
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:07,119
you know searching for the needle in a

1789
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:08,480
haystack and having the space to run a

1790
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:11,280
hundred of them

1791
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:13,280
yeah and then smoke test them and figure

1792
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:15,839
out which one or two are the ones that

1793
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:17,680
are good and the rest are mostly bunk

1794
01:03:15,838 --> 01:03:20,400
yeah that's hard

1795
01:03:17,679 --> 01:03:23,279
yeah it's time consuming and jungle weed

1796
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,280
and a lot of space

1797
01:03:23,358 --> 01:03:26,880
okay uh silver pearl did you get to try

1798
01:03:25,679 --> 01:03:27,919
uh pipsque

1799
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:29,358
oh yeah

1800
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:32,079
what do you think

1801
01:03:29,358 --> 01:03:34,000
it reminded me of the silver pearl i

1802
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:36,559
knew in the 90s

1803
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,318
um in the sense that uh this is gonna

1804
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:40,400
sound gross again but

1805
01:03:38,318 --> 01:03:42,318
it has this like there's this thing when

1806
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:44,160
babies are first born

1807
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:45,440
and all they drink is milk and they're

1808
01:03:44,159 --> 01:03:48,159
getting a lot of their mom's like

1809
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:51,358
colostrum or whatever yeah and baby poo

1810
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:52,480
kind of has this like sweet

1811
01:03:51,358 --> 01:03:54,960
like it's

1812
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:56,880
it's just it's not really all that gross

1813
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:58,798
yeah right and then they start eating

1814
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:00,960
real different foods and it's like then

1815
01:03:58,798 --> 01:04:04,239
it's just [ __ ] you know but yeah but the

1816
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:06,639
silver pearl has this kind of like sweet

1817
01:04:04,239 --> 01:04:07,919
young young baby poo

1818
01:04:06,639 --> 01:04:11,358
type smell

1819
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:14,240
um and i smelled that in his cut

1820
01:04:11,358 --> 01:04:16,000
so wild i got pick out like bubble gummy

1821
01:04:14,239 --> 01:04:17,598
but not pink bubble gum like some kind

1822
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,960
of sweet

1823
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:21,280
and then

1824
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:23,760
not skunky but somewhere along that

1825
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:26,079
direction it was so hard to describe but

1826
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:28,000
it's one of my favorite smells i mean

1827
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:30,000
the other thing is that like you know i

1828
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,838
i had kids and you didn't so

1829
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,639
there's a point when you have aromas

1830
01:04:31,838 --> 01:04:36,400
that what reminds you of what you have

1831
01:04:34,639 --> 01:04:38,318
like we talk about how there's no skunks

1832
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:39,760
in europe you have to be actually

1833
01:04:38,318 --> 01:04:41,119
exposed

1834
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:43,599
to the smell

1835
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:47,200
to have smelling something else trigger

1836
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:49,119
that memory yes i i've not got my nose a

1837
01:04:47,199 --> 01:04:50,960
baby [ __ ] yeah yeah

1838
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:53,838
so you know

1839
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:55,280
the silver pearl was to get a little bit

1840
01:04:53,838 --> 01:04:58,480
more specific

1841
01:04:55,280 --> 01:05:02,559
um i believe silver pearl is a mix of

1842
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:06,838
early girls skunk one and nl5 yes

1843
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:09,599
um and it is a pretty leafy

1844
01:05:06,838 --> 01:05:11,599
frosty nice smelling

1845
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:12,400
you know uh uh

1846
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:15,039
you know

1847
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:17,599
it was an early poly hybrid from neville

1848
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:19,920
it was it's a great uh resin dumper for

1849
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:22,480
like dry sift and [ __ ] too it is so

1850
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:24,798
frosty but it is so leafy

1851
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:26,559
it's leafy and very frosty

1852
01:05:24,798 --> 01:05:28,400
and you know back then especially like

1853
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:30,960
most things were most things that were

1854
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:32,400
getting released were f1s yeah and so

1855
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:34,318
that was that was sort of in the first

1856
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:36,880
wave of poly hybrids of different

1857
01:05:34,318 --> 01:05:40,000
crosses he'd made and then combining

1858
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:42,000
those into into different things yeah

1859
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:45,039
so that's silver pearl it's a cool old

1860
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:47,119
it's a cool old line from um both the

1861
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:51,280
seed bank in the 80s from neville and

1862
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:55,039
from the years of scentsy yep okay uh

1863
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:55,039
amnesia [ __ ] haze

1864
01:05:55,358 --> 01:05:59,038
it wasn't this big in the u.s obviously

1865
01:05:57,358 --> 01:06:01,679
but i mean you can't really talk about

1866
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:03,760
that era of clones with in the world

1867
01:06:01,679 --> 01:06:06,000
without mentioning amnesia hayes i mean

1868
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:09,920
i think i think

1869
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:11,358
amnesia hayes is sort of like uh

1870
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:14,559
you know i don't want to be wrong here

1871
01:06:11,358 --> 01:06:17,038
but i associate amnesia haze with after

1872
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:19,599
neville put out super silver haze and

1873
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:21,839
mango haze and and neville's haze and

1874
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:24,400
sort of stopped contributing yeah and

1875
01:06:21,838 --> 01:06:26,639
greenhouse sort of reconstituted their

1876
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:28,160
seed company right yeah

1877
01:06:26,639 --> 01:06:30,838
that was one of the that was the thing

1878
01:06:28,159 --> 01:06:34,558
that came out after that right

1879
01:06:30,838 --> 01:06:38,159
yeah for the most part yeah yeah yeah

1880
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:39,839
and some sort of super silver haze

1881
01:06:38,159 --> 01:06:41,920
and so there's an aspect where there's

1882
01:06:39,838 --> 01:06:43,440
this is highly disputed so no one take

1883
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:46,079
this the wrong way

1884
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:48,240
but if you listen to neville and shanti

1885
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:50,960
they claim that after neville's

1886
01:06:48,239 --> 01:06:53,279
experience at scentsy um they didn't

1887
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:55,599
want to give arjun all the clones and

1888
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:58,880
seeds and and all that

1889
01:06:55,599 --> 01:07:02,079
um so they controlled all that and they

1890
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:04,960
just gave greenhouse flour and seeds for

1891
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:07,760
sale yeah so when they left to do their

1892
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:10,000
own thing arjun had probably the most

1893
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:11,680
famous at the time between him and

1894
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,960
scentsy he had the most famous

1895
01:07:11,679 --> 01:07:13,759
award-winning

1896
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:15,440
uh

1897
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:18,720
seed bank

1898
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:21,838
and he is his breeders left yeah

1899
01:07:18,719 --> 01:07:24,239
and so he brought on franco and rumor is

1900
01:07:21,838 --> 01:07:26,880
is that he bought 20 or 30 000 euros

1901
01:07:24,239 --> 01:07:28,959
worth of his own seed stock yeah

1902
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:31,838
and they started breeding and doing

1903
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:34,240
various things trying to come up with

1904
01:07:31,838 --> 01:07:36,318
seed for their seed company yeah and i

1905
01:07:34,239 --> 01:07:39,279
think that's where like arjun's haze one

1906
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:41,358
through five and amnesia haze and you

1907
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:42,400
know lemon this and all that started

1908
01:07:41,358 --> 01:07:44,400
happening

1909
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:46,400
yeah you know um and that's that's

1910
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:48,559
amnesia haze to me yeah i don't remember

1911
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:51,280
who did i think it was like high pro or

1912
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:53,440
order lab or one of them made amnesia or

1913
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:57,280
amnesia i can't remember the [ __ ]

1914
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:58,559
story but it's it's not um it's not soma

1915
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:00,400
or uh

1916
01:07:58,559 --> 01:08:01,599
or whoever else people are saying yeah

1917
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:03,200
and i think it's i think it's one of

1918
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:05,039
those things too that like it's one of

1919
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:07,038
those renames that like they took some

1920
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:09,280
other haze in amsterdam to sell at

1921
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:11,839
coffee shops and like we did in cush in

1922
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:14,160
la and just gave it a new name

1923
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:16,399
that one's it's good it's a it's a

1924
01:08:14,159 --> 01:08:18,158
almost fruity floral that's the best way

1925
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:20,879
i can describe it's for penalty but it's

1926
01:08:18,158 --> 01:08:22,719
it's nice it's resinous it's potent i

1927
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:25,600
see why it was passed around for so long

1928
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:28,399
it's consistently a a great haze i think

1929
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:31,039
i like it i like haze so yeah

1930
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:32,238
it's good um did you ever run any blue

1931
01:08:31,039 --> 01:08:33,039
cheese

1932
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:34,718
yeah

1933
01:08:33,039 --> 01:08:36,960
yeah did you have a cut you liked or

1934
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:39,520
they would pass around um so when we

1935
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:41,600
were chatting about those those ron's

1936
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:43,359
parties and where a lot of us were

1937
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:45,120
gathering in those years

1938
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:46,960
um there was a lot of cool things

1939
01:08:45,119 --> 01:08:49,358
crossed of the blue family

1940
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:51,359
and while uh i didn't really like a lot

1941
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:53,359
of the straight blue stuff

1942
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:56,239
yeah a lot of the outcrosses were really

1943
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:58,560
good yeah um and blue cheese there was

1944
01:08:56,238 --> 01:09:01,599
blue widow blue cheese

1945
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:03,520
um blue rhino blue rhino there was a

1946
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:06,159
bunch of different blue hybrids out

1947
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:08,960
crosses that i actually preferred the

1948
01:09:06,158 --> 01:09:11,599
straight blue lines yeah and blue cheese

1949
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:13,198
was one of those ones yeah you know so

1950
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:16,079
um i didn't grow it a bunch or anything

1951
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:18,399
like that but it was a it was a pretty

1952
01:09:16,079 --> 01:09:19,600
sweet floral

1953
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:22,238
you know

1954
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:23,920
slightly skunk one-ish type plant yeah

1955
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:25,919
you know i mean there was there was a

1956
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:27,039
bunch of seeds passed around by friends

1957
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:28,560
too

1958
01:09:27,039 --> 01:09:30,798
oh yeah

1959
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:32,159
it wasn't just a cut i mean it was like

1960
01:09:30,798 --> 01:09:35,039
you know there was there was people that

1961
01:09:32,158 --> 01:09:36,238
had crosses and there was f2s

1962
01:09:35,039 --> 01:09:38,238
yeah so

1963
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:40,158
did you ever have any experience with it

1964
01:09:38,238 --> 01:09:42,399
uh no but i did make a blue cheese with

1965
01:09:40,158 --> 01:09:43,759
the blue bonnet that i really enjoy and

1966
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:45,599
that was just because so many people

1967
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:46,960
over the years asked me if i had a good

1968
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,880
blue cheese that i would recommend i'm

1969
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:50,239
like blue [ __ ] cheese i did not want

1970
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:52,159
anything to do with cheese in the first

1971
01:09:50,238 --> 01:09:53,759
place it was everywhere it was a british

1972
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:55,519
thing so during those years like

1973
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:57,039
whenever blue cheese doesn't [ __ ] that

1974
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:59,280
what the [ __ ]

1975
01:09:57,039 --> 01:10:01,119
i'm not regressive but i did find that

1976
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:02,319
it is a [ __ ] amazing combo and i was

1977
01:10:01,119 --> 01:10:04,559
just being announced

1978
01:10:02,319 --> 01:10:06,399
you cross cool things to skunk one and

1979
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:09,280
nice things come out of it that's why

1980
01:10:06,399 --> 01:10:10,960
it's been a breeder standard for decades

1981
01:10:09,279 --> 01:10:14,158
here's one that's a little self-serving

1982
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:16,319
but it was so huge in san diego that

1983
01:10:14,158 --> 01:10:18,799
um i think it was pretty huge everywhere

1984
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:20,079
actually uh bubble berry

1985
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:21,279
bubble berry

1986
01:10:20,079 --> 01:10:22,880
yeah

1987
01:10:21,279 --> 01:10:23,759
yeah did you have any of those cuts up

1988
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:25,760
there

1989
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:28,480
yeah we had some bubble berry

1990
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:30,400
uh i believe it was it was first offered

1991
01:10:28,479 --> 01:10:32,639
by sag martha

1992
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:33,920
yeah i think right yep yep that was a

1993
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:36,079
total stream

1994
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:38,880
um you know dj short sent a bunch of

1995
01:10:36,079 --> 01:10:41,119
blue family seeds to sag martha for them

1996
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:42,319
to retail them through their their

1997
01:10:41,119 --> 01:10:44,399
business

1998
01:10:42,319 --> 01:10:46,559
and tony crossed

1999
01:10:44,399 --> 01:10:48,799
some blue work um

2000
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:50,880
you know to some bubble gum

2001
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:53,199
yep and the bubble berry was born and

2002
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:54,400
the and the bubble gum is famously mold

2003
01:10:53,198 --> 01:10:57,439
resistant

2004
01:10:54,399 --> 01:10:58,639
and uh throws a very consistent type

2005
01:10:57,439 --> 01:11:01,439
afghan

2006
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:04,079
beautiful plant yeah and the above the

2007
01:11:01,439 --> 01:11:06,158
blueberry added terps and color

2008
01:11:04,079 --> 01:11:08,000
and some frost and some attractiveness

2009
01:11:06,158 --> 01:11:09,920
and some other weird stuff

2010
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:13,600
and so there was a good cut that floated

2011
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:14,319
around that everybody kind of loved yeah

2012
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:16,159
yeah

2013
01:11:14,319 --> 01:11:17,920
it was it was well loved in san diego

2014
01:11:16,158 --> 01:11:20,639
too it was one of my favorite strains

2015
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:23,440
the the the bigly chew pink bubble gum

2016
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:25,199
with heavy heavy like blueberry jam it's

2017
01:11:23,439 --> 01:11:26,479
insane and and

2018
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:27,919
what's funny is

2019
01:11:26,479 --> 01:11:29,439
i look at the old pictures of bubble

2020
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:30,960
berry from tony back in the day and he

2021
01:11:29,439 --> 01:11:34,719
obviously used

2022
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:36,000
the same line of bubble gum that we used

2023
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:38,319
however

2024
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,238
it wasn't the same clone and and the

2025
01:11:38,319 --> 01:11:42,799
blue mill we used was blue bonnet and

2026
01:11:40,238 --> 01:11:44,639
they used a blueberry mill which similar

2027
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:47,279
lines however

2028
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:48,800
they look uncannily similar when crossed

2029
01:11:47,279 --> 01:11:51,359
and i it might be because bubble gum

2030
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:53,840
breeds so true you know like

2031
01:11:51,359 --> 01:11:56,158
but it looks damn similar even all these

2032
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:59,119
years separated different parentage but

2033
01:11:56,158 --> 01:12:00,719
similar to similar lineage uh it is it's

2034
01:11:59,119 --> 01:12:02,880
a cool looking plant and it's very

2035
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:05,119
consistent when crossed even even in the

2036
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:07,119
same family yeah and it's it there's

2037
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:09,279
cool pictures of it from olden times

2038
01:12:07,119 --> 01:12:11,920
from the 90s matt the various breeders

2039
01:12:09,279 --> 01:12:13,039
have done work with it yep um you did

2040
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:16,800
work with it

2041
01:12:13,039 --> 01:12:18,479
um bob did stuff with it right

2042
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,840
you know um

2043
01:12:18,479 --> 01:12:23,439
bog bubble

2044
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:26,400
yeah that based on it in a way

2045
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:27,759
yeah like oh he was that was uh bubble

2046
01:12:26,399 --> 01:12:29,279
gum i don't think it was bubble berry

2047
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,719
you don't think it was bubble berry no

2048
01:12:29,279 --> 01:12:33,759
it was bubble gum yeah

2049
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:35,679
now or something yeah anyway it was it

2050
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:38,400
was it was a cool line

2051
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:39,760
it's it's a good example of how

2052
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:41,439
uh when two things that are very

2053
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:44,640
different from each other come together

2054
01:12:41,439 --> 01:12:46,639
for the first time yeah uh you can pop

2055
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:47,920
some cool plants yeah

2056
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:49,520
absolutely

2057
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:51,760
yeah people are still talking about blue

2058
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:54,719
rhino blue this blue that blue the blue

2059
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:56,960
outcrosses i'll say this too there was a

2060
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:59,279
very limited number of people outside

2061
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:01,520
the amsterdam seed banks in the late 90s

2062
01:12:59,279 --> 01:13:02,800
and early 2000s that got famous on the

2063
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:05,199
forums

2064
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:07,920
and there were certain forums of

2065
01:13:05,198 --> 01:13:10,639
watching of some blueberry groves that

2066
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:12,399
got everybody hyped on blueberry yep and

2067
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:14,320
so people started getting blueberry and

2068
01:13:12,399 --> 01:13:17,119
since it was obviously red seeds they

2069
01:13:14,319 --> 01:13:18,799
started crossing it to other lines

2070
01:13:17,119 --> 01:13:21,760
and that's when all those cool hybrids

2071
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:24,159
came out so like in the early 2000s blue

2072
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:26,000
and blue and white hybrids what the

2073
01:13:24,158 --> 01:13:27,679
white widow family and the blue family

2074
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:31,119
they were crossed to all kinds of things

2075
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:31,119
including each other yep

2076
01:13:31,359 --> 01:13:36,079
all right um um maui wowie

2077
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:37,679
i this is kind of a weird one because

2078
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:39,198
it's one of those ones where i a lot of

2079
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:40,480
people don't see the same maui wowie

2080
01:13:39,198 --> 01:13:42,639
twice

2081
01:13:40,479 --> 01:13:45,839
i think maui wowie is a lot like the

2082
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:48,239
alaskan thunder [ __ ] or crippy or

2083
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:50,319
diesel or you know fire

2084
01:13:48,238 --> 01:13:53,519
yeah you know it was probably it was

2085
01:13:50,319 --> 01:13:56,238
probably a sativa afghan grown on maui

2086
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:58,080
yeah um and it rhymes

2087
01:13:56,238 --> 01:14:00,158
and that makes it easy to sell and so it

2088
01:13:58,079 --> 01:14:02,399
was probably applied to a bunch of

2089
01:14:00,158 --> 01:14:03,359
different types of hawaiian weed

2090
01:14:02,399 --> 01:14:04,399
yeah

2091
01:14:03,359 --> 01:14:06,719
i think that's probably the most

2092
01:14:04,399 --> 01:14:08,319
accurate thing to say about it yeah i

2093
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:11,119
think that's that's that's fair how

2094
01:14:08,319 --> 01:14:12,079
about lamb's bread or lamb's breath

2095
01:14:11,119 --> 01:14:13,760
or

2096
01:14:12,079 --> 01:14:15,519
whatever you know i don't have any

2097
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:18,560
personal experience with that one but it

2098
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:21,920
was supposed to be a wild sativa like 20

2099
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:22,960
25 weeks yeah that came out of jamaica

2100
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:24,560
yep

2101
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:26,319
and was supposed to be pretty famous it

2102
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:29,120
was before

2103
01:14:26,319 --> 01:14:31,599
jamaica got inundated with uh your

2104
01:14:29,119 --> 01:14:33,760
european uh weed strains yeah and

2105
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:35,760
started growing mostly dutch [ __ ]

2106
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:37,760
yep um

2107
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:39,520
and as a result of that it's a little

2108
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:41,280
bit before my time and i don't even know

2109
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:43,120
that i ever saw one that i believe was

2110
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:44,479
true this is the only one that i

2111
01:14:43,119 --> 01:14:46,640
remember seeing and i'm like okay that

2112
01:14:44,479 --> 01:14:48,879
makes sense for a long flowering indian

2113
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:50,480
sativa type this was the pictures from

2114
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:52,960
jason king in the canada bible when he

2115
01:14:50,479 --> 01:14:54,399
went to jamaica and had to pay them

2116
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:56,239
[ __ ] a shitload of money to take

2117
01:14:54,399 --> 01:14:58,479
pictures of their crops yeah i mean i'll

2118
01:14:56,238 --> 01:15:00,399
say the more fun you know the the the

2119
01:14:58,479 --> 01:15:03,599
expression on that one i could see that

2120
01:15:00,399 --> 01:15:06,399
thing taking 24 weeks yeah easily easily

2121
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:09,360
yeah that thing's a a

2122
01:15:06,399 --> 01:15:09,359
calixi mess

2123
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:14,400
okay um

2124
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:16,719
let's move on to malawi i know there are

2125
01:15:14,399 --> 01:15:19,279
certain clones in malawi past i've been

2126
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:20,960
oh [ __ ] my whole thing almost all over

2127
01:15:19,279 --> 01:15:23,519
certain clones of malawi passed around

2128
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:26,640
up in humboldt right or

2129
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:29,760
cal i should say um i had a malawi

2130
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:32,320
uh that its biggest issue was that it it

2131
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:34,480
never wanted to finish for me yeah uh

2132
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:35,920
which is not a convenient tree

2133
01:15:34,479 --> 01:15:39,519
um

2134
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:42,480
you know and uh um you know malawi is

2135
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:44,719
one of those things where there's a lot

2136
01:15:42,479 --> 01:15:47,119
africa is probably

2137
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:50,480
the continent with the most weed that we

2138
01:15:47,119 --> 01:15:53,679
have the least amount of its genetics

2139
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:55,198
that like fresh genetics over here yeah

2140
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:57,760
it seems like there was an initial

2141
01:15:55,198 --> 01:15:59,119
seeding during like the slave trade era

2142
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:00,800
when there was an enormous amount of

2143
01:15:59,119 --> 01:16:03,198
ships coming from africa to the

2144
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:06,079
caribbean and stuff like that yeah so a

2145
01:16:03,198 --> 01:16:07,119
lot of like maybe mexican and caribbean

2146
01:16:06,079 --> 01:16:09,840
weed

2147
01:16:07,119 --> 01:16:11,760
ancient origins tied to there

2148
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:13,520
um but you talk about the congo and the

2149
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:14,640
malawi and this and that and everything

2150
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:15,520
else and

2151
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:17,440
um

2152
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:20,239
you know maybe durbin is the most common

2153
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:22,559
thing that we have from africa swazi and

2154
01:16:20,238 --> 01:16:24,158
urban lots of southeastern stuff there's

2155
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:26,320
this there's stuff that roll that all

2156
01:16:24,158 --> 01:16:29,119
that a lot of that african weed rolls

2157
01:16:26,319 --> 01:16:30,719
right through the equatorial region

2158
01:16:29,119 --> 01:16:32,479
which means that it takes forever which

2159
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:35,359
means that it's a ginormous pain in the

2160
01:16:32,479 --> 01:16:36,959
ass for anyone in america unless it's

2161
01:16:35,359 --> 01:16:40,000
crossed to

2162
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:42,079
something afghan that makes it yeah

2163
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:45,439
yep and by manageable we usually mean

2164
01:16:42,079 --> 01:16:47,840
like 12 or 14 or 15 weeks or something

2165
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:50,000
there's a red congolese that's pretty

2166
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:50,960
tightly held by some people that they

2167
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,960
love

2168
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:55,760
yeah but that's that's kind of like that

2169
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:58,079
it was crossed to some very afghan thing

2170
01:16:55,760 --> 01:17:00,480
to get it i remember that red congo is

2171
01:16:58,079 --> 01:17:03,679
like a congo afghani oaxacan or

2172
01:17:00,479 --> 01:17:06,079
something like it's not yeah i mean

2173
01:17:03,679 --> 01:17:07,840
the malawi or the com like there's you

2174
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:10,000
got to do some [ __ ] to tame it

2175
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:11,279
yeah you live in america you don't live

2176
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,359
in the tropics

2177
01:17:11,279 --> 01:17:14,559
yeah super hard to get those to flower

2178
01:17:13,359 --> 01:17:16,799
under

2179
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:17,600
like reasonable times indoors too yeah

2180
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,960
you know

2181
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:21,039
you have like uh

2182
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:22,800
24 weeks something and it's like unless

2183
01:17:21,039 --> 01:17:24,640
you start light dipping it in june

2184
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:26,719
you're not making your season

2185
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:28,640
yeah you're screwed

2186
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:30,960
you know and then you grow it inside and

2187
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:32,960
it's like this jungle weed that's leafy

2188
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:35,279
and takes like six months like you know

2189
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:37,039
it's hard yeah

2190
01:17:35,279 --> 01:17:39,359

2191
01:17:37,039 --> 01:17:41,920

2228
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:07,198
just like dj

2229
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:09,119
um the original brothers grim crew

2230
01:19:07,198 --> 01:19:11,359
came out at a time when there wasn't

2231
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:13,198
very many non-dutch breeders doing

2232
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:15,920
things publicly

2233
01:19:13,198 --> 01:19:18,000
so a lot of their work got heavily

2234
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:20,480
spread amongst the community yeah

2235
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:22,479
especially the early forum community

2236
01:19:20,479 --> 01:19:25,119

2237
01:19:22,479 --> 01:19:28,559

[ __ ] cubing

2240
01:19:30,158 --> 01:19:35,920
and how he took the the original seed he

2241
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:38,079
got from the jack herrera and turned it

2242
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:41,520
into c99

2243
01:19:38,079 --> 01:19:43,920
um and you know the apollo 11 the apollo

2244

uh of bronze um a lot of the things that

2248
01:19:52,399 --> 01:19:56,639
were was the stuff that was the most

2249
01:19:54,319 --> 01:19:59,679
common to be crossed with

2250
01:19:56,640 --> 01:20:01,440

2251
01:19:59,679 --> 01:20:03,760

2261
01:20:20,479 --> 01:20:24,238
bullshit-ish

2287
01:21:11,439 --> 01:21:13,359
original

2288
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:16,560

01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:21,039
iteration

2292
01:21:19,039 --> 01:21:23,760
the second one where where the sly

2293
01:21:21,039 --> 01:21:24,639
wasn't involved and mr soul and

2294
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:26,639
and

2295
01:21:24,639 --> 01:21:28,319
you know duke had something going on

2296
01:21:26,639 --> 01:21:30,480
like that was i mean there was like a

2297
01:21:28,319 --> 01:21:33,439
15-year break or something where there

2298
01:21:30,479 --> 01:21:35,519
was no seat yeah

2299
01:21:33,439 --> 01:21:38,079
so we're talking about the early late

2300
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:40,000
early 2000s first when they first got

2301
01:21:38,079 --> 01:21:42,800
famous yeah not and they were

2302
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:44,399
reconstituted uh decades later not when

2303
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:45,920
the marketing guy tried to put it back

2304
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:48,079
together put the team back together

2305
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:49,920
without the team um

2306
01:21:48,079 --> 01:21:51,760
let's see let's skip through those we

2307
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:53,920
did shoreline

2308
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:55,600
here's one that i i have some

2309
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:59,199
interesting info on but i can't say who

2310
01:21:55,600 --> 01:22:02,159
or where rfk skunk

2311
01:21:59,198 --> 01:22:04,799
rfk skunk yeah

2312
01:22:02,158 --> 01:22:06,719
you know i don't know i mean rfk skunk

2313
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:09,199
was uh supposedly

2314
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:10,880
um you know skunk uh

2315
01:22:09,198 --> 01:22:14,799
it's got a lot of things right so it's

2316
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:16,719
uh rfk is is where the uh the washington

2317
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:19,279
uh redskins played

2318
01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:22,399
right uh the the grateful dead there was

2319
01:22:19,279 --> 01:22:24,719
a bunch of dead shows um they was on the

2320
01:22:22,399 --> 01:22:27,439
when they would do their summer tour

2321
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:29,198
rfk was was one of the big stadiums that

2322
01:22:27,439 --> 01:22:32,158
they would always play in

2323
01:22:29,198 --> 01:22:34,559
yeah um you know and and all that and

2324
01:22:32,158 --> 01:22:38,158
supposedly that rfk

2325
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:39,760
uh came out of bud from rfk

2326
01:22:38,158 --> 01:22:41,759
i am beating myself up right now because

2327
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:43,840
i just realized that

2328
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:45,520
rfk is probably going to pop up tomorrow

2329
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:47,279
in some lemurs list of stuff that

2330
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:48,960
they're claiming to have but

2331
01:22:47,279 --> 01:22:51,599
yeah nonetheless

2332
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:53,359
yeah it got mixed it's like so there's a

2333
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:55,440
there's a whole series of like

2334
01:22:53,359 --> 01:22:59,039
mysterious east coast skunks from the

2335
01:22:55,439 --> 01:23:01,519
same area some might be renamed

2336
01:22:59,039 --> 01:23:03,840
right yeah um it's been rumored to be in

2337
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:06,480
a bunch of different things

2338
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:07,520
um but proof is low

2339
01:23:06,479 --> 01:23:10,319
yeah

2340
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:12,000
perhaps yeah um

2341
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:14,000
yeah we'll see we'll see

2342
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,960
one might be out there of this and it'd

2343
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:18,560
be growing and gonna see about it so i'm

2344
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:20,560
pretty stoked because it's one that

2345
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:22,320
there's very little info about out there

2346
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:24,480
as far as what it was like and blah blah

2347
01:23:22,319 --> 01:23:26,158
blah like i mentioned with the headband

2348
01:23:24,479 --> 01:23:27,759
story before manny and those others

2349
01:23:26,158 --> 01:23:30,238
cleared it up where there's very little

2350
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:32,159
info but it's still fairly famous

2351
01:23:30,238 --> 01:23:33,039
it allows a lot of room for people to

2352
01:23:32,158 --> 01:23:35,198
say

2353
01:23:33,039 --> 01:23:37,920
whatever they like about it yeah because

2354
01:23:35,198 --> 01:23:40,238
there's very little verifiable info

2355
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:44,000
so maybe that is the verifiable info

2356
01:23:40,238 --> 01:23:44,000
yeah you don't know you know

2357
01:23:44,079 --> 01:23:47,760
um

2358
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:50,319
romulan

2359
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:51,440
romulan is another one that uh

2360
01:23:50,319 --> 01:23:53,759
is weird

2361
01:23:51,439 --> 01:23:55,439
in the sense that there's a lot of funky

2362
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:58,560
stories about it

2363
01:23:55,439 --> 01:24:01,839
um and and they keep getting earlier and

2364
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:04,639
earlier yeah um what we know for sure is

2365
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:06,800
that it's canadian

2366
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:08,159
um you know that's where it got famous

2367
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:10,560
and when

2368
01:24:08,158 --> 01:24:12,319
it be i believe it basically got first

2369
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:13,440
like nationally or internationally

2370
01:24:12,319 --> 01:24:16,399
famous

2371
01:24:13,439 --> 01:24:18,879
when the canadian seed companies um

2372
01:24:16,399 --> 01:24:20,799
started jumping into the seed game and

2373
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:22,639
there was a lot of hybrids across to

2374
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:24,719
romulan yeah

2375
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:27,760
um and there's some stories about that

2376
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:29,920
it came from mendo and like and

2377
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:32,960
mendo joe and it was brought to british

2378
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:36,639
columbia and it was this and this and it

2379
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:38,079
came back in these crazy early years

2380
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:40,079
i don't know what you think of that matt

2381
01:24:38,079 --> 01:24:41,119
but um

2382
01:24:40,079 --> 01:24:42,719
um i

2383
01:24:41,119 --> 01:24:45,760
from everything that i've researched on

2384
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:47,679
it talking to people in bc and

2385
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:49,520
other parts of canada who were around

2386
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:51,760
during that time and had interaction

2387
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:53,440
with those crews mendocino joe was a

2388
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:54,560
hundred thousand percent not rhyming and

2389
01:24:53,439 --> 01:24:56,719
joe

2390
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:58,639
rongolin was also not from the 40s it

2391
01:24:56,719 --> 01:24:59,600
sounds like it was from the [ __ ] 90s

2392
01:24:58,639 --> 01:25:01,520
and

2393
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:04,079
if i remember correctly and i'm only i'm

2394
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:07,280
only repeating because i i i'm not from

2395
01:25:04,079 --> 01:25:08,960
canada obviously um port alberni pine

2396
01:25:07,279 --> 01:25:11,198
bud was one of its first names and there

2397
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:13,760
was another name something blue indica

2398
01:25:11,198 --> 01:25:15,599
was and then later on um

2399
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:17,280
it was made popular in the 90s with a

2400
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:19,440
different name change but yeah it's not

2401
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:21,679
a there's no such thing as a 1940s

2402
01:25:19,439 --> 01:25:23,119
afghani hybrid so it's one of those

2403
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:24,719
things when i hear it it just makes my

2404
01:25:23,119 --> 01:25:27,039
eyes cross

2405
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:29,679
and it's also it's also kind of kind of

2406
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:32,158
a cool thing in the sense that a lot of

2407
01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:35,279
cannabis names were very much

2408
01:25:32,158 --> 01:25:37,439
tongue-in-cheek about like pop culture

2409
01:25:35,279 --> 01:25:39,679
yeah and so romulan is actually you know

2410
01:25:37,439 --> 01:25:40,960
obviously it's a race of aliens from

2411
01:25:39,679 --> 01:25:42,480
star trek

2412
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:45,920
yes

2413
01:25:42,479 --> 01:25:49,919
you know yeah yeah it's nice star trek

2414
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:51,679
uh so star trek yeah so uh the romulan

2415
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:54,960
did you ever have the grapefruit romulan

2416
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:56,399
or the grommulin no no yeah it was it

2417
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:58,719
was okay it was a weird one that went

2418
01:25:56,399 --> 01:26:00,238
around san diego a bunch and like no

2419
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:02,319
matter what clones you were trying to

2420
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:04,718
chase you'd always end up

2421
01:26:02,319 --> 01:26:07,198
right back at square one with grommulin

2422
01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:12,239
how about just grapefruit

2423
01:26:07,198 --> 01:26:14,479
grapefruit um there was a uh

2424
01:26:12,238 --> 01:26:17,359
you know there's a there's a pretty

2425
01:26:14,479 --> 01:26:19,519
famous pheno of uh

2426
01:26:17,359 --> 01:26:22,719
soma's diesel

2427
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:24,880
that had grapefruit flavor yeah and some

2428
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:26,480
people bred with it and

2429
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:28,239
loved it a ton

2430
01:26:26,479 --> 01:26:31,599
and it had really strong grapefruit

2431
01:26:28,238 --> 01:26:34,158
terps yeah which is about as far from uh

2432
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:36,960
sour turps as you can imagine but yes

2433
01:26:34,158 --> 01:26:39,198
yes nonetheless they really loved it

2434
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:41,439
um and that's the only like and that's

2435
01:26:39,198 --> 01:26:43,359
the only real grapefruit i have ever

2436
01:26:41,439 --> 01:26:46,158
i've ever experienced there's a real

2437
01:26:43,359 --> 01:26:48,559
popular uh well most phenos of c99 that

2438
01:26:46,158 --> 01:26:50,879
are popped from seed come out very grape

2439
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:52,960
fruity um to me it smells what's weird

2440
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:54,480
when people explain grapefruit and give

2441
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:56,560
me grapefruit but i thought super

2442
01:26:54,479 --> 01:26:58,399
grapefruity i always smell [ __ ]

2443
01:26:56,560 --> 01:27:00,320
perfume it's weird it's one of those

2444
01:26:58,399 --> 01:27:02,238
things where i just smell it so much

2445
01:27:00,319 --> 01:27:03,759
different yeah

2446
01:27:02,238 --> 01:27:06,000
people are talking about all kinds of

2447
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:07,920
skunks and stuff like that and

2448
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:09,840
i'll say something real quick i do think

2449
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:12,399
in the 90s skunk was a much more

2450
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:15,600
prevalent odor i do think it popped up

2451
01:27:12,399 --> 01:27:17,039
in hybrids a lot more frequently um

2452
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:19,920
but you know uh

2453
01:27:17,039 --> 01:27:23,279
skunk bud tended to not be quite as

2454
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:25,679
potent as some other weed uh and it had

2455
01:27:23,279 --> 01:27:28,238
really uh noticeable terps that got you

2456
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:30,960
in trouble um and so i think it just got

2457
01:27:28,238 --> 01:27:33,919
selected away from too much

2458
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:36,399
uh and by various people and then as as

2459
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:38,079
clones changed and names changed people

2460
01:27:36,399 --> 01:27:40,238
went to different stuff and everyone

2461
01:27:38,079 --> 01:27:42,960
assumed that people would be holding it

2462
01:27:40,238 --> 01:27:44,079
and now it seems like a lost terp

2463
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:45,840
yeah

2464
01:27:44,079 --> 01:27:48,319
you know and it's also possible it could

2465
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:51,119
be a little bit of a recessive terp now

2466
01:27:48,319 --> 01:27:54,238
where it needs other genes from another

2467
01:27:51,119 --> 01:27:56,960
partner to like make it pop yeah and

2468
01:27:54,238 --> 01:27:58,879
they're buried double up double up

2469
01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:02,000
where in the 90s maybe it was an easy

2470
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:05,840
double up and now 30 years later it's

2471
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:06,960
like a rarer double up yeah

2472
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:08,719
because you've talked you've talked

2473
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:10,639
about i can't remember who made it but

2474
01:28:08,719 --> 01:28:13,679
you were telling me what was the sour

2475
01:28:10,639 --> 01:28:16,880
dub fino yeah it was a diesel uh

2476
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:19,119
sourdough cross to reverse chisel

2477
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:20,719
sour dub by diesel so you know you

2478
01:28:19,119 --> 01:28:23,439
matt's cross diesel to all kinds of

2479
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:25,439
things and one time this one hybrid

2480
01:28:23,439 --> 01:28:27,198
all of a sudden throws

2481
01:28:25,439 --> 01:28:28,799
you know a much more

2482
01:28:27,198 --> 01:28:31,198
skunky [ __ ]

2483
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:32,880
yeah yeah so i think that's probably

2484
01:28:31,198 --> 01:28:35,759
where it'll pop back up again is it will

2485
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:38,000
be it'll be a lucky recessive combo yeah

2486
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:39,280
i know crybaby did a gmo diesel that i

2487
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:41,840
thought would probably hold it pretty

2488
01:28:39,279 --> 01:28:44,238
well or even a d diesel or any of those

2489
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:46,560
things any any combination of the the

2490
01:28:44,238 --> 01:28:48,158
the like sour version of super skunk and

2491
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:50,719
the short squat version of super skunk

2492
01:28:48,158 --> 01:28:51,920
to me seems to just kind of bring it up

2493
01:28:50,719 --> 01:28:54,000
uh

2494
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:56,000
quite well quite well yeah i mean i

2495
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,279
think if you start crossing i mean we've

2496
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,960
talked about that a bunch we start

2497
01:28:57,279 --> 01:29:00,880
crossing different skunky things and

2498
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:02,319
large enough numbers yeah and you'll

2499
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:04,719
find some stuff

2500
01:29:02,319 --> 01:29:07,039
yeah you know um it's just not going to

2501
01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:10,000
be across the skunk one will take you

2502
01:29:07,039 --> 01:29:11,840
farther away from your goal than closer

2503
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,920
yeah there's see a lot of people that

2504
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:16,000
have had sour dub some people look at me

2505
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:18,239
like silly when i say sour dub you can

2506
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:20,479
grow up very [ __ ] skunky if you know

2507
01:29:18,238 --> 01:29:21,599
how to how to bring out skunkiness out

2508
01:29:20,479 --> 01:29:23,359
of strains

2509
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:24,800
but some people are just like oh i never

2510
01:29:23,359 --> 01:29:26,479
never see it i don't know some people

2511
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:28,079
have had really loud sourdough and some

2512
01:29:26,479 --> 01:29:29,279
people have it i'm never sure if it's

2513
01:29:28,079 --> 01:29:30,960
the same clone or just way different

2514
01:29:29,279 --> 01:29:32,559
growth styles

2515
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:34,239
i mean there's definitely i you know my

2516
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:36,400
friend that i visited he grows a lot of

2517
01:29:34,238 --> 01:29:39,839
living soil yeah and i definitely

2518
01:29:36,399 --> 01:29:42,238
noticed like a pretty extreme sweetness

2519
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:43,840
to a lot of things you know so i

2520
01:29:42,238 --> 01:29:46,479
definitely think you know room

2521
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:48,159
temperature and feeding and you know

2522
01:29:46,479 --> 01:29:50,000
type of feeding and stuff like that can

2523
01:29:48,158 --> 01:29:52,319
certainly different plants can

2524
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:54,000
definitely bring out different aspects

2525
01:29:52,319 --> 01:29:54,799
yeah

2526
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,800
so

2527
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:59,440
so one that was big around the forums

2528
01:29:56,800 --> 01:30:02,880
during um overgrow era i believe was

2529
01:29:59,439 --> 01:30:05,839
jackie o did you ever see jackie oh

2530
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:07,760
it was a i believe jack flash fino

2531
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:09,840
crosstalk calio

2532
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:11,280
indeed that was a naboo one if i

2533
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:13,520
remember correctly it was pretty good it

2534
01:30:11,279 --> 01:30:15,599
was it was a good calio hybrid

2535
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:17,600
did it taste like citrus or did it go

2536
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:21,600
beyond that oh it was super citrus and

2537
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:24,320
super pineally uh oh yeah yeah yeah two

2538
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:27,840
extreme flavors combined in one

2539
01:30:24,319 --> 01:30:29,439
yes super citrus and super terpene

2540
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:31,760
so then we all since we're bringing up

2541
01:30:29,439 --> 01:30:33,519
callio bring up calio in the melton did

2542
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:35,119
you have any callio

2543
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:36,239
i had calio

2544
01:30:35,119 --> 01:30:37,920
um

2545
01:30:36,238 --> 01:30:39,599
you know it was one of those things

2546
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:41,440
where

2547
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:44,079
maybe the funniest thing i could tell

2548
01:30:41,439 --> 01:30:46,879
about calio is when tangi came out and

2549
01:30:44,079 --> 01:30:50,238
got popular and people were lining up to

2550
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:51,600
buy tons of seeds from dna and tangy

2551
01:30:50,238 --> 01:30:53,198
hybrids

2552
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:55,199
a lot of us up here in mendo were

2553
01:30:53,198 --> 01:30:56,638
shocked because you know five or ten

2554
01:30:55,198 --> 01:30:58,559
years before

2555
01:30:56,639 --> 01:31:01,440
trying to give away

2556
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:04,239
pure citrus smelling pounds was a tough

2557
01:31:01,439 --> 01:31:06,960
sell yeah it was that was there was a

2558
01:31:04,238 --> 01:31:09,599
there was a limited limited market and

2559
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:11,119
you would get told no a lot

2560
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:13,120
headache weed

2561
01:31:11,119 --> 01:31:15,599
a lot of the pure citrus stuff whether

2562
01:31:13,119 --> 01:31:16,399
it was the lemon g or the cali o or this

2563
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:18,800
or that

2564
01:31:16,399 --> 01:31:21,039
if it's just one note

2565
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:24,480
um citrus terp

2566
01:31:21,039 --> 01:31:27,279
a lot of people will get old on it fast

2567
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:28,399
so we were amazed when tangi came out to

2568
01:31:27,279 --> 01:31:30,079
such

2569
01:31:28,399 --> 01:31:32,158
it was like citrus had gotten so

2570
01:31:30,079 --> 01:31:34,319
unpopular that it got it had a

2571
01:31:32,158 --> 01:31:36,559
resurgence because no one had smoked it

2572
01:31:34,319 --> 01:31:37,840
yeah because no one none of the brokers

2573
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:39,039
would buy it

2574
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:40,400
yeah that and that's kind of how i

2575
01:31:39,039 --> 01:31:42,238
looked at cheese too like when it

2576
01:31:40,399 --> 01:31:44,479
started getting a big resurgence i was

2577
01:31:42,238 --> 01:31:46,559
like gee really you [ __ ] have cheese

2578
01:31:44,479 --> 01:31:48,718
but i did it when i was down south i did

2579
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:51,600
get to grow out a lot of caleb's calio

2580
01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:54,079
hybrids yeah and you can really see its

2581
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:56,079
sativa origins

2582
01:31:54,079 --> 01:31:58,158
pop through in various and various

2583
01:31:56,079 --> 01:32:00,559
things especially if you cross it to

2584
01:31:58,158 --> 01:32:02,559
other things that like to stretch

2585
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:04,960
um and uh

2586
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:07,840
you know i'm not exactly sure what it is

2587
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:11,119
but it's one of those original clones

2588
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:14,560
that um you know went over to uh

2589
01:32:11,119 --> 01:32:17,039
amsterdam uh and it sounds like it came

2590
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:18,480
through uh rob clark

2591
01:32:17,039 --> 01:32:20,639
oh interesting

2592
01:32:18,479 --> 01:32:22,879
you know uh he wrote about it he wrote

2593
01:32:20,639 --> 01:32:24,239
about it uh in the first can of bible

2594
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:27,279
and that big

2595
01:32:24,238 --> 01:32:29,439
you know um but it people get over

2596
01:32:27,279 --> 01:32:30,960
people get over it because it's just

2597
01:32:29,439 --> 01:32:34,879
it's oranges

2598
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:36,639
yep yeah i'm not a fan um spirit of 76

2599
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:39,440
did you ever see that up there just in

2600
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:41,920
the can of bible no yeah yeah i i see

2601
01:32:39,439 --> 01:32:45,039
pinkleberry that looks pretty identical

2602
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:46,480
to it and that that super specific pink

2603
01:32:45,039 --> 01:32:48,079
pistol trait but that doesn't mean

2604
01:32:46,479 --> 01:32:49,279
they're necessarily related but that was

2605
01:32:48,079 --> 01:32:51,920
what i always wanted to see and i was

2606
01:32:49,279 --> 01:32:53,519
wondering if it passed around uh norcal

2607
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:55,600
back then so the thing that i'll say

2608
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:58,719
about that and it has nothing to do with

2609
01:32:55,600 --> 01:33:00,560
the spirit of 76 but it's that

2610
01:32:58,719 --> 01:33:03,119
growing a lot of the same strains over

2611
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:05,679
the years indoor versus outdoor

2612
01:33:03,119 --> 01:33:08,960
yeah uh there are strains that will give

2613
01:33:05,679 --> 01:33:10,880
me magenta or hot pink or

2614
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:14,719
crazy colored

2615
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:17,279
you know those hues pistols outdoor

2616
01:33:14,719 --> 01:33:18,399
yeah but we'll never ever do it

2617
01:33:17,279 --> 01:33:21,119
inside

2618
01:33:18,399 --> 01:33:23,599
yeah and they don't dry to that color

2619
01:33:21,119 --> 01:33:25,760
yeah but there's a period of time during

2620
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:28,000
their flowering cycle where you can get

2621
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:28,880
i have i mean i have a bunch on my phone

2622
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,639
um

2623
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:31,920
you can get some really amazing

2624
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:34,719
different stuff

2625
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:37,119
yeah but only in the sun

2626
01:33:34,719 --> 01:33:39,439
yeah it's weird yeah it is weird and

2627
01:33:37,119 --> 01:33:41,039
maybe it's i wonder i wonder if one day

2628
01:33:39,439 --> 01:33:42,879
that leds will somehow be able to

2629
01:33:41,039 --> 01:33:45,359
capture that range that pushes it out

2630
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:45,359
indoors

2631
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:48,239
so someone just asked a pretty good

2632
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:50,320
question when we said what does double

2633
01:33:48,238 --> 01:33:52,158
up mean and what i what i mean by that

2634
01:33:50,319 --> 01:33:54,880
and just like a super quick genetics

2635
01:33:52,158 --> 01:33:56,479
lesson and i'll use humans as the

2636
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:57,520
because that's easier than plants is

2637
01:33:56,479 --> 01:33:59,198
like

2638
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:01,760
having blue eyes

2639
01:33:59,198 --> 01:34:04,158
green eyes hazel eyes gray eyes that's

2640
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:06,400
recessive right yeah so the only way

2641
01:34:04,158 --> 01:34:07,679
your kids can get it is if both parents

2642
01:34:06,399 --> 01:34:09,198
have the gene

2643
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:11,520
yes right

2644
01:34:09,198 --> 01:34:13,599
if they don't um like for instance you

2645
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:15,679
know i have i have i have multiple kids

2646
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:17,760
i have hazel eyes my wife has green eyes

2647
01:34:15,679 --> 01:34:20,719
so we both have the gene

2648
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:21,600
we got two brown eyes and one blue-eyed

2649
01:34:20,719 --> 01:34:22,639
kid

2650
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:24,639
yeah

2651
01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:26,960
right and three tries so

2652
01:34:24,639 --> 01:34:29,679
you know um what i mean by double what

2653
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:32,319
we mean by doubling up is

2654
01:34:29,679 --> 01:34:34,719
i think that that particular skunk aroma

2655
01:34:32,319 --> 01:34:36,479
is probably recessive now

2656
01:34:34,719 --> 01:34:38,800
and you'd have to find a different

2657
01:34:36,479 --> 01:34:40,238
parent that had that recessive trait and

2658
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:43,440
grow enough of them that those two

2659
01:34:40,238 --> 01:34:45,839
recessives met in one plant yeah lined

2660
01:34:43,439 --> 01:34:47,678
up that's what we mean by doubling up

2661
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:49,440
because if you don't have two parents

2662
01:34:47,679 --> 01:34:50,800
with the blue eye gene you can't have a

2663
01:34:49,439 --> 01:34:51,759
blue-eyed kid

2664
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:54,480
yeah

2665
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:56,239
same thing with blonde hair actually

2666
01:34:54,479 --> 01:34:57,839
um same thing with any number of traits

2667
01:34:56,238 --> 01:35:00,399
they think that humans eventually will

2668
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:02,159
all be some kind of brown eyed just

2669
01:35:00,399 --> 01:35:04,238
because it's so dominant in so many

2670
01:35:02,158 --> 01:35:05,439
cultures that you know

2671
01:35:04,238 --> 01:35:07,599
and i think that's kind of what what

2672
01:35:05,439 --> 01:35:10,479
happened to skunk it just got lost

2673
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:12,159
and now it'll pop out on rare cases

2674
01:35:10,479 --> 01:35:13,759
mr toad does not have a strain that

2675
01:35:12,158 --> 01:35:16,399
produces pink pistol inside mr toad is

2676
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:19,360
full of [ __ ] and let's see we got the

2677
01:35:16,399 --> 01:35:21,920
white from chrome

2678
01:35:19,359 --> 01:35:24,238
uh you know you might remember more of

2679
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:27,679
the history about it than i do

2680
01:35:24,238 --> 01:35:29,759
um i classify it in in the same way as

2681
01:35:27,679 --> 01:35:31,199
the snow and maybe some other things one

2682
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:33,520
of those low

2683
01:35:31,198 --> 01:35:34,799
terpene low flavor

2684
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:36,320
chunky

2685
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:38,480
frosty

2686
01:35:36,319 --> 01:35:41,118
plants that tend to transfer that when

2687
01:35:38,479 --> 01:35:43,519
you breed yeah so it got mixed into a

2688
01:35:41,118 --> 01:35:45,920
bunch of stuff yeah it was the white

2689
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:48,480
because of how frosty it was yeah it was

2690
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:50,639
from from chrome from swamp boys was the

2691
01:35:48,479 --> 01:35:52,000
one that brought it online i i don't

2692
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:54,400
remember where he said he sourced it

2693
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:55,760
from somewhere in florida um

2694
01:35:54,399 --> 01:35:57,599
i remember there was some talk around

2695
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:59,600
the time too that it was called

2696
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:01,440
a white triangle or just triangle but

2697
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:02,960
not triangle kush remember there was

2698
01:36:01,439 --> 01:36:04,879
some speculation on that i don't know

2699
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:06,319
how accurate that is uh i wish we could

2700
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:09,039
have chrome on to talk about a little

2701
01:36:06,319 --> 01:36:10,880
bit um i was associated with like

2702
01:36:09,039 --> 01:36:12,399
in my head with the hash plant meaning

2703
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:14,960
that it's a plant that is solely for

2704
01:36:12,399 --> 01:36:18,000
producing hash or adding tons of resin

2705
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:20,319
but it also adds earth and dirt

2706
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:21,118
and mushrooms terps

2707
01:36:20,319 --> 01:36:23,039
so

2708
01:36:21,118 --> 01:36:25,599
it might be one of those things like i

2709
01:36:23,039 --> 01:36:28,319
neville used to talk about the nl5 yeah

2710
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:30,480
how it added frost and structure and

2711
01:36:28,319 --> 01:36:32,719
improved lee you know caleb's the leaf

2712
01:36:30,479 --> 01:36:34,479
ratio yeah but it didn't taste like much

2713
01:36:32,719 --> 01:36:36,480
or smell like much which he liked

2714
01:36:34,479 --> 01:36:39,359
because it let the other side of the

2715
01:36:36,479 --> 01:36:40,638
breeding shine through yes so it added

2716
01:36:39,359 --> 01:36:41,439
and that's kind of how i think of the

2717
01:36:40,639 --> 01:36:43,520
white

2718
01:36:41,439 --> 01:36:45,359
yeah it did it did amazing with the blue

2719
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:47,199
bonnet and let the blue bonnet dominate

2720
01:36:45,359 --> 01:36:48,559
it which is really weird for like that

2721
01:36:47,198 --> 01:36:51,118
recessive blue

2722
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:53,600
terp in the first place that blue smell

2723
01:36:51,118 --> 01:36:54,880
and um that's the one thing that i found

2724
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:57,280
that really married with the white well

2725
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:58,880
in a single f1 hybrid usually it takes

2726
01:36:57,279 --> 01:37:00,880
some back crossing to

2727
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:02,800
to get rid of those chirps to the white

2728
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:04,480
and that's kind of a common old school

2729
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:05,440
way of breeding where you take something

2730
01:37:04,479 --> 01:37:08,799
that's

2731
01:37:05,439 --> 01:37:10,638
frosty and dense with nice structure and

2732
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:13,039
potent but maybe doesn't have a lot of

2733
01:37:10,639 --> 01:37:14,960
smell or flavor and you throw that on

2734
01:37:13,039 --> 01:37:16,719
something wilder growing with better

2735
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:18,880
terps and better this and better that

2736
01:37:16,719 --> 01:37:22,399
you see if you can get

2737
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:24,400
both qualities in one plant yeah

2738
01:37:22,399 --> 01:37:27,920
you know so

2739
01:37:24,399 --> 01:37:28,960
let's see it's [ __ ] incredible

2740
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:31,600
not me

2741
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:33,600
yeah no i i i threw it once and called

2742
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:35,360
it [ __ ] awful but it was a

2743
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:37,440
uh i actually have to say let me let me

2744
01:37:35,359 --> 01:37:38,880
add this in too is that someone just

2745
01:37:37,439 --> 01:37:41,839
someone mentioned that they think that

2746
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:43,840
the citrus terps took off with dabs

2747
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:45,920
and i do think that tangy came out at

2748
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:48,800
the perfect time because a lot of that

2749
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:50,399
citrus weed is pretty low potency to

2750
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:52,400
moderate at best

2751
01:37:50,399 --> 01:37:55,599
yeah but if you make bho of it and you

2752
01:37:52,399 --> 01:37:59,039
make it 78 thc you're gonna get high if

2753
01:37:55,600 --> 01:38:01,600
you take a dab yep so in the flour form

2754
01:37:59,039 --> 01:38:03,600
years before it would just get it would

2755
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:04,400
just be weaker and wouldn't stay around

2756
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:07,199
long

2757
01:38:04,399 --> 01:38:09,118
yeah but you could put it through bho

2758
01:38:07,198 --> 01:38:10,960
and that citrus terp would come through

2759
01:38:09,118 --> 01:38:13,679
whether it was lemon or orange or

2760
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:14,560
tangerine or whatever your brain picked

2761
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:17,679
up on

2762
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:20,480
and it would work yeah so for it for it

2763
01:38:17,679 --> 01:38:22,239
was perfect timing for extract

2764
01:38:20,479 --> 01:38:23,198
yeah

2765
01:38:22,238 --> 01:38:25,759
anyway

2766
01:38:23,198 --> 01:38:27,439
uh black russian

2767
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:28,639
i don't really have any experience black

2768
01:38:27,439 --> 01:38:30,638
russian

2769
01:38:28,639 --> 01:38:33,920
cherry aka blackberry

2770
01:38:30,639 --> 01:38:38,000
uh beautiful beautiful magenta colors it

2771
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:39,039
was before chitrali was super popular so

2772
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,479
people weren't used to seeing those

2773
01:38:39,039 --> 01:38:42,319
beautiful magenta colors it's

2774
01:38:40,479 --> 01:38:45,118
responsible for like double purple doja

2775
01:38:42,319 --> 01:38:47,198
and sputnik and a few other things

2776
01:38:45,118 --> 01:38:49,039
mostly just like the blackberry but with

2777
01:38:47,198 --> 01:38:50,319
better cherry

2778
01:38:49,039 --> 01:38:52,479
nicer

2779
01:38:50,319 --> 01:38:54,719
uh terps and a little bit more resonance

2780
01:38:52,479 --> 01:38:56,238
than blackberry but still overall pretty

2781
01:38:54,719 --> 01:39:00,560
low potency and

2782
01:38:56,238 --> 01:39:02,559
mids um pretty low potency in mids

2783
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:05,440
yeah unfortunately i i spent a lot of

2784
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:06,719
time on on black brush a lot because i

2785
01:39:05,439 --> 01:39:08,479
was convinced i could pull something

2786
01:39:06,719 --> 01:39:09,840
good out of it and i never was able to

2787
01:39:08,479 --> 01:39:12,479
doesn't mean it can't be done i was just

2788
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:13,920
not able to and i tried a lot

2789
01:39:12,479 --> 01:39:16,000
i mean we were yeah i mean it was kind

2790
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:17,679
of this like that the blackberry kush

2791
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,479
that we had in mendo was kind of the

2792
01:39:17,679 --> 01:39:20,319
same

2793
01:39:18,479 --> 01:39:22,000
yeah it was incredible looking and

2794
01:39:20,319 --> 01:39:23,519
people loved to grow it and it would be

2795
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:25,359
absolutely gorgeous

2796
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:28,080
and then sometime you just realized that

2797
01:39:25,359 --> 01:39:29,759
you didn't really get very high from

2798
01:39:28,079 --> 01:39:30,880
from smoking it

2799
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:32,639
um some

2800
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:34,800
i just seen the same thing up over and

2801
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:36,319
over about 20 times asian fantasy we're

2802
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:37,520
not talking about asian fantasy only

2803
01:39:36,319 --> 01:39:40,319
because that was a clone that was

2804
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:42,080
supposedly never passed ever yeah and

2805
01:39:40,319 --> 01:39:44,559
that's it so there's no nobody has any

2806
01:39:42,079 --> 01:39:46,559
experience with it except for jason king

2807
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:48,480
and the guy that wouldn't give it out

2808
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:50,480
there was scammers that claimed to have

2809
01:39:48,479 --> 01:39:52,399
it and traded it out for a long time and

2810
01:39:50,479 --> 01:39:54,879
they still claim to have it and it's

2811
01:39:52,399 --> 01:39:56,479
stupid yeah it's ridiculous it's one of

2812
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:59,118
those strains like

2813
01:39:56,479 --> 01:40:02,399
um i i don't know like creepy people

2814
01:39:59,118 --> 01:40:03,920
just make [ __ ] up just is what it is um

2815
01:40:02,399 --> 01:40:05,198
west coast dog do you have experience

2816
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:07,440
with it

2817
01:40:05,198 --> 01:40:09,359
um i you know

2818
01:40:07,439 --> 01:40:10,960
i wish we have we have some friends that

2819
01:40:09,359 --> 01:40:12,960
have more experience with it that are

2820
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:15,039
chatting on here than i do

2821
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:17,679
i never really grew it it did seem like

2822
01:40:15,039 --> 01:40:20,238
it was one of those big yielding

2823
01:40:17,679 --> 01:40:21,840
you know that they could pass as chem

2824
01:40:20,238 --> 01:40:24,799
um so it got grown in a lot of

2825
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:26,560
greenhouses and a lot of outdoor yeah um

2826
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:28,880
but i don't remember its origin story

2827
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:30,719
off the top of my head and i that didn't

2828
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:32,159
think can and if you've never smoked him

2829
01:40:30,719 --> 01:40:34,480
or smoked

2830
01:40:32,158 --> 01:40:36,238
smelled kim you'd be like what it's a

2831
01:40:34,479 --> 01:40:38,399
it's it's above a hybrid probably of

2832
01:40:36,238 --> 01:40:39,759
some sort um it does real well outdoors

2833
01:40:38,399 --> 01:40:41,679
because people could move it out as

2834
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:42,800
indoors it just was one of those plants

2835
01:40:41,679 --> 01:40:44,880
that could

2836
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:46,159
one of those transitory plants that you

2837
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:48,159
could pass off is indoor and that's

2838
01:40:46,158 --> 01:40:50,158
about it that's like i mean brokers

2839
01:40:48,158 --> 01:40:51,839
there's always been a history of brokers

2840
01:40:50,158 --> 01:40:53,198
where if they could make depths look

2841
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:54,960
like ins

2842
01:40:53,198 --> 01:40:57,039
or they could they thought that outs

2843
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:58,480
looked like depths then they could get a

2844
01:40:57,039 --> 01:41:01,039
higher price

2845
01:40:58,479 --> 01:41:03,039
for from their customers and then their

2846
01:41:01,039 --> 01:41:04,639
margin would be bigger which is the

2847
01:41:03,039 --> 01:41:06,880
point of their existence

2848
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:09,118
yes exactly you know so it was like a

2849
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:10,480
big i don't know i think it was one of

2850
01:41:09,118 --> 01:41:12,479
those ones that it was like a big

2851
01:41:10,479 --> 01:41:16,000
growing afghan that was kind of boring

2852
01:41:12,479 --> 01:41:18,479
but yeah it got cam attached to it

2853
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:20,319
um let's see what else we got here

2854
01:41:18,479 --> 01:41:22,479
purple mr nice i know that went up in

2855
01:41:20,319 --> 01:41:25,279
your area did you did you grow any of

2856
01:41:22,479 --> 01:41:29,519
that yeah purple mr nice is a little

2857
01:41:25,279 --> 01:41:30,719
weird um in the sense that uh

2858
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:33,119
it

2859
01:41:30,719 --> 01:41:35,118
it's got g3 it's supposedly got g13 in

2860
01:41:33,118 --> 01:41:36,719
it yeah you know and it's one of those

2861
01:41:35,118 --> 01:41:38,639
things that when

2862
01:41:36,719 --> 01:41:41,600
when neville lost women never went to

2863
01:41:38,639 --> 01:41:43,440
jail for 11 months and then scentsy got

2864
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:45,199
him out of since he gave him a bunch of

2865
01:41:43,439 --> 01:41:46,638
money and got him out of jail and bought

2866
01:41:45,198 --> 01:41:47,839
his seed company

2867
01:41:46,639 --> 01:41:50,319
um

2868
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:53,360
some of the things that were common in

2869
01:41:50,319 --> 01:41:56,880
neville seed catalog didn't port over

2870
01:41:53,359 --> 01:42:00,238
yeah to scentsy like any of the g13

2871
01:41:56,880 --> 01:42:03,039
hybrids any of the hash plant hybrids um

2872
01:42:00,238 --> 01:42:05,759
the maple leaf all disappeared yeah and

2873
01:42:03,039 --> 01:42:09,760
then in the late 90s after neville left

2874
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:12,159
the maple leaf the g13 the afghani one

2875
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:14,000
all those things started popping back up

2876
01:42:12,158 --> 01:42:15,839
yeah and i don't know if they pulled

2877
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:17,118
them from seed but i think that's where

2878
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:20,639
it came from

2879
01:42:17,118 --> 01:42:23,279
yeah is mr it's scentsy offering first

2880
01:42:20,639 --> 01:42:25,760
yeah right and it was it g13 by hash

2881
01:42:23,279 --> 01:42:29,039
plant yeah

2882
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:30,960
you know hash planet one yeah it's uh

2883
01:42:29,039 --> 01:42:32,800
yeah it just it was like every single

2884
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:35,439
g13 hash plant that was purple to me it

2885
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:37,440
was it was it was narcotic enough it was

2886
01:42:35,439 --> 01:42:39,919
okay you know it yielded really well and

2887
01:42:37,439 --> 01:42:42,000
the better it yielded the worse it was

2888
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:43,199
yeah that's about it yeah i mean so it's

2889
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:45,679
one of those things where i always

2890
01:42:43,198 --> 01:42:47,759
question is like why did it disappear

2891
01:42:45,679 --> 01:42:49,840
the whole time neville was there

2892
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:52,320
yeah and then after he left got brought

2893
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:53,920
back like why didn't it stay i've never

2894
01:42:52,319 --> 01:42:57,118
gotten answers to that why didn't the

2895
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:58,800
hash plans and the g13s and the maples

2896
01:42:57,118 --> 01:43:01,439
and some of those other things why did

2897
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:04,719
they go off the menu yeah and then ten

2898
01:43:01,439 --> 01:43:07,118
years later pop off back on the menu

2899
01:43:04,719 --> 01:43:09,439
yeah it's a weird one um

2900
01:43:07,118 --> 01:43:13,519
any mangoes that you can remember

2901
01:43:09,439 --> 01:43:15,678
there's a ginormous mango uh

2902
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:16,800
old school seed line that floats around

2903
01:43:15,679 --> 01:43:18,560
mendo

2904
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:20,880
um because people used to be able to get

2905
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:22,639
eight or ten pounds of plant off it yeah

2906
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:23,760
um and they called it the mango around

2907
01:43:22,639 --> 01:43:25,520
here and then obviously there's the

2908
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:27,280
mango haze

2909
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:28,639
um but i don't know which one he's

2910
01:43:27,279 --> 01:43:30,000
referring to

2911
01:43:28,639 --> 01:43:33,840
yeah i'm not sure

2912
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:36,399
um i'm just just mango in general mango

2913
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:39,440

um you know i don't really i i've heard

2915
01:43:39,439 --> 01:43:44,319
various tales

uh about that type of stuff uh you know

2917

i had a friend that used to move a lot

2922
01:43:54,399 --> 01:43:59,118
of it but i never had i never grew it

2923
01:43:57,840 --> 01:44:00,880

01:44:13,118 --> 01:44:17,279
very low potency

2931

a

2940
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:37,520
a hash plant you know

2941
01:44:35,118 --> 01:44:39,359
from neville from the neville seed bank

2942
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:42,320
era in the late 80s

2943
01:44:39,359 --> 01:44:44,479
yeah it came out of uh you know it got

2944
01:44:42,319 --> 01:44:47,039
famous in colorado and leadville and

2945
01:44:44,479 --> 01:44:48,879
various places like that

2946
01:44:47,039 --> 01:44:51,359
some old schoolers used to carry it

2947
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:52,960
around in a hockey puck

2948
01:44:51,359 --> 01:44:54,559
hard case

2949
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:56,319
um and that's kind of how it got the

2950
01:44:54,560 --> 01:44:58,639
name the puck

2951
01:44:56,319 --> 01:45:00,880
and it's around and people breed with it

2952
01:44:58,639 --> 01:45:02,960
um i never had very much luck with it

2953
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:04,480
because when i had it i was primarily

2954
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:07,198
using the sun

2955
01:45:04,479 --> 01:45:09,519
yeah and it grew worthless weed in the

2956
01:45:07,198 --> 01:45:12,719
sun that was some worthless looking weed

2957
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:14,800
about either outdoor or greenhouse

2958
01:45:12,719 --> 01:45:16,560
i'd written like my head stash beds

2959
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:17,600
which produced a whole bunch of gorgeous

2960
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:20,159
weed

2961
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:22,320
uh and that stuff was leafy took forever

2962
01:45:20,158 --> 01:45:24,559
almost restless

2963
01:45:22,319 --> 01:45:26,238
but you know inside people get better

2964
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:27,280
better results off it

2965
01:45:26,238 --> 01:45:28,799
um

2966
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:31,359
you know it's kind of another one of

2967
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:33,600
those like old afghans that's really

2968
01:45:31,359 --> 01:45:34,559
ugly by today's standards

2969
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:37,280
yeah

2970
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:38,639
um and probably is best in a breeding

2971
01:45:37,279 --> 01:45:40,719
project

2972
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:43,039
probably its best trait is that it's got

2973
01:45:40,719 --> 01:45:45,359
very old genetics in it

2974
01:45:43,039 --> 01:45:46,639
yeah but it's not like a one hybrid and

2975
01:45:45,359 --> 01:45:48,799
you're done

2976
01:45:46,639 --> 01:45:50,560
no i you know i

2977
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:52,320
anybody working with it more power to

2978
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:53,280
them for trying that's all i'll say on

2979
01:45:52,319 --> 01:45:55,359
that

2980
01:45:53,279 --> 01:45:57,759
it's probably a multi-stage process to

2981
01:45:55,359 --> 01:46:00,719
get what you want

2982
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:04,000
and this is it for the list right now

2983
01:46:00,719 --> 01:46:05,760
you got me on yours you got anybody uh

2984
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:08,560
no i didn't write me down

2985
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:09,600
i just saw you had such a huge list yeah

2986
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:13,760
um

2987
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:16,239
you know there's uh yum bolt

2988
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:17,920
i never grew the yum bolt but i actually

2989
01:46:16,238 --> 01:46:20,079
used it strangely enough i used to get

2990
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:22,560
yum bolt from humboldt

2991
01:46:20,079 --> 01:46:24,880
and whoever had the yum bolt in humboldt

2992
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:27,360
was doing a good job and it was frosty

2993
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:28,960
and burned good and i enjoyed smoking it

2994
01:46:27,359 --> 01:46:29,839
yeah

2995
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:31,439
you know

2996
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:32,800
uh people are talking about you know

2997
01:46:31,439 --> 01:46:35,198
yeah there's people out there that are

2998
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:37,199
doing some extensive puck work and i

2999
01:46:35,198 --> 01:46:39,039
think that's probably what it would take

3000
01:46:37,198 --> 01:46:40,638
yeah yeah it would it would take i'm not

3001
01:46:39,039 --> 01:46:42,079
saying it's bad or i'm not dissing it

3002
01:46:40,639 --> 01:46:44,000
i'm just saying that like to get the

3003
01:46:42,079 --> 01:46:45,359
qualities you want out of it

3004
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:47,359
you're gonna have to work with it for a

3005
01:46:45,359 --> 01:46:49,439
while and do three four

3006
01:46:47,359 --> 01:46:50,880
you know five stages of breeding and

3007
01:46:49,439 --> 01:46:52,319
you'll probably get it to somewhere

3008
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:54,800
where you want to go

3009
01:46:52,319 --> 01:46:56,799
if i was being optimistic i would say

3010
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:59,840
cross once to the puck and then cross to

3011
01:46:56,800 --> 01:47:01,199
anything else for like nine generations

3012
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:02,319
no i'm just kidding there's i'm sure

3013
01:47:01,198 --> 01:47:04,079
people are doing great work with it i

3014
01:47:02,319 --> 01:47:06,238
just haven't run any and that's that's

3015
01:47:04,079 --> 01:47:08,399
the main thing

3016
01:47:06,238 --> 01:47:10,238
um island sweet skunk i could talk about

3017
01:47:08,399 --> 01:47:13,198
that for a second it

3018
01:47:10,238 --> 01:47:15,279
um it's canadian there's uh stories

3019
01:47:13,198 --> 01:47:18,158
around about it um

3020
01:47:15,279 --> 01:47:20,158
supposedly it uh wasn't [ __ ] this up

3021
01:47:18,158 --> 01:47:22,079
again don't [ __ ] it up again well then

3022
01:47:20,158 --> 01:47:23,759
you say it so won't i can't [ __ ] it up

3023
01:47:22,079 --> 01:47:26,000
well i don't remember so but i think

3024
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:27,679
it's cotton candy was the rename of iss

3025
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:29,840
or something like that well no there's

3026
01:47:27,679 --> 01:47:33,118
an aspect where the sweet skunk the

3027
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:36,000
sweet skunk was supposedly um an nl5

3028
01:47:33,118 --> 01:47:37,599
haze maybe mixed with something from uh

3029
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:41,039
from breeder steve

3030
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:43,119
and then the island sweet skunk uh

3031
01:47:41,039 --> 01:47:44,800
you know was uh

3032
01:47:43,118 --> 01:47:46,639
i don't know like

3033
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:48,480
it kind of got like [ __ ] up with mark

3034
01:47:46,639 --> 01:47:49,920
emery and he decided to like rename

3035
01:47:48,479 --> 01:47:52,079
something because he wanted something

3036
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:54,000
different sounding on his menu

3037
01:47:52,079 --> 01:47:56,158
so i don't know but apparently it still

3038
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:58,079
lives in canada so there's people that

3039
01:47:56,158 --> 01:47:59,599
know the real story and have an original

3040
01:47:58,079 --> 01:48:00,559
one it's been held around for a long

3041
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:04,320
time

3042
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:05,360
um and it's likely an nl5 haze or hybrid

3043
01:48:04,319 --> 01:48:07,198
yeah

3044
01:48:05,359 --> 01:48:08,880
irene we're not going to talk about just

3045
01:48:07,198 --> 01:48:11,359
because we might have

3046
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:12,960
some people on eventually that uh it's

3047
01:48:11,359 --> 01:48:15,198
kind of their story to tell and they can

3048
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:17,279
give an enormous amount of depth on it

3049
01:48:15,198 --> 01:48:18,960
so hopefully that'll be soon

3050
01:48:17,279 --> 01:48:20,238
you know

3051
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:22,158
yep

3052
01:48:20,238 --> 01:48:24,479
casey jones was that it was a similar

3053
01:48:22,158 --> 01:48:26,479
era um there was a cut from joe schmoe

3054
01:48:24,479 --> 01:48:27,359
that was pretty good at casey jones

3055
01:48:26,479 --> 01:48:29,599
um

3056
01:48:27,359 --> 01:48:31,519
that's about all i got on that anything

3057
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:34,880
else you want to cover before we uh wrap

3058
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:37,280
this one up and if we missed any again

3059
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:38,800
send us messages some of the ones people

3060
01:48:37,279 --> 01:48:40,479
were mentioning you guys missed it

3061
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:42,159
earlier in the episode summer and other

3062
01:48:40,479 --> 01:48:44,319
episodes we have all episodes about so

3063
01:48:42,158 --> 01:48:46,319
go check them out um anything else you

3064
01:48:44,319 --> 01:48:48,399
want to cover before i start doing a

3065
01:48:46,319 --> 01:48:50,319
[ __ ] what about that time 8 50 or

3066
01:48:48,399 --> 01:48:52,719
something like that yeah oh i'll see

3067
01:48:50,319 --> 01:48:56,000
some somebody just asked about champagne

3068
01:48:52,719 --> 01:48:57,279
um champagne was a canadian strain

3069
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:59,198
and there was this picture i can't

3070
01:48:57,279 --> 01:49:01,279
remember if it was in the in

3071
01:48:59,198 --> 01:49:03,439
emery's magazine cannabis culture or

3072
01:49:01,279 --> 01:49:05,439
whatever but there was there was these

3073
01:49:03,439 --> 01:49:07,279
vid there was these pictures of

3074
01:49:05,439 --> 01:49:08,879
champagne that were just like three foot

3075
01:49:07,279 --> 01:49:10,800
tall colas

3076
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:12,719
with very little branching on like a

3077
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:14,880
hydroponic setup and it just looked like

3078
01:49:12,719 --> 01:49:16,480
there was like five pounds of weed yeah

3079
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:18,719
on this table and it was very it was

3080
01:49:16,479 --> 01:49:20,718
very delicious looking and i think there

3081
01:49:18,719 --> 01:49:22,480
was some really attractive pictures of

3082
01:49:20,719 --> 01:49:24,158
champagne taken

3083
01:49:22,479 --> 01:49:24,799
that got a lot of people's interest in

3084
01:49:24,158 --> 01:49:26,960
it

3085
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:28,480
um and it was seed lines that was

3086
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:29,679
crossed into stuff

3087
01:49:28,479 --> 01:49:31,359
it's kind of one of those things i don't

3088
01:49:29,679 --> 01:49:34,000
know that we ever saw the real one down

3089
01:49:31,359 --> 01:49:36,880
in america i can't say um but it

3090
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:38,880
definitely was passed around those 90s

3091
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:39,920
beaster circles

3092
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:40,800
yeah

3093
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:42,480
you know

3094
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:44,239
yeah um

3095
01:49:42,479 --> 01:49:45,839
someone was talking about what was in it

3096
01:49:44,238 --> 01:49:47,919
the king and champagne a funny story

3097
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:49,760
about the king i almost popped the last

3098
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:53,118
of those seeds and then i agreed to do a

3099
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:55,360
collab with y east and

3100
01:49:53,118 --> 01:49:56,960
when he was with compound um the seeds

3101
01:49:55,359 --> 01:49:59,279
got given to his partner of king and i

3102
01:49:56,960 --> 01:50:00,719
never saw them again so you look at him

3103
01:49:59,279 --> 01:50:02,800
i'm sure compound might have a king

3104
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:04,399
hybrid somewhere and i think maybe

3105
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:07,119
there's a good chance like we have some

3106
01:50:04,399 --> 01:50:09,679
canadian friends and stuff yeah um you

3107
01:50:07,118 --> 01:50:11,920
know i think it still survives up there

3108
01:50:09,679 --> 01:50:13,920
yeah it could very well yeah it's mostly

3109
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:16,319
it's most the history on it is mostly

3110
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:17,920
canadian yeah and a lot of things people

3111
01:50:16,319 --> 01:50:19,519
are asking about like the canadian stuff

3112
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:20,399
i'd love to talk about but i just don't

3113
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:22,480
have

3114
01:50:20,399 --> 01:50:23,920
any experience with canadian stuff other

3115
01:50:22,479 --> 01:50:26,559
than what we could buy from seed up

3116
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:28,800
there and it was still minimal you know

3117
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:30,480
yeah um we had this we had this line

3118
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:31,920
from my friends in color we had the hong

3119
01:50:30,479 --> 01:50:33,118
kong i don't know if that's what people

3120
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:35,039
are talking about or they're talking

3121
01:50:33,118 --> 01:50:37,598
about a different kong but yeah we had

3122
01:50:35,039 --> 01:50:40,719
this thing called the hong kong that uh

3123
01:50:37,599 --> 01:50:41,520
still exists in various hybrids

3124
01:50:40,719 --> 01:50:43,599
so

3125
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:45,840
the kong if i remember correctly had

3126
01:50:43,599 --> 01:50:47,599
this reputation for being sold for some

3127
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:51,360
ridiculous amount of money like twenty

3128
01:50:47,599 --> 01:50:53,440
thousand dollars for a cut yeah

3129
01:50:51,359 --> 01:50:55,519
and soul assassin was not just og solo

3130
01:50:53,439 --> 01:50:57,198
assassins were all uh hybrids of og we

3131
01:50:55,520 --> 01:50:59,440
still have the number one in our circle

3132
01:50:57,198 --> 01:51:01,279
number three was an oracle hybrid and it

3133
01:50:59,439 --> 01:51:02,960
