welcome to breeder Syndicate 2.0 where

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,820
we explore the history of a clandestine

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:11,039
scene researching everything from

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,839
Cannabis string history old smuggling

5
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,000
Tales from the first person perspective

6
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:16,500
to breeding science and news on current

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,359
subculture

8
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,920
I'm your host Matthew and I'll

9
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,080
occasionally be joined by my homie not

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,179
so dog breeder and grower from Mendocino

11
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:26,639
to speak on these subjects and sometimes

12
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:28,379
interview other participants our goal is

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,118
to document this history before it's

14
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:31,379
written by corporations and others who

15
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:34,140
just weren't there

16
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:37,280
let's start writing some wrongs welcome

17
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,280
to the underground

18
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,780
hey what's up everyone welcome to

19
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:47,699
breeder Syndicate reviews

20
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,640
um I've already done a review on this

21
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,219
product right when I got it and I did it

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,439
like maybe

23
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,558
15 minutes after having out of the box

24
00:00:55,439 --> 00:01:01,558
and really not knowing what I had as a

25
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:03,179
product and not knowing what parts did

26
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:05,158
what and

27
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:07,560
I was trying something new but it really

28
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,479
sucked so I wanted to redo this reshoot

29
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,700
this and and since I actually understand

30
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:14,579
the product now I've cleaned it

31
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,740
taking it apart used it a bunch on

32
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:17,700
different stuff so I wanted to give it a

33
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:21,359
proper review

34
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,159
so this product is called the

35
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:26,400
now this part is going to be new to me

36
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,560
trying to get this in shot

37
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,118
a flower

38
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,340
the flower Mill

39
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:35,159
and this is the packaging for it and

40
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:38,640
again here's the stuff

41
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:42,420
and eventually there is a

42
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,219
if I can get the light not to uh

43
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,019
this is just terrible with this light

44
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:48,239
hold on

45
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:50,519
maybe I could turn down the lights on so

46
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,919
it just stops that

47
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:55,078
didn't really help much anyways there's

48
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:59,219
a QR code for it this is the flower Mill

49
00:01:55,078 --> 00:02:01,679
and as it comes and it arrives it you

50
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:03,719
know what it comes with this is the

51
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,220
premium Flour Mill

52
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:09,300
from flowermo USA really nice it's heavy

53
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:10,859
you can

54
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,959
hurt someone with this thing if you

55
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,520
wanted to and uh when you get it you

56
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,098
open it up this is what it looks like it

57
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,020
has a it doesn't have teeth on it like

58
00:02:17,098 --> 00:02:22,818
we are accustomed to seeing as you can

59
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,819
see from like this Edge

60
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,739
quite a bit different looking and inside

61
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:32,640
you'll see there's a uh

62
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:35,239
kind of perforated thingy and you can

63
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:35,238
unscrew it

64
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:40,199
and if you bought the um

65
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:42,479
upgraded screen package you can actually

66
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:45,179
change the size of these and we're going

67
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:47,518
to show you what each size does

68
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,719
and this right here now a lot of people

69
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,039
laughed at me because the last one I was

70
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,019
like what the hell is this green thing

71
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:55,560
in here you know

72
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:58,259
and uh sorry I have to slam it out it's

73
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,420
for the top

74
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:01,679
it sits in here and this is so when you

75
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:03,958
go to clean it

76
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,760
it's a rotor keycap and you just twist

77
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:08,400
it and Bam

78
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:11,399
this thing comes all the way off and you

79
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,620
can easily you know put an alcohol clean

80
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,379
it do whatever so it's actually pretty

81
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,060
freaking handy though I don't know where

82
00:03:16,378 --> 00:03:19,739
to put the key in the meantime like when

83
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,500
you're using it there's not a good

84
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,878
storage place for the key like if you

85
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,979
don't want to put it in the bottom face

86
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:27,959
up so that your bud just hangs in all

87
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:29,818
these crevices right

88
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:31,979
um so I haven't found a good place to

89
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:33,419
put other than in the package and then

90
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:35,878
going and hunting it down when I need to

91
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:37,079
use it to clean it but anyway um what

92
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:38,579
I'm going to show you first is we're

93
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,500
going to start with

94
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,239
the screen that it comes with because

95
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,280
you know most people if you're if you

96
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,360
don't order the um if you order the

97
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,519
premium

98
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,260
uh Clower Mill

99
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,000
and

100
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:53,158
you don't order the extra screens I want

101
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,680
to show you what you'll get right so

102
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:58,560
this is it stock and what I'm going to

103
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,840
be what I'm going to be uh shredding

104
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,420
today is um

105
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,539
Santa Cruz blue dream

106
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:08,158
grown by my buddy pack from Santa Cruz

107
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:10,620
goat farm

108
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:12,479
so and I'm going to do that for all the

109
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,759
screen sizes the same stuff from the

110
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:17,339
same person so that you get an idea for

111
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:19,978
the same type of blood bud and density

112
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:21,779
and stuff what you're going to get and

113
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:23,779
even when I load these I'm just being

114
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:26,698
real picky about stems just because I am

115
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:29,099
though like the owner said because he he

116
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:31,319
wrote me after the first um

117
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,879
the first review and was like hey here's

118
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:35,879
my name here's my number if you ever

119
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:37,379
need to talk it's real friendly nice guy

120
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:39,120
um and like I said before this isn't a

121
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:40,319
sponsored video they're not paying me I

122
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,560
didn't get this for free I went and

123
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:46,259
bought it and um because I I saw it at

124
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,699
our can Illuminati party and I was like

125
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:49,680
you know I'm big warm broader I was like

126
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:51,600
dude what is that you know and I saw it

127
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,759
and in action it was cool and it worked

128
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,100
really well so when I got home I wanted

129
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,139
to check it out on more stuff you know

130
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,759
what I mean you don't really

131
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:01,319
okay I'll get to use a whole another

132
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,120
person's grinder for a whole long time

133
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:04,139
so anyway

134
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,120
so

135
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:07,439
as you can see let's see if I can get a

136
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,819
good picture maybe I'll put a little bit

137
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:12,019
more in

138
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:12,019
just because

139
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,720
there we go

140
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,060
so here we go

141
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:21,720
I'm Santa Cruz blue dream I really wish

142
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:23,459
this had like a better macro setting

143
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,160
you can see because I want to show you

144
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:27,899
how fine it grinds up now unlike

145
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,060
Grinders where you push real hard and

146
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:32,159
grind I am noticing you don't

147
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,180
necessarily have to do that like slower

148
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,759
is better

149
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,139
so when I'm doing it oh maybe I'll do it

150
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,939
from this angle Maybe

151
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:41,160
well because it'll just drop out the

152
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:42,660
sides you just do it real slow because

153
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,699
you're just Milling the flower you're

154
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,439
not grinding you're milling and you're

155
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:48,900
gently pushing it against that screen

156
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:51,000
and rubbing it up against that screen

157
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:55,620
and what it does is it gives the the

158
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,019
butter real super fluffy texture and

159
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:00,300
I don't know it seems to me and I can't

160
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:04,279
prove it like like what do I know right

161
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:07,620
but it seems to me like it's

162
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:09,599
not murdering the oils as much but maybe

163
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,418
I don't know

164
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,979
anyway let's see you can get this one

165
00:06:12,418 --> 00:06:16,740
keeps coming unscrewed ever since the

166
00:06:13,978 --> 00:06:20,060
last time I did it

167
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,060
okay see we got

168
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:25,619
so there's still stuff left up here

169
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,538
and this screen and this is this isn't

170
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:30,300
my favorite screen to use to be honest

171
00:06:27,538 --> 00:06:33,478
with you because I've had a lot of

172
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:35,400
um stuff like this you know and the

173
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:37,978
sticks are supposed to stay up here but

174
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:40,379
like normal this isn't the most this

175
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:42,719
isn't like cookies density buds so the

176
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:46,500
fact that it just compressed it all kind

177
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:49,280
of was not a good sign

178
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:53,639
so I'll break it up some more

179
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:55,679
uncompress it and re-mill it

180
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:57,538
but yeah

181
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,240
this isn't this is not my favorite

182
00:06:57,538 --> 00:07:02,759
screen I really feel like the the one

183
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,560
slightly finer does a better job when it

184
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:06,120
comes to stuff like this

185
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,680
and like I said I can't go back and

186
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,959
forth I can only go one way right now

187
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,759
because for whatever reason this thing

188
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:13,978
is

189
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,060
unscrewing as I go back and forth maybe

190
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:16,800
you're only supposed to go One Direction

191
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,538
though because like I kept seeing

192
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,038
ignorant stuff like that last time and

193
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:22,620
yeah see

194
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:24,180
there you go

195
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,939
this flag needed a little bit of

196
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:29,098
fluffing by me my fault

197
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:31,199
so here's the finished product and this

198
00:07:29,098 --> 00:07:33,360
is what I mostly want you to see up

199
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,538
close

200
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,939
is the

201
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:40,560
texture

202
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:42,740
you see how it's kind of when you touch

203
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,740
it

204
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,060
it's still very marshmallowy

205
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,479
being just squish it

206
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:53,478
'll rise back up

207
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:57,478
yeah so

208
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,639
that's from the the screen that comes

209
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:02,038
with it and granted like I said I did I

210
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:03,538
did a crappy job try to grind it there

211
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:05,719
is a little bit left on top and that's

212
00:08:03,538 --> 00:08:05,719
it

213
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,379
um let's see

214
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,259
so uh we're gonna put this somewhere

215
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:14,939
else

216
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:17,639
and then we will do the next screen size

217
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:19,319
so I can show you if you did get the

218
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:21,060
other screens which you can expect from

219
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:22,740
those

220
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:27,680
and luckily with this changing the

221
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:27,680
screens is very very very easy

222
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:32,820
so

223
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:34,740
okay that way we don't mix it up so you

224
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:37,680
can actually see the different

225
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,459
densities so this is the screen we were

226
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,500
using

227
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:43,379
there's basically a screw on the back

228
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:47,100
side you hold it twist it

229
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:49,820
and unscrew it battery Dome

230
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,820
and then

231
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:55,399
this is the next size down

232
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:03,299
what that was

233
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:04,679
anyway so now you just load it back up

234
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:06,000
let's put that on there you screw this

235
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:07,799
is the thing that kept coming unscrewed

236
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,958
when I would go both directions

237
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:14,219
but I haven't had that problem before so

238
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:17,099
maybe I'm just I am very very slow

239
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:19,139
so any complications please blame on me

240
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,399
not the product because really I've had

241
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:22,319
no problems with this thing it's been

242
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,958
pretty nice

243
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,200
it's been pretty freaking nice I will

244
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,199
say

245
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:32,939
um I don't remember the price point on

246
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:36,120
this but it is a plus 100 price point

247
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,500
for just the the um

248
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,539
the mill

249
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,519
without the additional screens alone

250
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:43,740
it's over a hundred

251
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,240
so it's not going to be something that

252
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,360
you're gonna like

253
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:51,419
you know get super cheap or it's it's a

254
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:54,120
newer type tech for this

255
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:55,679
um market so I don't even think there's

256
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,278
knockoffs or anything like that out

257
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:01,379
there I mean I don't know but um the

258
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:03,120
quality of this is pretty sound and like

259
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:04,919
the fact that I'm nobody and the owner

260
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,799
reached out and was like real cool even

261
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:09,000
though it wasn't the best review

262
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:10,019
it was cool of him so here's the next

263
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,539
size

264
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:15,360
and this is the neck size

265
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:18,299
um smaller on the screens and there's

266
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,759
one slightly smaller than that and I

267
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:23,159
believe two larger

268
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:25,259
all right let's see

269
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:27,899
and see the the top of this thing is

270
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:30,720
magnetic and and weighted too so it's

271
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:32,100
it's nice you don't have to push

272
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,278
it does it

273
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:37,940
bam see a little bit on top not much

274
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:37,939
and then

275
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:52,319
freaking not so dog blowing me up

276
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:56,220
ring her off not so we're busy anyway

277
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:58,500
here's the uh finished for this size I

278
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:00,778
don't know if with this camera if it

279
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,339
really will be able to show you any

280
00:11:00,778 --> 00:11:04,439
like if you'll be able to tell any

281
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:07,860
difference you know

282
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:11,899
from the last size

283
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,899
come on get clarity there we go

284
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,600
the texture is slightly different with

285
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:21,139
this it's a little less fluffy a little

286
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,139
more fine

287
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,440
you know

288
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,879
the other stuff's a little more fluffy

289
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,100
and this is just a little more fine but

290
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:30,659
you don't have as much I don't know I

291
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,920
didn't ever have as much stuff left over

292
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:34,019
okay

293
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:35,219
so we're gonna go to the next uh let's

294
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:39,778
do

295
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:41,339
essentially what will be two sizes up

296
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:42,419
and after doing all this like a

297
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:45,380
barbarian I'm putting them all together

298
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:45,379
at the end right

299
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:53,578
that's slow all right

300
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:55,739
next size uh or two sizes up

301
00:11:53,578 --> 00:11:58,799
so for comparison's sake we're going to

302
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:00,659
jump up to this size

303
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:03,419
wait hold on I think that was what we

304
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:04,980
started with make sure

305
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:07,099
yeah that's what we started with here we

306
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,100
go

307
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:14,100
this size up so we just use this one

308
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,839
we're going to go up to that size so you

309
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:19,560
guys can see what that one's like the

310
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:22,440
the monster site

311
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:25,439
so like I did before I just unscrew it

312
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:28,019
here there's a screw on the other side

313
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,640
pop it out

314
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:30,720
and I'm trying to show it in camera even

315
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:32,220
though I keep pulling it off because

316
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,200
like whenever I'm always trying to find

317
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:36,060
like a tutorial and then take it off

318
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,940
camera like the part one part I'm

319
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:41,338
looking for on how to do or undo

320
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:43,200
it sucks and that constantly happens

321
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:46,680
with almost everything I look for so

322
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:49,500
hopefully I don't do that to anyone here

323
00:12:46,679 --> 00:12:51,419
if I do message me and let me know and I

324
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:54,839
will go back and

325
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:57,539
help somehow explain it somehow

326
00:12:54,839 --> 00:13:00,300
because that is frustrating as hell all

327
00:12:57,539 --> 00:13:01,860
right one last round of uh Blue Dream

328
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:04,379
here

329
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:07,259
so essentially one thing that you might

330
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:09,720
notice is that if you buy the premium

331
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:11,700
screens uh or if you buy the premium

332
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,079
Mill and you buy the additional screens

333
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,820
what's going to happen is you're going

334
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:17,458
to end up with two of the same size

335
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:19,620
screens because in that four screen set

336
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:23,099
it's an extra screen of one that it

337
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:24,419
comes with so just be aware of that

338
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,159
because I thought it would be like

339
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:27,899
additional screens as far as like

340
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:31,559
additional sizes so then I would have

341
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:33,958
five but realistically like you're gonna

342
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:35,159
find one that you work with best and

343
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:37,679
it's not necessarily going to be the one

344
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:39,240
that it comes with you know like I I saw

345
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,458
on the reviews a lot of people agree

346
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,440
with me that that small one is is not

347
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:44,939
the small list but the next to smallest

348
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,079
is

349
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:51,540
is the one that they like too so

350
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:53,519
and that one does not come with the uh

351
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:55,439
Mill that one is only with the

352
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,419
additional set it would be cool if

353
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,800
they'd like maybe what they should do is

354
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,838
like let you choose which one you get

355
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:02,939
you know as opposed to just giving you

356
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,500
if you can only have one maybe give you

357
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,940
the choice I think that would be a good

358
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,799
option

359
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:09,480
you know

360
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:11,099
that way you're not spending extra money

361
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,000
just to get the one that most people

362
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,180
like

363
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,559
that's kind of you know I mean nobody I

364
00:14:15,179 --> 00:14:18,059
don't think anybody likes that kind of

365
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:19,679
business and I don't think that you know

366
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:22,939
they seem like good business people so

367
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:22,939
hopefully that suggestion helps

368
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:27,059
okay

369
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,740
stuff this one full because it's a big

370
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:31,138
in

371
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:33,600
got most of the sticks out I could

372
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:37,019
and again here you know this thing does

373
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,278
I in the last video I said that it's you

374
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:40,740
never have to clean it because I'm an

375
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:42,360
idiot and I don't know why I thought

376
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,159
that no one ever told me that it doesn't

377
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,339
say that anywhere but you do have to

378
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:49,919
clean it but it also like I cleaned it

379
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:52,440
super fast super super fast it comes

380
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:53,519
apart super fast it cleans super fast

381
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,199
because it's not like trying to get

382
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,698
between a whole bunch of teeth it's just

383
00:14:55,198 --> 00:15:00,059
really easy scrubbing with the brush and

384
00:14:56,698 --> 00:15:01,679
Bam you're done so Props on that

385
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:04,979
because that was a main point of biting

386
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:07,198
this grinder was um ease of use and I

387
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,820
really I kind of was sold on the fluffy

388
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:11,338
texture you know I kind of love that

389
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:12,959
like that fluffy texture I thought it

390
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:15,300
was like what I've ever seen me look

391
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:17,278
like this with this ground

392
00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:20,099
so you know for people who like joint

393
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:22,019
stews it's just perfect but I smoke

394
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:25,800
bowls and it's it's

395
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:27,659
yeah it's Prime really good for ripping

396
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:29,578
and like vaping

397
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:30,838
most people know what ripping is but

398
00:15:29,578 --> 00:15:34,799
yeah vaping

399
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:40,399
essentially and here's the final one

400
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:40,399
okay let's see if it will adjust ever

401
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:51,799
there we go

402
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:51,799
extra fluff watch

403
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:57,138
growing

404
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:57,139
it's growing

405
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,860
it's alive

406
00:16:03,139 --> 00:16:09,659
it's fun right

407
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,560
now it's really cool though extra fluffy

408
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:13,620
um

409
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:16,099
it's a great grinder it's a lot of money

410
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:18,600
though at this day and age like

411
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,639
weed people don't have expendable money

412
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,560
like we used to

413
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,620
um believe it or not there was a

414
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:28,138
collapse in this industry so

415
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:29,879
um at the price point of like 150 bucks

416
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:34,320
for a grinder I don't know how many

417
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:39,059
people will actually buy this right like

418
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:41,040
um being realistic like that's a lot but

419
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:42,838
I don't know any other Grinders that

420
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:43,799
offer the same thing at the same time so

421
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:46,139
it's like

422
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:49,500
at this moment like if you want really

423
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:53,459
nice fluffy you know juicy tasty weed

424
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:55,278
it's a great option and um it's

425
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:57,239
available I believe the website is

426
00:16:55,278 --> 00:17:00,240
flowermillusa.com and on Instagram

427
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,959
they're Flour Mill USA

428
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,959
um yeah

429
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:09,179
I like it I'm stoked on it

430
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:11,519
um

431
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:12,959
and you know I I don't know if it has a

432
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:14,338
lifetime guarantee and you'd go look

433
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,720
back but if it did I'd be even more

434
00:17:14,338 --> 00:17:16,980
stoked because that would make it

435
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,660
definitely worth it if you didn't have

436
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,860
to buy another grinder or if something

437
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,540
went wrong with this one and they

438
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:23,818
replaced stuff that would be cool I'm

439
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:25,438
not saying they do so don't quote me I'm

440
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:27,838
just saying if they did that would be

441
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:31,679
cool because I know other places do that

442
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:33,599
uh for similar price points and yeah

443
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,820
that's uh

444
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:38,279
