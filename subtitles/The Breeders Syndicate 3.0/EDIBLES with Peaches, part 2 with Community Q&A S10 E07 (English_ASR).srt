00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,878
welcome to reader Syndicate 3.0 the next

2
00:00:04,599 --> 00:00:08,638
evolution of the look into

3
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:11,000
counterculture that is Canon my name is

4
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:12,919
Matthew owner of Riot seeds and this

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,320
started as a one-man mission for strain

6
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:17,160
history and breeding science over time

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,560
it's evolved into something bigger

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,920
better and more of a team effort we will

9
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:22,599
be joined by members of the can

10
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,880
Illuminati and other friends throughout

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,039
the seasons to hear their takes on grow

12
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:29,320
techniques breeding science strain

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,039
history and more our mission is to

14
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,000
combat the Nar the corporate cannabis

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,520

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,259
their own Financial benefit welcome to

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:42,039

[Music]

19
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:46,280
Syndicate so yeah so how yeah so we had

20
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:49,920
questions about from people about this

21
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:52,480
too so yeah just go for it so you know a

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,120
lot of this is your you know you don't

23
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:58,640
you can't test your weed at home you

24
00:00:54,119 --> 00:01:02,198
don't know if it's exactly 20% or 23 or

25
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,079
18 um so if you're going to use flour I

26
00:01:02,198 --> 00:01:06,719
mean you can look at your flour and make

27
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:10,920
a a good guesstimate of like what you

28
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:13,319
think if you're getting a 20% THC flour

29
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:17,719
and so with flour you can look at it

30
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:21,319
where okay so 1 G of flour is going to

31
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:24,078
have 200 mg of THC in

32
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:25,839
it and then that's how you can you know

33
00:01:24,078 --> 00:01:27,759
then you can figure out okay if I got

34
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,680
you know this many grams of flour than

35
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,040
that you know you can do your math from

36
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,399
there

37
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,520
um when I use

38
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:43,280
hash like uh bubble

39
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:44,920
hash uh or even dry sift um and not and

40
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,799
I'm talking about dry sift before you

41
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:50,879
clean it up uh would be at a ratio where

42
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,640
I figure about you're dealing with the

43
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:56,359
50/50 you're going to have probably 50%

44
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,039
heads and others in 50%

45
00:01:56,359 --> 00:02:00,759
THC when you're dealing with just hash

46
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:04,280
or dry SI

47
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:08,038
so for every 1 gr you're going to get

48
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:10,759
500 mg of THC with those two now when

49
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:14,279
you move to rosin it's more along the

50
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:17,518
lines of like with the foo where it's

51
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:22,400
going to be up around 60 to

52
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:24,840
80% of THC um I know when I wash I've

53
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:30,879
had several batches tested now and my

54
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:32,719
hash comes in at um over 80% THC um um

55
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:34,799
that's not the case for everybody like I

56
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:37,800
saw somebody's Temple Ball results and

57
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:41,519
that Temple ball came in at only 60%

58
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:45,439
THC um but that's because it wasn't made

59
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:48,080
into rosin it was made from the the the

60
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:50,719
hash and that's why I said that hash you

61
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,319
can figure in at 50% and you'll be

62
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:55,080
probably safe with your guesstimate so

63
00:02:53,318 --> 00:02:58,359
rosin you can

64
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:01,560
figure 60 to 80% if you're doing a good

65
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:05,519
job as far as like like the 1 G will

66
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:07,840
equal 600 to 800 mg of THC for every

67
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,360
gram you put into

68
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,598
something um and that's how that's the

69
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,680
math I've always used it seems to be

70
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:17,119
pretty

71
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,680
accurate um you know without a bunch of

72
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,319
lab testing and all that we can't be

73
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:27,360
scientifically exact but my bro science

74
00:03:23,318 --> 00:03:28,919
has worked that way so far good yeah I

75
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,040
mean I would even call it bro science

76
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:34,598
right like you you just being consistent

77
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:37,919
within what you yeah I I think just

78
00:03:34,598 --> 00:03:40,560
knowing that like how would I put

79
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,919
it partly it's because you know what

80
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,158
you're working with right like you know

81
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:44,559
the flower you're working with you know

82
00:03:43,158 --> 00:03:46,158
it's consistent you know the hash you're

83
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,360
working with you know you know it's

84
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:51,280
consistent and I think everyone just has

85
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,239
to develop that sense of you know their

86
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,680
own material and and and consistently

87
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:56,438
working with It

88
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,599
ultimately

89
00:03:56,438 --> 00:04:00,959
um and yeah like some of those I think

90
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:03,078
are just broadly good tip like thinking

91
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,799
about uh the material working within

92
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:07,680
these little chunks and just trying to

93
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,360
estimate like okay if x% of this chunk

94
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,640
is going to be you know this mass is

95
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,000
going to be THC then you know roughly

96
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:17,519
this that um but yeah like you said as

97
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,160
well ultimately no guarantee uh without

98
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:24,000
actual testing um but you can like

99
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,960
you're describing definitely find a

100
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,959
process that's consistent for you I

101
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,479
think

102
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,960
okay uh

103
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:36,800
any you you did of course mention the

104
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:40,758
fact that like again different kinds of

105
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:44,680
material you know uh flower versus hash

106
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:46,280
versus Rosen um any any other tips there

107
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,160
I think we had someone who was asking

108
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:51,279
about dry sift in particular like is

109
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,400
there anything you know that you could

110
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:57,000
say to that or is it you know ultimately

111
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:59,918
the same same question I would say that

112
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,478
uh if now if you static Tech your dry

113
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:05,038
sift you're going to get a better ratio

114
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:09,599
of THC cuz you're you know pulling out

115
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:12,439
mostly heads but if you do a dry sift um

116
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,520
I always go with the 50/50 it's half

117
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:16,079
half it's going to be 1 gram is going to

118
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:20,399
have 500

119
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:25,318
milligrams um of THC in

120
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:27,120
it yeah cool is it really easy to I

121
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:30,240
shouldn't say easy is

122
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,240
it is there a standard for guessing how

123
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,680
much THC is in something like I see a

124
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,199
lot of stuff being like okay there's 500

125
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:40,199
milligrams of THC in here but with all

126
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,960
the strains testing different and having

127
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:46,319
different ratios of stuff like how does

128
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:48,239
that work it's all a guessing game

129
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:51,039
unless it's going to a

130
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,079
lab I mean it it really

131
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:56,800
is uh cuz you can't you know like I said

132
00:05:54,079 --> 00:06:00,079
unless you're getting that flower tested

133
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:04,000
first and then or you're having hash

134
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:07,279
tested you know then you don't know you

135
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,120
can only guesstimate based on you know

136
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:14,359
what you see in your hand um the quality

137
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:17,759
of your flow the quality of the dry sift

138
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:20,319
um you know it all it it's just like

139
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,720
with hash the whatever quality goes in

140
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,919
is the kind of quality you're going to

141
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:27,599
get out from it [ __ ] in [ __ ] out as I

142
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:29,959
always say

143
00:06:27,598 --> 00:06:31,560
yep yeah yeah

144
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:33,560
yeah and and again I guess it just comes

145
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,199
back to having whether or not you have

146
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,079
some kind of sense of internal

147
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,840
consistency at least like within what

148
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:43,399
you're making and at least then like if

149
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:45,638
someone is buying or consuming your

150
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:47,598
product at least you have some kind of

151
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:49,240
internal measure that you're like using

152
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:54,159
at least your base units are sort of

153
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:56,160
consistent I guess yeah yep yeah yeah

154
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:00,000
okay interesting

155
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,439
one um maybe a tangent off that is uh

156
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,360
how much of a hassle is it to get these

157
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:05,918
things tested as someone who doesn't

158
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,000
live in the US and can't do that ever

159
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:09,038
like what's it like to get you know

160
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,439
products

161
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:16,839
tested it's it's a it's

162
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:19,240
expensive yeah very very um I haven't

163
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:22,478
even had a chance to get my Edibles to

164
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:24,759
Market to be tested yet um I do know

165
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:28,560
when the last thing I was working on was

166
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:32,319
the uh water soluble drops that we made

167
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,680
and uh oh my gosh I had to I think we

168
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,720
sent it to testing three different times

169
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:40,120
because you can only have 100 milligrams

170
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,560
in the package so we had to do the whole

171
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:46,759
formula where we

172
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:47,759
knew how much THC was you know per mgram

173
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:52,598
of

174
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:55,560
the drops and then we had a 10 MGR

175
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:58,000
package and so we had to figure out how

176
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:02,079
much we had to mix with water in order

177
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,560
to get 100 m into that 10 mg

178
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:09,120
package and uh so we did that and then

179
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,959
we had it tested and one of them was off

180
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,680
by a little bit and one of them was

181
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:15,878
exactly on like perfect so that's the

182
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,400
exact ratio but then the other one so we

183
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:21,680
had to readjust

184
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:23,799
it and send it back and then it tested

185
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,720
over so it had to come back and be

186
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:30,840
readjusted and sent back and then it

187
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:33,639
tested at the right level

188
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:35,759
that sounds fun yeah

189
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:36,689
right I never knew I was going have to

190
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,679
do so much

191
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:43,719
[Laughter]

192
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:46,159
math math you're really in like uh

193
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:47,920
chemistry territory almost much more so

194
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:50,679
than like a regular grower would be

195
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:53,240
right in some ways um because you're

196
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:54,838
both in extracts and Edibles and I

197
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,120
realize as well that your greatest enemy

198
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:59,600
is chlorophyll in all of it one of the

199
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,799
one of your biggest enemies in both

200
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,839
sides is

201
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:04,799
chlorophyll

202
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:06,640
definitely and you know the thing is is

203
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:09,078
that chlorophyll actually does have

204
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:11,600
benefits it's an anti-inflammatory I

205
00:09:09,078 --> 00:09:13,278
mean it does good things for you it's

206
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,720
just there's certain things like you

207
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:17,480
don't want it in your hash and you know

208
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,000
if you don't like the taste of weed then

209
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,079
you're not going to like the taste of

210
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,159
chlorophyll

211
00:09:21,078 --> 00:09:27,759
so do you make uh trim smoothies are you

212
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:29,719
into

213
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:33,120
that Che

214
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:35,320
your salads uh no because since I don't

215
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:39,799
like the taste of it what I do do is I

216
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:43,278
make I juice the leaf and then I freeze

217
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:47,679
dry that juice and I powder it up into a

218
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:50,000
capsule oh that's smart yeah damn nice

219
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:52,078
okay so I have and again is this to get

220
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,559
some of that like thca quote unquote or

221
00:09:52,078 --> 00:09:58,799
like why would you do this why because

222
00:09:54,559 --> 00:10:02,919
the actual raw cannabis plant is amazing

223
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:05,078
it is is so good for you like it's got

224
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:08,759
anti-inflammatory properties it's cancer

225
00:10:05,078 --> 00:10:12,479
fighting just 15 raw cannabis leaves a

226
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:16,879
day is enough to fight off any type of

227
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:19,399
cancer and so since what part of why I

228
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:21,320
did the capsules is because like for one

229
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:22,919
you can't always have fresh cannabis

230
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:27,360
leaves around and a lot of people don't

231
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:30,519
have access to cannabis leaves so um and

232
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,879
by juicing it I got it down to where I

233
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:35,560
can juice it and then I freeze it and

234
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:38,639
freeze dry it and powder it down and I

235
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:40,799
have it down to where I've got 15 leaves

236
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:43,200
into one

237
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:47,000
capsule so you can take one of these

238
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:49,959
capsules and freeze drying doesn't uh it

239
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,559
leaves you with 97% of the nutrients of

240
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:55,439
the plant so it doesn't degrade it like

241
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:58,239
when you uh dehydrate something or let

242
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,560
it dry naturally it doesn't degrade the

243
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,120
nutrients in there there and so you're

244
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:06,078
still it's like taking that raw cannabis

245
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,159
still but it's in a powdered form that

246
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:10,159
you can just pop and take and have

247
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,039
anywhere with you any time of the day

248
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:14,958
you don't have to be harvesting it

249
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:17,439
doesn't have to be right now

250
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:19,359
so there was a time when I would top my

251
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,040
plants and just eat the tops like

252
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:25,159
immediately but it was a pretty full-on

253
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:29,439
experience like the flavor is intense

254
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:32,278
it's so gross it's really gross you

255
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,920
should try the juice like a weird ritual

256
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:37,159
I made Buckshot try the juice from the

257
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:40,360
juicer and he was like oh

258
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:43,879
no yeah that'd be bad that'd be like

259
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:47,639
drink wheat grass ju I'm G to try that

260
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:49,439
so grass like drink grass so gross so

261
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:51,320
gross probably worse man probably even

262
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,200
more intense than that oh man have you

263
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,079
ever drank wheat grass like I've had

264
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,440
people give me shots of that before to

265
00:11:55,078 --> 00:12:01,519
like I feel like I have not for a long

266
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:04,399
time it is so foul and and bitter like

267
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:07,000
the worst kind of bitter like just

268
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,839
instant it triggers my instant gag

269
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,559
reflex so B people enjoy drinking it

270
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,920
though it blows my mind when I've had

271
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:17,159
full leaves uh the main thing I think

272
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:21,240
that that gets me is they often taste

273
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:22,399
very peppery to me um and that is like

274
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:26,919
quite a

275
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:30,159
full-on uh yeah

276
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:34,879
anyway uh okay well was next

277
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:34,879
so you another point about oils into

278
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:42,198
capsules uh yeah that's a great way okay

279
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:44,799
like um for example uh electric ladyland

280
00:12:42,198 --> 00:12:48,639
ask about uh the

281
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:51,240
RSO concentrate and um this is a great

282
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,959
way to go into that because uh and

283
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,799
address his question as well is in my

284
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:59,479
opinion uh when you make the RSO or F

285
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:01,639
whatever you want to call it um and you

286
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,000
evaporate the alcohol it then becomes a

287
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:06,278
concentrate it's not in my opinion what

288
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,399
I would call a tincture at that point um

289
00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:10,958
if it was still in the alcohol it would

290
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:14,198
be like a tinure but when you evaporate

291
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:17,078
that off it concentrates it down and I

292
00:13:14,198 --> 00:13:21,439
will take that RSO and put it into MCT

293
00:13:17,078 --> 00:13:25,799
oil and then I put those into capsules

294
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:28,000
because um for cancer patients sometimes

295
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:29,479
the well for one the taste of RSO is

296
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,159
horrible

297
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,800
it's sticky nobody wants to put it in

298
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:36,240
their mouth I know some people put it on

299
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:39,278
toast or crackers they do all kinds of

300
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,799
stuff um and if you use the concentrate

301
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:44,838
itself too it's really hard to get it um

302
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:47,799
into a capsule of its own and so if you

303
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:51,800
put it into uh like I like to use MCT

304
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:55,399
oil um and then it can go into a capsule

305
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:57,838
just like you could uh take your rosin

306
00:13:55,399 --> 00:14:01,839
pucks after you press your rosin and you

307
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,600
can soak those in MCT oil to extract

308
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,680
what's left in there out and then you

309
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,959
can turn those into capsules and then

310
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:13,159
you have something that you can uh have

311
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:15,518
a you know titrated dosage of uh like

312
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:20,120
with the RSO I can get them to where

313
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:22,879
there's I want to say like 150 Mig per

314
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:26,320
capsule so that somebody wants to make

315
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:28,198
sure they take uh th000 milligrams a day

316
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:32,079
they can take you know they know I going

317
00:14:28,198 --> 00:14:35,639
need to take 10 of these capsules a day

318
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:37,599
um so yep that's why I found the

319
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:40,000
capsules to be helpful cuz a lot of

320
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:43,120
people are used to taking pills anyways

321
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,720
and uh they don't mind it and that way

322
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,519
you don't have the taste uh or any of

323
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,720
the inconvenience of dealing with the

324
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:53,039
actual FICO or RSO

325
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,560
itself yeah I think capsules in general

326
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:57,838
are a great way to make it look less

327
00:14:55,559 --> 00:15:00,319
scary like I even though in a much more

328
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,320
amateurish way you know make my own oil

329
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,600
and occasionally we give them to friends

330
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,920
who are not into smoking at all but

331
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,040
because like you said they're in capsule

332
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:10,240
form you know it's a lot less I don't

333
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:11,679
know scary or something yeah I mean

334
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:16,480
something they're more comfortable with

335
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:20,559
in a custom sure exactly yeah and they

336
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:25,680
loved it yeah all of them loved it um no

337
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:25,679
good tip uh anything else about that

338
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:31,519
capsules uh I don't think so

339
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,319
what's this one actually the

340
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,278
preservative a good way because okay oil

341
00:15:34,318 --> 00:15:37,919
when you mix stuff in oil you have a

342
00:15:36,278 --> 00:15:41,360
tendency you know especially if you're

343
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:43,958
using Leaf um you're

344
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:47,159
introducing stuff into the oil that

345
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:49,799
could cause it to go bad faster and so

346
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:51,519
you can choose to use a preservative you

347
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:53,559
can do this with your gummies as well

348
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:57,399
cuz gummies have a tendency to go bad

349
00:15:53,559 --> 00:16:00,359
quick uh Lorraine candy sells a mold

350
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:03,198
inhibitor um that you can buy and use

351
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:05,360
that in your product um it's the same

352
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:09,318
thing they use in all kinds of different

353
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:12,680
things to preserve stuff on the Shelf um

354
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:14,559
and then uh if you want to get more on

355
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:17,359
the natural side of things there's a

356
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:19,439
rosemary oil that is a preservative that

357
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,759
you can put into the oil before you make

358
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,279
the capsules so they'll last longer so

359
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:28,000
you don't have to worry about them going

360
00:16:24,278 --> 00:16:31,240
bad if uh you like you make a bunch of

361
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,240
oil to start with um it would keep your

362
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:36,079
oil from you know expiring if you didn't

363
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,759
use it within a couple months or

364
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:40,479
something uh and especially if you're

365
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:43,720
using the capsules and you want to do a

366
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:46,879
bunch at a time you'll know that it's

367
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,839
okay they CU if they'll they turn cloudy

368
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:50,799
in the capsule you know that's bad don't

369
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:54,199
take a cloudy

370
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:56,919
capsule um I've seen

371
00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:58,799
it yeah sorry no I finish this yeah

372
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:00,639
sorry I had somebody that Miss messaged

373
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:02,758
me they weren't my capsules they had

374
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,640
gotten them from a weed for warriors

375
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:07,480
donation and they sent me a picture of

376
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,799
them and I was like do not take those

377
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:13,279
when that oil in those capsules turns

378
00:17:09,798 --> 00:17:15,400
cloudy that means it's expiring and it

379
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:16,879
could like botulism could be in there

380
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,400
there could be all kinds of stuff in

381
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:23,000
there um cuz you put plant material in

382
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,919
it so I always caution people that if

383
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,759
for whatever reason your oil turns

384
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:29,559
cloudy or your capsules just it's you're

385
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:32,720
going to have to take the loss and not

386
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:34,720
use them I had a question about spoiling

387
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,200
cuz um like I mentioned you know I'll

388
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,200
make like a big batch at the side of the

389
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,360
year and I'll Chuck it in the fridge um

390
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,120
I really see it go off but is that

391
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:45,759
partly because it's in the fridge um are

392
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:47,519
are we talking about products that you

393
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:49,038
know lie around at room temp or no

394
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,400
technically something in the fridge go

395
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:54,359
off you know just as easily but maybe

396
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:57,159
take longer the the fridge will keep it

397
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:59,479
preserved longer like I I was that's

398
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:03,520
definitely a great Rec recommendation uh

399
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:05,360
for any cannabis product um to make sure

400
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:08,679
it lasts longer because anything that

401
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:11,399
sits out at room temperature um is going

402
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:14,440
to go bad faster especially those

403
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,559
oils so even if you have capsules yeah I

404
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,600
tell anybody I give capsules to put them

405
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:23,399
in the fridge you know they'll stay

406
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:25,839
fresher that way and last a lot

407
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,679
longer yeah I haven't thankfully haven't

408
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:30,558
seen capsules turn cloudy yet but that

409
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:34,759
doesn't sound

410
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:36,798
good not ideal

411
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:38,359
no

412
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:41,038
okay

413
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:42,678
um I I don't know did I mention this on

414
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:44,679
the while we were recording I can't

415
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:46,720
remember but uh I know at least before

416
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:49,600
the recording we were talking about how

417
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:52,839
this might just be part one um in a in a

418
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:56,038
sense of like a series potentially

419
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:59,399
because you know we could obviously ask

420
00:18:56,038 --> 00:19:01,960
peaches to talk to us about the various

421
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,600
you know products that you know she

422
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,840
actually has experience with but I think

423
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:10,639
today was mostly about getting some of

424
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:12,639
this foundational stuff um out but we

425
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,080
did have a kind of like last little

426
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,200
section maybe before we get to some of

427
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:18,439
the community questions on was it was

428
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,440
your idea like

429
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:25,360
broadly baking um and temperature and

430
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:27,919
time with respect to baking paches ah

431
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:30,038
yeah like CU I've been doing Edibles for

432
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,880
a long time and before there was a bunch

433
00:19:30,038 --> 00:19:35,400
of research like I remember whenever I

434
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,159
baked anything I would bake it at like

435
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:41,720
200° for way longer cuz I didn't want it

436
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:43,960
to get over a c certain temperature and

437
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,038
uh now you know everybody's done some

438
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,400
more studies and you know you can bake

439
00:19:46,038 --> 00:19:50,359
your brownies at 350 in the oven cuz the

440
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,919
actual internal temperature of your

441
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:55,759
brownie doesn't get to

442
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:59,120
350° um and

443
00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:03,038
so uh but you have to keep in mind cuz I

444
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:07,279
see people uh who will like be frying

445
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:09,359
things in oil in medicated oil and the

446
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:12,399
fryer oil is medicated and they're

447
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:15,199
frying in it and I'm like okay that

448
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,919
temperature is too high all that THC has

449
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,919
been

450
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:23,880
like fried out and converted you're not

451
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:26,279
going to actually get high from frying

452
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:29,039
something in the

453
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:32,200
oil um

454
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:34,480
yeah uh just the one thing I've learned

455
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,798
with baking though is that uh I used to

456
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,240
have to bake things at a lower

457
00:20:35,798 --> 00:20:39,679
temperature and now I found that you

458
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,759
know you can just bake them at the

459
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:45,360
regular temperature um for your regular

460
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:47,240
length of time I do have a tendency

461
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:49,519
though like I don't always buy it when

462
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:52,839
something's over 400° I have a tendency

463
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:57,798
to turn it down and cook it for longer

464
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:59,359
um with you know certain baked items but

465
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:02,000
uh

466
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:04,599
uh I have found that just leaving it at

467
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,880
regular temperature is fine cuz it used

468
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:08,879
to take me a long time I used to do uh

469
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:12,559
snicker doodles were one of my favorites

470
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:15,278
to make and man it would take like an

471
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:17,839
hour to bake a thing cookies at a low

472
00:21:15,278 --> 00:21:20,200
Temp and it's just funny to see how

473
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:22,158
things have you know come for Full

474
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,840
Circle when you've done something for so

475
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,960
long and now there's new information out

476
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:29,359
there and we used to all be so careful

477
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,000
about not getting it too hot and now I'm

478
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:34,038
like oh I'll just put my brownies in at

479
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,038
350 they'll be

480
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,759
fine very good

481
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:44,320
tip

482
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:46,440
um well technically we're kind of out in

483
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:48,918
terms of the the points that you wanted

484
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,640
to address peaches but I wonder just

485
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:52,960
because we've mentioned it quite a few

486
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,799
times and just to give maybe everyone

487
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,038
almost like a sneak preview could you

488
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:59,119
give us an overview of the gummy making

489
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:02,319
process just a broad

490
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:06,000
overview uh yeah or your one

491
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:08,038
anyway the recipe I mean I have two cuz

492
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,240
you can make it you can make rest

493
00:22:08,038 --> 00:22:14,240
without gelatin and do it with fruit

494
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:16,120
juice and stuff like that those ones are

495
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,519
a little more difficult they take a

496
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:21,199
little more setting up in time uh my

497
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:25,798
favorite go-to gummy recipe is just with

498
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:28,558
some gelatin Jell-O and glycerin it's

499
00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:31,079
really basic and simple and and you can

500
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:33,158
whip it up and have gummies ready like

501
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:39,319
in 2

502
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:42,400
hours nice yeah uh that one you could go

503
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:46,439
ahead you go sorry um you could use

504
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:50,200
either oil or um alcohol or glycerin

505
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:52,759
with it um I I will post like if we want

506
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:56,360
to start a thread I'll post the actual

507
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:59,319
recipe up um for everybody with the

508
00:22:56,359 --> 00:23:02,798
ratios um but I just use a one it's a

509
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:06,519
small box of Jello-O and uh two packs of

510
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:08,759
gelatin and then your carrier oil and

511
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:13,119
then I like to use the mold inhibitor

512
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:15,400
because gummies will mold quickly um and

513
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:17,879
you just heat it up on the stove melt it

514
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,759
all and you pour it into the molds and

515
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,278
let it set and chill them and then you

516
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:23,079
keep them in the fridge and there like I

517
00:23:21,278 --> 00:23:25,798
said in like 2 hours you got gummies

518
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:27,038
ready to eat jeez okay I thought it was

519
00:23:25,798 --> 00:23:29,000
for some reason I thought it was way

520
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:30,919
more drawn out of process than that so

521
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,720
essentially it's assuming you have your

522
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:35,919
oil or your glycerin MH um it's just a

523
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,960
matter of mixing it together and putting

524
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:40,520
in the molds is that right yeah the yes

525
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,400
the process you're thinking of is the

526
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:44,359
one where like if you're going to use

527
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,840
instead of gel like cuz some people

528
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:49,719
don't want to use gelatin um or Jello so

529
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:51,720
you can use

530
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:55,038
um the

531
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:57,519
pectin uh you can use

532
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:59,640
agar um yes I was going to say that too

533
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:01,480
yeah okay those are two different

534
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,880
options and yeah cuz somebody had a

535
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:07,000
question about pectin and it being

536
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:09,440
having containing pesticides which uh is

537
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,960
a you know excellent point I do know

538
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:15,000
that they do offer a certified organic

539
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:16,880
apple pectin um and then the agar is

540
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,759
another option if you want to avoid that

541
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,760
stuff but that process is more drawn out

542
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:25,278
that's when you use the fruit juice and

543
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:28,158
you got to warm that up and then your

544
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:30,440
carrier goes in and you got to you know

545
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,360
add your pectin or whatever you're using

546
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,399
and cook it and do it and then those

547
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:37,199
ones usually have to yeah they sit out

548
00:24:34,398 --> 00:24:38,918
and like they have to dry it's a whole

549
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,480
process those ones have to be

550
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:44,360
sugared um yeah that sounds like a lot

551
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,038
of work

552
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:48,158
um I mean I assume that people are

553
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:49,558
staying away from jalous because they

554
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:54,640
don't like the fact that it's from what

555
00:24:49,558 --> 00:24:56,440
horse Hoops or horse Hoopes um uh or or

556
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,399
there's one other thing though is

557
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:01,720
korium use that

558
00:24:58,398 --> 00:25:04,398
you know what that is what's that

559
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:07,919
castorian ohar with

560
00:25:04,398 --> 00:25:10,439
this no it is it is in a lot of like

561
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:13,520
gummy worms and stuff like that it is

562
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:17,558
the um it's something extracted from the

563
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:19,798
anal gland of a beaver oh yeah that's

564
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:21,720
where they get raspberry extract from

565
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:25,558
there you go there you go everybody eat

566
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:28,159
Beaver [ __ ] yep from

567
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:31,158
Beaver I was just waiting to say that

568
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:33,760
awesome that is awes I mean I kind of

569
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:35,480
find this stuff fascinating because like

570
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:37,440
so many things come from Super strange

571
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,278
places like you know those like uh

572
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,320
there's that particular is it the red

573
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:43,480
color that they get from the shell of a

574
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:46,879
particular like Beetle or something and

575
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:47,919
they' crush them oh yeah yeah yeah and I

576
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,679
kind of remember yeah this stuff

577
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:54,360
fascinates me honestly um story him

578
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:56,360
buddy look before you eat be a butt Beav

579
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:59,000
a butthole okay and it's like the anal

580
00:25:56,359 --> 00:26:02,339
gland too on top of all the gland even

581
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,038
that's awesome even from the

582
00:26:02,339 --> 00:26:08,359
[Laughter]

583
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:10,158
gland well it might be a good time for

584
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:12,199
us to get to some of those Community

585
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,799
questions I think we we addressed some

586
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,720
um but yeah there are a few more uh I

587
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:18,798
will say that these questions also cover

588
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,480
some extract stuff because you know um

589
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:25,240
peaches is our resident you know

590
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:27,240
extracts and Edibles person so okay I'll

591
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:30,440
just start from the top we had one from

592
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:32,038
herbs SD on gummies I don't know if we

593
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,919
cover this already is there an easy way

594
00:26:32,038 --> 00:26:37,640
to turn rosin into gummies what's the

595
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:39,200
best F oil to use any trick and getting

596
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,799
them not to

597
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,840
separate

598
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:45,480
yeah uh well I would get sunflower like

599
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:49,038
and that'll be your first thing to make

600
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:50,880
them not separate um the other key when

601
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:53,839
you're going to use oil is doing the

602
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,520
stacking method so you're not like so

603
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:59,639
you can use half a cup of oil instead of

604
00:26:56,519 --> 00:27:03,398
a cup cuz cuz the less oil you use the

605
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:05,399
better um so if you can stack that batch

606
00:27:03,398 --> 00:27:08,959
so you get more into it then you're

607
00:27:05,398 --> 00:27:10,319
going to be better off um I find that

608
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,079
the

609
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:17,720
gelatin gummy recipe works better with

610
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:20,199
the oil um than the other one does in my

611
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,919
opinion and uh you just you need an

612
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:28,080
emulsifier to make it

613
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:29,720
work yep nice LSD do you find different

614
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:33,319
cultivar give different effects in the

615
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:36,759
Edibles I assume yes right but yes

616
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:38,918
definitely without a doubt yeah

617
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:42,319
that's can be one of those ones again

618
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:44,038
where it's like super complex and yeah

619
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:46,319
never really know I guess until you try

620
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:49,319
it well yeah and it's you know it's

621
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:51,558
really hard to always have one cultivar

622
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:53,398
in a certain specific edible because

623
00:27:51,558 --> 00:27:56,720
you'd have to grow so much of that

624
00:27:53,398 --> 00:27:59,678
specific one you know so it it's kind of

625
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,720
hard in that sense unless you know

626
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:04,679
you've got like I have before like I

627
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:06,839
said made a batch of tincture from all

628
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:09,278
strawberry banana and I can tell you

629
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:12,639
that batch of tincture smelled just like

630
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:12,640
the flower it was quite

631
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:19,240
amazing was that Mt say it again is it

632
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:21,798
that that's cool that it actually tasted

633
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:24,679
my mind yeah I want some now I want some

634
00:28:21,798 --> 00:28:27,918
blue I want some blue Edibles get on the

635
00:28:24,679 --> 00:28:29,559
map yeah yeah I'm I want to try that

636
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,600
that sounds

637
00:28:29,558 --> 00:28:34,639
awesome um kind of closely related I

638
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:37,038
want to know why Edibles are Hit or Miss

639
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,919
for some people like why they work

640
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:42,158
sometimes and and sometimes not it's I

641
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,759
mean do you think this is partly

642
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:47,600
cultivar related peaches or is there

643
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:50,158
something else you think um well I would

644
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:52,599
say the first thing would be the

645
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:55,919
decarbox because some people don't know

646
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:58,398
about that so it's possible that someone

647
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:02,000
has gotten Edibles that weren't decart

648
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:03,719
oh my God now if they're from the same

649
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,679
source

650
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:09,240
and you know they worked that yesterday

651
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:12,000
today they didn't seem to work the same

652
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:14,679
uh there's a couple of factors uh the

653
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,599
time that you ate them uh if you have a

654
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:19,798
full stomach it's going to take longer

655
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:21,839
for you to process that through your

656
00:29:19,798 --> 00:29:25,759
system whereas if you eat it on a empty

657
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:27,918
stomach it'll hit you faster um your

658
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:29,960
metabolism plays a role

659
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:32,080
some people you're going to fill it in

660
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,440
30 minutes other people it's going to

661
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:35,639
take 2

662
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,080
hours

663
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,720
um the other thing I always tell is

664
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:42,558
sometimes people's math is off what they

665
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:44,480
think is 500 milligrams is not so it's

666
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:48,639
possible that you just got a lowd dose

667
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:52,278
edible and you're used to it um then

668
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:55,080
there is the whole fact where cannabis

669
00:29:52,278 --> 00:29:58,960
is totally metabolized in the liver and

670
00:29:55,079 --> 00:30:02,158
it's done uh it's called the micro romal

671
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:04,880
cytochrome and that is what helps that

672
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:09,200
makes you get hot um it delivers it to

673
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:15,200
your blood system so some people have a

674
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:18,399
gene variant in that uh specific cyp 2c9

675
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:21,440
receptor and it doesn't allow them to

676
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:24,678
get high it doesn't process the Cannabis

677
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:28,000
into their system so they don't get high

678
00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:30,240
from it so just to clarify you mean when

679
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,440
they eat it right um but these people

680
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,759
will still get hyp from smoking it yes

681
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:37,840
because that's different effect yeah

682
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:41,640
that's right cool and then the whole

683
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:43,918
other thing uh is so we all have

684
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,720
cannaboid receptors so we can use

685
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:50,440
cannabis that's why it works on us um

686
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:55,079
some of us have 10,000 receptors some of

687
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:58,159
us have 100 so when you eat the Cannabis

688
00:30:55,079 --> 00:31:00,599
if you have a 100 then your system's

689
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:02,960
going to get flooded because you only

690
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:05,359
have so many but if you got 10,000

691
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:08,120
receptors that same amount of cannabis

692
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:10,558
is not going to work the same on you as

693
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:12,839
it does with someone with a 100

694
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:15,158
receptors so that's one of the other

695
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:18,759
facts besides that liver enzyme that

696
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:21,360
plays a role as well as when you eat it

697
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:23,440
and all that factor

698
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:25,558
um whether it's

699
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,278
decarbed I think that's all the factors

700
00:31:25,558 --> 00:31:29,638
that would go into why it would or

701
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:29,638
wouldn't

702
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,320
work very nice it's yeah it's it's kind

703
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:36,639
of as

704
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:39,960
complex maybe arguably more complex

705
00:31:36,638 --> 00:31:42,959
because they're more layers um uh as the

706
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:45,480
question of like why some cultivar might

707
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,240
get someone high and someone not or you

708
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:50,519
know why affects someone differently

709
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:52,880
there's so many variables here um down

710
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:55,759
to the process down to the flower itself

711
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,799
down to our bodies you know so yeah very

712
00:31:55,759 --> 00:32:01,440
similar I think

713
00:31:57,798 --> 00:32:04,839
um okay 's

714
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:08,399
next next question would have

715
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:10,240
been um this one's about washing and I

716
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:12,479
wonder if actually I might just direct

717
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:17,638
them to checking out your the first

718
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:21,720
episode we did with you this is from BL

719
00:32:17,638 --> 00:32:24,839
blaza uh newbie intro to washing kit uh

720
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:27,240
someone more wanting to learn to wash uh

721
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:29,079
do do we cover this in the first episode

722
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:32,240
I can't even really remember I'm sure we

723
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:34,398
did um I don't know his thing was about

724
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,519
like essential equipment

725
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:40,038
right um I would say just to touch

726
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:42,359
quickly your essential equipment to wash

727
00:32:40,038 --> 00:32:45,440
at home would be you need

728
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:47,158
bags um at least 5 gallon

729
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,200
buckets

730
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:54,120
um something to hold ice you're going to

731
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:56,159
need Scoops something to wash with

732
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:58,479
that's your basic something to dry on

733
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:01,760
want some screen

734
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,759
um I think that would

735
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:07,440
be

736
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:09,599
um oh a sprayer for spraying down your

737
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,159
bags yeah that you've mentioned that

738
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:13,798
before yeah that's a good one I think

739
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:16,760
that would be your like main Essentials

740
00:33:13,798 --> 00:33:21,000
and then as far as like if uh I think

741
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:23,440
you ask about with Edibles too um some

742
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,278
of the main things I use regularly is

743
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:28,960
the double boiler uh my convection oven

744
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:31,159
my other oven before I had the

745
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,120
convection oven uh

746
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:38,159
thermometer

747
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:38,158
strainers um my nut Mel bags and a

748
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:45,439
scale yep

749
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:47,880
yep um I think we covered mountain

750
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,399
flowers hemp's question which was on uh

751
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:52,799
pekon yeah in

752
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:55,278
gummies I gotta add that in he has

753
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:58,599
really good he has really good hint

754
00:33:55,278 --> 00:34:02,759
mountain flowers very good very good

755
00:33:58,599 --> 00:34:06,719
uh that's cool yeah I did not

756
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:08,878
know um we got electric ladyland yep you

757
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,519
covered that question and even I think

758
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:14,639
uh Zaza Papa I in the win uh how hard is

759
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:16,320
it to have repeatable product yeah we

760
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:19,599
covered this kind of about uniformity

761
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,720
again as well um yep and we did talk

762
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,679
about being consistent with your process

763
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:26,398
some of your measurements But ultimately

764
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:28,320
it does come down to testing and that's

765
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:31,598
the only way can give you an absolute

766
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,599
guarantee but otherwise yeah Pet's did

767
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,039
Cover what what she tries to do to

768
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:38,240
ensure

769
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:40,199
consistency y um those are the questions

770
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:43,358
that we've got did you get sub

771
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:45,358
robs oh yeah yeah yeah sorry yeah thanks

772
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:48,199
for reminding me very detail pull it up

773
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:53,398
yeah he did let me read it

774
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:55,918
out okay Mr subb asks if using ke for

775
00:34:53,398 --> 00:34:58,279
baking do I just melt butter and stir in

776
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:01,039
ke and will it spread evenly throughout

777
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:01,760
baked goods that way how much per stick

778
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:05,199
of

779
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:09,560
butter um

780
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:11,118
yeah okay so yes you can put ke into

781
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:13,199
butter but you're going to want to

782
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,720
decarbox it

783
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:18,679
first

784
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:22,039
um and you're it's going to be spicy the

785
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:24,960
thing about ke is it is spicy when you

786
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:27,960
eat it yeah when you use it to make

787
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,119
edibles it it's spicy

788
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,358
I've made Edibles with Keef that are

789
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:35,160
almost almost hard to

790
00:35:32,358 --> 00:35:37,838
eat can you explain I don't get this one

791
00:35:35,159 --> 00:35:39,719
like how is it different from you know

792
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:42,039
other extracts it's just heads right and

793
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:44,639
stuff why is it different I think I

794
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:47,039
think it's just I I'm not positive I you

795
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:49,358
know I haven't researched it very much

796
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:53,079
but there's definitely something about

797
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:55,799
cuz like to me the rosin is kind of

798
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:57,960
spicy but not as spicy and I think maybe

799
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:02,519
it's cuz it's been processed and

800
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:04,838
squashed out um May it helps hold back

801
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:07,880
maybe some of that material that you're

802
00:36:04,838 --> 00:36:10,519
getting in there cuz like with Keith um

803
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:13,280
you still got you know the stocks and

804
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:15,400
others in there when you make keth it's

805
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,839
just it happens that's why I said your

806
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:23,880
ratio is about

807
00:36:16,838 --> 00:36:27,318
5050 for THC to the heath ratio so

808
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:29,680
um I think with rosin when you press it

809
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:32,519
that stuff gets trapped in the bag and

810
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:36,799
so you don't like to me rosin Edibles

811
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:41,719
taste more like rosin um then they and

812
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:44,359
hash then they do weed uh where ke to me

813
00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:46,838
doesn't taste like weed but it tastes

814
00:36:44,358 --> 00:36:49,078
spicy and like you said when you ate the

815
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:52,358
weed plant the top of the weed plant it

816
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:55,680
tastes spicy to you so I'm assuming

817
00:36:52,358 --> 00:36:59,199
maybe it's in the stock of

818
00:36:55,679 --> 00:37:00,639
the THC head you know like how you you

819
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:02,639
want to set the rate the head but you

820
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:04,799
have the stock so in my opinion maybe

821
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:07,759
that stock is what is

822
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,920
spicy that's cool I mean Kei is but

823
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,079
rosin

824
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:13,200
isn't probably another good prompt for

825
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:15,119
people to chime in in the comments if

826
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:18,439
you've if you've experienced this let us

827
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:20,119
know more data um yeah I find that

828
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,400
really

829
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:24,318
interesting and as far as the amount you

830
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,200
would put into that butter it would be

831
00:37:24,318 --> 00:37:28,960
on how much how strong do you want your

832
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:30,960
brown need to be and and and it will

833
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,920
once you melt it in there it'll disperse

834
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:37,199
evenly you just want to mix it in really

835
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:40,200
good um but it would depend on how

836
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:42,439
strong now I would do the math that I

837
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:45,960
have one gam of Keef and that's going to

838
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:49,079
be 500 mg of THC so let's say you're

839
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:52,960
doing a brownie batch most brownies have

840
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:56,680
nine in the pan if you want you know

841
00:37:52,960 --> 00:38:01,960
each brownie to have 500 mg well then

842
00:37:56,679 --> 00:38:05,199
you're going to have to add you know n g

843
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:07,039
of ke to that butter to make that browny

844
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:10,039
have that

845
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:12,599
much if I'm doing my math

846
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:15,480
correctly I'm sure you are better than

847
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:17,760
mine I'll take your work for

848
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:22,039
it I'm sure somebody will point it out

849
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,040
to me if I'm wrong definitely

850
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:27,960
definitely um those are all the

851
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:29,318
questions we've got but I because okay

852
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,519
by the time this episode comes out I

853
00:38:29,318 --> 00:38:33,039
think it's going to be January or

854
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:36,239
something but when we're recording this

855
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:38,519
it's the 20 well 21 no 19th for you guys

856
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:40,799
20th of December for me and probably

857
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:44,000
gonna be the last recorder for the year

858
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:47,280
I think Matt so I kind of wanted to take

859
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:51,400
the opportunity to ask uh peaches what

860
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:56,519
what she has in store for 2024 just for

861
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:58,280
fun um well uh I'm going Peach crazy

862
00:38:56,519 --> 00:39:01,358

863
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:03,960

864
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:05,799
know that was a big chase for you it was

865
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:08,159
it's been like five years now that I've

866
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:12,480
been actually searching and so finding

867
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:14,559
it is is pretty cool yeah I'm going to

868
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:19,240

869
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:23,639

870
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:27,959
um that I have some some plans that I

871
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:30,440
want to try and um and I'm hoping that

872
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:33,240
this year they I just got a message from

873
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:35,838

879
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:53,440
goes through and works out and um it'll

880
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,880
be all worth the while that I've spent

881
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,920
the last few years you cut out a little

882
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:02,358

it it was never challenging really

963
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:24,558
because of the students it was always

so that'll be uh another fun adventure

1003
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:01,440
maybe we could do a little episode on

1004
00:44:58,639 --> 00:45:04,440
whatever you end up uh updating as just

1005
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:06,200
even just a Roundup uh you know of of of

1006
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,519
the changes you've made or new

1007
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:11,480
information you've gotten I think also

1008
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:14,318
going through it like one by one on the

1009
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:15,519
screen with it on and like going through

1010
00:45:14,318 --> 00:45:17,079
and talking about things that maybe I

1011
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:18,800
don't even add on there because they're

1012
00:45:17,079 --> 00:45:20,000
too controversial but that I'd like to

1013
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,200
add you know things like that that would

1014
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,358
be fun yeah I think it' be cool even I

1015
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:26,598
could even see that being like a live

1016
00:45:24,358 --> 00:45:29,199
stream kind of vibe too uh oh yeah we

1017
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:31,000
wanted to yeah I have a I have a bad

1018
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:32,759
habit of like deleting my live streams

1019
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,800
after for whatever reason I just get I

1020
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:38,200
don't like what I do I don't like what I

1021
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:39,720
not yeah I I you know how I am with

1022
00:45:38,199 --> 00:45:41,318
editing myself like even when I'm

1023
00:45:39,719 --> 00:45:42,598
editing like there was a long period of

1024
00:45:41,318 --> 00:45:44,719
time where I just cut out everything I

1025
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:47,480
said just one of those

1026
00:45:44,719 --> 00:45:49,480
things I know the vibe I understand yeah

1027
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:51,519
I was actually gonna say that though

1028
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:53,318
even those uh Instagram lives that you

1029
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:54,838
do those would you could just slap those

1030
00:45:53,318 --> 00:45:56,400
on YouTube and you know people would

1031
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:59,719
probably enjoy just

1032
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:02,318
I [ __ ] hate myself on that stuff hey

1033
00:45:59,719 --> 00:46:04,838
now you can use streamyard for it too so

1034
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:06,039
that's right you know and uh yeah that's

1035
00:46:04,838 --> 00:46:08,880
that's a good point I should be using

1036
00:46:06,039 --> 00:46:14,400
streamyard for the live Fe shouldn't

1037
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:16,640
I anyway sorry like nextstage stuff um

1038
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:19,200

1039
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:21,239
