sneaky YouTube algorithm

this community thanks again from all of

19
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,340
us at the Breeders Syndicate family

20
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:52,378
welcome to breeder Syndicate 2.0 where

21
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,899
we explore the history of a clandestine

22
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:57,179
scene researching everything from

23
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,980
Cannabis string history old smuggling

24
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:01,198
Tales from the first person perspective

25
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:02,578
to breeding science and news on current

26
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:04,618
subculture

27
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,180
I'm your host Matthew and I'll

28
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:08,280
occasionally be joined by my homie not

29
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,320
so dog breeder and grower from Mendocino

30
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,840
to speak on these subjects and sometimes

31
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:14,519
interview other participants our goal is

32
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,200
to document this history before it's

33
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:17,459
written by corporations and others who

34
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,159
just weren't there

35
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:23,359
let's start writing some wrongs welcome

36
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,359
to the underground

37
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,159
one of the hard Parts is people

38
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:30,959
desperately want to hear real stuff

39
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,520
and then you're trying to figure out

40
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,079
like well what's not going to cause too

41
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:36,478
much controversy what's going to piss

42
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,280
people off but I just have gotten to the

43
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:39,179
point where I just say the truth is I

44
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,939
know it

45
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,280
and if you wanna if you wanna you know

46
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:46,679
Converse or argue with me politely about

47
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,379
it that's fine and I'm even willing to

48
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,360
be convinced you know

49
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:53,239
um I got a wife and four daughters so I

50
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:55,259
hear that I'm wrong a lot

51
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:57,419
one thing that we didn't talk about

52
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,920
either that we could talk about at some

53
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,299
point and I don't know if it ties into

54
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,960
something you don't want to talk about

55
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:05,640
magic but like what made you after like

56
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:08,939
three or four years of successful

57
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,459
growing in those Canyons stop sure

58
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:13,199
you know because like a lot of times

59
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:14,759
like in Mendo where I'm at like people

60
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:17,939
get bigger and bigger and bigger and

61
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:18,899
bigger until you know something stops

62
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:21,359
them

63
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,860
you know like whether it's whether it's

64
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,480
they get wealthy enough that they just

65
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,520
decide to go on and do something else or

66
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,318
they get pinched or they get divorced

67
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,879
and something blows up in their life or

68
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:31,259
whatever I didn't and there was stuff

69
00:02:29,878 --> 00:02:32,878
too when you were talking about going

70
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:34,500
and visiting the cartels where I had

71
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:35,519
like all kinds of questions but I was

72
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,098
like man

73
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,180
I don't know that's a delicate one to

74
00:02:38,098 --> 00:02:41,878
walk

75
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:45,300
you know so

76
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:47,639
um you know but yeah it it uh because

77
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,019
I've had a bunch of friends up here that

78
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:50,579
you know they get one property they get

79
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:52,439
two properties they get bigger they go

80
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,700
bigger this happens that happens and all

81
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:56,039
of a sudden

82
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:57,959
something changes and that part of their

83
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:01,079
life is done for a bit in that those

84
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:02,939
spots they left you know because the

85
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,560
neighbor got pissed off or the law

86
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:06,659
enforcement came in or something weird

87
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,979
happened and all of a sudden all that

88
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:09,419
infrastructure and all that time and

89
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,919
effort

90
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:12,958
um and then some people just you know

91
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:15,179
they just cashed out and were happy and

92
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,158
went on and did something different

93
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,439
you know like it fueled some next part

94
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:21,199
of their life or something you know

95
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,919
so

96
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:25,378
uh well

97
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:30,059
I I

98
00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:32,280
after the last year in Magic Canyon

99
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:36,539
and making a good amount of money that

100
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:41,158
year I bought a ranch that was way

101
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:43,199
beyond my means and I and my concept was

102
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:46,139
that after one year before one year

103
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:48,959
before the next payment came to I would

104
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:50,939
sell a piece of it and

105
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,180
it was an amazing Place had a year-round

106
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:57,719
River stream going through it

107
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,580
like five miles of Dead End Road that it

108
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:01,560
was at the end of it down in a canyon of

109
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,180
its own along the Mogan Rim it was

110
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:07,319
incredible not far from Zane gray

111
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:10,379
country and wow I

112
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:13,639
I didn't I wasn't able to sell a piece

113
00:04:10,378 --> 00:04:13,639
and I lost the whole thing

114
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:17,819
um it was it was like oh no and that's

115
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:20,639
when

116
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:24,659
I more or less got into the Mexican

117
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,199
import instead because my friend

118
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,259
um

119
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:31,680
that I the truck driver helicopter pilot

120
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:33,240
pilot pilot anything that moved he could

121
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,660
drive it

122
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:42,139
um fly it whatever he uh plugged us into

123
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:44,460
that whole area in Mexico and

124
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:47,519
interestingly enough the strip that we

125
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:48,959
used was you would drive by it to get to

126
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:52,560
this Ranch

127
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:55,620
it was six miles Beyond and so it was in

128
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,839
the same basic Zone in area

129
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:01,978
it was easy for me to

130
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:06,418
study and go investigate and look at it

131
00:05:01,978 --> 00:05:08,639
so we used it three times for weed and

132
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:10,139
then they started wanting to do the

133
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,579
other

134
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:16,680
white marching powder

135
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:19,859
the Disco powder and we weren't

136
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,540
interested and I lost touch with him and

137
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:24,240
I read about it in the news more or less

138
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:25,919
in later

139
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,360
because I wasn't in that area anymore I

140
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:28,680
didn't have that ranch

141
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,280
so

142
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:35,160
Ranch cost a half a million and I put 50

143
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:38,579
000 down and lost it

144
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,979
so so I decided to get into something

145
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:44,038
else that was a little easier seemed

146
00:05:40,978 --> 00:05:47,038
easier and it was it was for a few years

147
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:49,978
really quite nice

148
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:52,439
and when he when we walked away from him

149
00:05:49,978 --> 00:05:55,439
we simultaneously threw another friend

150
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:56,579
met a guy in Tucson area

151
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:00,660
who

152
00:05:56,579 --> 00:06:04,079
would front us anywhere from 175 to 250

153
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:05,580
pounds of Mexican sensimilla and that's

154
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:09,000
what we started sending to the

155
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:11,000
Rastafarians and in Brooklyn and that

156
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,819
was the that was the best of all because

157
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,519
we could never send them enough

158
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:20,099
whatever we could send them because the

159
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:22,859
the sources from Jamaica were very

160
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:25,199
difficult at that point in the early 80s

161
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:28,139
they had you know it wasn't like the

162
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,060
early days and they were using Jamaica

163
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:32,819
as a bounce from Colombia at that point

164
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,680
for cocaine so the the pilots and people

165
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:37,139
who came in there were not interested in

166
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,400
flying some weed from Jamaica up to uh

167
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:41,939
the U.S

168
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:44,038
and Florida was hot you know I mean

169
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:47,579
anything coming into Florida or that

170
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:51,800
direction was pretty much in trouble by

171
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:54,719
the early 80s or late or mid 80s

172
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:57,780
but one one thing I've definitely known

173
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,600
about about uh cannabis people is if you

174
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:02,339
consider like weed a casino

175
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,560
um you could you could make the score of

176
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:07,019
your life and you wake up and you're

177
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,379
like I should take all my money and put

178
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:13,019
it all into chips and go back at it you

179
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:14,879
know it's like it's very very common

180
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:16,879
with weed people where you're like this

181
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:19,139
was the most successful year of my life

182
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:22,439
I'm gonna throw it all on table again

183
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:24,840
I'm all in let's go you know yeah and

184
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:28,079
that works until it doesn't you know

185
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:31,739
yeah yeah that's very common in that

186
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:34,019
regard that risk risk-taking uh

187
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,699
is is definitely part of the game for

188
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:37,978
sure

189
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:39,900
I also don't think humans are very good

190
00:07:37,978 --> 00:07:42,000
at realizing that like this could be the

191
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:44,038
the best five years of my life they

192
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,500
think well this is my new floor

193
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:47,579
and it's only it's I'm on the way up

194
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,918
from here

195
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:51,538
not like this could be this could be a

196
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:53,579
high point and I could be I could be

197
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:54,538
downward sloping it pretty fast in the

198
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:56,639
next couple

199
00:07:54,538 --> 00:07:58,318
I just think that's part of human nature

200
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,639
we always think that like okay this is

201
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,340
my new floor

202
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:04,019
and and in some instances you look back

203
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:06,478
and you're like wow that was like really

204
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:08,879
a golden era for me like things were

205
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,620
great you know and I didn't I didn't

206
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,659
appreciate it quite as much as I should

207
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,780
have at the time that these but that's

208
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:17,699
like youth right like youth uh you know

209
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:19,799
youth you have all this exuberance and

210
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:21,360
very little experience

211
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,978
you know

212
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,780
um but in sometimes you know that's what

213
00:08:22,978 --> 00:08:26,159
you know youth youth makes you do a

214
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:28,559
bunch of [ __ ] that an older person would

215
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,819
be too conservative to do and you're

216
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,700
young and dumb and you're just like well

217
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:34,399
let's go for it this will be great you

218
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:37,560
know

219
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,719
so you guys ready to ready to light the

220
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:41,418
light the fuse on this thing yeah let's

221
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:44,278
do it

222
00:08:41,418 --> 00:08:46,139
in the first episode we briefly touched

223
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:48,838
on your introduction to cannabis your

224
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:50,699
first time getting high your first time

225
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:52,800
um kind of the strains that you were you

226
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:54,060
were seeing around that time uh I

227
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,919
believe they were a lot of Colombians

228
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:58,018
right yeah that was uh that was the

229
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:59,639
majority of what we smoked this was

230
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:00,720
bought off the street you know high

231
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:03,838
school kids

232
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,759
okay and from there let's talk a little

233
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,740
bit more into the how you got into a

234
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:10,200
more serious side of cannabis where you

235
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,180
started getting not just into you know

236
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,700
collecting a seed here or there from

237
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:16,979
this thing but kind of uh breeding and

238
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:20,339
being more serious about collecting

239
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:21,778
yeah well you know my first like we

240
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:23,700
talked about in the first episode I

241
00:09:21,778 --> 00:09:25,500
think my first time trying to pop seeds

242
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:27,480
didn't end too well

243
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,940
um came back the next year which I

244
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:33,120
believe would have been 1980

245
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:35,100
and uh that year we had I had a great

246
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,299
place to grow with a couple of buddies

247
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:40,560
of mine

248
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:43,079
um we had a collection of of what turned

249
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,939
out to be kill or see we had great

250
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,759
success by that time I'd had a lot of

251
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:50,100
time to research and read about

252
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:52,620
um you know research growing and prepare

253
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:55,980
for the season and basically I started

254
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:59,220
right off doing Hydroponics outdoors in

255
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:02,879
five gallon buckets with a medium which

256
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:07,639
was peat moss bagged cow [ __ ] perlite

257
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:10,799
and vermiculite using Eco grow dry

258
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:13,580
hydroponic nutrients where'd you get the

259
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:13,579
recipe for that

260
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:16,939
this was

261
00:10:21,778 --> 00:10:26,820
your husband's back then it was

262
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:30,120
basically between Dyna grow and and Eco

263
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:31,860
grow and Donna grow was the Slicker

264
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,600
looking ads

265
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,580
um I don't know why I picked Eco grow

266
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,120
really but

267
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:42,300
um it was a two-part two-part mix of

268
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,139
granular stuff and

269
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:46,139
um

270
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:48,360
you know I remember mixing up my my soil

271
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:51,360
mix in the backyard of my parents house

272
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:54,120
on a big plastic sheet you know breaking

273
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,980
down everything and just kind of lifting

274
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,759
up one side and another to make it roll

275
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:01,379
and Tumble and mix you know somewhere in

276
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,360
the house my parents were probably

277
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:05,159
watching me thinking what the hell are

278
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:09,060
we going to do about this kid you know

279
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:11,159
I'm sure but uh you know they never they

280
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:12,899
never stopped me I think they were just

281
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:16,500
kind of marveling at you know the

282
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:20,820
daringness of the whole thing and

283
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:23,759
um I don't know yeah but um so yeah that

284
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:25,980
that season we had uh we had a Mexican

285
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:28,980
we had

286
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:30,180
um we had that that Maui that I told you

287
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,560
about

288
00:11:30,179 --> 00:11:32,338
we had

289
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:36,479
um

290
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:38,700
a a red bud what I call Red Bud but

291
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:42,480
this was one of those rare times when

292
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:44,940
you kind of LeapFrog the the dude that

293
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,459
you've been buying weed from for a year

294
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:50,279
or so and you've gotten to know suddenly

295
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:51,549
lets you in on something at a at a

296
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:52,740
higher level you know

297
00:11:51,549 --> 00:11:55,799
[Music]

298
00:11:52,740 --> 00:12:00,839
um in this case the dude needed somebody

299
00:11:55,799 --> 00:12:02,759
to drive him to pick up a load and um I

300
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:05,040
guess all of his usual people weren't

301
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:07,679
available and or maybe he just needed

302
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:09,659
somebody that was that was disposable I

303
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:11,879
was under 18 so you know if we got

304
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:15,059
busted you know probably nothing was

305
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:19,439
going to happen soon too bad but uh he

306
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:22,500
had a he had a 1979 Smokey in the Bandit

307
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:26,760
black Trans Am

308
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:29,278
um the you know the 400 cubic inch big

309
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:32,519
block in there with the golden eagle on

310
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:34,759
the hood and this guy let me drive his

311
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,759
car

312
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:40,079
down down this these gravel roads into

313
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,700
the country you know it's just nothing

314
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:43,679
but Farms

315
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,940
I was like are there weed people out

316
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:47,039
here

317
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:49,440
you know we went down this kind of this

318
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:50,458
Gravel Road along the fence along a

319
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,100
fence line

320
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:56,399
and there was a farmhouse at the end of

321
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:58,139
the road and the guy um the guy said

322
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,419

00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:33,300
you know excited and uh we went back you

335
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,860
know he came in through something in the

336
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:37,859
back and off we went

337
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:41,159
turned out it was the you know it was

338
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:42,839
what we called Red Bud back then but it

339
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:45,179
could have been Colombian red it could

340
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:46,920
have been Panama Red I don't have I'll

341
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:51,000
never really know

342
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:52,860
these things these buds were fresh like

343
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,440
I was used to getting stuff that was

344
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:58,139
pressed into Bricks by a hydraulic press

345
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,880
you know that by the time you got it and

346
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:03,060
broke apart a you know went through a

347
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:06,899
quarter pound they were like ships yeah

348
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:09,239
um very dense you know seeds smashed and

349
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:11,458
um you know the leaves and flowers and

350
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,919
Stems all pressed together into

351
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:15,599
kind of when you broke it apart it you

352
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:18,899
couldn't really tell what it was but

353
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:22,920
this stuff it was loose it was

354
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:26,458
uncompressed and every single bud in the

355
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:28,679
in the in the in the in the bags was

356
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:31,559
like the tip of your finger about an

357
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:36,000
inch and a quarter inch and a half long

358
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:39,000
um spongy and it was dark dark red like

359
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:43,139
like blood that had dried but you know

360
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:46,078
like a scab almost color wow and yeah

361
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:47,940
and it was sticky right so they were

362
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:51,659
they were roundish like the tip of your

363
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:52,980
finger like I said dark dark red and man

364
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:55,379
this stuff

365
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:58,980
when you smoked it you know the effect

366
00:14:55,379 --> 00:15:01,259
was very sedative it was like

367
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:04,500
it was hashy

368
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:06,299
um and The Taste was you know dark like

369
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:09,360
dark wood

370
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:12,539
um and hash and

371
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,639
um just just fantastic you know it was

372
00:15:12,539 --> 00:15:16,319
looking like you would imagine if you

373
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,539
could smoke ebony

374
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,180
and I probably wouldn't recommend that

375
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:22,679
you know for kids

376
00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:25,679
but if you could you know it had that

377
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:28,138
dark wood like like uh like some sort of

378
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:30,239
charred Oak Barrel used for bourbon or

379
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:32,940
something yeah like mahogany

380
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:36,240
yeah mahogany exactly

381
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:40,199
it looked like it tasted like it is it

382
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:42,419
fermented at all do you think no no I

383
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:45,179
mean it was it was like fresh there was

384
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:48,539
no moldy no sort of

385
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:52,078
Funk to it at all it was

386
00:15:48,539 --> 00:15:56,819
um this [ __ ] had been had been allowed

387
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:59,059
to mature past Peak on the plant in a

388
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:01,379
place where weather wasn't wasn't

389
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:04,198
destroying the plants at the end of

390
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:07,799
Harvest Time right interesting

391
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:10,319
so and it must have been yeah it was

392
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:12,539
gorgeous stuff so we had that I found

393
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,540
seats in that he gave me he gave me like

394
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:18,360
a half ounce for being his wheel man

395
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:20,458
which I was like man I want to do that

396
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,560
every week you know I mean that was yeah

397
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:24,319
I never never got the chance to do that

398
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:28,018
again for him but um

399
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:31,980
you know it was I had we had that plan I

400
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:35,720
I I grew a few from those seeds I had a

401
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:35,720
Mexican I had

402
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:42,179
um so I guess if it was I was 17

403
00:16:39,179 --> 00:16:42,179
wow

404
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:47,458
and um

405
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,680
so I had like a collection of these

406
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:53,958
different things that we would all kill

407
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:53,958
for today oh yeah um

408
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:59,160
like that's that you don't even really

409
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:00,838
see pictures of that anymore in uh

410
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:02,819
magazines or anything like that nobody

411
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:05,699
not that I can think of

412
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:07,919
yeah yeah that sounds beautiful well

413
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:09,900
that Farmhouse that we went to you know

414
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,759
that's kind of the way stuff

415
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,740
I'm pretty sure it was some sort of

416
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:18,119
biker house

417
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:21,179
and um you know I'd been I I went to a

418
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:24,359
couple places that were either biker

419
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:26,579
places or actually famous people places

420
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:28,678
that I'm not gonna I can't really say

421
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:31,859
because it'll give away too much info

422
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:33,600
about you know who and where sure where

423
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:36,418
I was at but

424
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:38,639
you know it's funny you know like rock

425
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:40,980
and roll group type thing you know

426
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,679
houses associated with

427
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:46,019
with southern rock bands that

428
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,980
they smoked a lot of [ __ ] weed in the

429
00:17:46,019 --> 00:17:48,980
Smith and rock bands

430
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,620
so yeah

431
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:54,599
[Applause]

432
00:17:52,619 --> 00:17:57,359
yeah that season started off great you

433
00:17:54,599 --> 00:18:01,139
know I got them up to about about six

434
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:04,259
seven feet tall and a huge storm came

435
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:06,179
blowing through and that Redbud plant

436
00:18:04,259 --> 00:18:08,038
which I don't know he's got a picture of

437
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:09,419
it actually

438
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:11,099
um I don't know if you can put that up

439
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:13,320
or not but

440
00:18:11,099 --> 00:18:15,899
one of the things that was unique about

441
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:19,740
it first of all the weeds were very wide

442
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:23,460
for you know what we call a sativa

443
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:25,798
um you know highways highly serrated

444
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:28,860
and uh one of the distinctive things

445
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:33,418
about that plant was that the the nodes

446
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:36,719
on the on the plant were were zigzag you

447
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:38,820
know yeah so instead of instead of the

448
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,160
axles that where the petioles come off

449
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:44,399
the stem being symmetrical and coming

450
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:46,980
off in pairs of two you know yeah that

451
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,919
it would it started zigzagging very

452
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:52,140
early on and you know that leads to a

453
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:55,620
structure on the plant where the flowers

454
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:57,419
kind of Stack offset from each other as

455
00:18:55,619 --> 00:19:00,239
when it goes into flower and they fill

456
00:18:57,419 --> 00:19:03,900
in all the gaps it's but I see that

457
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,339
sometimes with ohaze today yeah see

458
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,660
plants that have that same kind of

459
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:09,298
zigzag

460
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:11,220
um you know branching pattern

461
00:19:09,298 --> 00:19:15,480
um no exactly what you're talking about

462
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:18,900
yeah get on so the storm hits and it

463
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:21,538
breaks it breaks that plant over right

464
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:23,640
at the base and of course today I'd be

465
00:19:21,538 --> 00:19:26,160
like well okay let's just make one jig

466
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,720
big giant clone at this thing yeah you

467
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,400
know I mean it would have been it would

468
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,160
have been a hundred clones off of that

469
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:34,259
plant you know but yeah me my me and my

470
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,679
teenage Partners were just like oh no

471
00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:41,460
you know it's dead Jim you know so we

472
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:43,559
were all we lost that one but we moved

473
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:45,960
we moved all these plants through the

474
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:48,418
woods five gallon you know seven seven

475
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,400
foot tall in five gallon buckets through

476
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:52,860
the woods a couple hundred yards to a

477
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,200
better spot I think we were afraid for

478
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:57,659
some security Scare at the same time so

479
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:01,380
the Thai plant went you know to the new

480
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:03,419
spot the the Hawaiian the Maui went to a

481
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,940
new spot the Mexican went to the new

482
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:07,220
spot

483
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:11,340
and um

484
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:13,679
yeah and so everything else we we grew

485
00:20:11,339 --> 00:20:15,418
to finish there were there were two of

486
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,240
the Thai plants

487
00:20:15,419 --> 00:20:20,340
and there's uh there's a picture that of

488
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,980
the one of the ties and this the picture

489
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:24,058
there is um what wound up being the

490
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,298
purple

491
00:20:24,058 --> 00:20:29,038
tie that we grew okay so um you know

492
00:20:27,298 --> 00:20:31,558
from uh from an appearance standpoint

493
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:33,000
people are really you'll you'll hear a

494
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:35,099
lot of people talking with great

495
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,980
certainty about you know well Thai

496
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:41,399
plants have you know wide highly

497
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:44,519
serrated leaves and it's often described

498
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:47,220
as being the alligator tail leash right

499
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:50,220
and uh that's true

500
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:52,919
and then there's also Thai plants which

501
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:56,220
are you know have extremely narrow

502
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:58,919
weaves and and have a completely

503
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:01,679
different kind of serration and other

504
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:03,538
distinctive Leaf traits which I

505
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,160
don't really like to talk about because

506
00:21:03,538 --> 00:21:07,859
it's kind of my clue to know whether

507
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:09,840
somebody has the real thing or not but

508
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:11,279
no you know stuff like that's important

509
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:13,379
to keep back and people don't realize

510
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:14,940
that like there's certain traits in in

511
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:18,240
certain lines that like you don't really

512
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:20,700
want to say openly because of people who

513
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,400
um you know manipulate [ __ ] like that so

514
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:25,140
yeah totally yeah you know when they do

515
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,419
uh when they do when they release

516
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:29,038
information about like uh this isn't my

517
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,780
wheelhouse it's more mats but when they

518
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:32,700
release information about like murders

519
00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:35,220
and stuff like that and they're looking

520
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:37,500
for they're looking for help they

521
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:40,319
actually put in details sometimes that

522
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:42,240
are slightly not correct so that they

523
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:44,700
can weed through the hundreds of tips

524
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,440
that they get when people are like oh

525
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,360
yeah this this and this and they're like

526
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:51,360
oh no that that was actually part of the

527
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:53,099
fake bit we put out you know

528
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:54,298
um because yeah people will as soon as

529
00:21:53,099 --> 00:21:56,819
you say it

530
00:21:54,298 --> 00:21:58,619
people will find it yep and they'll have

531
00:21:56,819 --> 00:22:00,178
stories about it so it's a real it's an

532
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:03,058
interesting part of like talking about

533
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:05,100
history or whatever is

534
00:22:03,058 --> 00:22:07,440
um are are those kind of little Keys

535
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:09,240
have you seen any good examples of a

536
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,320
broadleaf tie before

537
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:15,000
like a true like in its in its in nature

538
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:17,759
not just someone saying this is a tie

539
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,900
like an actual broadleaf tie absolutely

540
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:25,500
yeah in the um in the book by um

541
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:29,580
Lawrence cherniac yes um great books of

542
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:31,319
cannabis yep so I'm perfectly willing to

543
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:33,599
believe it you know all I know is I

544
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:35,819
bought the the first version of great

545
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:38,879
books of cannabis like just like volume

546
00:22:35,819 --> 00:22:42,298
one whatever that was and back in you

547
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:46,020
know early 80s and in that book there's

548
00:22:42,298 --> 00:22:48,779
a picture of of a patch a pack of Thai

549
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:52,339
wheat growing under some sort of canopy

550
00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:54,839
in the woods and uh they all have that

551
00:22:52,339 --> 00:22:57,899
wide leaf

552
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:59,759
um beautiful beautiful plants but uh

553
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,919
they're definitely wide Leaf you know

554
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:04,558
and so the tie that I was growing came

555
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,780
from sticks that one of my partners

556
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:10,918
older brother brought back home in a

557
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:13,798
ties in some Thai stick he got at

558
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:15,419
um University of Colorado Denver or

559
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:16,500
Boulder or wherever the hell he was

560
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:19,200
going and

561
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:22,500
Christmas time he came back home to be

562
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,960
with his parents and my my buddy found

563
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:27,960
his stash on a tray under his bed and

564
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,460
stole the seeds and we grew them we got

565
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,500
to smoke a little bit but you know he

566
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:33,960
was pretty stingy he was pretty stingy

567
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:36,119
with the stuff he had stolen I'm sure

568
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,159
I'm sure that's funny

569
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:40,979
yeah so it was more narrowly the stuff

570
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,840
that you guys grew yeah yeah and you

571
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:45,000
know like back to that point you know

572
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:47,158
about the uh information about

573
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,579
distinctive traits that you know

574
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:52,200
releasing it that and not so and I were

575
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:54,538
talking about it the other day and it's

576
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,480
like you know I as much as I want to

577
00:23:54,538 --> 00:24:00,419
share everything that I know I I what my

578
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:02,220
fear is that things things that you

579
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:04,919
don't I've never heard anybody else

580
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:07,079
talking about on forums

581
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:08,159
um that are you know unique Thai traits

582
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:10,980
that

583
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:13,320
that you know were very distinctive for

584
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:15,538
me back then you know I'm I'm just

585
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:17,099
afraid that if I say it then the next

586
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:20,519
thing you know there's going to be you

587
00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:22,798
know 10 guys on Instagram selling old

588
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:24,779
school Thai Air wounds and and they're

589
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:28,019
just gonna have this bullet points of

590
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:30,538
whatever I say here you know saying this

591
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:33,720
is what it is it's a legitimate fear you

592
00:24:30,538 --> 00:24:35,519
know and yeah you know I uh we we

593
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,740
definitely talk about that quite a bit

594
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:40,798
in fact it's one of the things that like

595
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:43,319
the entire second generation of like um

596
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:46,740
of like Amsterdam breeders

597
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:49,740
just decided to be absolutely completely

598
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:52,380
vague with lineage because they got so

599
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:55,200
tired of competitors stealing the exact

600
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:58,320
ad copy and being like well it's this

601
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,298
you know and so they got very secretive

602
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:02,579
on what it was and where it came from

603
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:05,940
and how to this and how to that and so

604
00:25:02,579 --> 00:25:07,439
we we see it now on IG even uh with

605
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:10,019
certain names of strains and different

606
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,100
things so it's it's kind of a catch-22

607
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:13,259
it's like you want to get the

608
00:25:11,099 --> 00:25:15,359
information out there but

609
00:25:13,259 --> 00:25:16,619
um it also feeds people that want to

610
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:18,359
fake stuff

611
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:20,879
yeah it definitely does and if you say

612
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:23,038
it on this show I can almost guarantee

613
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:26,520
that someone will have it up tomorrow

614
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:28,379
for sale somehow and they're in a little

615
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:30,960
like you said like little bullet points

616
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:33,360
it happens but you know on the other

617
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,519
side of it and you know this is what we

618
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:38,038
were talking about the other day is that

619
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:40,980
it's like well you know Thailand is just

620
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:45,298
reopened you know from for Regal

621
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:47,940
legal production and you know even even

622
00:25:45,298 --> 00:25:51,240
over there I mean there's just so much

623
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:52,580
happening right now that maybe if you

624
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:55,259
know the information

625
00:25:52,579 --> 00:25:57,240
that I have might be useful to somebody

626
00:25:55,259 --> 00:25:59,519
the next thing you know better

627
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,919
selections are made and the stuff

628
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:05,879
actually does become available I mean

629
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:07,679
it's it's it's a it's a bit of a it's a

630
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,539
bit of a conflict and I'm just going to

631
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,980
hold back on some of those details right

632
00:26:09,538 --> 00:26:13,319
now but

633
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:15,419
um you know that that particular we grew

634
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:18,200
two of those Thai plants one was Green

635
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:23,038
in flower the other was purple

636
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:24,298
and uh the purple one was just amazing

637
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:26,220
um you know what I'll just I'll go ahead

638
00:26:24,298 --> 00:26:29,759
and talk about the effects of Thai

639
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:31,860
please yes you know as opposed to you

640
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:35,278
know selection things that would be

641
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:37,459
helped people earlier on but you know

642
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:40,079
the effects of it

643
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:42,120
I sat down

644
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:44,819
I got in trouble in high school a lot

645
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:48,298
right mostly because because I didn't

646
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:50,879
give a crap about the school and I would

647
00:26:48,298 --> 00:26:53,639
come in every morning and you know get

648
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:57,299
get really high before school walk in

649
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:59,820
and then you know just kind of chill

650
00:26:57,298 --> 00:27:02,038
there until lunchtime after lunchtime

651
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:04,678
the buzz was wearing off I'd come back

652
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:06,658
and and fall asleep in the next class

653
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:07,919
right afterwards and

654
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:10,860
anyway

655
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,538
um you know all I really cared about was

656
00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:15,658
wheat I'd fallen in love with this plant

657
00:27:12,538 --> 00:27:19,500
it was my my first great love

658
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:20,700
um and and that's never really ended but

659
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:23,400
um

660
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:26,640
you know I I would sit there and I'd got

661
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:28,320
in trouble for like whatever absences or

662
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,059
whatever and get get in-school

663
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:32,759
suspension and of course that was a

664
00:27:30,058 --> 00:27:35,460
challenge to get really really high

665
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:36,960
because you're sitting there in in a

666
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:39,720
classroom with a bunch of other

667
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:43,019
delinquents and you know you're forced

668
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,640
to sit there and be silent right and

669
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:47,158
you're supposed to you're supposed to be

670
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,799
doing school work but I was already not

671
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:50,840
doing that so you know that wasn't gonna

672
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:52,918
change

673
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:54,899
so I uh

674
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:57,960
I basically would sit there and I

675
00:27:54,900 --> 00:28:00,538
started writing describing

676
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:03,360
um inspired by R right I would I would

677
00:28:00,538 --> 00:28:05,400
sit down and describe the effects of the

678
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:08,699
high that I was experiencing

679
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:11,700
and I I was describing that the effect

680
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:13,019
of the tie and I wrote like a page and a

681
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:15,419
half of it

682
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:17,220
and I still remember it even though this

683
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:19,080
other kid that was in class liked what

684
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:20,579
I'd written so much that he asked if he

685
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:23,579
could keep it so I don't have it anymore

686
00:28:20,579 --> 00:28:26,460
but I still remember it and basically

687
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:30,240
you know the effects of the time

688
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:33,840
were very different from Colombian of

689
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:36,359
the day or Mexican or even you know what

690
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:38,220
we you know what we know today is is the

691
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:41,699
haze High

692
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:44,400
um in that it was it was totally

693
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:46,080
introspective

694
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,778
right

695
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:50,699
um you know hey Hayes and Colombians can

696
00:28:48,778 --> 00:28:51,900
make you feel connected with things

697
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:55,620
around you

698
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:57,900
sure but the Thai weed was totally

699
00:28:55,619 --> 00:28:59,899
introspective instead of being connected

700
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:02,519
with things around you other people

701
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:05,700
nature whatever it was all in the head

702
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:08,220
and it was all and and I it felt like

703
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:11,400
waves right where

704
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:14,460
and your thoughts were kind of going

705
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:17,400
from you know smoothly connecting from

706
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:20,579
one thought to another kind of you know

707
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:23,640
ebbing and flowing as as you as you kind

708
00:29:20,579 --> 00:29:26,579
of go through these musings of of

709
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,980
different things inside your head and it

710
00:29:26,579 --> 00:29:32,158
was yeah in that way very very different

711
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:34,740
from from the Colombian that we you know

712
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,419
was our normal thing would you would you

713
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:39,120
say that it would lead you closer to

714
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:41,340
paranoia because it was so introspective

715
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:46,079
like an ego Crusher or would you say it

716
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:49,918
was more freeing and it was it was

717
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:52,678
luxurious it was uh it was smooth like

718
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:55,679
like a tide you know coming and going it

719
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:59,640
was it was not it didn't have that that

720
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:02,640
electrically charged anxiety that you

721
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:06,659
can feel sometimes with um with you know

722
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:09,659
a particular particular phenos of haze

723
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:12,179
um it was it was very much

724
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:14,278
kind of um you know had a bit of a

725
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:16,980
dreamy aspect but you were very very

726
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:19,140
awake

727
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:22,220
um would you associate the clear-headed

728
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:25,140
high that you described with uh Tai

729
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:28,500
yeah yeah absolutely I've never had the

730
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:29,220
same experience with anything else

731
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,038
um

732
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:33,720
you know Haze is very different you know

733
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:36,538
it's uh

734
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,579
it's very very different that leads me

735
00:30:36,538 --> 00:30:42,538
to a thought

736
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:45,000
um maybe raho you and and and Mad Jack

737
00:30:42,538 --> 00:30:47,398
could talk like when you guys were all

738
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,579
consuming this stuff uh you know

739
00:30:47,398 --> 00:30:52,678
basically pure and like not not all

740
00:30:50,579 --> 00:30:54,960
mixed together like we got it way later

741
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:57,480
or like hints of it

742
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,460
um what you know we you just touched on

743
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,200
it a little bit but like what were the

744
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:03,600
big differences you noticed between like

745
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,519
say smoking Pure Mexican pure Thai and

746
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:07,678
pure Colombian you kind of just talked

747
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,960
about that a little bit in terms of Thai

748
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:12,480
versus Colombian but

749
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,038
um what you know you know were there

750
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,440
other distinct differences you guys

751
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:18,778
noticed in the highs did you have

752
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:21,120
preferences of what you really liked one

753
00:31:18,778 --> 00:31:22,980
versus the other because was it

754
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:26,278
consistent or did it just vary from

755
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:28,440
plant to plant a bit

756
00:31:26,278 --> 00:31:30,839
uh let me

757
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,640
magic let me just uh keep going on this

758
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:34,859
for just a second because I don't have

759
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,919
much to say about Mexican it was kind of

760
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:42,079
a rare rare thing where we were and um

761
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:42,080
you know when it showed up it was unique

762
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,038
you know it didn't have the sedative

763
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:49,679
um kind of knock it knocked down power

764
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:54,058
of the Colombian it was it was light

765
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:56,220
uplifting tasted great energetic but but

766
00:31:54,058 --> 00:31:59,038
you know it didn't have the depth of

767
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:01,440
effect it seemed a little superficial to

768
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:03,480
me and this was very limited experience

769
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:06,240
that I had with it so you know I'm just

770
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:08,220
not an expert on Mexicans

771
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,859
um I grew it grew some of the seeds from

772
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:13,380
it they matured way early compared to

773
00:32:10,859 --> 00:32:15,778
the Colombians so much so that I

774
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:19,140
actually let the stuff go over mature

775
00:32:15,778 --> 00:32:22,319
past Peak you know resin uh development

776
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:24,720
and you know I'm pretty sure that I lost

777
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:26,278
some potency off of letting it go too

778
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,620
long but

779
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:31,919
um you know the

780
00:32:28,619 --> 00:32:34,139
the tie was just special it was so

781
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:37,220
special that you know I only sold like

782
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:40,740
one bag of it the guy that I sold it to

783
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:43,558
you know wanted more immediately and I

784
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:46,019
guarantee if we could find him right now

785
00:32:43,558 --> 00:32:48,778
he would still tell you that he

786
00:32:46,019 --> 00:32:50,819
remembered that smoke and it was maybe

787
00:32:48,778 --> 00:32:52,980
the best weed he'd ever smoked in his

788
00:32:50,819 --> 00:32:54,538
life you know I mean it was that that

789
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:56,099
unique

790
00:32:54,538 --> 00:32:58,798
um you know the Colombian were lucky

791
00:32:56,099 --> 00:33:01,619
today because we have so much good

792
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:04,500
example you know so much of what was

793
00:33:01,619 --> 00:33:07,079
available in the Colombian you know in

794
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:10,079
the breadth of Colombian weed back in

795
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:13,740
the day it's been captured somewhere in

796
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:15,538
the Hayes genome and accessible through

797
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:17,000
so anybody who's willing to put in the

798
00:33:15,538 --> 00:33:20,819
work

799
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,940
that's that's that's it for me

800
00:33:20,819 --> 00:33:26,720
where you got mad Jack as far as your uh

801
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:28,798
High experiences between Thai Mexican

802
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,240
Hawaiian even

803
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:33,240
um things that have acclimated to Hawaii

804
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,240
Colombia

805
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:39,898
well I would say that rahu he's

806
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:42,359
summarized it pretty well uh Colombians

807
00:33:39,898 --> 00:33:44,278
when they showed up they were just so

808
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:46,439
overwhelming

809
00:33:44,278 --> 00:33:49,859
some of them were so overwhelming couch

810
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:52,798
luck that you hear stories in my friend

811
00:33:49,859 --> 00:33:55,379
from Colombia had this weed that was

812
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:57,960
truly wacky weed I don't know who first

813
00:33:55,380 --> 00:34:02,220
wrote about that I think it was R who

814
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:02,220
who discussed it and

815
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:08,039
people

816
00:34:05,398 --> 00:34:10,378
you know would fall down stairs they

817
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:11,940
would throw up they would their sense of

818
00:34:10,378 --> 00:34:14,039
balance would go off so bad that they

819
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:16,260
would you know fall down and

820
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:18,898
Mexican was not like that Mexican was

821
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:21,720
more all the ones I smoked even the ones

822
00:34:18,898 --> 00:34:24,299
that were really strong were still like

823
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:27,178
social and uplifting

824
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:29,399
um I didn't smoke like my friends who

825
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:31,320
you know would roll hash joints all all

826
00:34:29,398 --> 00:34:34,799
day and smoke them

827
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:36,480
they had a different level of

828
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,119
of on

829
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:41,878
well they're they're

830
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,019
they needed textures like myself that

831
00:34:41,878 --> 00:34:45,960
were

832
00:34:43,019 --> 00:34:47,639
would smoke once or twice a day and yeah

833
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:50,579
so

834
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:52,740
I don't know it was some of those early

835
00:34:50,579 --> 00:34:55,319
Colombian Mexicans that my friend who

836
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:58,319
was the dealer in Tempe got were just

837
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:00,300
outstanding and when people tried them

838
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,220
you were talking about Green weed

839
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:05,280
earlier rahu was

840
00:35:02,219 --> 00:35:07,980
um or maybe it was not so but you know

841
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,320
once they saw it and tried it it was

842
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:12,559
they didn't care the color but most

843
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:16,740
people were used to the compressed

844
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:19,619
brickweed Brown weeds and even lots of

845
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:22,019
seeds but this once it's switched over

846
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:24,838
to the seedless sensimilla coming over

847
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:28,380
from Mexico Michoacan particularly

848
00:35:24,838 --> 00:35:30,480
oaxacan and Guerin those three

849
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:33,240
zones were

850
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,440
um each one was different the the smoke

851
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:36,899
was different but they were all

852
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:39,539
uplifting not that they couldn't

853
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:42,838
paralyze you because sativas can

854
00:35:39,539 --> 00:35:44,759
be get on the racy side and and I know

855
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:47,099
what you're talking about the paranoia I

856
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,140
don't know if I was paranoid or just um

857
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:51,260
actually knew someone was after me you

858
00:35:49,139 --> 00:35:51,259
know

859
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:56,338
that's very possible too I went through

860
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:58,260
that I went through that a few times

861
00:35:56,338 --> 00:36:01,380
with smoking

862
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:04,680
um Thai weed I don't remember I it was a

863
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:06,180
small window of period that I even saw

864
00:36:04,679 --> 00:36:09,659
Thai wheat on the market or people

865
00:36:06,179 --> 00:36:14,098
selling it like 69 to

866
00:36:09,659 --> 00:36:16,319
maybe 74. and that was it never saw it

867
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:19,859
again myself I've heard stories about it

868
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,780
but never saw it and it was yeah it was

869
00:36:19,858 --> 00:36:23,098
the head of all the other sativas when

870
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:25,320
it hit

871
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:27,599
there's there's a bunch of articles in

872
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:29,460
Old High Times that our rights about and

873
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,400
it's talking about like The

874
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:34,139
Disappearance you you can almost like

875
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,820
document like the years The

876
00:36:34,139 --> 00:36:37,980
Disappearance of Colombia for a little

877
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:40,740
bit The Disappearance of Thai for a

878
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:42,119
while the Resurgence of it it's so

879
00:36:40,739 --> 00:36:44,459
fascinating there's so much you can

880
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:46,619
learn just by reading just his articles

881
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:49,619
in high times during those years

882
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:52,680
have you um taken the time to

883
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:55,740
scan those articles and we could comp

884
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:58,919
compile just an r book

885
00:36:55,739 --> 00:37:02,399
which I did you did I did I have every

886
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:03,780
single one yeah from from when did he

887
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:07,500
stop

888
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:09,720
S I think 84.85 is the last step I see

889
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:11,780
from our yeah and I think about 85 he

890
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:15,000
bounced from high times and then

891
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:17,099
continuing his career writing about

892
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,920
um Adolf Hitler like the history of

893
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:22,440
Adolf Hitler and Nazis

894
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:25,139
um and he had a lot of very extreme

895
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:28,320
opinions uh political opinions but not

896
00:37:25,139 --> 00:37:30,000
not necessarily like he wasn't an

897
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,680
extremist by any stretch of the

898
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,760
imagination but he quit writing about

899
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:37,500
weed and um he's still very well known

900
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,480
um I would love to hear from him

901
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:41,940
sometimes since he's still with us on

902
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:44,820
this side of the the shadow realm you

903
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:47,400
know we'll see one thing I think is

904
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:49,619
curious I heard it from both raho and

905
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:53,039
magag is that

906
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:55,680
um because in modern times uh so I want

907
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:58,759
to follow up on it just real quick

908
00:37:55,679 --> 00:38:02,279
um in modern times we kind of consider

909
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:05,220
sativa to be you know thin leafed

910
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:07,500
uplifting paranoia trippy it has these

911
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:08,879
various effects but you guys were both

912
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:12,480
mentioning that there was some pure

913
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:15,780
sativas that were couch locking

914
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,760
uh and I would say like modern lead

915
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:20,640
people today

916
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,500
um everybody thinks that if if you get

917
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:24,059
couch locked it's the Indica something

918
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:26,338
coming through

919
00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:29,699
right like people don't associate couch

920
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:32,460
lock at all with any kind of peer sativa

921
00:38:29,699 --> 00:38:35,159
but I just heard both raho and you

922
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:38,460
mention that some of the peer sativas

923
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:41,159
you smoked kind of were like you know

924
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:43,260
couch lock however they were the

925
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:44,539
Colombian sativist to me

926
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:47,760
um Mexican

927
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:49,559
sativas were very powerful but you you

928
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:52,140
still wanted to go do something go

929
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:53,578
hiking go climbing you know go bowling

930
00:38:52,139 --> 00:38:54,779
even

931
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:57,780
um

932
00:38:54,780 --> 00:39:00,480
but Colombians the couch locking

933
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:02,940
Colombians were just so overwhelmingly

934
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,358
powerful and they were pure sativa I've

935
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:08,400
heard people talk about Colombian

936
00:39:05,358 --> 00:39:11,519
indicas and I don't I don't think that's

937
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:16,139
correct unless they were introduced you

938
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:18,960
know to Colombia yeah where genetics

939
00:39:16,139 --> 00:39:23,400
have spread it's possible but not native

940
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:27,000
to the jungles no no no no and I also

941
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:30,440
think there's a there's a part of me

942
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:33,539
oh go ahead Rahul go ahead

943
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:37,079
I was gonna comment on the the couch

944
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:39,838
lock and uh and the Indica from Colombia

945
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:41,640
the idea of indica and Colombia so I

946
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:44,519
mean you know the couch like piece of it

947
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:46,440
it's it must be you know it's just so

948
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:50,759
hard to get a Colombian to reach

949
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:53,400
maturity in in outdoors in the kind of

950
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,599
you know latitudes that most of us live

951
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,480
in

952
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:59,700
um you know part of it may be that it's

953
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:03,320
we just never really get there to the

954
00:39:59,699 --> 00:40:07,078
point where those those uh those those

955
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:09,180
effects that come you know come out but

956
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:13,200
um also Colombia you know as a country

957
00:40:09,179 --> 00:40:16,618
it's just got such a diverse kind of

958
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:19,919
um breadth of of different kinds of meat

959
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:21,180
and you know from you know from the from

960
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,420
the gold

961
00:40:21,179 --> 00:40:26,940
up of Santa Marta

962
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:31,139
it's interesting that you know people

963
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:34,019
talk about Indica in in Colombia because

964
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:36,719
Santa Monica oh you know the

965
00:40:34,019 --> 00:40:40,920
the times that I had

966
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:43,439
it was you know legit from Florida from

967
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:45,119
my one of my buddies deadhead sisters

968
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,559
and

969
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:49,500
um

970
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:52,320
you know this stuff was fresh it was it

971
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:56,699
was chips so it was pressed but it was

972
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:59,220
bright bright yellow gold and and you

973
00:40:56,699 --> 00:41:00,779
know it was it was moist

974
00:40:59,219 --> 00:41:02,879
uh you know the moisture level

975
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:04,440
throughout this stuff was very

976
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,260
consistent

977
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,940
um you could see the calyx's large bone

978
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:10,800
calyxes

979
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:12,480
um kind of throughout these these little

980
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,579
chips of gold

981
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,858
and um

982
00:41:14,579 --> 00:41:19,320
you know there's gold and a little bit

983
00:41:16,858 --> 00:41:22,098
of green in there and when we smoked it

984
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:25,019
The Taste was

985
00:41:22,099 --> 00:41:27,300
you know it had a lot in common with

986
00:41:25,019 --> 00:41:29,280
with what we think of as Indica today

987
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:31,140
you know it had that same kind of

988
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:34,800
hashiness

989
00:41:31,139 --> 00:41:36,480
um it had some Citrus elements to it but

990
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,000
there was there was also something that

991
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:43,380
you just don't really find in in indicas

992
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:47,400
and it was a sandalwood taste in there

993
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:49,680
um which was was unique right and so but

994
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:52,680
it's funny that there was so much in

995
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:54,598
common with Indica you know coming out

996
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:56,159
of that gold

997
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:59,900
um while being you know probably

998
00:41:56,159 --> 00:41:59,899
something completely different I don't

999
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:04,740
I'm not sure I understand that at some

1000
00:42:03,179 --> 00:42:07,739
point there was some pharmaceutical

1001
00:42:04,739 --> 00:42:09,838
company that was growing you know took

1002
00:42:07,739 --> 00:42:11,699
genetics down to Colombia and did some

1003
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:14,400
work down there I I don't remember the

1004
00:42:11,699 --> 00:42:16,379
details of it but I'm not throwing out a

1005
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:19,260
theory that that had anything to do with

1006
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:21,780
Samara gold or anything but

1007
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:23,820
um just just what I smoked it yeah the

1008
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:26,099
biggest issue I would have with indicas

1009
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:29,640
making their way down to Colombia is

1010
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:32,280
that they would just flower at like you

1011
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:33,719
know at Shin height or something and you

1012
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:35,640
know you really have to breed them

1013
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:38,279
heavily into the native stuff because

1014
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:41,159
you know it's it's Colombian is

1015
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:43,920
basically equatorial uh the equator runs

1016
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:45,719
right through Colombia and so

1017
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,940
um you know if you put out pure Indica

1018
00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:50,459
there they would literally flower

1019
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:52,440
instantly uh within a matter of days

1020
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:54,240
they would start putting on it they

1021
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,858
would start putting on stuff I just

1022
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:57,598
think it's interesting that like we've

1023
00:42:55,858 --> 00:43:01,380
accepted

1024
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:03,838
um that wide Leaf is always means that

1025
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:07,140
there's Indica Heritage thin Leaf always

1026
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:09,539
leans towards sativa sativas have this

1027
00:43:07,139 --> 00:43:11,699
certain set of highs

1028
00:43:09,539 --> 00:43:14,460
right and then indicas have this other

1029
00:43:11,699 --> 00:43:16,199
set of highs and the two don't overlap

1030
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:18,599
and basically what you guys are talking

1031
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:21,779
about right now is that there's a range

1032
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:24,420
of leaf width and there's a range of

1033
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:26,480
highs that maybe they do overlap some

1034
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:29,280
more than people thought

1035
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,659
right yeah

1036
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,060
yeah

1037
00:43:30,659 --> 00:43:34,440
you know my experience with Mexicans was

1038
00:43:33,059 --> 00:43:35,818
that they were

1039
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:38,579
um

1040
00:43:35,818 --> 00:43:41,818
and that the duration of the effect you

1041
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:43,740
know was uplifting it was it was happy

1042
00:43:41,818 --> 00:43:46,259
um it was it was head rushy but the

1043
00:43:43,739 --> 00:43:49,618
duration of the effect was not that long

1044
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:51,420
in Columbia was

1045
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:52,980
um

1046
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:55,500
your audio is clipping a little bit

1047
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:57,740
buddy okay

1048
00:43:55,500 --> 00:44:00,539
the duration of which was sorry

1049
00:43:57,739 --> 00:44:04,799
it's better now yes the duration of the

1050
00:44:00,539 --> 00:44:08,699
the duration of the max was was not as

1051
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:10,740
not as long and uh it was head rushy

1052
00:44:08,699 --> 00:44:11,699
um you know uplifting you know positive

1053
00:44:10,739 --> 00:44:13,799
but

1054
00:44:11,699 --> 00:44:16,199
but nowhere near didn't last anywhere

1055
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:18,000
near as long as the Colombians um and

1056
00:44:16,199 --> 00:44:19,139
the Colombians were more of a kind of

1057
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,300
zonked

1058
00:44:19,139 --> 00:44:23,519
part of that part of that you know the

1059
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:25,800
commercial stuff was probably because of

1060
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:28,980
processing handling just the degradation

1061
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:31,740
of the cannabinoids to CBN and stuff

1062
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:33,800
like that but

1063
00:44:31,739 --> 00:44:33,799
um

1064
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:37,740
when you know when you talk about

1065
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:40,740
sativas being

1066
00:44:37,739 --> 00:44:43,259
trippy that's that's kind of a pet peeve

1067
00:44:40,739 --> 00:44:46,318
for me because it's it's such a vague

1068
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:47,880
term to say trippy

1069
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:49,980
um it's almost to the point of being

1070
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:53,579
meaningless you know I mean

1071
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:56,699
I'm not an expert on on trip tripping

1072
00:44:53,579 --> 00:44:58,260
but you know the uh it seems like people

1073
00:44:56,699 --> 00:45:00,299
could be a little better about

1074
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:02,220
describing the effects than saying

1075
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:06,900
trippy

1076
00:45:02,219 --> 00:45:08,358
it's a bit of a pet peeve for me I uh I

1077
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:11,099
think that um

1078
00:45:08,358 --> 00:45:14,279
you know I think the language around

1079
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:15,900
highs uh is individual and I think a lot

1080
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:19,079
of times people think whatever happens

1081
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:20,880
to them is what the weed does

1082
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:23,339
and it's it's always been interesting to

1083
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:25,559
me that some people it's a lot easier

1084
00:45:23,338 --> 00:45:28,078
for them to smoke weed and trigger a

1085
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:30,420
paranoia experience where other people

1086
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:32,339
can smoke that same cannabis and not

1087
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:34,318
feel that at all they're just like warm

1088
00:45:32,338 --> 00:45:36,779
and happy and energetic and they feel

1089
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:38,759
great and the other person that smoked

1090
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:40,980
the same joint is like ready to crawl

1091
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,960
out their skin and maybe needs an

1092
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:44,400
intervention from their friend you know

1093
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,199
so

1094
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,300
um I think like how it interacts with

1095
00:45:46,199 --> 00:45:50,219
our bodies isn't as understood as we

1096
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:52,560
would like you know and we think it's

1097
00:45:50,219 --> 00:45:54,179
monolithic like you know this weed does

1098
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:55,920
this to these people

1099
00:45:54,179 --> 00:45:58,199
but it's not always the case I don't

1100
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:01,260
think you know

1101
00:45:58,199 --> 00:46:03,059
I also wanted to mention something

1102
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:05,819
um when we talk about Colombian or we

1103
00:46:03,059 --> 00:46:07,559
talk about Panama we talk about Thai or

1104
00:46:05,818 --> 00:46:09,420
whatever one of the things that gets

1105
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:11,460
talked about with Colombian a lot is

1106
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:13,318
Colombia is pretty mountainous

1107
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:15,300
and so they talk about lowland

1108
00:46:13,318 --> 00:46:17,759
Colombians that are grown in the valleys

1109
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:19,680
and stuff and then Highland Colombians

1110
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,480
that were grown like way more up in the

1111
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:23,159
mountain valleys or even on ridges and

1112
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:25,139
things like that where the elevation was

1113
00:46:23,159 --> 00:46:26,940
much different

1114
00:46:25,139 --> 00:46:28,858
um and those two things seem to grow

1115
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:30,838
quite a bit differently and probably

1116
00:46:28,858 --> 00:46:32,759
have different highs too

1117
00:46:30,838 --> 00:46:35,059
you know because their climates are so

1118
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,060
much different

1119
00:46:35,639 --> 00:46:41,879
yeah Mad Jack and I have uh have a

1120
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:45,119
friend who's kind of an expert in the in

1121
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:49,440
the variation within you know the

1122
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:54,420
Colombian family of of of plants from

1123
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:58,139
effect to taste smell Terps you know

1124
00:46:54,420 --> 00:47:00,539
um just this guy can go through and run

1125
00:46:58,139 --> 00:47:04,920
through a Fino hunt on a line and and

1126
00:47:00,539 --> 00:47:08,880
just basically uh page types or you know

1127
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:11,400
um Punta Roja or you know various and

1128
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:13,740
just basically slice it and dice it out

1129
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,480
into different different

1130
00:47:13,739 --> 00:47:18,419
um

1131
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:21,719
completely different Colombian types wow

1132
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:23,119
I I don't have that that level of

1133
00:47:21,719 --> 00:47:26,519
you know

1134
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:28,380
detail you'd have to run way more plants

1135
00:47:26,519 --> 00:47:31,259
than I ever did to be able to do that

1136
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:33,000
and I guess this guy is just he's really

1137
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:34,980
passionate about it

1138
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,079
um High one low and you know it's like

1139
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:40,858
geez Man by the time it got here nobody

1140
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:42,839
really knows where it came from sure I

1141
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:44,480
always always get a little irked about

1142
00:47:42,838 --> 00:47:47,219
that because it just seems like

1143
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:49,139
marketing talk more than more than the

1144
00:47:47,219 --> 00:47:51,559
reality of what happened where the

1145
00:47:49,139 --> 00:47:55,318
farmer did his work you know

1146
00:47:51,559 --> 00:47:57,480
I I I think that I think certainly like

1147
00:47:55,318 --> 00:47:59,639
not knowing where it came from is true I

1148
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:01,260
mean I talked before on one of our

1149
00:47:59,639 --> 00:48:04,318
previous episodes about you guys are

1150
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:06,240
talking about oaxacan and and guerreran

1151
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:08,639
and Michoacan and the differences and

1152
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:10,500
when I was getting Mexican in high

1153
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:11,519
school by then it was just straight

1154
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:13,139
Mexican

1155
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:15,179
you aren't getting any Regional

1156
00:48:13,139 --> 00:48:15,960
information it was there was green and

1157
00:48:15,179 --> 00:48:18,059
brown

1158
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:20,400
and you were hoping to get the Lesser

1159
00:48:18,059 --> 00:48:23,099
compressed stuff that was green that was

1160
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:25,559
that was your goal if you could but as

1161
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:27,180
far as like where it came from by the

1162
00:48:25,559 --> 00:48:28,980
time the 90s were around and I was

1163
00:48:27,179 --> 00:48:30,899
smoking it you had no idea

1164
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:32,519
that your dealer didn't know their

1165
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:34,500
dealer didn't know I don't know how high

1166
00:48:32,519 --> 00:48:37,858
up the chain you'd have to go before

1167
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:39,539
someone had an idea of origin but it

1168
00:48:37,858 --> 00:48:41,699
just said

1169
00:48:39,539 --> 00:48:43,800
I think that's all Mad Jack's fault for

1170
00:48:41,699 --> 00:48:45,500
giving those two kilos a seat to the

1171
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:48,240
cart fell

1172
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:50,579
yeah well I mean you know even if they I

1173
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:53,279
just don't I mean maybe people knew but

1174
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:54,839
it wasn't trickling down to 16 or 17 or

1175
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,359
18 year old me

1176
00:48:54,838 --> 00:48:59,338
you know right right there was too many

1177
00:48:57,358 --> 00:49:01,019
layers in between yeah there's still

1178
00:48:59,338 --> 00:49:02,940
there's maps that they have nowadays

1179
00:49:01,019 --> 00:49:04,559
that talk about which cartels are going

1180
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:06,358
which routes and we're going into which

1181
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:09,119
things but I think that's like the best

1182
00:49:06,358 --> 00:49:11,880
idea we can grab from anywhere right now

1183
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:14,400
because I I agree even even you know I

1184
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:16,079
came in 10 years after not so and it was

1185
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,720
the same experience like you have

1186
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:21,240
Mexican and you have Mexican and you

1187
00:49:18,719 --> 00:49:23,219
have like Mexican that's not as

1188
00:49:21,239 --> 00:49:24,779
compressed and sometimes honestly the

1189
00:49:23,219 --> 00:49:26,879
stuff that wasn't as compressed wasn't

1190
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:28,800
as good as the stuff that was compressed

1191
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:31,140
for me and it always looked way better

1192
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,380
and smelled way better and it never

1193
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:37,259
really had the same kind of high

1194
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:39,539
so there's like good old big Mexican and

1195
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:42,680
big old good Mexican

1196
00:49:39,539 --> 00:49:42,679
yeah right

1197
00:49:44,639 --> 00:49:49,078
yeah I I actually speaking of of them I

1198
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:51,140
actually just read this thing yesterday

1199
00:49:49,079 --> 00:49:53,400
you guys where they were talking about

1200
00:49:51,139 --> 00:49:54,598
the uh I don't know what they they have

1201
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,400
some nickname for them that I don't

1202
00:49:54,599 --> 00:49:58,740
remember but they were calling the like

1203
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:02,039
the kids of El Chapo

1204
00:49:58,739 --> 00:50:03,779
and how they've realized that like if

1205
00:50:02,039 --> 00:50:06,539
they want Mexican to be considered

1206
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:08,700
world-class weed they need to reinvent

1207
00:50:06,539 --> 00:50:10,199
it again and so it sounds like they're

1208
00:50:08,699 --> 00:50:11,939
doing something similar where they're

1209
00:50:10,199 --> 00:50:13,618
Gathering up genetics from all over the

1210
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:16,200
place because they have money in space

1211
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:18,059
and time and they're trying to reinvent

1212
00:50:16,199 --> 00:50:20,519
things figuring that it's going to go

1213
00:50:18,059 --> 00:50:23,699
legal before too too long and they want

1214
00:50:20,519 --> 00:50:24,719
to be at the Forefront at it so it

1215
00:50:23,699 --> 00:50:26,639
sounds like there's some pretty

1216
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:29,338
extensive breeding projects and they

1217
00:50:26,639 --> 00:50:31,139
have an interest in it of taking it from

1218
00:50:29,338 --> 00:50:33,059
like your traditional good old Mexican

1219
00:50:31,139 --> 00:50:34,019
and like Reinventing it for the modern

1220
00:50:33,059 --> 00:50:36,960
Market

1221
00:50:34,019 --> 00:50:39,119
I mean they've got the longest uh time

1222
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,679
in this vid or some of the longest time

1223
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,700
in this business so it makes sense that

1224
00:50:40,679 --> 00:50:43,919
they'd want to keep their business

1225
00:50:41,699 --> 00:50:46,799
control you know what I mean like

1226
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:48,659
this is their their stake

1227
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,460
I mean it's a good climate

1228
00:50:48,659 --> 00:50:52,440
they have their own challenges down

1229
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:54,480
there just like Thailand does and just

1230
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:57,119
like we do in the states and that you

1231
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:59,480
know the the impact of the War on Drugs

1232
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:01,980
uh has just

1233
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:05,159
deployed it you know it's just caused

1234
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:06,780
the massive loss of of so much heirloom

1235
00:51:05,159 --> 00:51:08,818
genetics

1236
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:11,160
um but the the positive thing is that

1237
00:51:08,818 --> 00:51:13,139
you know as as they're reopening just

1238
00:51:11,159 --> 00:51:14,940
like in Thailand they're going to be

1239
00:51:13,139 --> 00:51:16,558
pockets of people who have kept this

1240
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:18,780
stuff alive that are going to kind of

1241
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:22,319
pop up from their from their holes and

1242
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:24,900
and uh and start doing the work again I

1243
00:51:22,318 --> 00:51:28,500
mean I know Jackie and I both have uh we

1244
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:31,559
have we have friends down in Mexico who

1245
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:34,139
you know are in remote areas working

1246
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:36,540
with very old genetics people who have

1247
00:51:34,139 --> 00:51:40,858
kept the stuff alive and and are working

1248
00:51:36,539 --> 00:51:44,579
to uh kind of bring bring back something

1249
00:51:40,858 --> 00:51:47,279
from the Glory Days it's um it's very

1250
00:51:44,579 --> 00:51:49,380
very humble people uh very passionate

1251
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:53,040
about what they're doing and you know

1252
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:56,760
it's I feel honored to to you know read

1253
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:58,558
about their work when I get the chance

1254
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:02,579
you know who else is really passionate

1255
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:06,680
about spreading land races sorry had to

1256
00:52:02,579 --> 00:52:10,200
I had to bring your voice oh my gosh

1257
00:52:06,679 --> 00:52:12,000
he was holding up uh his he loves one of

1258
00:52:10,199 --> 00:52:16,318
his favorite possessions as his Arjun

1259

bobble head oh man yeah that's great

1260
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:19,880
he is the king of cannabis

1261
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:24,920
it's all cartel man

1262
00:52:25,318 --> 00:52:30,659
um we we know a couple individuals who

1263
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:33,480
are outside of that realm and they're

1264
00:52:30,659 --> 00:52:35,338
just humble farmer type guys that are on

1265
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:38,699
forums and

1266
00:52:35,338 --> 00:52:41,838
um you know I I've never smoked any of

1267
00:52:38,699 --> 00:52:44,699
it or had anyone that I know so far

1268
00:52:41,838 --> 00:52:47,119
receive it from them it's usually from

1269
00:52:44,699 --> 00:52:50,399
here being sent down to them because

1270
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:52,140
they're interested in seeds also

1271
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,599
but

1272
00:52:52,139 --> 00:52:56,879
um back to the Colombian part

1273
00:52:54,599 --> 00:52:58,980
in Colombia like you mentioned there's

1274
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:01,318
Low Land there's the highlands there's

1275
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:04,079
the valleys and

1276
00:53:01,318 --> 00:53:06,619
Santa Marta way up in the north next to

1277
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:10,500
Venezuela almost on the Caribbean the

1278
00:53:06,619 --> 00:53:13,200
high elevation of Santa Marta's

1279
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:15,059
every one of those was uh

1280
00:53:13,199 --> 00:53:20,460
distinct

1281
00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:25,140
um High early at least in 1969 70 71 72

1282
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:27,119
73. I met my Colombian friend who I end

1283
00:53:25,139 --> 00:53:29,519
up being friends with and he stayed in

1284
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:32,099
the United States for eight years at the

1285
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:37,500
Redway to have in Redway at the tavern

1286
00:53:32,099 --> 00:53:39,240
country Tavern in 1973 and he I think I

1287
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:42,000
mentioned you know that wacky way that

1288
00:53:39,239 --> 00:53:45,358
he had was I've never seen anything

1289
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:49,559
still that's that potent it was

1290
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:52,318
it it was compressed it was black it has

1291
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:55,200
it was seedless there was no stems and

1292
00:53:52,318 --> 00:53:56,818
it was from One Source One old grower he

1293
00:53:55,199 --> 00:54:00,480
said who's been growing weeds since the

1294
00:53:56,818 --> 00:54:03,420
40s up in the mountains in Neva in the

1295
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:05,400
Iva and he would get five or six ounces

1296
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:07,619
at a time in New York City and they

1297
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:11,760
looked like chunkies and they were in

1298
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:14,039
aluminum foil in a square

1299
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,780
maybe two inches by two inches by an

1300
00:54:14,039 --> 00:54:19,558
inch thick and

1301
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:21,740
it's so I told rajo this in 1973 it sold

1302
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:24,480
for a hundred dollars an ounce

1303
00:54:21,739 --> 00:54:27,118
I mean there was people in Arizona that

1304
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:29,039
would drive from Flagstaff to Phoenix

1305
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:30,838
on a phone call if you said there's some

1306
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:33,079
here you have to come now they would

1307
00:54:30,838 --> 00:54:35,219
drive immediately two and a half hours

1308
00:54:33,079 --> 00:54:38,039
and speaking of the wacky weed

1309
00:54:35,219 --> 00:54:40,019
specifically yeah that's it that's

1310
00:54:38,039 --> 00:54:42,300
awesome because it was so rare and so

1311
00:54:40,019 --> 00:54:44,460
unusual and he used a razor blade to cut

1312
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:46,859
it it looked like a chunk of hash and it

1313
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:49,920
would just zip off a little little

1314
00:54:46,858 --> 00:54:51,900
fragments then roll half joints New York

1315
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,960
needles pin joints whatever you want to

1316
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:56,338
call them and

1317
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:58,139
I I don't know if I mentioned it on the

1318
00:54:56,338 --> 00:55:00,599
show earlier but one of my friends from

1319
00:54:58,139 --> 00:55:02,338
Chicago came out to Phoenix and he took

1320
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:04,200
one hit on one and he was it was really

1321
00:55:02,338 --> 00:55:06,838
hard to pull because they were so near

1322
00:55:04,199 --> 00:55:08,460
so thin and as he did he fell forward

1323
00:55:06,838 --> 00:55:10,799
and hit his face against the brick wall

1324
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:14,159
broke his glasses and went unconscious

1325
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:17,818
on the ground Jesus and

1326
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:19,679
um I I didn't really I've I smoked it

1327
00:55:17,818 --> 00:55:22,079
quite a few times but when I did I had

1328
00:55:19,679 --> 00:55:23,940
to sit down it was the ultimate couch

1329
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:26,760
lock you know I I didn't want to go

1330
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:29,818
hiking or do anything but for him and

1331
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:31,920
two other friends in Tempe it made them

1332
00:55:29,818 --> 00:55:34,259
more normal you know the more they smoke

1333
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:37,800
the more that they could do stuff

1334
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:40,079
for me it was like green Kryptonite for

1335
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:42,000
me and red Kryptonite for them

1336
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:45,359
um yeah that's I've seen that a lot with

1337
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:48,900
like um I have what I consider like uh

1338
00:55:45,358 --> 00:55:51,659
at least typically I I'm reversed from

1339
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:54,780
what most people uh feel when they smoke

1340
00:55:51,659 --> 00:55:58,019
cannabis like I I smoke more longer

1341
00:55:54,780 --> 00:56:01,980
flowering narrow leaf type plants to

1342
00:55:58,019 --> 00:56:04,019
relax whereas if pure afghanis even

1343
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:07,079
things like skunk one don't agree with

1344
00:56:04,019 --> 00:56:09,179
me at all they make me paranoid and and

1345
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:11,400
it's just not it gives me this nasty

1346
00:56:09,179 --> 00:56:12,899
funky feeling you know

1347
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:15,119
um it's weird how different brain

1348
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:18,599
chemistry can really really flip all

1349
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:21,619
that and I noticed from going you know

1350
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:25,680
as a Young Man smoking to

1351
00:56:21,619 --> 00:56:27,720
being you know 41 now how weed affects

1352
00:56:25,679 --> 00:56:29,519
me is drastically different than it did

1353
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:31,439
when I was young and I don't think it's

1354
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:34,858
just the level of potency in the weed

1355
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:36,900
more like hormones and things how we how

1356
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:38,338
our brain chemistry and body chemistry

1357
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:40,440
change I think it just has such a

1358
00:56:38,338 --> 00:56:42,299
drastic effect and that's one thing I

1359
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:45,119
found to hold true with a lot of males

1360
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:46,980
is that when they're young cannabis

1361
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:49,460
affects them a lot different than when

1362
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:52,380
they're older and when people are older

1363
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:53,818
they tend to to experience the paranoia

1364
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:56,420
and stuff that they didn't have when

1365
00:56:53,818 --> 00:56:56,420
they were younger

1366
00:56:56,670 --> 00:57:02,880
[Laughter]

1367
00:56:59,719 --> 00:57:06,959
your hormones are different at different

1368
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:12,119
stages of your life yeah

1369
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:14,519
I um especially for Matt

1370
00:57:12,119 --> 00:57:16,200
yeah just started his new hormone

1371
00:57:14,519 --> 00:57:20,579
regimen so I'm really proud of him for

1372
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:23,519
that you know I mean I I will say that

1373
00:57:20,579 --> 00:57:26,760
uh at my age which I'm you know in my

1374
00:57:23,519 --> 00:57:29,338
mid-40s Ig constantly wants me to regrow

1375
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:32,339
my hair get more testosterone become

1376
00:57:29,338 --> 00:57:34,380
more manly uh you know just started

1377
00:57:32,338 --> 00:57:36,299
getting the trt ads yeah there's the

1378
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:38,400
targeted ads they have for people who

1379
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:39,960
are 46 you're like oh man they really

1380
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,838
are they really are trying to make it

1381
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:44,720
seem like I'm falling apart I suppose

1382
00:57:41,838 --> 00:57:47,960
don't don't fight yet don't fight the

1383
00:57:44,719 --> 00:57:51,358
algorithm not so yeah

1384
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:53,220
so yeah just slam it I'll make it I'll

1385
00:57:51,358 --> 00:57:56,279
make a couple points that you know when

1386
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:58,078
I first started growing indoor

1387
00:57:56,280 --> 00:58:00,059
um which is how I started because I

1388
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:01,318
lived in Chicago and that was like that

1389
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:03,119
was the only way you could get away with

1390
00:58:01,318 --> 00:58:04,980
it the stuff that we were getting from

1391
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:08,338
Amsterdam and all that it was primarily

1392
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:10,139
indica weed right and so the only Sativa

1393
00:58:08,338 --> 00:58:12,058
weed I really had experience with when I

1394
00:58:10,139 --> 00:58:14,098
was young was Mexican which I didn't

1395
00:58:12,059 --> 00:58:16,859
think was all that potent but I do

1396
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:18,240
remember like after a few years of

1397
00:58:16,858 --> 00:58:20,338
growing

1398
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:22,679
um asking some of my connections to get

1399
00:58:20,338 --> 00:58:25,199
me like the best green Mexican that they

1400
00:58:22,679 --> 00:58:26,639
could because I found that like even

1401
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:29,159
though it wasn't as nice and it didn't

1402
00:58:26,639 --> 00:58:31,500
taste as good as the stuff we were doing

1403
00:58:29,159 --> 00:58:34,799
ourselves it had a completely different

1404
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:36,358
Buzz than all of these amsterdam-based

1405
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:39,359
heavy Indica strains that we were

1406
00:58:36,358 --> 00:58:42,659
running indoors right and I have this

1407
00:58:39,358 --> 00:58:44,940
clear memory of I think it was in 1997

1408
00:58:42,659 --> 00:58:47,639
when they released Neville's Haze

1409
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:49,920
and Neville's Haze was kind of like the

1410
00:58:47,639 --> 00:58:51,779
the haziest or the most sativa thing

1411
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:54,358
that had been released up till that

1412
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:57,480
point right uh that at least like normal

1413
00:58:54,358 --> 00:58:59,219
people could get access to okay and by

1414
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:00,599
that point I had made enough friends in

1415
00:58:59,219 --> 00:59:03,000
Amsterdam that when I went over there

1416
00:59:00,599 --> 00:59:04,140
and visited I got to I got to try some

1417
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,579
different things that weren't just from

1418
00:59:04,139 --> 00:59:08,879
coffee shops but were from some

1419
00:59:05,579 --> 00:59:10,380
collectors and I clearly remember I

1420
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,298
thought about this when madjag was

1421
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:14,220
talking I clearly remember smoking a

1422
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:16,380
Pinner joint

1423
00:59:14,219 --> 00:59:17,939
um with the guy and my buddy who would

1424
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:19,460
come with me three of us so like it

1425
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:24,119
didn't go very far

1426
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:26,880
and I got so soaring high off this

1427
00:59:24,119 --> 00:59:29,519
sativa that it almost felt like air was

1428
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:31,798
rushing over my brain and then when we

1429
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:33,838
walked out of his little his little flat

1430
00:59:31,798 --> 00:59:36,000
in Amsterdam there was about six or

1431
00:59:33,838 --> 00:59:38,639
seven steps that went down to the the

1432
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,260
cobblestone street or whatever and I

1433
00:59:38,639 --> 00:59:42,539
held the railing

1434
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:45,720
to make sure I was gonna make it down

1435
00:59:42,539 --> 00:59:47,279
those steps safely right yeah like I

1436
00:59:45,719 --> 00:59:50,759
felt like and you know at this time it

1437
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:53,040
was 1997 I was I was in my early 20s

1438
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:55,079
and I have this clear memory of like

1439
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:56,699
looking down the stairs and being like I

1440
00:59:55,079 --> 00:59:59,460
better hold the railing

1441
00:59:56,699 --> 01:00:02,279
you know because I was nervous about

1442
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:05,220
like my sense of balance my equilibrium

1443
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:08,819
where my head was at with my head would

1444
01:00:05,219 --> 01:00:10,919
my feet obey my mind you know had have

1445
01:00:08,818 --> 01:00:12,480
we broken that chain where my legs and

1446
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:15,599
arms aren't going to obey what's coming

1447
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:17,639
out of my mind and tell them what to do

1448
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:19,140
um and that was not something that I had

1449
01:00:17,639 --> 01:00:21,358
experienced before

1450
01:00:19,139 --> 01:00:23,818
and all of a sudden I had this memory of

1451
01:00:21,358 --> 01:00:26,219
like maybe some of these older guys

1452
01:00:23,818 --> 01:00:28,920
talking about this like psychedelic or

1453
01:00:26,219 --> 01:00:31,980
these trippy experiences off sativas

1454
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:33,599
maybe they weren't bullshitting because

1455
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:36,119
for a minute it was just completely

1456
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:39,119
outside the realm of my experience with

1457
01:00:36,119 --> 01:00:41,818
all of this like very heavy Afghan or

1458
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:44,338
the best Afghan Sativa weed that leaned

1459
01:00:41,818 --> 01:00:45,719
Afghan right

1460
01:00:44,338 --> 01:00:48,298
um because people weren't buying and

1461
01:00:45,719 --> 01:00:50,578
growing piercativas then you know all

1462
01:00:48,298 --> 01:00:53,219
the club all the all the seed banks and

1463
01:00:50,579 --> 01:00:55,559
stuff you know were basically growing

1464
01:00:53,219 --> 01:00:57,419
you know mostly predominantly Indica

1465
01:00:55,559 --> 01:01:00,359
leaning stuff because that was easy and

1466
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:04,079
chunky and small and manageable

1467
01:01:00,358 --> 01:01:07,078
hard fat words yep yeah it just it just

1468
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:09,359
it and so that's what you got you know

1469
01:01:07,079 --> 01:01:10,980
um so this this weed that this weed that

1470
01:01:09,358 --> 01:01:13,679
hit you like that was that you're saying

1471
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:17,099
this was a pure sat no it was Neville's

1472
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:20,159
Haze which is okay was uh you know it's

1473
01:01:17,099 --> 01:01:22,619
it's basically the two the two Haze

1474
01:01:20,159 --> 01:01:23,879
males that Neville had

1475
01:01:22,619 --> 01:01:26,160
um with a little bit of Northern Lights

1476
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:28,318
in there yeah depending on if you

1477
01:01:26,159 --> 01:01:30,179
believe Sam more Northern Lights in

1478
01:01:28,318 --> 01:01:32,880
there I mean whatever whatever the case

1479
01:01:30,179 --> 01:01:35,098
may be it was it was I mean that cut

1480
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:37,559
still exists yeah that cut still gets

1481
01:01:35,099 --> 01:01:39,420
grown and sold in Amsterdam

1482
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:41,280
um but it was you know some people

1483
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:44,338
described it as racy some people got

1484
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:45,359
paranoid some people I literally got you

1485
01:01:44,338 --> 01:01:48,358
know I know you said you don't like

1486
01:01:45,358 --> 01:01:51,659
trippy but I got tracers in my vision

1487
01:01:48,358 --> 01:01:53,818
uh where my vision was all about and you

1488
01:01:51,659 --> 01:01:55,379
know I was concerned about my legs

1489
01:01:53,818 --> 01:01:57,719
obeying my mind

1490
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:59,818
you know like as a 22 year old I didn't

1491
01:01:57,719 --> 01:02:02,098
usually grab the railing to like go down

1492
01:01:59,818 --> 01:02:05,460
six or seven steps

1493
01:02:02,099 --> 01:02:07,500
but I did I think I think that's

1494
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:09,720
basically the peak of

1495
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:12,059
of Neville's work right there you know

1496
01:02:09,719 --> 01:02:14,759
that I got smoked out by a buddy right

1497
01:02:12,059 --> 01:02:17,400
about that same time period of some

1498
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:19,559
stuff that that had the exact same

1499
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:21,720
effect I mean we're sitting there and I

1500
01:02:19,559 --> 01:02:23,880
don't like bongs but you know he he

1501
01:02:21,719 --> 01:02:25,818
smoked me out on this bong and I was

1502
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:28,858
like I

1503
01:02:25,818 --> 01:02:31,259
after I coughed my head off I sat on the

1504
01:02:28,858 --> 01:02:32,159
couch and I just went into like silent

1505
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:35,720
mode

1506
01:02:32,159 --> 01:02:38,940
you know for for 30 minutes

1507
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:41,818
and yeah I know you've seen this before

1508
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:45,659
you know I mean where I I sat there not

1509
01:02:41,818 --> 01:02:48,119
saying a word and uh just like freaking

1510
01:02:45,659 --> 01:02:50,818
out until finally I was like I gotta go

1511
01:02:48,119 --> 01:02:52,920
and everybody's like okay see you you

1512
01:02:50,818 --> 01:02:55,798
know and I walk out of this place and

1513
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:58,440
I'm I'm stumbling you know it's like

1514
01:02:55,798 --> 01:03:00,179
head spinning I gotta go down these

1515
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:03,000
stairs and I'm I'm grabbing onto that

1516
01:03:00,179 --> 01:03:05,818
railing for for my dear wife trying to

1517
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,858
try and drive home I get lost I'm like

1518
01:03:05,818 --> 01:03:10,980
two you know three miles from my house

1519
01:03:07,858 --> 01:03:13,558
get totally lost right on roads that

1520
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:16,380
I've driven a thousand times

1521
01:03:13,559 --> 01:03:19,680
um you know wind up calling into work

1522
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:22,680
and say hey um I'm so messed up I call

1523
01:03:19,679 --> 01:03:27,899
in on the sick line and I'm like hey uh

1524
01:03:22,679 --> 01:03:30,480
I I I'm lost I leave her recording

1525
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:32,400
for my co-workers tell them I'm not

1526
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:36,119
gonna be in today I took the wrong turn

1527
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:39,780
and I don't know where I am you know so

1528
01:03:36,119 --> 01:03:42,539
I mean that's to me that is his legacy

1529
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:45,000
he you know and this is the same stuff

1530
01:03:42,539 --> 01:03:47,639
probably that turned into the the Cuban

1531
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:49,619
black and all those other famous NL

1532
01:03:47,639 --> 01:03:51,239
hazes out there you know this is the

1533
01:03:49,619 --> 01:03:54,420
kind of thing that came from Neville's

1534
01:03:51,239 --> 01:03:55,858
Peak it was kind of the stuff that um he

1535
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:59,039
called at the beginning of his holy

1536
01:03:55,858 --> 01:04:01,139
grail project because he regretted like

1537
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:04,739
by the time that he realized how special

1538
01:04:01,139 --> 01:04:06,838
Hayes was he had already lost several of

1539
01:04:04,739 --> 01:04:08,279
the plants that he had gotten from seed

1540
01:04:06,838 --> 01:04:11,159
because they were just such an enormous

1541
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:13,798
pain in the ass to grow and keep

1542
01:04:11,159 --> 01:04:15,779
um and he was you know he he only had

1543
01:04:13,798 --> 01:04:18,780
the two males and then he lost the one

1544
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:22,019
male in 89 and so he ended up out of the

1545
01:04:18,780 --> 01:04:25,380
six or seven plants he had he only ended

1546
01:04:22,019 --> 01:04:28,980
up with one probably by 90 or 91.

1547
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:31,099
and so the Neville's Haze was his his

1548
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:33,599
attempt to cross two of them together

1549
01:04:31,099 --> 01:04:35,220
with a little bit of Indica in it and

1550
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:37,019
then that was going to be the basis for

1551
01:04:35,219 --> 01:04:38,578
his project

1552
01:04:37,019 --> 01:04:40,199
um and it was going to be a private

1553
01:04:38,579 --> 01:04:42,000
breathing I believe but then it was just

1554
01:04:40,199 --> 01:04:43,558
so good they decided to release it to

1555
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,318
the public people underestimate the

1556
01:04:43,559 --> 01:04:48,900
impact of that nl5 that Neville made

1557
01:04:46,318 --> 01:04:51,179
those crosses with you know it's kind of

1558
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:53,400
like a turbo or a supercharger on an

1559
01:04:51,179 --> 01:04:55,980
engine for that sativa you know it

1560
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:59,700
cranked up the quantity of cannabinoids

1561
01:04:55,980 --> 01:05:01,559
in in any particular nugget

1562
01:04:59,699 --> 01:05:03,239
um just because the resin production was

1563
01:05:01,559 --> 01:05:05,220
way up the

1564
01:05:03,239 --> 01:05:08,939
you know

1565
01:05:05,219 --> 01:05:11,219
um if if you ran it in in a lab like um

1566
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:14,940
like people do today and you compare it

1567
01:05:11,219 --> 01:05:17,039
to the haze with you know uh the NL

1568
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:18,780
hybrid you'd find just a much higher

1569
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:21,900
level of cannabinoids simply because

1570
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:25,920
there's more resin there per gram

1571
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:27,298
um and and that's that nl5 was you know

1572
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:30,720
the peak of

1573
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:33,420
of his his NL breeding work you know it

1574
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:34,980
was the best plus the best

1575
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:36,420
um you know to say that it's just a

1576
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:38,099
little bit of NL

1577
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:40,200
um maybe that's all it took but I

1578
01:05:38,099 --> 01:05:42,980
consider it you know to be a real

1579
01:05:40,199 --> 01:05:46,679
multiplier on the effect of those hey

1580
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:49,500
we recently discounted we recently

1581
01:05:46,679 --> 01:05:51,118
learned some other stuff that

1582
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:52,380
um kind of dovetails into maybe

1583
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:54,480
something we can talk about a little bit

1584
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:56,760
involving some of the pearls and girls

1585
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:57,358
and early stuff

1586
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:00,000
um

1587
01:05:57,358 --> 01:06:02,159
and it was that Neville's

1588
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:05,460
Apparently one of his main things he

1589
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:09,179
wanted to do was rework the early Pearl

1590
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:12,059
and find that early Pearl or early girl

1591
01:06:09,179 --> 01:06:13,019
that he had originally encountered and I

1592
01:06:12,059 --> 01:06:15,059
always thought that was interesting

1593
01:06:13,019 --> 01:06:17,099
because I always thought the nl5 and the

1594
01:06:15,059 --> 01:06:19,319
NL work was probably the peak of what he

1595
01:06:17,099 --> 01:06:21,960
considered his like Afghani type work

1596
01:06:19,318 --> 01:06:25,139
but I guess at the end he was chasing

1597
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:27,059
the the Pearl yeah not so he was working

1598
01:06:25,139 --> 01:06:28,558
with a lot of Mexicans

1599
01:06:27,059 --> 01:06:31,019
yeah right

1600
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:32,400
um and I guess one of the reasons why he

1601
01:06:31,019 --> 01:06:34,619
was working with a bunch of different

1602
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:37,079
Mexicans that he could get was because

1603
01:06:34,619 --> 01:06:38,940
that early girl in early Pearl he loved

1604
01:06:37,079 --> 01:06:42,119
the sweetness of the flavor and the high

1605
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:44,099
so much he was trying to find it again

1606
01:06:42,119 --> 01:06:46,318
and I think it was one of those things

1607
01:06:44,099 --> 01:06:48,298
that he thought would be common you know

1608
01:06:46,318 --> 01:06:50,639
and then he lost it and couldn't get it

1609
01:06:48,298 --> 01:06:52,318
back type of type of gig you know

1610
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:55,199
because the era had passed or whatever

1611
01:06:52,318 --> 01:06:58,079
but um some of it some of his associates

1612
01:06:55,199 --> 01:07:00,058
in um that were very close to him in the

1613
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:02,460
last 10 years of his life have said that

1614
01:07:00,059 --> 01:07:05,760
one of his main projects in addition to

1615
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:09,179
like the sativa side of you know of the

1616
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:11,819
Holy Grail extreme sativas was also like

1617
01:07:09,179 --> 01:07:14,219
bringing back some of those the Mexican

1618
01:07:11,818 --> 01:07:15,719
memories that he had

1619
01:07:14,219 --> 01:07:17,399
um and that was what was captured in

1620
01:07:15,719 --> 01:07:19,259
because early girl and early Pearl are

1621
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:21,480
basically predominantly Mexican with a

1622
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:24,000
little bit of Afghan thrown in

1623
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:26,760
it um and he was infatuated with it he

1624
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,920
really was he wanted the flavor and the

1625
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:31,140
buzz of certain kinds of oaxacans that

1626
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:33,559
he had he wanted that back again really

1627
01:07:31,139 --> 01:07:33,558
badly

1628
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:38,220
apparently

1629
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:40,859
well I I can't blame him I mean that

1630
01:07:38,219 --> 01:07:42,179
that early early Pearl

1631
01:07:40,858 --> 01:07:46,019
you know the

1632
01:07:42,179 --> 01:07:48,838
at its best is just delicious smoke with

1633
01:07:46,019 --> 01:07:51,480
a great effect you know I mean but the

1634
01:07:48,838 --> 01:07:53,940
the problem he probably ran into was

1635
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:56,400
that you know it was by the time he

1636
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:58,200
started trying to recapture it it was

1637
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:00,539
damn near impossible to find it coming

1638
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:04,019
out of Mexico the cartels had taken

1639
01:08:00,539 --> 01:08:05,880
control of who grew what and I mean if

1640
01:08:04,019 --> 01:08:07,980
you tried to take your stuff through the

1641
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:09,900
plazas and I don't know this right this

1642
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:12,960
is just from reading stuff and

1643
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:15,119
other people who know it firsthand or

1644
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:17,338
whatever I I don't but from what I

1645
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:19,380
understand is you know if you were a

1646
01:08:17,338 --> 01:08:22,500
small producer cranking out a family

1647
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:24,779
heirloom on on your little piece of land

1648
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:26,579
and tried to try to sell it move it

1649
01:08:24,779 --> 01:08:28,739
across the border or whatever you you

1650
01:08:26,579 --> 01:08:31,979
might get in some very serious problems

1651
01:08:28,738 --> 01:08:33,959
with the cartel they they kept a lock on

1652
01:08:31,979 --> 01:08:35,879
this stuff and and hybrids were the

1653
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:38,759
order of the day so

1654
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:41,699
he must have had a very hard time and I

1655
01:08:38,759 --> 01:08:44,819
know from reading his posts on on uh you

1656
01:08:41,698 --> 01:08:47,099
know Mr nice that you know that he was

1657
01:08:44,819 --> 01:08:50,460
and and his catalog also you know he

1658
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:53,400
thought early Pearl needed if you read

1659
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:55,319
what he what he put in in his catalog he

1660
01:08:53,399 --> 01:08:58,679
said that early Pearl needed skunk

1661
01:08:55,319 --> 01:09:01,859
number one and uh he was he he crossed

1662
01:08:58,679 --> 01:09:03,060
the skunk and then was doing it again

1663
01:09:01,859 --> 01:09:05,338
um

1664
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:07,020
um to try and get it where he wanted I

1665
01:09:05,338 --> 01:09:09,298
think those were probably mainly

1666
01:09:07,020 --> 01:09:11,100
commercial and you know goals breeding

1667
01:09:09,298 --> 01:09:14,100
goals that he was pursuing instead of

1668
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:14,100
connoisseur

1669
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:18,000
um I guess later she wanted to

1670
01:09:15,779 --> 01:09:19,199
appreciate what was unique about the

1671
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:22,798
Pearl

1672
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:25,500
um and uh and but I guess he didn't have

1673
01:09:22,798 --> 01:09:28,159
much to go back to after that

1674
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:31,679
I was going to say okay

1675
01:09:28,159 --> 01:09:34,619
The Human Condition uh which is Neville

1676
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:36,779
regretted that he didn't have all of

1677
01:09:34,619 --> 01:09:40,019
those uh varieties that he had in the

1678
01:09:36,779 --> 01:09:41,880
80s and early 90s uh later on in life

1679
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:43,679
when he was much much better at what he

1680
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:46,259
was doing and that they were almost

1681
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:48,239
wasted on him when he was young just

1682
01:09:46,259 --> 01:09:50,159
trying to figure it out which I think is

1683
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:52,259
kind of what we all think in a lot of

1684
01:09:50,159 --> 01:09:54,359
ways about ourselves you know it's like

1685
01:09:52,259 --> 01:09:56,939
oh I wish I could have done that with

1686
01:09:54,359 --> 01:09:59,159
what I know now you know back then I was

1687
01:09:56,939 --> 01:10:01,079
just stumbling along

1688
01:09:59,159 --> 01:10:02,579
um but that would be interesting so

1689
01:10:01,079 --> 01:10:04,198
magic when you were getting all that

1690
01:10:02,579 --> 01:10:06,719
skunk one

1691
01:10:04,198 --> 01:10:08,219
um and you were talking to uh Rob about

1692
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:10,920
that kind of stuff

1693
01:10:08,219 --> 01:10:12,840
was I I know you said that's all you got

1694
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:14,640
but did he talk to you about some of

1695
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:15,960
those other lines that they had and the

1696
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:17,760
different stuff that they were messing

1697
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:19,560
with you mentioned he brought like a

1698
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:20,699
whole selection of weed that put you on

1699
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:24,539
the floor

1700
01:10:20,698 --> 01:10:24,539
uh indeed

1701
01:10:25,619 --> 01:10:30,359
so I'd be did he did he mention any

1702
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:32,640
early girl or early Pearl or any Mexican

1703
01:10:30,359 --> 01:10:35,579
or Pollyanna or anything like that that

1704
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:37,739
you can remember no just Afghan number

1705
01:10:35,579 --> 01:10:40,738
one that was the other thing he brought

1706
01:10:37,738 --> 01:10:43,859
a few packets of that and I I look back

1707
01:10:40,738 --> 01:10:46,678
through notes and his skunk number one

1708
01:10:43,859 --> 01:10:49,619
packets were two big gelatin capsules

1709
01:10:46,679 --> 01:10:51,779
with 25 seeds each I thought it was 50

1710
01:10:49,619 --> 01:10:53,579
so each pack was a hundred when it was

1711
01:10:51,779 --> 01:10:57,238
50 was the whole pack

1712
01:10:53,579 --> 01:10:59,340
and he um

1713
01:10:57,238 --> 01:11:01,859
I I don't know he

1714
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:04,500
I was so inspired from reading about

1715
01:11:01,859 --> 01:11:06,119
this in High Times that's why I

1716
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:08,880
contacted him

1717
01:11:06,119 --> 01:11:10,679
when he finally did come the second year

1718
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:13,380
out to our place

1719
01:11:10,679 --> 01:11:15,480
came out to Arizona and he stayed for a

1720
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:18,179
day or two he had his personal stash in

1721
01:11:15,479 --> 01:11:22,139
this little zip pouch with individual

1722
01:11:18,179 --> 01:11:24,600
vials and he had pre-rolled joints so he

1723
01:11:22,140 --> 01:11:26,820
didn't he had a Thai joint he had a

1724
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:28,460
Colombian he had this and that he

1725
01:11:26,819 --> 01:11:32,219
probably had what you're speaking about

1726
01:11:28,460 --> 01:11:34,260
Northern Lights and various things as I

1727
01:11:32,219 --> 01:11:36,840
remember he had like 10 different

1728
01:11:34,260 --> 01:11:39,420
samples in there I took one hit of the

1729
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:40,800
Columbian that he had and I just laid on

1730
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:42,020
the floor and listened to him talk for

1731
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:46,380
an hour

1732
01:11:42,020 --> 01:11:49,500
in my living room I I couldn't focus

1733
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:53,340
really I don't remember anything

1734
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:54,920
your honor I you know I don't remember

1735
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:58,079
um

1736
01:11:54,920 --> 01:12:00,300
well I'd like to give back though to the

1737
01:11:58,079 --> 01:12:02,640
questions you were talking over the

1738
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:05,940
Concepts you were talking about

1739
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:09,119
okay so trying to compare one of these

1740
01:12:05,939 --> 01:12:10,859
massively and Powerful highs that we all

1741
01:12:09,119 --> 01:12:13,619
have experienced at different times in

1742
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:16,380
our life what about

1743
01:12:13,619 --> 01:12:18,300
comparing them to Edibles today

1744
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:21,359
and I don't mean Edibles that are just

1745
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:23,100
pure THC there are some edibles that our

1746
01:12:21,359 --> 01:12:25,500
friends make or you might make or I've

1747
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:27,900
made like

1748
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:28,859
cobs or

1749
01:12:27,899 --> 01:12:30,198
um

1750
01:12:28,859 --> 01:12:33,719
cookies

1751
01:12:30,198 --> 01:12:35,819
cornbread that it's it's full spectrum

1752
01:12:33,719 --> 01:12:37,859
because you use the whole plant you're

1753
01:12:35,819 --> 01:12:41,340
not just

1754
01:12:37,859 --> 01:12:44,519
trying to get high THC Edibles which I

1755
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:46,739
find not that exciting they sell them at

1756
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:48,239
all the different dispensaries and Rec

1757
01:12:46,738 --> 01:12:50,399
stores now

1758
01:12:48,238 --> 01:12:53,399
yeah the hash Edibles that are just

1759
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:56,899
mostly THC like extract edible yeah but

1760
01:12:53,399 --> 01:13:00,059
but I've had cornbread

1761
01:12:56,899 --> 01:13:02,219
from my friends who live 30 miles from

1762
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:03,780
here down the dirt road and they said

1763
01:13:02,219 --> 01:13:05,399
they gave me a square of cornbread and

1764
01:13:03,779 --> 01:13:07,319
they said make sure you only eat a

1765
01:13:05,399 --> 01:13:09,539
quarter of it don't eat more than a

1766
01:13:07,319 --> 01:13:12,000
quarter of it so I took a quote it was

1767
01:13:09,539 --> 01:13:14,399
delicious huh it was delicious we had to

1768
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:17,158
do it I took a quarter of it and cut it

1769
01:13:14,399 --> 01:13:19,559
in half and took an eighth and the next

1770
01:13:17,158 --> 01:13:22,139
day I was in the morning I thought well

1771
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:23,580
this will make my day mellow at work I

1772
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:27,420
started driving to work and I got about

1773
01:13:23,579 --> 01:13:30,719
one mile away and I realized I couldn't

1774
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:32,279
really drive very well yeah if I get

1775
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:35,819
pulled over there's no way I'd be able

1776
01:13:32,279 --> 01:13:38,219
to hide where I was at and

1777
01:13:35,819 --> 01:13:42,179
there was we that powerful back in the

1778
01:13:38,219 --> 01:13:43,920
days you know in 69 70 and 71 72 that

1779
01:13:42,179 --> 01:13:44,880
you could take a few Puffs and get to

1780
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:48,359
that point

1781
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:50,640
where you had to hold the railing or you

1782
01:13:48,359 --> 01:13:53,158
would fall

1783
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:55,820
so what

1784
01:13:53,158 --> 01:13:59,219
what rajo and not so were talking about

1785
01:13:55,819 --> 01:14:02,759
I know we've all experienced that so now

1786
01:13:59,219 --> 01:14:07,319
I I like edibles also because they last

1787
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:09,920
all day and you save your throat

1788
01:14:07,319 --> 01:14:12,719
you have to have you know a special

1789
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:14,520
ability I don't like to drive if I'm

1790
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:16,859
that high that's for sure but if you

1791
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:18,420
have a designated driver wow go to the

1792
01:14:16,859 --> 01:14:20,698
art museum

1793
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:23,219
um go to parties go to great restaurants

1794
01:14:20,698 --> 01:14:25,198
and have and hold the railing on the way

1795
01:14:23,219 --> 01:14:27,359
in and

1796
01:14:25,198 --> 01:14:29,279
having you know a lot of a lot of

1797
01:14:27,359 --> 01:14:30,719
ex-opiate addicts

1798
01:14:29,279 --> 01:14:32,340
um will message me because they know

1799
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:34,679
I've been through that and I openly talk

1800
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:36,420
about it you know and they'll message me

1801
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:38,579
and say did you ever find a strain that

1802
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:41,880
gave you the same effects or similar

1803
01:14:38,579 --> 01:14:44,039
effects to the high of opiates anything

1804
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:45,539
that was a good replacement for that and

1805
01:14:44,039 --> 01:14:48,779
the one thing I could say is the closest

1806
01:14:45,539 --> 01:14:50,460
I've ever gotten was Edibles and

1807
01:14:48,779 --> 01:14:52,319
you know it was a similar experience

1808
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:54,420
where someone gave me a tray of brownies

1809
01:14:52,319 --> 01:14:56,639
like from Humboldt and he's like hey man

1810
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:58,739
really just only eat like an inch by an

1811
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:01,500
inch thing and I you know I was a fat

1812
01:14:58,738 --> 01:15:04,379
kid so I was like this is delicious I'm

1813
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:07,020
gonna eat it all and I was seriously

1814
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:10,980
High drooling for two three days like

1815
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:12,600
not non-functional barely alive and I'd

1816
01:15:10,979 --> 01:15:15,479
have to say that is the closest I've

1817
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:17,940
ever been to just a whole opiate not off

1818
01:15:15,479 --> 01:15:21,359
was an extreme

1819
01:15:17,939 --> 01:15:23,279
case of weed brownies so for those

1820
01:15:21,359 --> 01:15:25,859
struggling with that

1821
01:15:23,279 --> 01:15:28,319
that might be an option Edibles I mean

1822
01:15:25,859 --> 01:15:32,219
they could take you far and put you out

1823
01:15:28,319 --> 01:15:34,579
for sure for sure the closest I would

1824
01:15:32,219 --> 01:15:37,198
have to compare to that in current times

1825
01:15:34,579 --> 01:15:39,899
is last year A friend gave me a bottle

1826
01:15:37,198 --> 01:15:43,139
of of

1827
01:15:39,899 --> 01:15:44,579
coffee liqueur from Starbucks that he

1828
01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:47,420
had poured

1829
01:15:44,579 --> 01:15:49,679
um cannabis oil in that he had made and

1830
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:52,560
and I said well how do you make the oil

1831
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:55,880
and he it was not really oil as an extra

1832
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:59,460
he just took fresh Buds and boiled them

1833
01:15:55,880 --> 01:16:01,260
and and boiled them down till it became

1834
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:04,319
more of a syrup and he poured it into

1835
01:16:01,260 --> 01:16:06,719
that and I said well how much what's a

1836
01:16:04,319 --> 01:16:09,179
dose and he said I don't know he said I

1837
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:11,819
just took a swig of it one day and I

1838
01:16:09,179 --> 01:16:15,960
laid down and I didn't move off the

1839
01:16:11,819 --> 01:16:17,519
couch all day so I went wow and I I

1840
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:21,779
still have it in my refrigerator it's

1841
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:21,780
awesome it is to

1842
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:25,320
um

1843
01:16:22,859 --> 01:16:28,619
have to say it to Morphine then anything

1844
01:16:25,319 --> 01:16:32,039
I've experience in the Cannabis World it

1845
01:16:28,619 --> 01:16:34,039
takes away pain it makes you relaxed

1846
01:16:32,039 --> 01:16:37,260
um you you can't do much

1847
01:16:34,039 --> 01:16:39,260
that's the sad part of it but it's very

1848
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:42,300
disabling at times

1849
01:16:39,260 --> 01:16:44,039
watch a movie hopefully it creates I'm

1850
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:46,020
not the most biggest chemistry guy but

1851
01:16:44,039 --> 01:16:49,500
supposedly it creates something in your

1852
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:52,440
bloodstream called THC 11. which is

1853
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:55,319
different than thc9

1854
01:16:52,439 --> 01:16:57,119
um and it is My Kryptonite uh in the

1855
01:16:55,319 --> 01:16:58,559
sense that uh when you were like oh it

1856
01:16:57,119 --> 01:17:00,599
lasts all day like well that's the

1857
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:04,620
negative for me it's like I'm I'm stuck

1858
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:07,199
all day right and uh you know like I'm a

1859
01:17:04,619 --> 01:17:09,420
dad so my my ability to just like have

1860
01:17:07,198 --> 01:17:11,698
days where I have no responsibility and

1861
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:15,060
I have to do nothing are pretty few and

1862
01:17:11,698 --> 01:17:18,059
far between right I have had cops behind

1863
01:17:15,060 --> 01:17:19,920
me mad Jag where I had eaten too many

1864
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:23,100
brownies over Thanksgiving or something

1865
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:25,920
at a friend's house and I thought when I

1866
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:27,300
got if I got pulled over my only saving

1867
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:29,880
grace would be like I'll take a

1868
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:31,380
breathalyzer right now yeah because I

1869
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:32,400
hadn't drank any alcohol and I'm like

1870
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:34,140
let's just get it out of the way I'll

1871
01:17:32,399 --> 01:17:36,000
blow a zero zero of course I haven't

1872
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:37,980
done anything but if they would have

1873
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,960
asked me to get out and like lift my leg

1874
01:17:37,979 --> 01:17:43,198
and touch my nose or walk in a straight

1875
01:17:39,960 --> 01:17:45,060
line I would have been doomed like no

1876
01:17:43,198 --> 01:17:47,219
chance I would have been able to walk in

1877
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:50,340
a straight line like all of my motor

1878
01:17:47,219 --> 01:17:51,260
functions it messes with my it makes me

1879
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:54,300
feel

1880
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:56,640
drunk in the sense that it it messes

1881
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:58,560
with my equilibrium and it gives me a

1882
01:17:56,640 --> 01:18:00,260
little bit of the spins and it makes me

1883
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:03,539
feel warm

1884
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:04,980
and uh I have a bunch of friends that

1885
01:18:03,539 --> 01:18:06,600
tell me that eventually it'll feel

1886
01:18:04,979 --> 01:18:08,279
Pleasant and I'm like well how many

1887
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:10,579
times do I have to feel unpleasant

1888
01:18:08,279 --> 01:18:13,079
before the pleasant starts

1889
01:18:10,579 --> 01:18:14,939
you know because right now I'm just

1890
01:18:13,079 --> 01:18:16,800
getting a bunch of unpleasant you know

1891
01:18:14,939 --> 01:18:17,579
so when do I break through to the fun

1892
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:19,980
part

1893
01:18:17,579 --> 01:18:22,500
in a similar vein a friend of mine was

1894
01:18:19,979 --> 01:18:25,979
driving up from Phoenix to um the Verde

1895
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:28,500
Valley where I lived at that time and he

1896
01:18:25,979 --> 01:18:32,759
said he was driving along and all of a

1897
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:32,760
sudden his car started going and

1898
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:36,500
then he woke up

1899
01:18:34,619 --> 01:18:40,439
he'd fall asleep

1900
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:43,279
and he was going like 20 in in fourth

1901
01:18:40,439 --> 01:18:46,639
gear in the you know what it does

1902
01:18:43,279 --> 01:18:50,779
he's on the interstate but

1903
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:54,060
at night the traffic was very small and

1904
01:18:50,779 --> 01:18:56,158
he didn't crash and die which today you

1905
01:18:54,060 --> 01:18:58,380
couldn't do that no you couldn't do that

1906
01:18:56,158 --> 01:19:02,460
285 behind you that would just cream

1907
01:18:58,380 --> 01:19:03,719
into you yeah yeah that's hilarious but

1908
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:05,340
that is interesting because some people

1909
01:19:03,719 --> 01:19:07,079
really obviously a lot of people like

1910
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:09,000
Edibles because they're sold all over

1911
01:19:07,079 --> 01:19:10,738
the place and at dispensaries and things

1912
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,899
like that

1913
01:19:10,738 --> 01:19:14,579
um I can smoke I don't want to say I can

1914
01:19:12,899 --> 01:19:16,439
smoke any amount of weed but I can smoke

1915
01:19:14,579 --> 01:19:20,219
a lot of different kinds of Wheat and be

1916
01:19:16,439 --> 01:19:23,158
fully functional if need be with my day

1917
01:19:20,219 --> 01:19:24,779
um and Edibles they can take me out and

1918
01:19:23,158 --> 01:19:26,219
be like well all I'm doing is a whole

1919
01:19:24,779 --> 01:19:29,039
lot of nothing

1920
01:19:26,219 --> 01:19:31,500
yeah until this feeling goes away I have

1921
01:19:29,039 --> 01:19:34,800
two daughters yeah but they're grown so

1922
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:36,960
I at this point in my life I can

1923
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:39,960
spare a day if I want to

1924
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:41,880
yeah no I have uh I have I have a bunch

1925
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:44,760
and they're all needy at this stage of

1926
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:46,760
their life so it's rare that they don't

1927
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:50,520
need anything from me

1928
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:53,340
yeah that's funny I'm sure I'm sure you

1929
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:55,500
appreciate what a what a great part of

1930
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:56,819
your life this is not so and I'm really

1931
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:59,819
happy for you

1932
01:19:56,819 --> 01:20:02,158
yeah oh yeah no it's killer yeah

1933
01:19:59,819 --> 01:20:04,019
I have I have four daughters

1934
01:20:02,158 --> 01:20:07,920
you know and uh three of them are still

1935
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:09,540
at home and uh they're all uh yeah I

1936
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:11,039
mean they all still like me so that's a

1937
01:20:09,539 --> 01:20:14,279
positive

1938
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:16,640
um I might be a glorified Uber in ATM at

1939
01:20:14,279 --> 01:20:16,639
this point

1940
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:21,960
but you know yeah I mean you know it's

1941
01:20:19,439 --> 01:20:24,419
it's uh it's good it's it's uh not

1942

1960
01:21:06,359 --> 01:21:11,039
all that stuff was was the year or the

1961
01:21:09,238 --> 01:21:13,198
year before the two two years before

1962
01:21:11,039 --> 01:21:16,679
1980

1963
01:21:13,198 --> 01:21:18,539
um 81 I I grew some seed that a friend

1964
01:21:16,679 --> 01:21:21,658
of mine brought me from California and

1965
01:21:18,539 --> 01:21:24,658
he hitchhiked around Mendo for uh you

1966
01:21:21,658 --> 01:21:26,939
know several months and collected

1967
01:21:24,658 --> 01:21:28,619
collected seeds every time he got a ride

1968
01:21:26,939 --> 01:21:31,738
because everybody there was a grower

1969
01:21:28,619 --> 01:21:34,738
they all had weed they'd smoke and he

1970
01:21:31,738 --> 01:21:37,019
they'd give them the seeds so um

1971
01:21:34,738 --> 01:21:40,738
that particular plant came from that

1972
01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:43,080
collection and uh this is it was

1973
01:21:40,738 --> 01:21:46,439
actually on his way home from from uh

1974
01:21:43,079 --> 01:21:49,500
California to for Christmas and he he

1975
01:21:46,439 --> 01:21:52,859
stopped at the at the SFO airport he

1976
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:55,140
walked by a guy smoking a joint in a in

1977
01:21:52,859 --> 01:21:57,960
a Corvette

1978
01:21:55,140 --> 01:22:00,239
um and he just kind of walked up to him

1979
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:03,179
and gave him the smile and and

1980
01:22:00,238 --> 01:22:04,979
guy invited him to smoke with him and he

1981
01:22:03,179 --> 01:22:07,140
wound up picking up these seeds and so

1982
01:22:04,979 --> 01:22:08,639
you know the names of the stuff he

1983
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:10,199
brought home and gave me he would

1984
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:11,940
collect these seeds and then bring them

1985
01:22:10,198 --> 01:22:14,099
and give them to me

1986
01:22:11,939 --> 01:22:16,319
and this one of course got the very

1987
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:17,340
intuitive and descriptive name of plain

1988
01:22:16,319 --> 01:22:18,359
weed

1989
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:21,480
because

1990
01:22:18,359 --> 01:22:23,158
you know he was he came up on a plane

1991
01:22:21,479 --> 01:22:23,779
yeah

1992
01:22:23,158 --> 01:22:26,759
yeah

1993
01:22:23,779 --> 01:22:29,158
but um you know he didn't really know

1994
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:31,260
you know besides the names he would give

1995
01:22:29,158 --> 01:22:34,920
me for these seeds which you actually

1996
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:35,760
had a story attached you know that the

1997
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:37,920
um

1998
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:40,619
this you know there was never really any

1999
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:42,239
knowledge about what what was in it he

2000
01:22:40,619 --> 01:22:44,219
wasn't quite The Connoisseur that I was

2001
01:22:42,238 --> 01:22:45,599
and didn't didn't read as much stuff as

2002
01:22:44,219 --> 01:22:47,219
I did so

2003
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:48,780
and it was kind of up to me to figure

2004
01:22:47,219 --> 01:22:52,679
out what it was

2005
01:22:48,779 --> 01:22:54,719
after we grew it and smoked it and this

2006
01:22:52,679 --> 01:22:58,800
particular plant was

2007
01:22:54,719 --> 01:23:03,420
was an F1 hybrid with Tai and some sort

2008
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:07,260
of um Affy or Pakistan Annie

2009
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:09,119
um wide leaf and uh it was amazing you

2010
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:11,159
know that I talked about being an

2011
01:23:09,119 --> 01:23:13,500
in-school suspension and writing about

2012
01:23:11,158 --> 01:23:16,259
the Thai effect that I that I was

2013
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:18,420
experienced a couple years before

2014
01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:21,960
well that that analysis that

2015
01:23:18,420 --> 01:23:25,380
introspection that came from

2016
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:28,020
um from that exercise came you know had

2017
01:23:25,380 --> 01:23:31,140
become just you know locked in my mind

2018
01:23:28,020 --> 01:23:34,260
that's Thai wheat right that's me that

2019
01:23:31,140 --> 01:23:37,739
was what I knew it to be and so when I

2020
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:41,400
sat down with this with this thing

2021
01:23:37,738 --> 01:23:44,459
started smoking I recognized it was like

2022
01:23:41,399 --> 01:23:47,519
way you know the effects were literally

2023
01:23:44,460 --> 01:23:49,679
you know half of the effect of Thai weed

2024
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:53,640
with with this

2025
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:56,158
um kind of sedative effect of uh of the

2026
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:58,079
time of the Affy or Pakistani I always

2027
01:23:56,158 --> 01:24:00,960
thought it was Pakistani because the

2028
01:23:58,079 --> 01:24:02,698
leaves looked so from yeah and I don't

2029
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:04,260
know what your guys's thoughts are on it

2030
01:24:02,698 --> 01:24:06,299
but you know like when you guys were

2031
01:24:04,260 --> 01:24:09,679
talking about Thailand and Thai having

2032
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:12,480
like you know not all of it but like a

2033
01:24:09,679 --> 01:24:15,119
significant portion of it had a lot

2034
01:24:12,479 --> 01:24:18,000
wider leaves than Colombian

2035
01:24:15,119 --> 01:24:20,760
right was that something that

2036
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,658
um do you I I always wondered like was

2037
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:23,820
that

2038
01:24:21,658 --> 01:24:25,799
um you know do you think that Colombian

2039
01:24:23,819 --> 01:24:28,439
and Thai like do you think they took the

2040
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:30,480
same amount of time uh because I always

2041
01:24:28,439 --> 01:24:33,479
look at like Leaf width as basically

2042
01:24:30,479 --> 01:24:35,879
like a genetic thing on like the plant

2043
01:24:33,479 --> 01:24:37,379
the you know there's Sun panels right so

2044
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:40,140
it's like how much sun does the plant

2045
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:42,119
get and if it needs more sun it gets

2046
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:44,460
wider leaves to capture it and if it

2047
01:24:42,119 --> 01:24:47,340
needs less it's a little thinner right

2048
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:49,679
because it doesn't need to as much

2049
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:51,719
um uh you know and Matt and I and others

2050
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:53,819
we've had some like long talks about how

2051
01:24:51,719 --> 01:24:55,859
like if you look at Afghans if you look

2052
01:24:53,819 --> 01:24:57,658
at like stuff from like the the low

2053
01:24:55,859 --> 01:24:59,219
elevations

2054
01:24:57,658 --> 01:25:02,099
um a lot of that stuff is like your

2055
01:24:59,219 --> 01:25:03,840
traditional super fat Leaf indicas but

2056
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:06,719
then if you go up into like the the

2057
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:09,420
mountains areas like the Hindu Kush type

2058
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:11,399
type regions those indicas are much

2059
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:13,500
thinner leafed

2060
01:25:11,399 --> 01:25:15,960
um I don't know if that was like UV or

2061
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:19,380
the sun was stronger or they just didn't

2062
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:22,260
need to have as big solar panels

2063
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:24,239
um but what percentage like I'm maybe

2064
01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:26,159
you don't know but like would you say

2065
01:25:24,238 --> 01:25:28,259
that like much wider leaves than

2066
01:25:26,158 --> 01:25:30,359
Colombians or panamanians was like a

2067
01:25:28,260 --> 01:25:33,860
fairly distinctive trait of a lot of

2068
01:25:30,359 --> 01:25:33,859
ties that you saw

2069
01:25:33,899 --> 01:25:37,099
I didn't see it okay

2070
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:42,480
yeah me either you know I mean I grew

2071
01:25:40,319 --> 01:25:45,899
very little of it what I what I saw was

2072
01:25:42,479 --> 01:25:48,479
you know pictures of the wide Leaf Tie

2073
01:25:45,899 --> 01:25:50,939
um and people described it but that I

2074
01:25:48,479 --> 01:25:52,738
never had any experience with that but

2075
01:25:50,939 --> 01:25:55,738
the phenomenon you're talking about you

2076
01:25:52,738 --> 01:25:58,619
know wider weave at lower elevation or

2077
01:25:55,738 --> 01:26:00,119
or you know related to Elevation I

2078
01:25:58,619 --> 01:26:01,619
always thought that the width of the

2079
01:26:00,119 --> 01:26:04,800
leaf had something to do with

2080
01:26:01,619 --> 01:26:07,079
transpiration you know and maybe if

2081
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:09,539
they're an arid environments or humid

2082
01:26:07,079 --> 01:26:13,039
environments that you know that would

2083
01:26:09,539 --> 01:26:15,479
affect but honestly I I don't know

2084
01:26:13,039 --> 01:26:19,198
Lebanese tended to be

2085
01:26:15,479 --> 01:26:22,559
more narrow than like say a broadleaf

2086
01:26:19,198 --> 01:26:24,319
Afghani I do know that much and

2087
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:26,940
um I think they're in similar elevations

2088
01:26:24,319 --> 01:26:29,579
so I I think it has something to do with

2089
01:26:26,939 --> 01:26:31,439
transpiration a lot you know humidity

2090
01:26:29,579 --> 01:26:35,460
stuff like that

2091
01:26:31,439 --> 01:26:38,698
yeah or lack thereof yeah exactly you're

2092
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:41,279
protecting it I mean uh you know it it

2093
01:26:38,698 --> 01:26:44,819
uh I mean I was actually talking to

2094
01:26:41,279 --> 01:26:47,519
somebody from Kentucky uh majag who was

2095
01:26:44,819 --> 01:26:50,519
uh like really getting into like your

2096
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:53,520
experiences with um with you know on

2097
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:55,219
previous uh shows that we've done and he

2098
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:58,320
was talking about how like in Kentucky

2099
01:26:55,219 --> 01:27:01,439
they could water a patch about your size

2100
01:26:58,319 --> 01:27:04,019
with a few hundred gallons because it

2101
01:27:01,439 --> 01:27:06,419
was so humid there that the soil stayed

2102
01:27:04,020 --> 01:27:08,820
moist and you didn't really need that

2103
01:27:06,420 --> 01:27:10,260
much water to keep the soil wet and he

2104
01:27:08,819 --> 01:27:13,079
was like man this guy's out there in the

2105
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:15,539
desert and he's pouring thousands and

2106
01:27:13,079 --> 01:27:17,399
thousands of gallons down there just to

2107
01:27:15,539 --> 01:27:19,619
give the plant enough to drink you know

2108
01:27:17,399 --> 01:27:21,899
by the time he came back and I could do

2109
01:27:19,619 --> 01:27:25,019
the same size patch with like five

2110
01:27:21,899 --> 01:27:27,059
percent of the water right you know and

2111
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:28,500
that that's I I basically told them it's

2112
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:30,060
probably like you know you grow you're

2113
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:32,460
growing in a humid forest and he's

2114
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:34,500
growing in an arid desert-like

2115
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:36,899
environment to some degree

2116
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:39,960
how about people who live in Hawaii or

2117
01:27:36,899 --> 01:27:42,299
Jamaica we're in the rainy areas where

2118
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:44,698
it rains every day for an hour every

2119
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:47,100
afternoon you know they they don't

2120
01:27:44,698 --> 01:27:50,339
irrigate at all they it's all just

2121
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:52,860
natural yeah they don't have to irrigate

2122
01:27:50,340 --> 01:27:54,779
maybe with climate change that's

2123
01:27:52,859 --> 01:27:58,559
starting to

2124
01:27:54,779 --> 01:28:01,979
differ but traditionally my friend in

2125
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:03,120
Colombia he he once went down to the

2126
01:28:01,979 --> 01:28:06,779
West Coast

2127
01:28:03,119 --> 01:28:08,880
where they used to ship from and it

2128
01:28:06,779 --> 01:28:11,519
rained so much that the biggest problem

2129
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:14,279
with growing they grew tons and tons of

2130
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:17,520
wheat but to dry it they had to hang

2131
01:28:14,279 --> 01:28:20,099
huge tarps up like massive like tents

2132
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:23,580
like circus tents almost to to be able

2133
01:28:20,100 --> 01:28:24,900
to dry it there's no way around it you

2134
01:28:23,579 --> 01:28:27,300
know and it would probably take a lot

2135
01:28:24,899 --> 01:28:29,939
longer to dry in that humidity

2136
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:31,440
nature really you know it it presents

2137
01:28:29,939 --> 01:28:32,819
you know different benefits and

2138
01:28:31,439 --> 01:28:35,759
different challenges

2139
01:28:32,819 --> 01:28:37,500
for sure you know I mean in the in the

2140
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:39,780
midwest where I'm from you know they

2141
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:41,819
grow a lot of corn and soybeans they

2142
01:28:39,779 --> 01:28:43,500
don't irrigate it at all they're

2143
01:28:41,819 --> 01:28:45,719
completely dependent on the weather to

2144
01:28:43,500 --> 01:28:48,359
come along and just rain on their crops

2145
01:28:45,719 --> 01:28:51,119
where on the west coast where I live now

2146
01:28:48,359 --> 01:28:53,219
in California it's all irrigation

2147
01:28:51,119 --> 01:28:55,139
if you can't bring water to it you can't

2148
01:28:53,219 --> 01:28:57,439
grow it doesn't matter what kind of crop

2149
01:28:55,139 --> 01:28:57,440
you're doing

2150
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:02,520
of Chicago

2151
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:05,460
um 20 miles west of Chicago I grew up

2152
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:08,340
and my friend was

2153
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:09,658
one of my best friends One Summer got a

2154
01:29:08,340 --> 01:29:10,860
job with the company that was

2155
01:29:09,658 --> 01:29:13,619
eradicating

2156
01:29:10,859 --> 01:29:14,880
cannabis that was growing wild along the

2157
01:29:13,619 --> 01:29:17,639
railroads

2158
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:21,300
basically since World War II when they

2159
01:29:17,639 --> 01:29:22,980
were making rope out of it and he had a

2160
01:29:21,300 --> 01:29:26,340
map of all these spots that they were

2161
01:29:22,979 --> 01:29:29,399
going to go out to to destroy and we

2162
01:29:26,340 --> 01:29:31,800
would go there first and one time it

2163
01:29:29,399 --> 01:29:33,779
wasn't far from my home it was just

2164
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:36,060
growing and we had never noticed it

2165
01:29:33,779 --> 01:29:38,579
along the railroads and we harvested

2166
01:29:36,060 --> 01:29:41,639
like 20 pounds of this stuff and and

2167
01:29:38,579 --> 01:29:45,059
dried it and you could smoke an entire

2168
01:29:41,639 --> 01:29:46,920
joint and not get high oh yeah we called

2169
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:50,100
it we called it pretendica

2170
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:51,960
uh in fact you know this is obviously

2171
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:54,120
much later than that but I would

2172
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:55,859
sometimes I got Bamboozled when I was

2173
01:29:54,119 --> 01:29:57,840
growing up in Chicago and I would buy

2174
01:29:55,859 --> 01:30:00,299
these very expensive ounces that were

2175
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:02,400
Frosty and green and juicy and I was

2176
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:04,199
like oh man I'm really getting it and

2177
01:30:02,399 --> 01:30:06,658
then we'd smoke and smoke and smoke and

2178
01:30:04,198 --> 01:30:08,399
we'd be like this isn't working and like

2179
01:30:06,658 --> 01:30:10,500
even as good as the brown Mexican this

2180
01:30:08,399 --> 01:30:12,119
is really weird I'm not getting high and

2181
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:13,679
I had never heard of CBD I didn't know

2182
01:30:12,119 --> 01:30:16,198
what it was but it was ditch weed right

2183
01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:19,859
that's what it was it was just it was

2184
01:30:16,198 --> 01:30:21,960
just a ditch weed you know yeah and they

2185
01:30:19,859 --> 01:30:24,299
actually there was a thing called a hemp

2186
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:26,880
for victory or whatever where uh and

2187
01:30:24,300 --> 01:30:30,239
during World War II they grew millions

2188
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:33,359
of acres in the Midwest of hemp

2189
01:30:30,238 --> 01:30:36,238
um for you know uh everything from you

2190
01:30:33,359 --> 01:30:38,158
know ropes and sails and and you know

2191
01:30:36,238 --> 01:30:40,198
and duffel bags and all kinds of stuff

2192
01:30:38,158 --> 01:30:42,179
for the war effort and then as soon as

2193
01:30:40,198 --> 01:30:44,579
World War II ended they made it illegal

2194
01:30:42,179 --> 01:30:46,020
again but after growing that many seeded

2195
01:30:44,579 --> 01:30:48,059
crops

2196
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:50,760
um it basically permanently in Indiana

2197
01:30:48,060 --> 01:30:53,280
and Illinois some Wisconsin some Kansas

2198
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:55,199
that kind of thing it was just kind of a

2199
01:30:53,279 --> 01:30:56,939
permanent thing

2200
01:30:55,198 --> 01:30:59,519
um and the government would go out there

2201
01:30:56,939 --> 01:31:02,399
and collect money and they would go and

2202
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:04,080
eradicate all this like not wheat

2203
01:31:02,399 --> 01:31:06,619
but it looked like me

2204
01:31:04,079 --> 01:31:06,619
yep

2205
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:11,280
you know

2206
01:31:09,359 --> 01:31:13,019
they were protecting Society from

2207
01:31:11,279 --> 01:31:15,599
something that wouldn't work

2208
01:31:13,020 --> 01:31:17,219
I pre-rolled 100 joints of this in

2209
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:19,739
hitchhike to California it was the first

2210
01:31:17,219 --> 01:31:21,539
time I'd been to California and two guys

2211
01:31:19,738 --> 01:31:23,638
picked me up in Utah

2212
01:31:21,539 --> 01:31:25,679
in their Volkswagen and I beg them to

2213
01:31:23,639 --> 01:31:28,859
give me a ride they took me all the way

2214
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:31,619
to California it was like 1200 more

2215
01:31:28,859 --> 01:31:34,079
miles and in exchange I gave them the

2216
01:31:31,619 --> 01:31:36,059
100 joints and I said this is not very

2217
01:31:34,079 --> 01:31:38,039
good weed and I told them the whole

2218
01:31:36,060 --> 01:31:39,659
story and they said no problem we're

2219
01:31:38,039 --> 01:31:42,439
going to sell it at the high school and

2220
01:31:39,658 --> 01:31:42,439
they'll buy anything

2221
01:31:46,079 --> 01:31:52,500
joints and that was it

2222
01:31:49,219 --> 01:31:55,260
all right so uh that 82 crop you know I

2223
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:58,079
wound up with that that Thai Afghani or

2224
01:31:55,260 --> 01:32:00,480
Thai Pakistani plain weed and you know

2225
01:31:58,079 --> 01:32:04,158
the smoke told the tail you could

2226
01:32:00,479 --> 01:32:07,379
absolutely feel the exact same cerebral

2227
01:32:04,158 --> 01:32:10,079
introspective kind of thought surfing

2228
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:12,359
kind of you know floating from from

2229
01:32:10,079 --> 01:32:15,979
thought to thought but it had this

2230
01:32:12,359 --> 01:32:20,759
sedative effect it you know it um

2231
01:32:15,979 --> 01:32:24,059
it it made you sleepy and uh you know

2232
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:25,679
the taste was was Amplified

2233
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:27,600
um I'm not going to talk about the Thai

2234
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:30,840
Terps but but

2235
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:34,079
you know there was a the Citrus that was

2236
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:37,020
mixed in with with the Thai

2237
01:32:34,079 --> 01:32:39,899
um from the indica and the hashiness

2238
01:32:37,020 --> 01:32:41,760
that was just delicious it was honestly

2239
01:32:39,899 --> 01:32:43,979
it was maybe one of the best plants I'd

2240
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:46,920
ever smoked and if I had it right now

2241
01:32:43,979 --> 01:32:50,339
I'd hang up right now so that I could

2242
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:52,260
just smoke myself into a into a

2243
01:32:50,340 --> 01:32:55,319
Oblivion but um

2244
01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:58,020
no that that year was pretty amazing 82.

2245
01:32:55,319 --> 01:33:01,920
we had started off in a whole different

2246
01:32:58,020 --> 01:33:04,380
state and uh wound up having a brush

2247
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:07,859
with the law that I

2248
01:33:04,380 --> 01:33:09,600
kind of fast talked our way out of

2249
01:33:07,859 --> 01:33:12,359
and um

2250
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:16,020
we we came back home it was a travel

2251
01:33:12,359 --> 01:33:18,359
trailer filled with our plants and uh my

2252
01:33:16,020 --> 01:33:21,360
two partners who who I was growing with

2253
01:33:18,359 --> 01:33:22,559
you know after after things kind of went

2254
01:33:21,359 --> 01:33:24,960
bust

2255
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:27,719
they they'd had enough they they didn't

2256
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:30,658
want to try and do it back back home so

2257
01:33:27,719 --> 01:33:32,639
they said you can have the plants

2258
01:33:30,658 --> 01:33:34,679
and I spent

2259
01:33:32,639 --> 01:33:36,300
um I spent some time trying to find a

2260
01:33:34,679 --> 01:33:37,980
place to grow you know that's always the

2261
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:39,659
hardest part

2262
01:33:37,979 --> 01:33:41,638
um you make the wrong decision and you

2263
01:33:39,658 --> 01:33:45,839
wind up behind bars you know your life

2264
01:33:41,639 --> 01:33:48,840
ruins so uh some some friends of friends

2265
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:52,639
wound up coming to the rescue with a

2266
01:33:48,840 --> 01:33:56,279
place along some power lines and we we

2267
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:58,079
you know hauled the plants out there and

2268
01:33:56,279 --> 01:34:00,960
then for the rest of the summer I did

2269
01:33:58,079 --> 01:34:04,198
like 99 of the work

2270
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:06,179
uh you know raising these things this

2271
01:34:04,198 --> 01:34:08,698
this collection of of

2272
01:34:06,179 --> 01:34:12,420
seed lines from Northern California that

2273
01:34:08,698 --> 01:34:15,000
you know original original stuff

2274
01:34:12,420 --> 01:34:16,920
each each line different you know one of

2275
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:19,260
them looked like what today we'd call

2276
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:21,380
Afghani number one another one looked

2277
01:34:19,260 --> 01:34:21,380
like

2278
01:34:22,079 --> 01:34:27,840
so that um

2279
01:34:24,119 --> 01:34:29,880
called they called Kush and um it looked

2280
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:32,760
like what we know what we think of today

2281
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:35,819
when we say Williams Wonder it was just

2282
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:39,119
amazingly consistent morphology of the

2283
01:34:35,819 --> 01:34:41,519
plant every every leaf just like carbon

2284
01:34:39,119 --> 01:34:43,559
copies of the other the Symmetry the

2285
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:46,800
branches and the nodes

2286
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:49,860
and the the flowers just like these

2287
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:52,380
monstrous freaking balls at the end of

2288
01:34:49,859 --> 01:34:54,238
you know on on every node it was

2289
01:34:52,380 --> 01:34:56,639
gorgeous gorgeous plant

2290
01:34:54,238 --> 01:34:58,698
so you know it was a it was it was a

2291
01:34:56,639 --> 01:35:02,460
season of a Lifetime right there and

2292
01:34:58,698 --> 01:35:04,019
unfortunately somebody and you never you

2293
01:35:02,460 --> 01:35:06,779
know you never really find out who did

2294
01:35:04,020 --> 01:35:08,880
it but somebody wound up stealing half

2295
01:35:06,779 --> 01:35:11,039
the crop I showed up to water them one

2296
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:13,199
day and you know probably two or three

2297
01:35:11,039 --> 01:35:15,300
weeks left to go and show up to water

2298
01:35:13,198 --> 01:35:18,299
them and half the plants are gone right

2299
01:35:15,300 --> 01:35:21,119
now who steals half the plants you know

2300
01:35:18,300 --> 01:35:22,320
uh but when when you walk into something

2301
01:35:21,119 --> 01:35:24,479
like that the first thing you're

2302
01:35:22,319 --> 01:35:26,759
thinking is holy [ __ ] they're probably

2303
01:35:24,479 --> 01:35:28,198
like watching me right now because I

2304
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:30,600
just interrupted them while they were

2305
01:35:28,198 --> 01:35:34,138
stealing all the plants

2306
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:36,600
um but you know that that turns into

2307
01:35:34,139 --> 01:35:39,119
it's time to harvest everything right

2308
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:41,460
now and you know

2309
01:35:39,119 --> 01:35:42,779
um you know you take what you've got

2310
01:35:41,460 --> 01:35:44,039
left

2311
01:35:42,779 --> 01:35:45,300
um

2312
01:35:44,039 --> 01:35:47,760
but um

2313
01:35:45,300 --> 01:35:49,560
yeah that that plain wheat was really

2314
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:53,639
something special

2315
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:55,380
um and and it those those genetics

2316
01:35:53,639 --> 01:35:59,159
um turned into the foundation of what I

2317
01:35:55,380 --> 01:36:02,100
did for like the next the next six years

2318
01:35:59,158 --> 01:36:04,799
um you know wound up growing growing my

2319
01:36:02,100 --> 01:36:07,620
own F generations of of

2320
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:09,539
you know the the best a fees and

2321
01:36:07,619 --> 01:36:11,340
different hybrids that I've made for a

2322
01:36:09,539 --> 01:36:14,399
couple years and then I was like you

2323
01:36:11,340 --> 01:36:16,079
know what if I'm gonna do this

2324
01:36:14,399 --> 01:36:18,179
this is what I want to do for a living

2325
01:36:16,079 --> 01:36:21,238
you know I want to be a grower I want to

2326
01:36:18,179 --> 01:36:22,859
be a breeder I want to be the best

2327
01:36:21,238 --> 01:36:26,158
kind of like you know what Matt what

2328
01:36:22,859 --> 01:36:28,939
inspired mad Jag to to you know brand

2329
01:36:26,158 --> 01:36:31,738
his stuff and go in the canyon and

2330
01:36:28,939 --> 01:36:33,839
document what he did you know it was all

2331
01:36:31,738 --> 01:36:36,419
very very intentional but at the same

2332
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:39,659
time these days it just seems so you

2333
01:36:36,420 --> 01:36:41,819
know almost almost naive and innocent

2334
01:36:39,658 --> 01:36:43,319
you know that just anything seemed

2335
01:36:41,819 --> 01:36:45,960
possible and

2336
01:36:43,319 --> 01:36:48,420
you know the idea that you could you

2337
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:50,460
could uh be a pot grower for a living

2338
01:36:48,420 --> 01:36:53,219
and and you know

2339
01:36:50,460 --> 01:36:56,100
being High Times magazine like mad Jag

2340
01:36:53,219 --> 01:36:58,020
was it was uh it was pretty exciting for

2341
01:36:56,100 --> 01:37:00,659
young kids so

2342
01:36:58,020 --> 01:37:02,760
you know I went out to Mendo I

2343
01:37:00,658 --> 01:37:05,279
made arrangements with friends and

2344
01:37:02,760 --> 01:37:08,280
connections and wound up there you know

2345
01:37:05,279 --> 01:37:10,198
in the hills for for the summer and

2346
01:37:08,279 --> 01:37:12,059
um you know one of the reasons I think

2347
01:37:10,198 --> 01:37:14,399
they they

2348
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:17,280
they let me go out there and join them

2349
01:37:14,399 --> 01:37:19,559
on the hill was because my buddy told

2350
01:37:17,279 --> 01:37:21,599
him about my seed collection you know I

2351
01:37:19,560 --> 01:37:23,880
mean he had collected all the best stuff

2352
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:26,520
from their backyard sent it out to the

2353
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:28,679
east coast I took it worked it and was

2354
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:31,320
now bringing it back

2355
01:37:28,679 --> 01:37:34,139
they wanted it you know they they knew

2356
01:37:31,319 --> 01:37:35,880
that it was the good stuff so plus I

2357
01:37:34,139 --> 01:37:37,679
think he kind of portrayed me as some

2358
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:39,000
sort of you know young mad scientist

2359
01:37:37,679 --> 01:37:41,039
that was gonna

2360
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:42,539
you know teach him something but you

2361
01:37:41,039 --> 01:37:45,359
know when I got out there it was all

2362
01:37:42,539 --> 01:37:48,319
about digging holes and and shutting up

2363
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:48,319
and working um

2364
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:53,400
that was that was it was hard you know

2365
01:37:51,658 --> 01:37:56,779
being away from home and everything I

2366
01:37:53,399 --> 01:37:56,779
missed my girlfriend and

2367
01:37:56,939 --> 01:38:01,678
um but you know that that just didn't

2368
01:37:59,219 --> 01:38:04,020
work out the partnership got very tense

2369
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:07,020
and I was out there for almost three

2370
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:07,980
months before you know it was time I had

2371
01:38:07,020 --> 01:38:10,800
to go

2372
01:38:07,979 --> 01:38:12,059
and luckily you know while I was out

2373
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:15,900
there

2374
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:18,900
I went to a July 4th picnic at uh

2375
01:38:15,899 --> 01:38:21,238
at um bill kreutzman's

2376

and um you know my uh my partner had

2382
01:38:36,359 --> 01:38:41,219
rented a Mustang from the local car

2383
01:38:38,698 --> 01:38:43,859
rental place to go to this party it was

2384
01:38:41,219 --> 01:38:46,198
a big deal he'd you know collected a

2385
01:38:43,859 --> 01:38:48,658
bunch of party materials for us to enjoy

2386
01:38:46,198 --> 01:38:50,638
when we went didn't really tell me where

2387
01:38:48,658 --> 01:38:52,379
it was or what it was gonna what it was

2388
01:38:50,639 --> 01:38:54,719
going to be until we were sliding

2389
01:38:52,380 --> 01:38:57,600
sideways down down the Gravel Road off

2390
01:38:54,719 --> 01:39:01,139
the mountain to get there

2391
01:38:57,600 --> 01:39:05,900
um you know it was amazing showed up

2392
01:39:01,139 --> 01:39:09,719
you know to did my substances and um

2393
01:39:05,899 --> 01:39:11,849
you know it was uh it was it was pretty

2394
01:39:09,719 --> 01:39:13,698
it was trippy

2395
01:39:11,850 --> 01:39:16,739
[Music]

2396
01:39:13,698 --> 01:39:19,799
it was trippy you know there was music

2397
01:39:16,738 --> 01:39:22,259
and big big loud speakers and giant

2398
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:24,380
barbecue grills and Growers all around

2399
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:27,780
me and I didn't know anybody

2400
01:39:24,380 --> 01:39:30,199
my my boys and my boys that I came with

2401
01:39:27,779 --> 01:39:33,179
disappeared as soon as we got there and

2402
01:39:30,198 --> 01:39:36,259
you know basically I just kind of roamed

2403
01:39:33,179 --> 01:39:39,420
around until until it got late at night

2404
01:39:36,260 --> 01:39:43,639
and it turns out you know my my partner

2405
01:39:39,420 --> 01:39:47,699
I ran into one of the guys that had

2406
01:39:43,639 --> 01:39:49,800
provided the seeds that that were my

2407
01:39:47,698 --> 01:39:52,319
first pure indica

2408
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:52,920
in 1981.

2409
01:39:52,319 --> 01:39:54,599
um

2410
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:57,420
and uh

2411
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:59,039
I ran into him and it was like I've

2412
01:39:57,420 --> 01:40:01,619
desperately wanted those seeds back

2413
01:39:59,039 --> 01:40:04,619
because when I made my my f2s or

2414
01:40:01,619 --> 01:40:07,079
whatever I made a bad choice on what

2415
01:40:04,619 --> 01:40:08,939
female I just did and I you know I put

2416
01:40:07,079 --> 01:40:11,880
it on the big tall

2417
01:40:08,939 --> 01:40:14,158
giant Indica instead of the little short

2418
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:17,159
squat ping pong ball

2419
01:40:14,158 --> 01:40:18,960
cash plan indica and it turned out that

2420
01:40:17,158 --> 01:40:21,658
that was like you know that little short

2421
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:24,119
one was the once in a lifetime plan and

2422
01:40:21,658 --> 01:40:26,399
uh so every year after that I was

2423
01:40:24,119 --> 01:40:28,859
growing these seeds out and every time

2424
01:40:26,399 --> 01:40:30,179
you know as they grew and flowered I was

2425
01:40:28,859 --> 01:40:32,579
like damn it

2426
01:40:30,179 --> 01:40:33,420
you know why didn't I dust that other

2427
01:40:32,579 --> 01:40:36,059
one

2428
01:40:33,420 --> 01:40:37,619
but uh so I I when I saw this guy I was

2429
01:40:36,060 --> 01:40:39,239
like oh man I'll get the get the

2430
01:40:37,619 --> 01:40:40,738
original stuff I can get that short

2431
01:40:39,238 --> 01:40:43,259
plant back again

2432
01:40:40,738 --> 01:40:46,259
he was he was some sort of cokehead or

2433
01:40:43,260 --> 01:40:48,659
something by that point and he uh he did

2434
01:40:46,260 --> 01:40:50,880
he lost it he'd completely lost the line

2435
01:40:48,658 --> 01:40:53,339
it turned out he had stolen the line

2436
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:55,980
from his mother to begin with

2437
01:40:53,340 --> 01:40:59,159
probably a classic classic Mendo story

2438
01:40:55,979 --> 01:41:00,959
there but I'm sure I'm just having a

2439
01:40:59,158 --> 01:41:03,179
hard time thinking anybody would want to

2440
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:05,420
listen to this much of of us

2441
01:41:03,179 --> 01:41:08,399
you'd be you'd be shocked

2442
01:41:05,420 --> 01:41:11,279
like we don't think that same thing all

2443
01:41:08,399 --> 01:41:13,619
the time and we would debate heavily on

2444
01:41:11,279 --> 01:41:15,059
like how not to bore the pants off of

2445
01:41:13,619 --> 01:41:16,619
people

2446

outdoor they never did gorilla they

2451
01:41:25,198 --> 01:41:30,479
never did any of this stuff they came on

2452
01:41:27,119 --> 01:41:33,179
in an era where it was Instagram and it

2453
01:41:30,479 --> 01:41:34,859
was this and like so it's like a time

2454
01:41:33,179 --> 01:41:36,779
capsule and there's not even really that

2455
01:41:34,859 --> 01:41:39,000
many good places to go read about this

2456
01:41:36,779 --> 01:41:40,859
stuff and like you were talking about at

2457

the beginning of the show most people

2458
01:41:40,859 --> 01:41:44,460
that are talking about this stuff are

2459
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:46,139
trying to sell themselves

2460
01:41:44,460 --> 01:41:47,340
right they're trying to promote

2461
01:41:46,139 --> 01:41:49,440
something they're not actually

2462
01:41:47,340 --> 01:41:51,179
interested in the history they're

2463
01:41:49,439 --> 01:41:53,099
interested in a narrative

2464
01:41:51,179 --> 01:41:55,319
that promotes something they're

2465

2508

the show feel free to like it but if

2510
01:43:39,899 --> 01:43:43,859
it's your second viewing we ask a gentle

2511
01:43:42,359 --> 01:43:45,960
person's agreement that you click the

2512
01:43:43,859 --> 01:43:48,238
Subscribe button it costs you nothing

2513
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:50,158

2514
01:43:48,238 --> 01:43:52,379
sneaky YouTube algorithm

2515
01:43:50,158 --> 01:43:54,539
