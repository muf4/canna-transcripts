1
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,760
what's up everyone so i'm sick tonight

2
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:20,159
so i probably won't be talking a whole

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,880
lot not so hopefully we'll be doing most

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,240
of the talking like usual um

5
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:26,719
but yeah

6
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:28,640
our riot seedco account got blocked from

7
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:30,399
going live and i found that out the

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,399
second i tried to go live

9
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:35,199
that's [ __ ] weird but i do get

10
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,600
reported a lot so whatever [ __ ] them

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,440
we'll do it on this uh platform and it

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,760
may be a smaller show but i don't really

13
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:45,839
give a [ __ ] so all the people who want

14
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,839
to be here will be here oh

15
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:50,399
and if y'all look back there

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,640
look at that beauty that is a tender

17
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,879
telecaster look at that [ __ ] hey what's

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,439
up hey

19
00:00:54,878 --> 00:01:00,000
yeah so oh oh

20
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:03,358
[ __ ] uh instagram blocked me because

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,920
someone's been reporting me i wonder who

22
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:09,359
i mean uh you're popular

23
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:12,960
i yeah yeah it could be any one of my my

24
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:14,478
loyal adoring fans so you know so we can

25
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:18,798
uh

26
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:21,118
yeah i mean it it's hard to to uh

27
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,118
um

28
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,079
it's definitely got the potential for

29
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:25,679
abuse

30
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:26,959
yeah i mean if

31
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,400
if you want to tell history you're going

32
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:29,679
to be pissing people off no matter what

33
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,520
you do no matter what you're talking

34
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,720
about no matter which subject it is

35
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:35,039
because there's always someone making

36
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:37,118
money off the subject you know

37
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,118
oh yeah there's people that are make

38
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:41,438
there's people that like

39
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:42,560
uh what is it the more mystery less

40
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:44,398
history

41
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,159
yes yes

42
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,920
that's like relationship advice but i

43
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,000
guess it comes into play with cannabis

44
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,719
you know it does it does i was thinking

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,200
like

46
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,319
even in ufos dude people go [ __ ] nuts

47
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,159
on each other when they don't

48
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:57,359
necessarily believe the same exact you

49
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,439
know thing

50
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,759
and and they report each other and they

51
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:04,078
get real nasty and like dox each other

52
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,159
and swat each other i mean everybody

53
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:07,279
likes science until it challenges their

54
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,280
assumptions

55
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,199
yeah there you go i mean

56
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,159
you know and it's rare

57
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:13,919
that

58
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:15,520
science is going to back you up on

59
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,399
everything that you believe

60
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,319
yeah yeah exactly oh wow we do have 80

61
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,680
people in here so that's a plus it is

62
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:25,839
like this account being much smaller

63
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,280
it's it's looks like it's popping up so

64
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,719
and it's only been a couple of minutes

65
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,519
so hopefully

66
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:33,759
uh more people pop on

67
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,759
and whatnot and i guess if if we're

68
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:37,518
interesting enough we'll have a podcast

69
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:39,598
on it or something too maybe so we'll

70
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,959
see yeah we'll see how it goes we'll see

71
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:42,000
how it goes

72
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,319
all right is there anything you wanted

73
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,959
to touch on early on

74
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:49,439
uh well i mean we kind of like uh we

75
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,680
were kind of going to have a grab bag of

76
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:54,000
things to chat about today we were going

77
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,319
to talk a little bit

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,158
since it kind of ties into what you and

79
00:02:56,318 --> 00:02:59,359
csi have going on we were going to kind

80
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:01,359
of touch on

81
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,400
a little bit of hawaiian history and

82
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:08,239
what hawaiian means in general in terms

83
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,519
of cannabis you know yeah um and uh you

84
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,280
know and then we were gonna then there

85
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,759
was something that kind of irritated

86
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,280
both of us about terpenes and some other

87
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:17,280
stuff that we were gonna [ __ ] about

88
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,479
i think that's right i printed this out

89
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,840
too so so we can you know so yeah you

90
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:24,238
know um

91
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,039
so not too bad so

92
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,120
maybe what we can do we got 91 people in

93
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,439
climbing so that's pretty positive

94
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,840
yeah um so maybe what we can do is we'll

95
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,479
we'll keep off the the

96
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,239
semi-controversial stuff for a little

97
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:39,119
bit and we'll start on

98
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,560
we'll start on the on hawaiian right

99
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,158
hawaii

100
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,719
to be hawaiian so uh so hawaiian is

101
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:47,598
interesting hawaii is a trippy place

102
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:49,840
because

103
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:51,518
i believe it's the farthest islands from

104
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,640
a continent

105
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,438
in the world

106
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,238
yep

107
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:56,560
right

108
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,319
um of of one of the seven continents

109
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,080
it's the farthest it's the farthest

110
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:04,878
thing and so um there are no

111
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,280
there's not much on hawaii that's native

112
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:09,120
yeah of any kind anything most things

113
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,438
are non-native to hawaii because it's

114
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,840
essentially a volcanic island chain in

115
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:14,959
the middle of nowhere

116
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,319
right um

117
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,399
but one of the interesting things about

118
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:21,279
hawaii hawaii is that

119
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:24,959
um hawaii i believe is the only american

120
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:27,198
state that's actually in the tropics

121
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:30,478
oh yeah that would make sense so like

122
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,160
even even if you go down to like say um

123
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,719
florida like the very southern tip of

124
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,479
florida or the florida keys for instance

125
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,479
yeah those are still considered the

126
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:41,120
subtropics

127
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:44,399
yes not actual tropics yeah right what

128
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,399
about what about guam

129
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,040
you know guam isn't a state

130
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,519
that's that's true yeah it's a territory

131
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,600
territory uh and i will admit that i'm

132
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:55,359
not familiar with all of america's

133
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,800
territories and where they may or may

134
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,639
not be located

135
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,400
yeah i only know that guam people are

136
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,079
called chamorin that's i learned that

137
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:04,319
because i had a friend that was from

138
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,639
guam and i said he was guamanian he got

139
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,319
real pissed but but i'll say this like

140
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,120
from the perspective that we're speaking

141
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:11,038
of

142
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,439
if you're doing something in the united

143
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:15,199
states in the 50 united states you don't

144
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:16,800
go through customs the same way as if

145
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,680
you're outside of it

146
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,639
yeah

147
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,959
so

148
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,960
um you know we've got this you know i i

149
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:25,038
don't have it but um they they're doing

150
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:28,560
some you know hawaiian lights and i have

151
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:30,000
a pretty old strain from hawaii and so

152
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,800
we thought we'd chat about what that

153
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,600
meant

154
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,120
so there is no wheat unlike most of what

155
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,439
we talk about where

156
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,079
mexican or colombian or panamanian or

157
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:42,160
thai or african or any of this [ __ ]

158
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,159
there really is no

159
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,479
record of

160
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,479
marijuana in hawaii

161
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:49,519
um much before

162
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:52,719
you know

163
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:54,560
the 60s or something yeah you know um so

164
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,199
there's not like there wasn't really any

165
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,800
indigenous cultures cultivating it there

166
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,680
yeah right

167
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,840
and

168
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,720
so there's an aspect where

169
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:05,198
um

170
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,960
you know it's rumored uh and they

171
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,879
certainly were involved that the

172
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:10,959
brotherhood of eternal love

173
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:13,680
yeah um that was one of the locations

174
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:17,038
that they used to grow cannabis um

175
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,879
before helicopters flew yeah and

176
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:21,199
so as a result of that

177
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:23,199
a lot of the common strains back then uh

178
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,360
mexican colombian that kind of thing

179
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,038
could be grown successfully out there

180
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,639
yeah even today

181
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:30,079
in hawaii

182
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,840
most people if they want to grow in

183
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:34,240
hawaii they veg

184
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:35,758
indoors or in greenhouses with

185
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,240
artificial lighting

186
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,240
because it's it's basically so close to

187
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,000
1212 there all the time

188
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,840
that anything that we normally grow in

189
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,319
our in in our stuff unless it's some

190
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:49,119
kind of pure equatorial sativa would

191
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,879
flower immediately upon going outside

192
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,120
oh wow i didn't know that

193
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,319
yeah i mean it's it's it's you know i

194
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,800
mean that's part of the reason why

195
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,960
equatorials take so long yeah is they

196
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,478
don't have any like wintertime pressure

197
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,519
where they have to create seed before

198
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:03,758
they die

199
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:05,598
yeah it's always kind of warm and nice

200
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,520
and there's not you know you take

201
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:09,279
afghanistan or hindu kush or something

202
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,038
like that where there's a pretty good

203
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:14,000
amount of difference between daytime and

204
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:15,680
nighttime versus summer and winter and

205
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,079
in the equatorial regions there's not a

206
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,360
big difference yeah it might be a couple

207
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:23,198
of hours

208
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,598
yeah right um and so you might be 12 12

209
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,478
or you might be 13 and 11 or you might

210
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:30,800
be 11 and 13 but you don't really vary

211
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:32,000
much beyond that little

212
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,360
aspect

213
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,918
yeah um

214
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,000
so hawaiian hawaiian basically is a

215
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:40,000
catch-all term for anything

216
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,879
in hawaii

217
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,759
yeah

218
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:45,759
right yeah uh and what apparently what

219
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,639
used to be grown out there

220
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,400
was some combination of colombians

221
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,918
mexicans ties

222
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,239
and uh

223
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:56,240
um and then some of that stuff was mixed

224
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,319
with afghans

225
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,639
for structure and weight and this and

226
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,240
that you know and and all that type of

227
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,280
stuff so

228
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,360
um

229
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,758
you know when when for instance like

230
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,919
they were talking about you know the the

231
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,400
stuff that seattle greg and those guys

232
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:14,240
were getting in the 70s or 80s

233
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:16,399
that they were mixing with their afghans

234
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,680
they were getting hawaiian

235
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:20,079
right

236
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,439
but you know that was probably some

237
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:25,198
combination of colombian thai mexican uh

238
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:28,399
blended together

239
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,598
and or maybe mixed with afghan

240
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:32,240
yeah

241
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:33,759
is kind of is kind of that you know and

242
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,959
so

243
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:38,399
um hawaii used to be a pretty bomb place

244
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:41,038
to grow cannabis

245
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,519
uh and then the problem became is when

246
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:46,240
the helicopter started flying in the

247
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,399
early 80s and stuff um there's not very

248
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,560
much land mass in hawaii

249
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,240
yeah so it's not it

250
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:53,759
it's not like northern california or

251
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,919
other areas where they just have this

252
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:58,799
vast area to search through

253
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:00,240
yeah there's you know volcanic areas

254
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:02,958
that it's really easy to see if there's

255
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,600
a weed growing there's jungle areas that

256
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:08,079
are unsuitable there's only so many

257
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,120
you know human area human habitation

258
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,399
areas and so the area they have to cover

259
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,799
is pretty small

260
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,399
yeah it wouldn't be too hard to just

261
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:18,879
fly up a little bit and see so there was

262
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,240
a big boom in the 60s and 70s of people

263
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:22,399
growing out there

264
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,039
and then as soon as

265
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,360
the helicopters started flying a lot of

266
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:30,399
people got a lot you know hawaii kind of

267
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,480
ceased being an export place

268
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,399
on any major level i'm not saying that

269
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,240
it wasn't some of it still didn't exist

270
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,399
but a lot of it moved into greenhouses

271
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,399
and moved on to the edge of jungles it

272
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,559
became really difficult to get off off

273
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:46,240
any kind of large-scale stuff

274
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:48,239
yeah because the islands are so small so

275
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,320
when matt did his interview with with

276
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,240
greg i think was the very first breeder

277
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,120
syndicate interview

278
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,278
um

279
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,519
you know he talked about he thought that

280
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:59,360
the hawaiian that they were using an nl5

281
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,519
was some blend of

282
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,800
mexican and colombian

283
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,799
yeah

284
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:06,879
was his was his that was his take on it

285
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:09,199
yeah that was his take some kind of

286
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:10,879
mexican colombian which would have been

287
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,360
uh pretty common because that would have

288
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:15,200
been two of the main imports

289
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,039
seeded weed imports that were coming

290
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,959
into america at the time

291
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:22,559
yeah right

292
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:25,759
um and uh you know and so i have a small

293
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,799
tie to uh to hawaiian uh not that i

294
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:28,319
lived there or anything like that

295
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:30,958
because i never did but

296
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,800
um one of the strains that i still have

297
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:36,399
is we call it the maui

298
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:39,838
and of all places i met a guy from maui

299
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,958
in the in 94 in amsterdam who had come

300
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,560
out there to

301
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,439
trade seeds with some of the breeders

302
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,119
out there

303
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,560
and we shared a joint and stuff like

304
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,720
that and i was with some friends and he

305
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:51,039
gave us a small handful of seeds

306
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,360
and uh one of them became the maui

307
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:55,039
so they have truck stops in

308
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,000
hawaii is what you're saying

309
00:10:55,039 --> 00:11:01,519
so or i'm in amsterdam i mean so they uh

310
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,200
they i mean they have a whole district

311
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,720
district you know they don't even have

312
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,440
they don't even call it they just they

313
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,759
just it's very much more open there so

314
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,320
um and so being 19 or whatever the [ __ ]

315
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,519
i was i asked zero intelligent questions

316
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,600
of this man

317
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,519
uh i thought he was a super old-timer

318
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,759
which he was probably about my age he

319
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,000
was probably mid-forties but to a 19

320
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:24,480
year old yeah he seemed a grizzled

321
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,799
veteran yeah i'm sure you know

322
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,360
and that trip i spent thousands of

323
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:31,599
dollars on seeds uh and the only thing

324
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,360
that i ended up keeping was this female

325
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,200
from a handful of seeds that he gave me

326
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,240
when we shared a joint

327
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,000
wow

328
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,519
it was pretty much all the dutch stuff

329
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,320
out of all the dutchess that that

330
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,320
particular trip uh which was was one it

331
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,200
was my it was actually my first trip to

332
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:50,399
amsterdam believe it or not in 94. um

333
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,240
that particular trip um i didn't find

334
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,159
anything that was a keeper amongst the

super skunk yeah um

343
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,919
from them

344
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,519
um you know i bought some uh

345
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:19,039
you know i i

346
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,000
i think i bought some bubble gum that

347
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:22,879
year

348
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,240
yeah um i bought i bought a a random i

349
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:25,360
bought some stuff from maybe dutch

350
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,839
passion

351
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,480
anyway i was stupid um and instead of

352
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,160
buying well i was 19 right so instead of

353
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,959
buying like three or four things and

354
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:38,319
buying like you know 50 seeds of each

355
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:40,719
thing yeah i bought like 15 or 18 things

356
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,560
and like one or two packs of each yeah

357
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,240
right so then you like crack a pack and

358
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:46,399
it's ten seeds and you get four females

359
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,159
and you don't like any of them yeah and

360
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,000
i was that wasn't at the era i was so

361
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:52,000
young then that wasn't at the era where

362
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,159
we were like keeping males or breeding

363
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,759
or anything like that right

364
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:58,000
um so that's the other thing too is i

365
00:12:55,759 --> 00:13:01,039
got that maui and we tossed all the

366
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,278
males because they were [ __ ] useless

367
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:05,278
right what are we gonna do with those

368
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:07,519
you know um

369
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:08,639
but uh but so hawaiian hawaiian is

370
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,320
definitely

371
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,079
you know in that it's kind of it's in

372
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,240
the lexicon right

373
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:17,679
and you know someone just said oh maui

374
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,839
wowie uh maui wowie was is kind of like

375
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:22,159
matanuska [ __ ] or this or that or

376
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,360
whatever it's a catch-all term

377
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:25,439
it was

378
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,000
it was originally

379
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,279
made by a guy named eddie from the

380
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,839
brotherhood of eternal love so there

381
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:33,360
really was a maui wowie at one time

382
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,600
unlike madness of [ __ ] we can't

383
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,399
trace it to one person but that one we

384
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,320
can but what has become maui wowie i

385
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,399
think most of what we see is maui wowie

386
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,519
are mostly afghan dominant types yeah

387
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,240
and they

388
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,039
um you know they used to uh they used to

389
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,079
ship

390
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:52,480
uh some of that stuff in macadamia nuts

391
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:53,919
oh wow they did they used to ship it to

392
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,560
the states they used to hide it in the

393
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:59,360
center of macadamia nut tins yeah that's

394
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:02,000
funny and stuff like that and so

395
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,680
you know hawaiian was sort of a was sort

396
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,360
of a catch-all phrase there is no

397
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:08,319
indigenous hawaiian

398
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:11,519
yeah right it was all basically

399
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:14,240
entrepreneurs bringing other indigenous

400
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:17,278
weed to hawaii and trying to figure out

401
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,519
how to get worthwhile buds

402
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:22,240
is basically what it boiled down to

403
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,159
um and uh

404
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,159
you know what's interesting about like

405
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:27,278
the the hawaiian that i have what we

406
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:28,559
call them and the only reason why we

407
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:30,159
call it the maui

408
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:32,479
is because i was dumb and i didn't ask

409
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:34,078
any [ __ ] questions so

410
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,839
uh the only thing that we knew was the

411
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:37,278
dude was from maui

412
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,920
yeah

413
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:43,919
um but that's it right i met fast eddie

414
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:46,078
i doubt you met you met fast eddie um

415
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:49,360
because uh the fast daddy that you

416
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:50,559
probably met was a very famous dude from

417
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,440
dead tour

418
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:54,078
uh

419
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,079
who is part of the wrecking crew

420
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:58,719
uh maybe you met fast betty from the

421
00:14:56,078 --> 00:15:00,638
brotherhood of eternal love but around

422
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,480
but i yeah i've never been able to get a

423
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,159
hold of him i've tried a lot but the

424
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,560
fact the fast eddie that most people are

425
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:09,439
familiar with um is from the wrecking

426
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:11,518
crew he was he was a pretty famous uh

427
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,360
person on he goes yeah that guy it was

428
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,399
it was a pretty famous dude on deadlock

429
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,480
if you went to dead tour uh on any level

430
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:21,120
um you probably heard him be like doug

431
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,879
says he had the deepest voice dow says

432
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,320
he would scream at little kids and stuff

433
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:27,838
and they were all drunk and they were

434
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,839
just a mess but anyway

435
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,480
um

436
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:36,719
so there's an aspect where

437
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,440
uh you know so that's hawaiian hawaiian

438
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,519
is anything that got brought to hawaii

439
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,079
and got grown there

440
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,839
yeah basically right yeah um and then it

441
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:47,519
just gets the name hawaiian and just

442
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,519
like a lot of like we've talked about

443
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,000
this before but just like a lot of stuff

444
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,839
where it obscures like we give nicknames

445
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,839
to things and it obscures the origin of

446
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,040
where it came from yeah that's what

447
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,600
hawaiian did

448
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:01,439
you know seattle grey got hawaiian

449
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,000
which isn't very helpful

450
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:07,199
did he get pure mexican pure colombian a

451
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,559
blend a blend with afghan

452
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:11,120
he didn't know

453
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:13,359
yeah they they said he could tell was

454
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,278
after uh mexican colombian because the

455
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,120
best we could tell was mexican colombian

456
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:18,720
you know and so

457
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,240
you know um

458
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,278
and so that's what got blended in and

459
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,919
back then

460
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:25,360
especially you know nobody knew that all

461
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:26,799
this stuff was going to be famous and

462
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,440
lineage and all that was going to get

463
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:32,000
poured over and be super important right

464
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,600
yeah and notes were a bad thing

465
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,198
so it is like saying oh i got the

466
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,040
californian

467
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:38,479
there was a california indica that made

468
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:40,240
it around the answer i got i got the

469
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,079
californian you know it's about it it

470
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,120
like gives you an idea of where the area

471
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:44,078
was from

472
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,360
right

473
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:46,319
and so

474
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,399
um

475
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,000
you know what's interesting is that

476
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,639
being that i'm not from hawaii and i

477
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,720
don't really have any ties there um

478
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,560
i do have we i do have some good friends

479
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,879
that grew up on the island on various

480
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:01,919
islands and grown there their whole life

481
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:05,359
yeah and when i showed them um pictures

482
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:07,599
and flowers of uh my maui cut they did

483
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:09,678
say that there was that wasn't that

484
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,678
uncommon of a phenotype that they had

485
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,519
seen in the past in hawaiian that they

486
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,919
had grown from the past

487
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:19,119
yeah you know um so hawaii is sort of

488
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,640
like a catch-all from people get stuff

489
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,000
you know i mean like like there was even

490
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,480
a thing we were talking about a couple

491
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,279
episodes ago during the chem dog episode

492
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,679
where

493
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:29,839
um there's a maui dog

494
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,480
yeah why is it called maui dog because

495
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:34,480
someone got a supposedly a dog bud seed

496
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,640
and took it to maui

497
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,519
yeah popped it on maui and now it's maui

498
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,200
dog

499
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:41,918
you know so the interesting thing

500
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,919
there's some pictures of maui on my page

501
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,960
it's really interesting it's huge it's

502
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,880
chunky

503
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,360
uh it's pretty short it's got a bunch of

504
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,280
afghan influence but if you look at it

505
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,719
the leaves are incredibly skinny and

506
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,399
double serrated

507
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,120
yeah

508
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,120
there's this asp

509
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,359
yeah

510
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:04,240
um

511
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:06,719
is my audio kicking out

512
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,160
it's just on my back off from your

513
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,600
video

514
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,200
kinda i mean we can hear you but it's

515
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:13,038
just off from your speaking you look

516
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,720
like you're in a kung fu movie i look

517
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:16,720
like i'm on a kung fu is it better now

518
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:21,199
no wait it'll work

519
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:23,359
it'll work so sorry that uh sorry that

520
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,480
it's ad-libbed or whatever like i'm i'm

521
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:28,319
dubbed

522
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:30,319
uh hopefully that changes but um

523
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:34,240
but yeah so my maui

524
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:37,519
uh is you know csi is always looking to

525
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,279
um do things that match right and so in

526
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:41,119
addition to my headband you know i've

527
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:43,759
shared a bunch of stuff with him in the

528
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:46,159
hopes that he would breed it uh and it

529
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:48,319
would get out to a wider audience a bit

530
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,919
and um one of the things that's going to

531
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:55,119
get dropped with matt and and csi is

532
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:57,120
um my maui by the hawaiian lights

533
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:59,918
i think it's i don't know if that one or

534
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:02,319
maui by nl5 it might just be it might be

535
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,200
maui by nl5 yeah but anyway he used it

536
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:04,079
so

537
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,000
um

538
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:07,839
you know and so there's an aspect too

539
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,919
where it's like

540
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:12,159
you know uh it's it's been out there

541
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,919
before there's a cut from mandelbrot

542
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,720
called the truth

543
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,880
which is uh maui by superdog that i made

544
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,960
20 plus years ago or something like that

545
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,480
um so it's percolated around and it's

546
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,558
kind of been a mendo it's been a

547
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,880
mendocino county classic

548
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:28,879
because it's uh probably not now with

549
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,960
the way the market is but for a long

550
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,360
time it was one of those cuts that you

551
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,960
could put outside reliably get four or

552
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:36,839
five pounds off it and it would be done

553
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,720
in the middle of october

554
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:40,879
yeah

555
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,880
you know decent that's very decent and

556
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,320
it's pretty i remember i remember seeing

557
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,919
pictures of it i've never uh i don't

558
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:47,279
think i've ever smoked maui but i've

559
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,960
never seen pictures of it and thinking

560
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:50,798
it was absolutely gorgeous especially

561
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,120
for an outdoor plant yeah and it turns

562
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:54,720
purple in the cold you know and stuff

563
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:56,879
like that and it's it's obviously some

564
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,038
kind of sativa afghan blend because if

565
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,440
you look at the buds and the density and

566
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:04,000
how quick it finishes it's got a heavy

567
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,080
afghan you know but its leaves are like

568
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,919
that's i mean it's like super skinny

569
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:09,678
leaves they don't even fatten really

570
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,038
they're just like consistently skinny

571
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,120
the whole way down and they've got a

572
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:14,879
bunch of double serrations

573
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:15,839
what's it smell like

574
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,080
um

575
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:20,399
you know it smells kind of

576
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:22,639
it smell i mean it's one of those ones

577
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,960
where when i asked oh god let's not do

578
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,759
that yet cause i'll get all irritated uh

579
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,200
it

580
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:28,879
it's one of those ones where i've asked

581
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,840
trimmers for years and years what it

582
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:35,600
smells like yeah um and you get ranges

583
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:38,879
from my favorite is uh you know wrigley

584
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:41,199
uh wrigley fruity gum

585
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,159
that's a good smell you know um it's got

586
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,080
a super distinctive smell and i will say

587
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,039
jokingly that it's uh i joke that it's

588
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:50,000
like my longest female relationship

589
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:52,558
because

590
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,038
we popped that seed in 1994

591
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:56,480
yeah and i still have it

592
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:57,279
so she's

593
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,679
uh

594
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:00,798
28 years this year

595
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,360
28

596
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:05,279
yeah [ __ ] old yeah that's really old

597
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:06,558
it's [ __ ] old and so i've had her

598
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:09,759
literally i

599
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:11,918
she was the next to the crystal chunk

600
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:14,960
um she was the second weed that i ever

601
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:17,280
really started religiously cropping

602
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,279
yeah um and if you're in indiana or

603
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:20,960
chicago or illinois area and you ever

604
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:22,639
smoked the maui it's very likely it's

605
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,159
the same cut

606
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,559
because that's where we cropped it first

607
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,000
and a bunch of friends um grew it out

608
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:29,119
there and probably still grow it here

609
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,359
and there

610
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:34,000
you know yeah it's not elite by today's

611
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:36,479
standards in terms of like the high but

612
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,400
it's probably it's got a good high

613
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,558
but it's it's not up there with the best

614
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,159
of the best in my opinion you know but

615
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:44,798
yeah it's got a bunch of amazing

616
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,960
qualities and it it's um

617
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:49,440
you know it breeds really well for for

618
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,880
color and frost and structure and all

619
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,360
that type of stuff

620
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,600
um it's really consistent and

621
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:59,839
uh it'll probably be another show but it

622
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:59,839
is blended into some very famous stuff

623
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,678
you know that we won't dive into

624
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:04,400
um

625
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:09,679
but

626
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:10,960
uh all i know is uh all i know is um

627
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,280
where it's from

628
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,558
yeah that's the totality

629
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:16,000
that's how it goes it was from an old

630
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:17,678
dude on maui that had been growing there

631
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,359
for a long time and he basically said he

632
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,360
grew things and acclimated him there and

633
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:23,359
he came over to amsterdam to trade seeds

634
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:27,038
with friends yeah and he would bring

635
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:28,479
stuff back and mix it into his lines

636
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:30,798
so he said it was an afghan that

637
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,759
finished quick and yielded well and was

638
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:35,839
rot resistant and you could see the

639
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:37,200
you know you could see the the sativa in

640
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:39,759
it and so

641
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,000
i have pretty high hopes uh that csi

642
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:44,798
will blend into a few different things

643
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,079
um because it's such a stable breeder

644
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:47,119
and the other part about it that i

645
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:49,119
really like

646
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:51,119
is that when any time you get anything

647
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:53,839
that's that old

648
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:55,678
its lineage ties to something completely

649
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:56,879
different than what's a mishmash of

650
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,038
today

651
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,760
yeah that's true anything from the mid

652
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:03,759
90s doesn't really have any of the most

653
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:06,879
famous 40 or 50 cuts that we usually

654
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:08,558
talk about that's in it yeah

655
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,159
so a lot of times when you're breeding

656
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:11,759
you get the best results when you start

657
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,080
breeding things that are kind of unlike

658
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:17,279
each other and not too related

659
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:20,079
um so it's not related to chem or kush

660
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:22,639
or this or that or da da da da da da you

661
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:24,000
know and so it hasn't been overused and

662
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,280
over blended

663
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,839
um

664
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:30,798
you know and so there's uh matt sent me

665
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:31,839
a a a thing this morning um about all

666
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:34,000
the

667
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:35,359
um

668
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,558
i'm sorry i started reading stuff and

669
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:38,639
got distracted

670
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:41,359
but you know we could one day do i we

671
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:44,480
have some good friends that probably uh

672
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:47,119
would be a a lot better experts on like

673
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,720
hawaiian growing culture and famous

674
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:51,599
strains and stuff like that i don't

675
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,679
really feel it's like my place to like

676
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:55,519
lead a kind of discussion like that it's

677
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,720
not an area where my knowledge goes

678
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:58,639
hella deep

679
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,558
yeah you know i couldn't talk on molokai

680
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,480
frost like people are asking or quite

681
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:04,158
electric i couldn't talk on any of that

682
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,319
yeah i mean you know i've heard plenty

683
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,559
of stories second hand i've had you know

684
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:10,879
i know a bunch of growers uh from over

685
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:11,839
there and stuff like that over the years

686
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,159
um

687
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:15,678
you know but you know we could do a

688
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,799
whole episode

689
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,798
uh where people could ask questions um

690
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:22,480
you know but i we did think it was worth

691
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:24,558
mentioning we did think it was cool to

692
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,640
talk about because hawaiian is sort of

693
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:29,440
getting like brought back in because of

694
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,440
this interest in the nl and the nl5 and

695
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,278
what greg was doing and

696
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,880
and you know maybe maybe there's an

697
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:38,558
aspect of like talking about what

698
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,440
hawaiian was yeah yeah was beneficial

699
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:42,399
so

700
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,159
you know hawaiian is is sort of and like

701
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,880
what hawaiian was

702
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:49,760
isn't what hawaiian is that's correct

703
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,520
yeah because what hawaiian was back then

704
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:53,519
might have been a mix of colombian and

705
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:54,879
mexican and some afghans and stuff that

706
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:57,440
the brotherhood of eternal love was

707
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,200
doing but hawaii now

708
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,320
is just another place that clones get

709
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,558
sent right so it's got cherry pie and

710
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:07,519
it's got skunks and it's got this and

711
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:09,918
it's got chems and da da da da da and

712
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:12,240
you know so on and so and whatnot um

713
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:15,520
yeah it is a cool place in the sense

714
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,640
that there's uh you know it's super

715
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:18,000
humid there

716
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,480
and um

717
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,798
it's a totally different environment and

718
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,720
so you have to find things that do well

719
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:26,240
in that environment

720
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,400
yeah you know what i that would be a

721
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,720
good idea maybe we can have paccololo in

722
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,080
paradise on and yeah that's why i just

723
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,919
want to talk about it we have some

724
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:36,240
resources and some friends that would be

725
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,559
far more educated uh because that's

726
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,000
their neck of the woods yeah to talk

727
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:40,879
about that kind of stuff than we would

728
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,079
be

729
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,440
i just wanted to bring it up in the

730
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:45,839
sense that we've been getting a bunch of

731
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,480
questions about hawaiian

732
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:50,639
and hawaiian lights and

733
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,839
what's what's your maui and stuff like

734
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,840
that and

735
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:55,278
you know maui is one of those ones where

736
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:57,119
i even lost it

737
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:59,038
sadly for a number of years due to some

738
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:02,079
unfortunate circumstances

739
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:05,038
um but because it was a classic grown by

740
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:07,359
old timers around my area in mendo

741
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:09,119
um it it it lived

742
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:11,918
yeah because like i said you know there

743
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:15,519
was you know in in an era where like

744
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:17,440
weed was weed to some degree um

745
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:19,119
you know a four to six pound reliable

746
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,120
plant that was done in the middle of

747
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,798
october was pretty beneficial

748
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:24,239
yeah

749
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:26,558
so it was kind of one of those things i

750
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,519
brought i brought it out

751
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:30,879
in 98 or whatever yeah and started

752
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:32,798
spreading it around

753
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,039
and it's kind of percolated around our

754
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:37,599
area off and on since then and it's

755
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:39,759
still around there yeah uh yeah i mean i

756
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:41,918
still have it i live here

757
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:43,679
uh there's a few friends that have it uh

758
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,720
it's certainly probably under pressure

759
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,320
with how few strains sell currently

760
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,558
you know and how rough the market has

761
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:53,678
become and how how low the market has

762
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:55,278
become recently um but it definitely

763
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,919
still exists

764
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:59,200
um i gave it to like i said i gave it to

765
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,320
csi

766
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,319
um

767
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:03,599
to breed with

768
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:06,480
you know

769
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:08,558
and preserve help preserve you know it's

770
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,400
always it's always risky when you're

771
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:12,079
trying to save things you have to find

772
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,600
people that have an interest in stuff

773
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:17,119
that were willing to hold on to it yeah

774
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:18,480
right because there could be a fire

775
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:20,639
there could be an accident there could

776
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,000
be a bus there could be any number of

777
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,159
different things

778
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,319
um people are talking about what's aloha

779
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,080
white widow i don't really know much

780
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:30,240
about aloha

781
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:32,879
except for amsterdam except for it was

782
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:36,880
white widow from amsterdam popped on in

783
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:38,000
hawaii no aloha seeds was from amsterdam

784
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,840
oh they were

785
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,119
from amsterdam yeah they were a dutch

786
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:44,480
company and they they made it

787
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:46,319
and they just called it aloha white

788
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,399
widow so everybody assumed it was you

789
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:50,558
know a hawaiian white widow

790
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:52,398
see there you go i even assumed yeah

791
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:54,319
yeah i just assumed that it was a it was

792
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:56,398
another one of those things where

793
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:58,240
you're in um

794
00:27:56,398 --> 00:27:59,359
you know you're in it's it was just one

795
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,759
of those things where it's like oh it's

796
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:05,359
from hawaii let's add hawaii i actually

797
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:07,038
called aloha seed bank in amsterdam

798
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:08,639
god when i first heard about the string

799
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:11,359
because i wanted to see if i could still

800
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,640
source it at the time um

801
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:14,879
yeah they wouldn't even talk about what

802
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,480
was in it or any of that but yeah it was

803
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,919
it was their their seed line they

804
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,759
weren't they just weren't interested in

805
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,919
selling it anymore so it's sort of one

806
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:24,798
of those things where uh soma decided to

807
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:27,759
call a line new york city diesel exactly

808
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:29,519
and it's not sour diesel but we'll call

809
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:31,278
it diesel because it was the first you

810
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:33,679
know yeah um

811
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:34,880
so who knows who knows i was mistaken

812
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,038
right there i didn't actually know it's

813
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,480
back history i've never personally grown

814
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:39,440
it you know

815
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,558
um

816
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,798
so so

817
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:45,359
i think probably like

818
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:48,240
99 of people had no clue that it was

819
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:49,759
aloha seeds amsterdam um it's just it's

820
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,240
just how it's always gone everybody was

821
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:53,919
a aloha widow of course it would be and

822
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,839
that's that's one of the things that

823
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:56,720
matt and i always talk about where it's

824
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:58,879
like

825
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,120
you can make misleading statements and

826
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,440
not outright lie

827
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:04,479
and then people will just assume

828
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,440
yeah

829
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,839
exactly

830
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,880
these genetics are authentic

831
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:13,038
by the way i i was super stoked a long

832
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,080
time ago i made a joke about how you

833
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:18,480
could rename blueberry or blue dream and

834
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:20,079
call it blueberry [ __ ] yum yum and

835
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,558
someone would probably buy it

836
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:25,839
i just today saw a string called

837
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:27,119
blueberry yum yum taken off oh man damn

838
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:28,319
hot damn

839
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:31,519
called it

840
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:33,599
oh somebody's talking about ncga

841
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:36,240
rock 10 rock

842
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:38,398
you know so yeah i mean there's the

843
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,960
the the name game and then creating

844
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:42,079
assumptions based on that yeah

845
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,960
you know i mean

846
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:47,199
20 years ago if something was

847
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,360
was named after some kind of smell or

848
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,038
aroma or whatever it probably had some

849
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:53,439
kind of distinctive

850
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:56,480
remembrance of that yeah

851
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,880
now it's it has no connection to it

852
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:02,000
you know is it a ludicrous song i call i

853
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:04,960
pull blueberry yum yum out my ass but

854
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,398
goddamn it's hard being original

855
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,798
i wouldn't have known that it's very

856
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:10,319
hard being original so

857
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:11,679
yeah i mean there's there's aspects

858
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:14,558
where

859
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:16,240
you know hawaiian um

860
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:18,398
uh you know it's probably going to

861
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,640
remain a mystery and when any time

862
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:22,719
anytime you have like a mystery

863
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,880
right that's hard to be proven

864
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,000
you're going to get people that are

865
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,520
going to claim that they have knowledge

866
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,200
yeah and they have facts behind the

867
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:33,599
rumor and it's like oh well you might

868
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,200
not have had the hawaiian that went to

869
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:37,119
greg but we did

870
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,720
yeah that was my uncle

871
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:40,959
yeah yeah

872
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,720
my uh that was my dad that was my uncle

873
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,440
that was my that was my dad's best

874
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:48,240
friend that was my you know my aunts you

875
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:51,840
know my my aunt's boyfriend whoever you

876
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,839
know because you can't

877
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,798
really refute it and that's really

878
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:58,639
popular in cannabis

879
00:30:56,798 --> 00:31:01,278
um is

880
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:04,080
being able to not refute things well i

881
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:05,278
mean you saw just just in this episode

882
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:06,879
just in this

883
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:09,839
20 minutes or whatever that we've been

884
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,600
live you saw one person coming here

885
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:14,639
ask for an opinion because they weren't

886
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:17,439
sure and then flip out because it was

887
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,679
counter to what they wanted to hear

888
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,278
i missed that part

889
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,919
i'm not very good at patting my head and

890
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:25,278
rubbing my stomach so i ignore a lot of

891
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,120
the comments not because they're not

892
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:28,319
valuable but because i i have a hard

893
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:29,518
time like

894
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:32,480
bullshitting

895
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:34,960
uh and reading at the same time yeah you

896
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,880
know my brain

897
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,798
my brain was in here repeatedly asking

898
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,320
about someone non-stop

899
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:43,200
and then asked about someone that

900
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:45,278
referred him to that person um someone

901
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,038
from virginia that dude so i was just

902
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:48,720
like dude stop yeah i mean i don't know

903
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,879
there's and there's aspects too where

904
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,558
it's like sometimes people make a really

905
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,320
good assumption that like this is old

906
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:56,879
enough and this is mysterious enough

907
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:58,879
that it'll never be outed oh yeah yeah i

908
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,640
think most of them that do it think that

909
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,039
think that it's old enough and it's in

910
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,799
the past enough and it's i mean we even

911
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:06,879
saw when i won't even mention their name

912
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:08,158
but we did this that we outed somebody a

913
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,559
few years ago

914
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,399
um that consistently had he was a

915
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:14,558
younger cat and he consistently had

916
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:16,558
strains that were from one to two years

917
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:18,319
before they were ever released

918
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:20,639
yeah and you could just tell that they

919
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:22,798
were just hunting on the forums for

920
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,960
early info yeah and then they figured

921
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:26,558
they'd they'd ratchet it back for a week

922
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,000
a year or two

923
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:29,759
and then they didn't realize that there

924
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,278
was people that were actually alive and

925
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:33,038
in cannabis then

926
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:34,159
yeah you know

927
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:35,599
um

928
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:37,278
yeah he didn't even that dude didn't

929
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:38,480
even go look at the catalogs to see if

930
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:40,000
he could get the you're right he's just

931
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,278
like [ __ ] it

932
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,960
i mean

933
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:44,398
we won't even talk about that but when i

934
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,399
first saw him on instagram i thought

935
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:47,759
that dude was like in his 50s

936
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:49,199
he would have had to have been and then

937
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:52,000
i figured and then i figured out he was

938
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,080
like 27 and i was like what in the [ __ ]

939
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,919
you know no yeah

940
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:57,519
so you know and yeah there's a thing i

941
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:00,159
mean there's multiple people that that

942
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:02,159
have claimed um you know that have

943
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,840
claimed connection to various seed banks

944
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,880
or various people or various this or

945
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:06,879
that and

946
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,480
you know uh one of the cool things about

947
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,360
the internet is that it's linked a bunch

948
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,079
of us

949
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:15,278
yeah and so you get a chance to you know

950
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:17,199
you get a chance to ask those people

951
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:18,960
and then they're like hell no

952
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,278
yeah

953
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,640
you know and uh

954
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:24,558
you know and so

955
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,720
you know there's uh yeah it's go hey

956
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:30,398
someone picked it up skunk 18 fam uncle

957
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:33,200
fester skunk 18 uh nature fraud

958
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:35,678
i noticed someone mentioned about the uh

959
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,360
seeds being federally legal and i at

960
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,519
first i was like what

961
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:41,278
first that's from a source like a single

962
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:44,720
source and i'm not 100 sure on what they

963
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:46,480
posted but if if um cannabis seeds were

964
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,000
to be classified as hemp seeds you'd

965
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,240
still need a hemp license you need a

966
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,558
seed distribution license and you'd only

967
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,720
be distributing in your state

968
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:56,798
so no i think you can send it i think

969
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,038
you can send it out of state but i think

970
00:33:56,798 --> 00:34:01,278
the issue is is that you can't just be

971
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:03,278
like i'm gonna send my buddy in florida

972
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:05,119
a bunch of seeds and write

973
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:06,798
hemp and we're good

974
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:10,239
no you have to have there has to be

975
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:11,679
legitimate companies in both states

976
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:13,279
because

977
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:15,200
they have to be registered in the state

978
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,960
of california as a california hemp seed

979
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:19,199
company yes and you'd have to send it to

980
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,720
a registered i use is that how it works

981
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,519
you'd have to be in the market for that

982
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,759
because

983
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:24,719
because hemp is hemp was put in the farm

984
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,440
bill

985
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:30,158
yeah so it's um it's legal in all 50

986
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,559
states yes it's not a state it's not a

987
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,559
state by state thing and there's even

988
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:36,639
there's even hemp transports where you

989
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:39,039
can transport legal hemp

990
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,720
clones from one state to another

991
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:42,559
interesting but you

992
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:44,719
still to this day after working at the

993
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:46,878
hemp farm i know that they cannot buy

994
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:50,000
anything not licensed to be sold in

995
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:52,078
california by a hemp register that might

996
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,918
be a different so yes technically it's

997
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,679
legal but there's but

998
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:57,598
it's still like you have to have two

999
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:00,400
hemp businesses it has to be a

1000
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:02,160
legitimate sale between hint businesses

1001
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,000
it's not like i'm gonna send a bunch of

1002
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:05,440
hemp seeds legally

1003
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,039
we haven't gotten to the point where

1004
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,800
it's like tomato seeds or something like

1005
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:10,239
that where it's just like enthusiasts

1006
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,119
can just trade whatever the [ __ ] they

1007
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:15,118
want yeah i mean i i just ran through

1008
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:18,079
this and experienced it with uh the

1009
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:20,000
california hemp laws and like register

1010
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,160
trying to register to be a breeder of

1011
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,599
hemp and stuff like you have to do go

1012
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:25,279
through so many [ __ ] hoops maybe

1013
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:27,039
that's just california too

1014
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,839
but you have to go through so many hoops

1015
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:32,079
to be able to grow hemp in california

1016
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:34,000
for sure yeah i mean i'm sure i'm sure

1017
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:36,240
state state by state they can put their

1018
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,920
own regulations on it yeah but i don't

1019
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:39,919
believe that any state can make hempy

1020
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,159
legal because it's a federally federally

1021
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,400
legal on the farm bill it's just it's

1022
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:46,239
not illegal but it's

1023
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,838
heavily regulated

1024
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:49,039
and i think what happened is is that all

1025
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:51,440
these people in all these different

1026
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:52,800
states jumped into hemp and there wasn't

1027
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,679
a pipeline

1028
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,519
for that much cbd or cbg or

1029
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:59,279
hemp products yet

1030
00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:00,559
yeah and people are saying

1031
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,240
that um

1032
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:03,920
like costco doesn't have a license no

1033
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:06,000
but they're selling hemp that's been

1034
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,240
treated with heat that's a whole another

1035
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,440
different kind of license everything

1036
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:11,759
else once it's been treated with heat

1037
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,800
it's unviable so of course they can sell

1038
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,720
that

1039
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,760
yeah i mean that's that's been around

1040
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:19,439
forever but yes it has

1041
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,599
so i don't know i mean

1042
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,119
there's uh but yeah there's there's been

1043
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,880
i mean that's one of the one of the

1044
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,960
reoccurring frauds

1045
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,559
in cannabis is just

1046
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,159
like you know since

1047
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:32,719
new people are in every five or ten

1048
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:34,799
years you can recycle the same garbage

1049
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:36,480
over and over again you know sure and

1050
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,240
then people get all mad and they start

1051
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,000
coming on and defending themselves and

1052
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:41,679
then the people that told the lie first

1053
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,239
they start to change aspects of it

1054
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:46,000
because they realize they've been outed

1055
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:47,439
you know and they have to shift what it

1056
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
is you know

1057
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,679
um and it's just one of those it's just

1058
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,838
one of those areas that's like right for

1059
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:57,199
[ __ ] yeah you know um and so maybe

1060
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:59,199
maybe i should

1061
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:00,960
maybe i should do like i never do a plug

1062
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:03,039
on here but maybe i should do like a

1063
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,960
plug right yeah so

1064
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:05,679
uh anytime you see

1065
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,599
like

1066
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:09,358
quote unquote my headband cut or like

1067
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:11,200
when i just talked about the maui or

1068
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:13,838
anything like that like

1069
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:16,239
my entire intention for spreading

1070
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:17,838
genetics is for people to have good weed

1071
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:19,039
yeah so

1072
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:20,838
um

1073
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:24,159
you know

1074
00:37:20,838 --> 00:37:25,440
i don't um

1075
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:28,159
i don't

1076
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,720
i'm not making anything off of uh

1077
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:32,559
off of cam off off these things i'm not

1078
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:34,159
profiting in any way i'm not trying to

1079
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:36,799
jump into the seed game i've had a bunch

1080
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:39,838
of friends trying me to trying to get me

1081
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,359
to uh one of them is on is your is on

1082
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:44,480
your screen right now

1083
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:45,920
um but uh i've resisted you know um and

1084
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,599
it's nothing it's nothing against people

1085
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,559
that make seed for money or anything

1086
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,599
like that because obviously i have a

1087
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:54,000
bunch of friends that do so um but

1088
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,519
like part of passing out uh you know

1089
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,480
clones and stuff like that to good

1090
00:37:55,519 --> 00:38:00,800
friends uh and especially csi is that

1091
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,880
he's got enough of a matt and csi and

1092
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,480
others have enough of a customer base

1093
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,760
that you can get good stuff out there

1094
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,240
that's different

1095
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:11,040
yeah and one of the ways that like you

1096
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:12,559
know i've said it before but um probably

1097
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:13,920
the person that probably the person that

1098
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:16,078
did the biggest

1099
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,960
guarantee that my mendo perps will never

1100
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:21,039
disappear from the community is caleb

1101
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,000
yeah because he fell in love with it and

1102
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:24,960
he

1103
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,960
grew he crossed it to a [ __ ] ton

1104
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,880
of different things and enough people

1105
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,199
bought that that even if the mom was to

1106
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,280
terribly get lost her children and

1107
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:34,559
grandchildren are freaking everywhere

1108
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,640
yeah

1109
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:39,519
and so that's really if you want to talk

1110
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:41,440
about legacy with seeds um or anything

1111
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:43,838
else you know anytime anything gets

1112
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:46,639
popular like all of a sudden you know

1113
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:49,039

1118
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,800
first time ever all of a sudden you

1119
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,240
start to see clone cellars popping up

1120
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,119
with the cut

1121
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:05,439
you know

1122
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:09,200
um and you start to see

1123
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:10,079
freaking uh and you start to see

1124
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:12,639

and all that different types of [ __ ] and

1128
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,519
so

1129
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,760
you know it's just one of the things

1130
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:23,759
that goes along with popularity

1131
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,320
yeah you could probably go back six

1132
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,320
months and before a year before i

1133
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,800
started talking about it and nobody has

1134
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,440
it yeah nobody was ever talking about

1135
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,039
the la kush headband before

1136
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,480
we started talking about it so nobody

1137
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,838
was mentioning it nobody was mentioning

1138
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,760
it i mean not that it hadn't existed

1139
00:39:37,838 --> 00:39:42,159
before and not that it didn't exist with

1140
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,599
mandelbrot seeds 15 years ago or

1141
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:46,799
something like that but in the last five

1142
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:49,440
or six years it was it was nowhere yeah

1143
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,599
right and so and and now all of a sudden

1144
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,519
and really it only got my name i didn't

1145
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,880
even want it to have my name

1146
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:56,400
um people were just trying to

1147
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,519
differentiate like

1148
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,599
how what to call what headband yeah and

1149
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:03,039
so they attached it to it so it's like

1150
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:05,280
people always assume that i'm getting

1151
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:07,920
some royalty or i'm getting some kind of

1152
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:10,480
um you know aspect or i'm getting cuts

1153
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,480
or you know payback or whatever and or

1154
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:15,440
they're assuming also sometimes that you

1155
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,440
verified said cut yeah that i verified

1156
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,960
it and that's why it has it and so

1157
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,240
you know there's an aspect to it where

1158
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,960
it's like the only reason why i passed

1159
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:24,959
it out to a few good friends is just to

1160
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,880
hopefully have people that get weed that

1161
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:30,079
i like a whole bunch

1162
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:32,559
yeah and get that into some hybrids

1163
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:34,880
that's really it just so everybody knows

1164
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:37,039
you know so if you start seeing you know

1165
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,480
people pop up on clone traders and this

1166
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:40,000
and that and everything else

1167
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,920
it's not like i'm the only person on

1168
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,358
earth that has it but it's very very

1169
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:47,599
small circle and it's most likely a scam

1170
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:49,598
yeah at this point you know if it

1171
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:52,079
becomes incredibly popular like

1172
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:54,000
everything else it'll probably leak and

1173
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:56,160
there'll be some you know but

1174
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,760
i mean it's really just oh somebody

1175
00:40:56,159 --> 00:41:00,239
somebody's finding a bunch of fire i

1176
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,599
have that yeah you want it it's 400

1177
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:03,199
bucks

1178
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,559
oh i'm breeding with that i got seeds of

1179
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:06,559
it already

1180
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:08,799
i got that yep

1181
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:11,039
and that's the seed name game you know

1182
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,440
this is name game and that's it's as far

1183
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:14,960
back as like as people in amsterdam not

1184
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,480
wanting to give out lineage just so

1185
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,838
their competitors would all copy that

1186
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:22,159
lineage instantaneously

1187
00:41:18,838 --> 00:41:24,480
yeah so you know just for clarification

1188
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:26,399
on that like it it it's not and there's

1189
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,240
nothing wrong with selling seeds or this

1190
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,720
or that or whatever else but it's like

1191
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:32,639
my entire breeding has like not been

1192
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:35,759
that's not been i bred for because i

1193
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:36,799
like good weed yeah

1194
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,640
you know

1195
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,160
um and i think it makes some people mad

1196
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:42,159
that they can't attack me for [ __ ]

1197
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:44,318
them over or like or breeding hermes

1198
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:45,920
[ __ ] or this or that or whatever you

1199
00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:48,079
know and and really when it comes down

1200
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,838
to it too is like you know a bunch of

1201
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:52,160
our friends have been talking to talking

1202
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:54,639
about it and it's like if this seed

1203
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:56,078
crash leads to a financial crash for a

1204
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:58,559
bunch of people

1205
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:00,800
it might go back to a small handful of

1206
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:02,719
enthusiasts making seats

1207
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:06,160
and it will be i i really think it will

1208
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:07,679
be yeah because 95 of the people has you

1209
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:09,598
know have gotten into seed breeding in

1210
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:11,039
the last five or six years

1211
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,640
with the intention that it could be

1212
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:13,920
another revenue stream and it could get

1213
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:15,358
their name out there and it could get

1214
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,119
this and that and

1215
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:19,279
part of the reason why so much stuff

1216
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:21,119
today comes from so few breeders from 20

1217
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,079
years ago is because nobody bothered to

1218
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,640
breed

1219
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:26,240
yeah it wasn't all that common

1220
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:27,920
yeah because it was there wasn't money

1221
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:28,719
in it yeah there wasn't a lot of money

1222
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,240
in it

1223
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:31,759
people think there's a lot of money in

1224
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:33,279
it now but there's only a few people

1225
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,720
making a lot of money

1226
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,160
yeah there's only a few people and

1227
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:38,239
there's and you know and so there was a

1228
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:39,920
minute there in ig where people could

1229
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:41,598
sell seeds and make their own private

1230
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,280
hybrids and like sell them to their

1231
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:45,119
followers and all that and that seems to

1232
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,440
be collapsing a little bit right now

1233
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:49,119
yeah um so we'll see in two or three

1234
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,720
years how many of those people really

1235
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:52,880
love making seeds and care about

1236
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:54,399
breeding and which ones it was just

1237
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,559
another avenue

1238
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,760
yeah for revenue

1239
00:42:56,559 --> 00:42:59,679
and not that there's anything wrong with

1240
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,480
revenue you know yeah nothing wrong with

1241
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:02,639
that

1242
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,159
i have seen a massive

1243
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:06,318
the one thing i mean whether people hate

1244
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:08,639
me are like me i haven't gone away and

1245
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:11,119
i've seen a massive overturn since i've

1246
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:13,598
gotten here and i'm i'm expecting a

1247
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:15,280
super massive overturn because i mean

1248
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:17,119
just in the past five years you know

1249
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,800
thousands of people making seeds trying

1250
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,720
to sell that has popped up and that's

1251
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,318
going to get a lot harder that's the

1252
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:24,559
problem too is that since most people

1253
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:27,838
started recently

1254
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:30,000
you know they're grabbing what they have

1255
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:32,318
available to them that's recent

1256
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,639
so all this breeding is like all the

1257
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:36,318
same five or six you know five or six

1258
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:37,199
years of the most recent most famous

1259
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:40,318
stuff

1260
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:42,078
yeah and i uh i don't think that you're

1261
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:45,599
going to find anything magically

1262
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:46,400
different crossing cherry pie and kush

1263
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,160
no

1264
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,039
you know i think that people have tried

1265
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:51,279
that

1266
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:52,880
yeah over and over and over and over and

1267
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:54,319
over

1268
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,599
and you know and you're probably not

1269
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:56,960
going to find anything new using

1270
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,318
cushmits

1271
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,920
no and i'm not even dissing those

1272
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:02,000
strains don't get me wrong i'm not i'm

1273
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:05,119
just saying nothing's unique

1274
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,559
to today it's funny to me from it

1275
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:07,838
you know yeah i mean there was there's a

1276
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:09,119
guy commenting there was a bunch of

1277
00:44:07,838 --> 00:44:11,358
people that had

1278
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:13,440
the surprising thing about about the

1279
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:15,199
head my headband cut is not that it's

1280
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,559
mine or whatever because i didn't make

1281
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:17,439
it or anything but

1282
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:19,440
that

1283
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,760
most people won't hold on to anything

1284
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,639
unless it's making them money right now

1285
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,400
yeah

1286
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:27,679
so there's an enormous amount of stuff

1287
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:30,079
like uh you know 15 years ago i knew

1288
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:32,799
dozens and dozens of growers that had

1289
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:35,119
urkel and grape ape and gdp and green

1290
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:37,920
crack even yeah and green crack and then

1291
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:39,599
as soon as the market changed

1292
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,200
six people kept it

1293
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,680
yeah there was a bunch of people that

1294
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:46,239
had headband 15 years ago

1295
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:48,480
you know or sours you know yeah i mean i

1296
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:50,479
even had a friend call me the other day

1297
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,679
uh who's lifelong

1298
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,199
resident of

1299
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:55,838
southern humboldt

1300
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:57,519
and they're looking for sour cuts

1301
00:44:55,838 --> 00:44:59,119
yeah because in the last two or three

1302
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:01,119
years everybody

1303
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:02,800
has been um

1304
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:04,640
popping all you know working with all

1305
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,640
this candy and all this dessert and all

1306
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:08,480
this purple and all this stuff

1307
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:11,118
and now people are starting to ask for

1308
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,480
it again and nobody kept it

1309
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:15,039
it's not like it doesn't exist they'll

1310
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,639
be able to get it back again eventually

1311
00:45:15,039 --> 00:45:17,519
but maybe they don't get back the same

1312
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:19,279
one

1313
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:20,480
yeah that's that's that's a big deal

1314
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,079
that's why a lot of people don't have

1315
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,800
vertical like you said oracle was one of

1316
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:26,400
the most grown things up there everybody

1317
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:28,560
that had more than ten lights in mendo

1318
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:30,400
was growing urkel or grape ape or

1319
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:32,719
something like that mendopa they were

1320
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:36,880
all growing purples yeah

1321
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:39,439
you know um and uh you know and then you

1322
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,400
know when sauer and kush came in

1323
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,800
um

1324
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:45,680
everybody dropped it yep when cookies

1325
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:47,440
came in a bunch of people dropped sours

1326
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:48,960
when this came in a bunch of people

1327
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:51,119
dropped that

1328
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,280
and i do think there's going to be a

1329
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:56,000
renaissance of some of those strains

1330
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:58,480
because they're better in my opinion

1331
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,679
than a lot of the modern cuts

1332
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,280
absolutely

1333
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:03,118
they'll come back they taste better they

1334
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:05,119
work better they're longer lasting they

1335
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:06,880
have more unique eyes

1336
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:08,559
you know that type of thing so i think

1337
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,280
they will make a comeback

1338
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:13,279
um you know uh but

1339
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,200
you know there's i mean

1340
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,920
the my sour that i have i've had this

1341
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:20,159
sour since the very early 2000's i don't

1342
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:22,559
know which one it is

1343
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:24,480
yeah um but it's not most of the one

1344
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:26,880
i've collected a whole bunch of them

1345
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,800
um and it's not most of them

1346
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:31,039
yeah i haven't found one i haven't found

1347
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:33,039
one i kept hoping i'm like oh maybe it's

1348
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:35,838
the choco maybe it's the amish maybe

1349
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:39,679
it's the joe b maybe it's the

1350
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:40,480
uh ecsd maybe it's the nycd maybe it's

1351
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:42,399
the

1352
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,240
you know yeah um

1353
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,160
and uh it's what's really hard is you

1354
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:47,118
really can't tell diesels apart by

1355
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:49,358
pictures

1356
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:51,200
no not no they all tend to look super

1357
00:46:49,358 --> 00:46:52,799
skunky you really have to grow them side

1358
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:54,078
by side and you really have to kind of

1359
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,400
smoke them if you want to pick out

1360
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,440
differences yeah

1361
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,240
you know

1362
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,039
so

1363
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:04,639
um you know what i know about my sour is

1364
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:06,719
that it's old and that we kept it

1365
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:09,039
and that's about it you know the

1366
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:11,838
headband got renamed sour by a bunch of

1367
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:13,679
people um it got

1368
00:47:11,838 --> 00:47:15,199
you know it got tossed around but it was

1369
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:16,719
a little bit more finicky than regular

1370
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:18,559
sour and it could freak out on you

1371
00:47:16,719 --> 00:47:19,919
sometimes so a lot of people got rid of

1372
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:21,039
it because it wasn't as easy as the

1373
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,599
other ones

1374
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:25,039
yeah you know and and then people get

1375
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:26,640
rid of their cut

1376
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:29,119
and one thing that i've learned is that

1377
00:47:26,639 --> 00:47:30,480
if i would have lost my sour cut even

1378
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:32,000
though i have six or seven other

1379
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,960
different ones right now

1380
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,880
um

1381
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,559
it none of them are that one

1382
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,960
yeah and there's a bunch of people that

1383
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:41,280
always talk about you know i tried to

1384
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:43,679
get back that thing that i had

1385
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:46,480
and i can't find the sour diesel cut or

1386
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:49,118
the blue dream cut or the gdp cut like

1387
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:51,440
yeah or the trinity i can't get it back

1388
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:54,720
it's like this one's good

1389
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:56,079
but it's not um but it's not it's not

1390
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:58,558
what it is

1391
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:00,720
i um dookie made a good comment he said

1392
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:04,240
the skunk search should start in a sour

1393
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:06,159
s1 and i i agree but i think

1394
00:48:04,239 --> 00:48:08,000
the places i saw it the most were when

1395
00:48:06,159 --> 00:48:10,078
you crossed two

1396
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,599
different expressions of super skunk was

1397
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:13,599
where i was seeing it just constantly

1398
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:15,200
pop up i thought that was but i think

1399
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:17,359
that you can probably find that miss our

1400
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:19,838
s1 i'm it's just you can't make them the

1401
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:22,719
problem is with sour s1s is that like it

1402
00:48:19,838 --> 00:48:25,199
fails or you get like 20 seats exactly

1403
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:27,118
that's why that's why i even went with

1404
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:29,039
crossing two super skunks that are that

1405
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:31,039
are different expressions like a sour

1406
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:32,880
and a diesel but i do agree with them i

1407
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:35,358
think that

1408
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:37,440
diesels are modern skunk

1409
00:48:35,358 --> 00:48:39,598
yes i think it's one of the most classic

1410
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:40,960
examples of a modern skunk away type

1411
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,920
plant that we have

1412
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,440
yeah

1413
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,960
diesels are modern skunk and the good

1414
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,880
thing about the diesels

1415
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:48,079
is that unlike a lot of other things

1416
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,519
where you could be like oh that one's

1417
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:50,880
fake or whatever

1418
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:53,679
most of the diesels are pretty [ __ ]

1419
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:55,519
nice man yeah they burn good they smoke

1420
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:58,000
good they have you know they range in

1421
00:48:55,519 --> 00:49:00,480
gassy to more headband aromas stuff like

1422
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,400
that but grown well taken long enough

1423
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:04,400
dried right

1424
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,960
they they work

1425
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:09,760
you know um they work they're good you

1426
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:11,920
know so it's one of my favorite families

1427
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:13,680
so you know there's probably at this

1428
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,680
point from my experimentation there's at

1429
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:17,919
least 10 or 12 cuts that are all

1430
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:20,239
different from each other that circulate

1431
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:22,400
yeah of course everyone wants to be like

1432
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:24,719
oh mine's the oldest mine's the original

1433
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,400
mine's the one you remember

1434
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:27,118
that's why you should pay x amount for

1435
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,000
it

1436
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:31,838
yeah in clone form or in weed form

1437
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,480
because it i can try it take take it

1438
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:35,759
back right to 95 you don't know the bros

1439
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,199
that i know

1440
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,960
except for most of those people haven't

1441
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:41,039
been growing since i mean whatever you

1442
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:44,800
know i just yeah yeah in the sense that

1443
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:46,639
that it's like then it becomes a

1444
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,640
you know that's really what it becomes

1445
00:49:46,639 --> 00:49:50,480
it becomes a marketing gig uh but

1446
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:51,920
luckily um

1447
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,599
you know

1448
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,960
they a lot of them still exist and

1449
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:56,240
they're most of them are all good

1450
00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:00,240
there's only one or two that i didn't

1451
00:49:56,239 --> 00:50:02,479
like very much yeah i liked i liked um

1452
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:04,558
uh your growth the amish i never tried

1453
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,000
it before that oh that was that those

1454
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:08,160
couple years that i brought it to the

1455

party it was fire it was dude all the

1456
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:12,078
diesels you grew were flavorful they all

1457
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,079
had that mouth coating thing in common

1458
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:15,760
but they they were all super flavorful

1459
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:17,680
outdoor i never really had much diesel

1460
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:19,520
outdoor that was good and that year it

1461
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:21,118

00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:58,239
probably i did a nice job on the growing

1481
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:59,280
it but uh you know sun's real nice light

1482
00:50:58,239 --> 00:51:01,439
yeah dude

1483
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:04,079
i love the sun the sun is a great light

1484
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:06,318
so if you get good weather with the sun

1485
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:08,160
and you get warm nice days that go into

1486
00:51:06,318 --> 00:51:09,838
late october early november and you can

1487
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:11,519
take that sour late

1488
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:14,318
most people with sour the problem that

1489
00:51:11,519 --> 00:51:16,480
became was sour up here is that

1490
00:51:14,318 --> 00:51:17,519
as soon as it got the nose people would

1491
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,880
cut it

1492
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:20,880
yeah

1493
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:23,519
and it probably needed another 10 days

1494
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,440
to two weeks and it's real easy for it

1495
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:27,920
to go from being a good nose when you

1496
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:29,280
cut it to turning complete boof once you

1497
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,358
try to [ __ ]

1498
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,519
cure it i've seen sour go bad so many

1499
00:51:31,358 --> 00:51:36,239

most of these cuts of diesel cuts are

1530
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:37,679
real nice

1531
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:39,358
yeah most of them get you nice and high

1532
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:40,719
most of them burn well

1533
00:52:39,358 --> 00:52:42,639
um

1534
00:52:40,719 --> 00:52:45,199

[ __ ] i mean he's he's passed now but

1538
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:53,279
mandelbrot made that up

1539
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:55,200
yeah that was my sour diesel that i gave

1540
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,640
dawn that he crossed into a bunch of

1541
00:52:55,199 --> 00:52:58,639
stuff and he just decided that it was

1542
00:52:56,639 --> 00:53:00,480
from amherst and added amherst to it

1543
00:52:58,639 --> 00:53:02,159
because that's what he thought i didn't

1544
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,599
get it from amherst

1545
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:07,440
you know so

1546
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:08,640

from this dude so it's his who's is it

1581
00:54:18,639 --> 00:54:21,598
oh it's this well you know amish got

1582
00:54:20,639 --> 00:54:22,879
named it because it came out of

1583
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:25,519
pennsylvania and there's a bunch of

1584
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:27,519
amish and that one was from shroomie and

1585
00:54:25,519 --> 00:54:30,079
it's also called shroomies diesel too so

1586
00:54:27,519 --> 00:54:31,920
called shroomies diesel yeah you know

1587
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:33,280
um and so there's you know there's

1588
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,200
there's a lot of stuff like that where

1589
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:37,440
nicknames get added and subtracted i

1590
00:54:35,199 --> 00:54:39,279
don't know what the real deal sour is

1591
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,280
i don't know what the albany sour is but

1592
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:43,680
it's like as as more of the story comes

1593
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,480
out i would assume that like albany is

1594
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:47,838
just

1595
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:49,920
trying to tie it to manny and

1596
00:54:47,838 --> 00:54:51,838
some of the original sour people

1597
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:54,480
yeah and you know what's funny is like

1598
00:54:51,838 --> 00:54:56,480
we know the term from vondo that they

1599
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,599
called the sour that they all preferred

1600
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:59,358
the manny

1601
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:01,359
and we don't really mention that much

1602
00:54:59,358 --> 00:55:02,798
but i guarantee

1603
00:55:01,358 --> 00:55:04,960
that someone's gonna pop up with that

1604
00:55:02,798 --> 00:55:07,440
[ __ ] manny in two weeks or a

1605
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:10,079
week you know

1606
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:12,400

1607
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:14,000
and you know and and so sometimes one of

1608
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:16,798
those things just like

1609
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:19,039
just just like the the dog isn't really

1610
00:55:16,798 --> 00:55:20,400
you know it's not really you know skunk

1611
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:22,639
va's dog

1612
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,480
yeah but he gets on the forums and he's

1613
00:55:22,639 --> 00:55:26,960
the first guy talking about it and which

1614
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:30,079
cut is it oh it's the skunk vaca

1615

yeah you know oh it's not so's headband

1616
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:33,519
yeah because you're trying to figure out

1617
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:36,000
some kind of language

1618
00:55:33,519 --> 00:55:38,480
to chat about it it's matt riot's

1619

12-inch [ __ ] i get that all the time i

1620
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:42,318
just just because i

1621
00:55:40,798 --> 00:55:44,400
yeah that's just the difference between

1622
00:55:42,318 --> 00:55:45,519
our measurements and metro and metric

1623
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,039

1628
00:55:53,679 --> 00:55:57,679
but yeah you know and no i mean someone

1629

1662
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,920
himself that was intentional but

1663
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:09,920
sometimes it's not intentional skunk va

1664
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:12,480

on whether or not you want to have a an

1677
00:57:39,358 --> 00:57:44,000
ego attachment to it yeah you know but

1678
00:57:42,639 --> 00:57:45,920
really when it comes down to it when you

1679
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,079
get back to breeding all the stupid

1680
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,920
names all the attachments all the all

1681
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:51,839
that everything else the only thing that

1682
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,880
people are going to remember is if it's

1683
00:57:51,838 --> 00:57:56,000
good weed

1684
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:58,880
yeah so you are my phone my phone's

1685
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,719
getting down to like 10 so let's cover

1686
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:02,559
some of that real quick

1687
00:58:00,719 --> 00:58:04,239
all right so there's this thing going

1688
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:08,160
around right now that really irritates

1689
00:58:04,239 --> 00:58:09,679
the piss out of me and um there is a you

1690
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:11,679
know they've been pushing all this stuff

1691
00:58:09,679 --> 00:58:14,318
with the emerald cup judging

1692
00:58:11,679 --> 00:58:16,480
and all that and sc labs has come out

1693
00:58:14,318 --> 00:58:18,239
with this new classification

1694
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:19,838
and they're trying to get rid of using

1695
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:22,078
sativa and

1696
00:58:19,838 --> 00:58:25,039
indica which that's a different

1697
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:27,119
discussion yeah i agree i agree

1698
00:58:25,039 --> 00:58:28,480
that we that there could be better terms

1699
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:29,760
there could be better terminology

1700
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,119
applied to that but what they want to

1701
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,119
replace it to

1702
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:35,519
um is they and what they're using for

1703
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:37,760
the emerald cup this year is the most

1704
00:58:35,519 --> 00:58:39,119
ridiculous [ __ ] i've ever seen yeah

1705
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:41,440
and the reason why is because they have

1706
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:42,640
six categories and i'll try to do them

1707
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,079
off of memory

1708
00:58:42,639 --> 00:58:44,879
um but

1709
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:47,359
it's

1710
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,480
haze jack and hayes

1711
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:51,119
yep

1712
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:52,079
and it's um this probably won't be in

1713
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:52,880
order

1714
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:54,480
uh

1715
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,720
og and gas

1716
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:59,519
yep sweet dreams

1717
00:58:56,719 --> 00:59:01,039
sweets and dreams sweet and dreams

1718
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:02,880
desserts

1719
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:05,279
exotics

1720
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:08,240
uh what's the final one tropical and

1721
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:10,960
floral tropical and floral right which

1722
00:59:08,239 --> 00:59:13,679
are two different and so like that's the

1723
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:15,358
most ridiculous smell and terpene

1724
00:59:13,679 --> 00:59:19,440
classifications i've ever heard in my

1725
00:59:15,358 --> 00:59:21,598
life exotics what is this what's exotic

1726
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:23,519
i mean do they go off the exotic mic

1727
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:25,838
definition of exotics where runts isn't

1728
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:27,759
exotic well i mean just exotic is like

1729
00:59:25,838 --> 00:59:28,639
exotic is something that's unusual to

1730
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:31,200
you

1731
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:34,000
yeah exactly that's all exotics i'd be

1732
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:36,639
like like you know maybe some southeast

1733
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,719
asians i would consider exotics or some

1734
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:41,279
wild africans but if you live there it's

1735
00:59:38,719 --> 00:59:42,558
not exotic it's common exactly so how

1736
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:45,119
cookies might be

1737
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:46,798
over there what is sweets and dreams

1738
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:49,280
sweets and dreams is the one that makes

1739
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:51,039
them like no sense to me then and then

1740
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:54,480
you know like and then there's an aspect

1741
00:59:51,039 --> 00:59:55,920
of okay so you've got sweets plus dreams

1742
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:57,119
and then you've got

1743
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:59,200
desserts

1744
00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:01,440
now i get dessert cookies has a

1745
00:59:59,199 --> 01:00:03,838
marketing campaign where everything they

1746
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:05,760
name is dessert based yeah so they get

1747
01:00:03,838 --> 01:00:07,679
their whole so they have cookies and

1748
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:09,920
they have sherbet and they have flan and

1749
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:12,000
they have [ __ ] this and that [ __ ]

1750
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:13,680
and whatever

1751
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,719
none of it tastes like the specific

1752
01:00:13,679 --> 01:00:16,879
dessert

1753
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:19,759
exactly it's just they have a theme

1754
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:21,680
yeah right uh i will say that cookies

1755
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:23,680
the original thin mint uh which they

1756
01:00:21,679 --> 01:00:26,000
can't say anymore because uh girl scouts

1757
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:29,039
sued them um but

1758
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,960
it did have kind of a doughy flavor

1759
01:00:29,039 --> 01:00:33,838
yeah i don't get that from any of it all

1760
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:35,920
i taste is og but i know people do do

1761
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:37,599
get that from it so it's it's also like

1762
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:39,039
how you smell how you taste yeah

1763
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:40,960
different things i mean i can at least

1764
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:42,719
okay it's got some kind of doughy type

1765
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:45,358
aroma to it you know that some people

1766
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:47,679
but what is exotics but it was neither

1767
01:00:45,358 --> 01:00:50,318
thin nor mint that's right for sure what

1768
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:53,039
is what is exotics what is

1769
01:00:50,318 --> 01:00:55,199
what is dessert weed what is dreams what

1770
01:00:53,039 --> 01:00:57,759
is dreams what is that even [ __ ] even

1771
01:00:55,199 --> 01:01:00,879
like blue dream even jack and hayes okay

1772
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:01,839
so jack and hayes in california

1773
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,798
like

1774
01:01:01,838 --> 01:01:05,679
um

1775
01:01:02,798 --> 01:01:09,440
you know that it's mostly terpenoline

1776
01:01:05,679 --> 01:01:11,759
yeah but that's by no means the only

1777
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:13,039
haze aromas in haze

1778
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:15,119
in fact

1779
01:01:13,039 --> 01:01:17,279
i would put blue dream in the jackson

1780
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:19,680
haze category more than i would like a

1781
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:21,599
blueberry category but i certainly

1782
01:01:19,679 --> 01:01:23,919
wouldn't make a category for dreams

1783
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:26,480
based off one strain but you know it's

1784
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:29,358
like even if so even like all in back in

1785
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:30,880
new york right uh where there's a bunch

1786
01:01:29,358 --> 01:01:32,639
of haze cuts that are still pretty

1787
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:34,798
famous and kept

1788
01:01:32,639 --> 01:01:36,159
yeah you know they don't the the best

1789
01:01:34,798 --> 01:01:38,400
ones they have back there aren't

1790
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:40,159
terpenoline they don't smell like jack

1791
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:42,639
they smell like frankincense they smell

1792
01:01:40,159 --> 01:01:43,838
like church they smell there's a variety

1793
01:01:42,639 --> 01:01:44,798
of smells

1794
01:01:43,838 --> 01:01:46,400
so

1795
01:01:44,798 --> 01:01:47,440
hold on i'm going to respond to one

1796
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:50,559
thing

1797
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:53,679
someone said they are leaning into

1798
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:55,920
genetics no they're not and chemovar

1799
01:01:53,679 --> 01:01:57,279
this is not based on chemo bar which i

1800
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,559
think is important and i appreciate the

1801
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:00,319
effort in advancing the discussion the

1802
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:02,798
thing is this discussion was already

1803
01:02:00,318 --> 01:02:05,038
advanced past indica in sativa and

1804
01:02:02,798 --> 01:02:07,119
hybrid long ago

1805
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:08,880
and it's it's only the people that

1806
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:10,559
aren't very well read on the subject

1807
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:13,519
that are still there and they're still

1808
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:14,880
there which is so it's been realized

1809
01:02:13,519 --> 01:02:16,798
just so everyone knows that when you're

1810
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:18,720
judging at the emerald cup all these

1811
01:02:16,798 --> 01:02:20,880
jars are labeled and no one has any

1812
01:02:18,719 --> 01:02:21,679
supposedly has any idea what they are

1813
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:24,160
yeah

1814
01:02:21,679 --> 01:02:26,639
they're supposed to just just blind

1815
01:02:24,159 --> 01:02:30,000
smoke and guess and smell and look and

1816
01:02:26,639 --> 01:02:32,719
share it doesn't come with oh this is

1817
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:36,719
white runts from xnx farm

1818
01:02:32,719 --> 01:02:38,480
yeah it's just sample number 148.

1819
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:40,879
yep you know and we're going to name

1820
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:42,719
does this is this dessert to you

1821
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:44,798
is this dreams do you feel dreamy when

1822
01:02:42,719 --> 01:02:46,558
you smoke this yeah is this dream that

1823
01:02:44,798 --> 01:02:49,440
that still blows my mind because i you

1824
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:52,559
know even the even the even the og even

1825
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:54,318
the og and gas it's like with nog

1826
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:55,839
there's piney

1827
01:02:54,318 --> 01:02:58,639
there's earthy

1828
01:02:55,838 --> 01:03:00,400
there's so much depth in og itself and

1829
01:02:58,639 --> 01:03:02,719
you can't just combine

1830
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:06,720
diesel and kush

1831
01:03:02,719 --> 01:03:08,558
into the same category as gas eogs what

1832
01:03:06,719 --> 01:03:10,639
yeah what about what about the the like

1833
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:13,760
the irene ones that are more sweet

1834
01:03:10,639 --> 01:03:16,078
cereal oh geez like

1835
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:17,920
ones that are like lemony and pine soul

1836
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:19,039
yeah and ones that are straight earthy

1837
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:21,599
mouth coat

1838
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:24,160
yeah um so really to me i'm not trying

1839
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:26,480
to to diss them or whatever but it it

1840
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:28,318
really is a step backwards and i really

1841
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:32,079
don't want that kind of language to

1842
01:03:28,318 --> 01:03:33,838
start being used um because you know

1843
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:35,599
what the [ __ ] is dreams

1844
01:03:33,838 --> 01:03:38,880
yeah what the [ __ ] is a dream yeah the

1845
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:40,960
thing my point was like i i agree in

1846
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:43,039
advancing the conversation because i do

1847
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:45,599
not think index indica and sativa and

1848
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:47,039
hybrid are accurate however

1849
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:49,680
someone already did that but like

1850
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:51,599
someone pointed out merlin and and clark

1851
01:03:49,679 --> 01:03:53,519
came up with the broadleaf dominant

1852
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:56,559
narrow leaf drug i'm sorry broad leaf

1853
01:03:53,519 --> 01:03:58,400
drug type narrow leaf drug type and um

1854
01:03:56,559 --> 01:04:00,319
from there i mean you you know you can

1855
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:01,680
classify it any other way but those bld

1856
01:04:00,318 --> 01:04:03,920
and nld

1857
01:04:01,679 --> 01:04:05,358
yeah the ld and nld is a great way to do

1858
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:08,159
it because it doesn't talk about the

1859
01:04:05,358 --> 01:04:10,159
high type it just talks about this the

1860
01:04:08,159 --> 01:04:12,318
outward expression and maybe we should

1861
01:04:10,159 --> 01:04:14,960
you know we're planning on having uh our

1862
01:04:12,318 --> 01:04:16,159
buddy crybaby come on uh one of these

1863
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:19,599
shows and we're gonna have like a

1864
01:04:16,159 --> 01:04:21,679
terpene and an aroma episode uh because

1865
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:23,838
he can probably talk more intelligently

1866
01:04:21,679 --> 01:04:25,679
about those kind of things than we can

1867
01:04:23,838 --> 01:04:27,440
he's got a better language

1868
01:04:25,679 --> 01:04:29,519
but really what this is it's about

1869
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:32,000
communication and language so

1870
01:04:29,519 --> 01:04:33,759
when we're talking about our eyes

1871
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,480
it's really easy to be like this is

1872
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:39,039
periwinkle or this is burgundy or this

1873
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:41,199
is orange or this is and you can be like

1874
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:44,240
yes that is we can both see it but when

1875
01:04:41,199 --> 01:04:46,318
it comes to to nose right

1876
01:04:44,239 --> 01:04:47,838
other than sour

1877
01:04:46,318 --> 01:04:49,279
bitter

1878
01:04:47,838 --> 01:04:51,679
dead

1879
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:53,680
salty there's only like five or six

1880
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:55,358
things that you actually taste

1881
01:04:53,679 --> 01:04:57,199
right yeah and then the rest is

1882
01:04:55,358 --> 01:04:59,440
impressions so people will be like oh

1883
01:04:57,199 --> 01:05:00,639
this smells like pencil shavings or a

1884
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:02,480
fresh car

1885
01:05:00,639 --> 01:05:04,159
or it smells like you know something

1886
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:06,400
common like oranges so you don't really

1887
01:05:04,159 --> 01:05:08,399
describe the smell

1888
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:10,639
you describe something else that it

1889
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:12,880
smells like

1890
01:05:10,639 --> 01:05:15,279
yeah but but that classification what

1891
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:16,559
the [ __ ] does dream smell like

1892
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:19,039
yeah that's

1893
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:20,640
what is what does a great smell like

1894
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:22,960
yeah you know what used to be exotic in

1895
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:25,920
europe pepper

1896
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:28,480
yeah that's true huh yeah spices

1897
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:31,119
from the far east they were exotic

1898
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:32,960
you know you can have exhaus exotic

1899
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:35,200
dragon fruit but if you live in hawaii

1900
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:37,280
it's probably not exotic

1901
01:05:35,199 --> 01:05:40,078
at one point you know mangoes were

1902
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:40,079
probably exotic

1903
01:05:40,639 --> 01:05:44,159
what is oh yeah yeah

1904
01:05:42,639 --> 01:05:46,480
have you had those before

1905
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:50,000
i know i remember yeah fresh vinyl

1906
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:51,358
linoleum you know new car smell all that

1907
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,559
and so there's a whole bunch of those

1908
01:05:51,358 --> 01:05:54,400
things where it's like it's really

1909
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:56,480
difficult to have the language to talk

1910
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,358
about smells with people

1911
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:59,760
and

1912
01:05:57,358 --> 01:06:01,358
i'm bad at it and you know and i always

1913
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:03,119
i always when trimmers and stuff like

1914
01:06:01,358 --> 01:06:04,639
that i always try to ask them away from

1915
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:06,720
the rest of the trimmers what do you

1916
01:06:04,639 --> 01:06:07,759
smell when you smell this wheat

1917
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:09,519
yeah

1918
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:11,440
and try to get a bunch of different

1919
01:06:09,519 --> 01:06:14,000
people's feedback and then do i see

1920
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:16,318
things that people keep talking about

1921
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:18,880
yeah is there a commonality that you can

1922
01:06:16,318 --> 01:06:20,079
pull out of their impressions

1923
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:21,920
because not everybody has the same

1924
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:24,720
impression like for instance how would

1925
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:26,240
europeans know roadkill

1926
01:06:24,719 --> 01:06:27,118
yeah right there is no roadkill in

1927
01:06:26,239 --> 01:06:29,279
europe

1928
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:30,400
no no roadkill skunk no roadkill skunk

1929
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:32,880
but that's what they mean when they talk

1930
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:34,240
about roadkill yeah roadkill skunk i

1931
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:36,079
should have been more specific but it's

1932
01:06:34,239 --> 01:06:37,519
like you're not american there is no

1933
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:39,599
you've never smelled a dead skunk on the

1934
01:06:37,519 --> 01:06:42,239
side of the road yeah unless you came

1935
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:43,760
here yeah um so you know there's an

1936
01:06:42,239 --> 01:06:45,598
aspect where it's like i looked at all

1937
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:47,760
this stuff and you've got all these

1938
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:50,318
judges this [ __ ] don't

1939
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:54,079
understand the concepts of monoterpenes

1940
01:06:50,318 --> 01:06:55,920
try terpenes sesquiterpene shut the [ __ ]

1941
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:57,920
up we don't you obviously don't

1942
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:59,280
understand the discussion

1943
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:00,880
so go back

1944
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:03,359
you can talk about terpenes and you can

1945
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:05,599
talk about individual terpenes but like

1946
01:07:03,358 --> 01:07:07,759
the language around how those terpenes

1947
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:09,760
blend into different aromas

1948
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:12,400
yeah you know like just like there's

1949
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:14,319
there's only so many primary colors

1950
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,519
yeah and you know terpenes you can

1951
01:07:14,318 --> 01:07:17,519
combine two different things and have

1952
01:07:15,519 --> 01:07:19,119
them smell the exact same way no matter

1953
01:07:17,519 --> 01:07:21,119
what terpenes you're using you know like

1954
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:22,640
you there's certain ways to make

1955
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:24,000
strawberry smells and there's other ways

1956
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:26,078
to make strawberry smells that are very

1957
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,318
similar that two people could smell as

1958
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:30,960
strawberry but the problem is it's not

1959
01:07:28,318 --> 01:07:32,880
it's not a terpene conversation in that

1960
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:35,039
sense the level of the level of

1961
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:37,358
education amongst people to discuss

1962
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:40,160
aromas in cannabis is very limited even

1963
01:07:37,358 --> 01:07:42,000
amongst the educated yeah it's a limited

1964
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:44,078
conversation and so i don't think it's

1965
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:46,079
advanced by and they're all pushing oh

1966
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:47,680
my god we're breaking barriers and

1967
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:49,839
here's how we're judging stuff and we've

1968
01:07:47,679 --> 01:07:52,239
got different colored stickers to put on

1969
01:07:49,838 --> 01:07:55,119
jars whether it's dessert or whether

1970
01:07:52,239 --> 01:07:57,598
it's haze or whether it's exotic

1971
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:59,200
yeah and i just think that's a joke

1972
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:01,440
yeah i think the categories are not

1973
01:07:59,199 --> 01:08:02,239
related to reality

1974
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:04,480
yeah

1975
01:08:02,239 --> 01:08:06,879
you know and it's not dissing them

1976
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:08,559
you know no it's not dissing them i mean

1977
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:11,039
if anything it's probably dissing sc

1978
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:12,880
labs maybe but it's just it's just

1979
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:16,319
another way to try to talk about

1980
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:17,119
language and talk about classifications

1981
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:20,640
um

1982
01:08:17,119 --> 01:08:22,719
but it's not accurate it's not helpful

1983
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:24,400
most weed before cookies nobody said

1984
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:27,119
nobody was like oh my god all this weed

1985
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:29,119
smells like desserts yeah i this is like

1986
01:08:27,119 --> 01:08:30,880
this is flan at my favorite mexican

1987
01:08:29,119 --> 01:08:33,278
restaurant to a tea

1988
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:36,838
i just exhale flan

1989
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:38,640

1990
01:08:36,838 --> 01:08:40,000

that the language than i am

1998
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:58,000
he's got he's got a much deeper base of

1999
01:08:56,479 --> 01:09:01,358
talking about the language and the

2000
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,079
terpenes and stuff like that you know

2001
