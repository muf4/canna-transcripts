sneaky YouTube algorithm

[Music]

22
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,359
like I was connected with everything

23
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,160
around me

24
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,558
all of a sudden I just started

25
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,798
questioning everything I'd ever been

26
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:06,798
told

27
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:14,299
you know by the time by the time I got

28
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:18,500
high that very first time

29
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:18,500
when it started to hit me

30
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:22,820
and I'm like wow

31
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:26,420
[Applause]

32
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:26,419
I got high

welcome to Greater Syndicate everyone

35
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:38,938
I'm Matthew uh announcer's not with us

36
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,520

00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:43,199
for episode number four of the magic and

38
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:44,759
Rojo Chronicles

39
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,280
um today we were talking a little bit

40
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:49,500
earlier we kind of wanted to go over

41
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,920
some of someone that we've mentioned a

42
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:55,438
lot in in the past few episodes who is

43
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,359
uh are The Connoisseur and we've been

44
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,459
going over some of his past work and and

45
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,500
we all have a special admiration for the

46
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:03,239
guy and we keep bringing them up so we

47
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,280
thought that would be a kind of a neat

48
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:07,919
idea to to talk a little bit more about

49
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,959
some of his work and what we admire so

50
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,479
much about the man

51
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,979
so welcome guys good to have you hope

52
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,139
you had a happy New Year where do you

53
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:18,479
want to jump off at um we were the first

54
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:19,919
article we were reading was a five-year

55
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:24,959
review yes

56
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:27,359
September 1979. I start I I found High

57
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,878
Times I think about when it started in

58
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,760
1974 and

59
00:02:29,878 --> 00:02:34,079
started reading it avidly and collecting

60
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:37,019
it and

61
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,080
once R showed up I don't know what issue

62
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:42,959
it was exactly it was really cool to

63
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,599
have someone who's in New York City

64
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,939
right in the middle of everything and

65
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:50,219
had access obviously he had lots of

66
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:52,079
dealer friends he had access to all the

67
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:53,280
strains that were coming in

68
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,819
and

69
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,159
that particular issue the fifth

70
00:02:56,818 --> 00:03:03,899
anniversary 1979

71
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:06,780
was largely about the Advent of gold

72
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,519
when Santa Marta gold first showed up

73
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:12,060
Colombian gold

74
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:15,060
and how it blew everyone away and they

75
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,699
were just digging it and

76
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:21,719
over the course of a year or two

77
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:24,359
it made the brown weeds and other weeds

78
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:27,598
like uh oaxacan let's just say or

79
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:30,900
Michoacan guerreran in Mexico and

80
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:32,939
apparently he said even Thai stick it

81
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,280
people didn't want them they wanted

82
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:37,318
something that was gold all they cared

83
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,019
about was that the weed would be gold

84
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:42,000
and he mentioned a lot of the reasons

85
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:44,400
they were gold were

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,299
the way they sun-dried them or the way

87
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,340
they were

88
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:50,760
fermenting on their trip to the United

89
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,979
States in the hold of the ship or

90
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:55,798
warehousing in the U.S because they

91
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:57,780
would hold on to it and wait till the

92
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:59,879
prices got higher in the summer when

93
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,180
there was a drought and there was no

94
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:03,840
harvesting being done immediately and

95
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,719
um

96
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,759
just holding it at the warehouse helped

97
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:11,180
change its color but on the other hand

98
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:14,519
he said it also

99
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:17,819
precipitated the weeds that had mold

100
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:19,918
yeah it hadn't been initially dried

101
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:22,139
correctly or packaged

102
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,359
the thing that's so important about the

103
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:25,680
article is he's he's really documenting

104
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:30,000
one of the first

105
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:32,400
times well it's maybe the first time a

106
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,639
major Market shift based on appearances

107
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:37,620
was ever really documented you know and

108
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:40,259
it's uh it's swept through the United

109
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,720
States markets you know multiple times

110
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:46,259
over the last 20 years whether it was

111
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:49,620
moving from you know just uh just green

112
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:51,240
bud or kind bud to purple and everybody

113
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,240
had to have purple

114
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,519
and uh all of a sudden you know plants

115
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,240
and cuttings that had been around for 15

116
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:03,299
20 years just you know Foundation lines

117
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,579
that people had had bred with and kept

118
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,419
around for forever

119
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:08,639
um

120
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:10,500
you know cuttings got lost they they

121
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,139
were neglected they got pushed to the

122
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,478
side because everybody had to have you

123
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:18,000
know in order to sell you had to have

124
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:20,279
weed that looked like what the buyers

125
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,819
were looking for and that turned into

126
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:27,359
purple just like R was talking about in

127
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:30,060
what 78 70 79

128
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,460
um everybody you know wouldn't buy it

129
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:35,699
unless it was gold

130
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:38,339
you know so so the dealers started you

131
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:42,240
know coming up with ways to make not

132
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:43,500
gold look like gold so they could sell

133
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,300
it

134
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,339
um and uh you know it's just it's the

135
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,918
same story over and over again repeating

136
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:52,379
itself I'm sure it took place in in

137
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:54,839
Amsterdam you know multiple multiple

138
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:56,939
times where some new thing came in and

139
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:58,679
everything had to had to have those

140
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:01,019
superficial traits

141
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,840
but um

142
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:07,799
yeah that's uh you know the market

143
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:10,319
drives towards those things

144
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,020
um you know we we assess the product

145
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:15,680
with our eyes first

146
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:15,680
usually

147
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:21,000
smell comes next

148
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,638
and if you can really get a

149
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
we get a

150
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:29,220
all the different senses but you know in

151
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,720
today's market unfortunately I think

152
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,940
like that that's a thing of the past

153
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,060
being able to see it smell it you know

154
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:39,899
touch it feel the consistency with

155
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:43,139
um with the event of mylar bagging and

156
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:45,299
you know all the stuff at the corporate

157
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:47,639
level that people have to do it's crazy

158
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:50,579
to me that people can't smell their bud

159
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:54,120
before they smoke it blows my mind

160
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:56,599
yeah and I mean look at Art you know R

161
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:00,720
was talking about these same things in

162
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:04,139
1979. yeah right so I mean you know

163
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:07,680
people people lamenting you know cookies

164
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:09,500
and you know mylar bags that you can't

165
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,600
see what's in them and

166
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:14,399
you know about sticker with a lie inside

167
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,500
you know I mean

168
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:18,359
but it's uh

169
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,819
it's this is an old story it's been

170
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:24,300
going on a long time it drives it drives

171
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:26,098
breeding in in the wrong direction so

172
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,079
unfortunately

173
00:07:26,098 --> 00:07:31,379
um so one of the other things that I

174
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:33,359
noticed about R in his in his ability to

175
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:35,159
be prophetic was his really famous

176
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,379
article that pissed a lot of people off

177
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,060
which was bam the indica

178
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:42,538
right do you remember that article at

179
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:44,300
all is bandwidth article where he in my

180
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:47,159
opinion prophetically tells everyone

181
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:49,680
that you know this thing's gonna come in

182
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,780
it's going to dumb down weed weed's

183
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,560
never gonna be the same like he was more

184
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:57,059
of the the trippy sativa you know like

185
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,399
he liked that high that that

186
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,620
clear-headed high or that Speedy racy

187
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:03,418
high and he felt like indicus was just

188
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,280
gonna completely come in dumb it down

189
00:08:03,418 --> 00:08:07,258
and the market would be mostly Indica

190
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:10,318
dominant because the ease of growth for

191
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:12,240
for indoors and I mean it almost like

192
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,900
told the tale of what happened with

193
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:18,780
cookies and Kush like prophetically

194
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:21,538
yeah timing the timing on that article

195
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:25,378
is right on the money because you know

196
00:08:21,538 --> 00:08:27,899
the the Affy the indicas had basically

197
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:29,580
made it into every nook and cranny of

198
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:34,379
the American Market by that point

199
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:37,319
anybody wanted seeds to grow uh an Affy

200
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:39,479
um could find him and uh there was just

201
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,820
so much variety you know when you think

202
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:44,520
about the various paths that these seeds

203
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:47,459
took the connections that were made you

204
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:50,639
know the it's um it's amazing to think

205
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:54,119
about that that network of of genetics

206
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:56,159
just just exploding overnight and and

207
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,539
spreading around the country because two

208
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:00,419
years earlier

209
00:08:57,539 --> 00:09:04,159
you know it was scarce's hen's teeth you

210
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:09,000
know getting getting Indica in 19 1981

211
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:10,379
you know hard to find rare we it was you

212
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,839
know not maybe not in the hills of

213
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:14,639
NorCal but

214
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:18,660
everywhere else but in two years it was

215
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:20,879
turned you know up overnight just it was

216
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:23,819
everywhere everybody had their own seeds

217
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:25,379
and we're growing it maybe we can expand

218
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,180
on this just a little bit because it's

219
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:29,639
something I want to drive home to a lot

220
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:31,919
of the younger people because I think

221
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:34,740
and and based on

222
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:37,379
how how often I see people make claims

223
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:40,379
of having these afghanis from the early

224
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:43,259
60s and and so and even 40s in some

225
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:45,720
cases uh can we can we kind of drive

226
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:49,220
home the point when afghanis when you

227
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,220
both saw afghani's into the market

228
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:57,000
either one of you on that one

229
00:09:53,820 --> 00:10:00,480
well for me it was when I met Rob Clark

230
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,600
and bought my skunk number one seeds

231
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,399
didn't hit Afghani number one yeah that

232
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,560
was the first time I had

233
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:09,839
heard of it or really seen

234
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:11,939
and I grew some

235
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,100
I don't remember them I just he gave me

236
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:17,160
a little free pack of a few yeah

237
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:21,120
compared to the mass of skunk number one

238
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:22,980
that we bought and I I know I grew them

239
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,879
uh maybe on a little side patch or

240
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,940
something

241
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:29,939
and it was it definitely well it was

242
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:33,200
part of the genetics of skunk number one

243
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:36,360
anyway it had Afghan in it

244
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,220
and the the leaves were medium sized

245
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:42,539
they they weren't these natal beautiful

246
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:44,700
long needle sativas so um

247
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:46,379
maybe it was it piqued our interest and

248
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,778
we were going wonder why these leaves

249
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:53,039
are so wide or I haven't shared like

250
00:10:48,778 --> 00:10:55,139
that but did they smoke tanning

251
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:57,000
pardon do you remember them being

252
00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:58,500
smaller plants compared to the rest and

253
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,720
thinking what the hell is that I don't

254
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,399
remember I don't even remember growing

255
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,680
those Afghani number ones but that's

256
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:08,519
where I first heard of them so when when

257
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:10,319
Clark told me the uh genetics involved

258
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:14,278
in Skunk number one I went oh wow so

259
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:16,459
it's in here too and I

260
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:20,220
don't totally agree with r on that

261
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:22,500
because we have the ability to have all

262
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:24,959
of them now I mean you can have land

263
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:27,899
race beautiful sativas from Nepal some

264
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:30,479
remote little you know zomia that you've

265
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:33,539
discovered and other real seed company

266
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,600
and then you can have um pure Afghans if

267
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:40,319
you want them and I guess was it Tom

268
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:43,980
Hill who had Maple Leaf uh or deep chunk

269
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:46,860
yeah yeah yeah and that wasn't that a

270
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:49,700
few a pure Afghani or it was like a

271
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:52,680
hybrid of a few afghanis

272
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:56,000
he uh he says it is he says it's pure

273
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:59,338
yeah yeah

274
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,419
the um Maple Leaf was Neville's stuff

275
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:05,100
yeah okay is it is it spread around you

276
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:07,799
know he sold it under different names

277
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:10,259
and other people got the seeds from him

278
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:12,778
did their selections and sold sold stuff

279
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:14,458
under different names

280
00:12:12,778 --> 00:12:16,919
yeah that was one of the early bass

281
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:18,778
lines the maple leaf from him

282
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:20,639
um one that an Afghani that kept passing

283
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:22,379
into other lines under different names

284
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,419
definitely

285
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:25,759
hmm

286
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:28,679
supposedly

287
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:31,439
the uh the um

288
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:34,078
the maple leaf is the possibly

289
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:37,380
supposedly the back end of super skunk

290
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:40,919
and what is making Super Skunk so skunky

291
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:45,000
well you know you know it's Afghan T but

292
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:47,338
yeah the Afghan tea is maple leaf so in

293
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,078
the way the reason I say maybe is

294
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:51,000
because there are also some theories

295
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:52,799
even among Neville's old partners that

296
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,440
it was really Afghani one really named

297
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:58,078
Afghan T

298
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:00,120
which is possible you know especially

299
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:03,838
knowing Nev it's like very possible

300
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,879
because he disliked he disliked um you

301
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,639
know Santa's got banned quite a bit by

302
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:09,659
that point and giving them credit for

303
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,639
one of his

304
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:14,458
best lines when he already had half the

305
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:17,519
credit for nl5 Hayes you know

306
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:19,138
um was probably not in Neville's idea of

307
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,879
things he was going to let happen that's

308
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:22,139
my personal opinion and I know some of

309
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:24,720
the other partners kind of share that

310
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:25,799
Afghani one Theory so yeah

311
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,620
yeah

312
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:30,599
he certainly you know spoke had nothing

313
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:32,519
good to say about Afghani number one

314
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,959
when he was back on the forums but

315
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:35,399
exactly

316
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:37,199
um you know it was interesting the

317
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:40,399
language that he used it was very

318
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:44,940
non-specific he called it uh

319
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:46,980
toxic in a bad way yeah yeah like he

320
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:51,000
needed to say like there's that good

321
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:52,740
toxic you know right right but it's not

322
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,320
that one it's the other one it's the

323
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:57,419
it's a bad toxic right right right and

324
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:59,240
that goes to the point of like I saw him

325
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:02,519
like

326
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:05,159
constantly referencing Afghani one even

327
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:06,600
at points where I'm like huh why why are

328
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:07,919
you bringing it up right now like stuff

329
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,540
and they're talking about Super Stop the

330
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:11,399
stuff and he's bringing up Afghani one

331
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:13,860
and I'm just like it's almost like he's

332
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:16,860
guilty to me not guilty but maybe his

333
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:18,180
conscience coming out being like here's

334
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,860
a little hint here's a little hint for

335
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:22,199
the people actually give a [ __ ] little

336
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:24,120
little breadcrumbs that I don't know I

337
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,379
could be all in my head too you know

338
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,799
there were there were a lot of good

339
00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:31,559
lines around that didn't turn into these

340
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:33,299
legends that are sought after and those

341
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:35,159
are the ones I I wonder you know what

342
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:36,899
happened is they if they would ever pop

343
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:41,100
up again but

344
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:44,039
I mean kyber right yep

345
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:47,579
um that was that looked a lot like stuff

346
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:50,039
I grew at the time and you know it was

347
00:14:47,578 --> 00:14:52,198
fire so you know I always wanted to get

348
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:55,078
that but by the time I you know

349
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:57,899
discovered seeds online

350
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:59,759
um you know it was already yeah it was

351
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:01,679
already kind of the market was all

352
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,019
screwed up deduction totally screwed

353
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:06,599
everything up you know you know what's

354
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:09,539
interesting too a side note I just got

355
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:12,180
this in okay listen and it's something

356
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:13,860
that me and uh actually CSI mostly I

357
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:15,838
found out about it much later and we

358
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:18,120
were told about it by mustafung and it

359
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,040
is from the breeder of the Pakistani

360
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,440
chatrol Kush and it's the whole record

361
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:25,198
of the dude who bred it named isadoro

362
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:27,060
Rodriguez but it's all in Castilian so

363
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:31,078
wow it's gonna be fun to try to read it

364
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:33,419
but the breeding of chitrali is all laid

365
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:36,179
out in here in pictures and everything

366
00:15:33,419 --> 00:15:38,278
so Props to mustafung for for putting us

367
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:39,659
in the right direction on that yeah now

368
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:42,059
there's a guy you need to get on the

369
00:15:39,659 --> 00:15:44,100
internet oh my God right

370
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:45,419
yeah

371
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:48,420
definitely

372
00:15:45,419 --> 00:15:50,939
you know Santa Marley you know yeah or

373
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:52,679
Ecuadorian or Peruvian or Bolivian uh

374
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:55,620
yeah it's true they were more into coca

375
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:58,379
but I'm sure someone there

376
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:02,720
had the ability to grow I was looking

377
00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:02,720
for the article can you tell me the um

378
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:09,778
the date on it but for which

379
00:16:06,778 --> 00:16:13,039
because we are yeah the fifth this one

380
00:16:09,778 --> 00:16:18,240
is um September of

381
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:20,338
1979 79 79 yeah oh 9.79

382
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,860
and so it talks about the past five

383
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:26,220
years uh uh that he's been there and

384
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:28,199
it's in the first uh division he has at

385
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:30,480
the age and plenty of variety then they

386
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:31,919
have the the rise of the Exotics which

387
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,320
is hilarious considering what they

388
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:35,939
consider Exotics now you know the

389
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,459
narrowing of the market

390
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:40,199
we have the Colombian Gold Rush the Rise

391
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:43,379
of fool's gold and the decline of

392
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:45,179
Colombian the Advent of sin Samia which

393
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:47,519
I still think magic has something to do

394
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:50,039
with and the embryonic third generation

395
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:53,159
and the first signs of New Hope

396
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:55,439
agent plenty of variety

397
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:58,679
and I mean I I don't know if I should be

398
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:01,680
reading the whole thing but uh generally

399
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:04,619
speaking we have the menu here here's

400
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:06,859
some uh Ethiopian Emperor stash nice

401
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:10,318
little dense nuggetry there

402
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:12,298
and along with some kush some uh this is

403
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:14,399
an old picture of Afghani if it's 79

404
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:16,019
Kush smoke yeah I remember these

405
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,179
pictures I remember when this magazine

406
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:21,000
came out and the colors on that page

407
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:23,540
from that Ethiopian Emperor's stash the

408
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,578
bright emerald green and

409
00:17:23,539 --> 00:17:28,619
you know it's just just gorgeous and and

410
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:31,678
the way it was kind of similar condition

411
00:17:28,619 --> 00:17:33,739
to that what they call Kush smoke down

412
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:37,140
below it you know they both look like

413
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:40,140
this wasn't something that was manicured

414
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:41,880
and and you know put in a and protected

415
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:44,400
it was something that was thrown in a

416
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:47,940
baggie and carried around in a backpack

417
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,880
for for sure weeks you know it it looks

418
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:53,400
like that and um

419
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,580
but I I don't see a lot of seeds in the

420
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,679
in the Kush the Ethiopian definitely lit

421
00:17:56,579 --> 00:18:00,839
my imagination all the all the while

422
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:03,538
back then I still think about you know

423
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:05,819
could there be some something special in

424
00:18:03,538 --> 00:18:06,720
an Ethiopian line

425
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:10,740
um

426
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,600
I'm sure yeah especially these old ones

427
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:17,160
and it has the menu here from the week

428
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:19,319
of uh June 16th 1974 for the prices

429
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:22,259
so it shows like Mexican commercial at

430
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:25,200
200. well Hawken tops at 3 30. uh

431
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:27,359
Michoacan at 5 50. then you have the

432
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,640
Colombian Reds multi and gold and I

433
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:31,918
remember uh when I was talking to one of

434
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,780
the guys who would bring in Colombian in

435
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,440
Florida you would always talk about how

436
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:39,839
you had to buy a certain amount of uh

437
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:41,759
Colombian rainbow I believe he called it

438
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:43,619
which was the multi like they're

439
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:45,419
referring to here just like all of it

440
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:48,599
kind of compressed and combined the Reds

441
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:50,940
blacks both and or the the bottom end of

442
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:52,619
that and then for every 10 kilos of that

443
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:55,500
you would buy you'd be able to buy like

444
00:18:52,619 --> 00:18:57,599
two kilos of the black or one kilo of

445
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,980
the red or one kilo of the gold I always

446
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:01,259
thought that was fascinating that there

447
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,519
was like some kind of Market trade like

448
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:05,220
that where you can get you had to buy a

449
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:06,538
certain amount to get the higher tier

450
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:09,720
this

451
00:19:06,538 --> 00:19:12,240
looks like Panama Reds um at the top in

452
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,809
74 as far as the the highest priced

453
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,140
demand

454
00:19:13,809 --> 00:19:19,139
[Music]

455
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:21,179
600 a pound whereas you know commercial

456
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,740
Mexicans at 200 so three times the price

457
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:23,880
of shitty commercial Mexicans moving in

458
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,500
all the time so it's talking about the

459
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,880
rise of Exotics here yes by the end of

460
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,339
the first year in addition to all the

461
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,140
goodies on that menu above almost every

462
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:33,240
time you showed up at Crosby's or

463
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:35,280
similar smoking salons and I guess they

464
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,220
were smoking the saloon somewhere which

465
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:41,160
that sounds fascinating for the time

466
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:44,100
um well it needs more saloons yeah right

467
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,660
uh new and excite exciting stamp example

468
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:47,579
of by the surprising second generation

469
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,200
dopes by the end of the year the menu

470
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:52,319
would include the following premium

471
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,500
price entries we have the Chaco Chiba or

472
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:57,418
at least Chiba uh 65 Colombian per ounce

473
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,759
wacky weed which is what art talks about

474
00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:01,799
all the time 75 an ounce and the Santa

475
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:03,660
Barbara gold for 60 an ounce so at that

476
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:07,079
time wacky weeds killing it whereas the

477
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:09,779
tie is at 200 to 240 an ounce per stick

478
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:11,819
at 15 to 20 and Hawaiian at 160 so

479
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:14,399
significantly above the Colombian at the

480
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:16,918
time right here you can see a picture of

481
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,660
the the Jamaican land spread very early

482
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:21,780
picture of it

483
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:25,080
and there's the wacky weed

484
00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:26,759
the Colombian wacky weed

485
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:30,178
and do you want to explain why he called

486
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:32,960
it wacky weed bro

487
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:36,360
no

488
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,038
I don't think uh no honestly I I never

489
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:40,678
had anybody sell me anything called

490
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:43,259
wacky weed right so yeah

491
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:45,600
um hearing these descriptions of it it I

492
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:49,440
know jaggy and I probably both are

493
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:52,139
thinking this you know sounds familiar

494
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:55,080
um but it's you know like Mad Jack's

495
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:57,059
source of the candy bar the black highly

496
00:20:55,079 --> 00:21:00,058
compressed

497
00:20:57,058 --> 00:21:02,579
um you know super super weed that was

498
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:06,379
you know sliced off with a razor blade

499
00:21:02,579 --> 00:21:09,298
like cash yeah um you know that's

500
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:11,760
you hear similar kind of attributes or

501
00:21:09,298 --> 00:21:13,619
traits to the effect to this but it's

502
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:15,480
it's definitely not the same thing

503
00:21:13,619 --> 00:21:17,819
because you know there was just that one

504
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,620
farmer up there crafting that out and I

505
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:23,599
never saw anything like like what they

506
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:27,139
said of wacky week yeah

507
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:29,519
it's a nickname um in 1970 in Denver

508
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:32,520
there was a weed that I never saw again

509
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:36,720
that they called cartoon weed

510
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:38,639
and when you smoke this everything

511
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,339
you couldn't stop laughing from the

512
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,259
moment you took the first few Puffs and

513
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:46,500
you're just everything became a cartoon

514
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:48,779
in the sense that you couldn't hold back

515
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,940
and let stop laughing and it was just

516
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:52,200
fabulous more typical from when people

517
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,960
eat

518
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,819
um cannabis you know they get into the

519
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,620
giggles and then maybe into just

520
00:21:56,819 --> 00:22:00,899
laughing so hard they have tears running

521
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:03,719
down their eye out of their eyes but

522
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:06,659
cartoon weed wacky weed you know

523
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:10,019
nicknames that I guess if you smoke

524
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:12,179
wacky weed you'd get whacked and it was

525
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:14,460
just overly powerful

526
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:17,640
yeah he he refers to in a lot of these

527
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:19,980
articles as he almost refers to it as if

528
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,538
he thinks maybe it's either a strain or

529
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:23,279
expression or something that can be

530
00:22:21,538 --> 00:22:25,558
gotten more than once you know from the

531
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:26,700
same farmer and that it's an actual it

532
00:22:25,558 --> 00:22:28,918
seems like he's talking about like it's

533
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,360
strain but I think more than likely it

534
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:32,460
was just highly compressed really

535
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:34,918
high-end Colombian where the oils have

536
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:38,880
really soaked in you know to that bud

537
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:41,159
maybe even hash coated like or oil hash

538
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,840
oil compressed

539
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:45,059
um but yeah it sounds like it just made

540
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:47,819
people absolutely stupid and and lose

541
00:22:45,058 --> 00:22:52,500
control of their limbs a fellow I knew

542
00:22:47,819 --> 00:22:55,859
in Chicagoland in 1970-71 had high

543
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:58,679
school kids making Thai sticks you had

544
00:22:55,859 --> 00:23:01,459
the same same little

545
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:04,320
splinters of they were like bamboos

546
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:07,620
steaks little tiny ones and he would pay

547
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:10,500
these kids to sit and it was Mexican and

548
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:12,899
it was good since Samia early stuff and

549
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,880
he had them wrap the buds very carefully

550
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:17,900
on these sticks because he could

551
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:20,640
quadruple the money he charged easy yeah

552
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:23,159
that's brilliant though he was an early

553
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,080
entrepreneur yeah that's it that's an

554
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:27,299
entrepreneur a definitely an

555
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:28,740
entrepreneur

556
00:23:27,298 --> 00:23:30,779
um So lately a lot of people have been

557
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:33,480
talking about the choco Chiba Colombian

558
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:36,298
especially since we uh did the chocolate

559
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,759
tie episode a few days ago and right

560
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:41,819
here it talks about the entrance

561
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:43,259
of the Chiba at least the that region in

562
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:45,058
Colombia where stuff was imported from

563
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:46,619
and it says while Tai was certainly the

564
00:23:45,058 --> 00:23:48,538
most glamorous among the new treats

565
00:23:46,619 --> 00:23:50,279
served up I think not enough credit has

566
00:23:48,538 --> 00:23:52,200
gone to Chiva which for the sake of

567
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:54,538
historical Justice deserves a footnote

568
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,058
uh as the first high-level breakthrough

569
00:23:54,538 --> 00:23:59,038
to Second Generation quality grass so

570
00:23:57,058 --> 00:24:01,019
they're referring to the Chiba maybe as

571
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:04,500
a second generation type Colombian gold

572
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:06,720
or gold type Chiba hit the state shortly

573
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,339
before Thai and opened up a lot of Mines

574
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,620
to the higher possibilities of grass

575
00:24:08,339 --> 00:24:14,279
opened up a lot of wallets too it was a

576
00:24:10,619 --> 00:24:15,779
closer to a psychedelic uh than any

577
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:18,480
other previous grass available

578
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:20,460
breathtaking Russia's super energetic

579
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,019
and cerebral grass and demonstrated to

580
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:25,019
the marijuana marketers that people

581
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:26,639
would pay 75 an ounce almost double what

582
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:28,558
they were accustomed to if the grass was

583
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,480
like Chiba a Quantum Leap above the

584
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:32,819
ordinary chiefly established the reality

585
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,038
of The high-priced Gourmet Market and

586
00:24:32,819 --> 00:24:37,200
after that the supply began to match the

587
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:38,700
demand and then it was talks about Chiba

588
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,640
followed by other Colombian specialties

589
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:43,798
like the wacky weed and the tie and and

590
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,840
other stuff like that coming in

591
00:24:43,798 --> 00:24:47,400
uh uh and then it talks about the

592
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:49,220
narrowing of the market and one of the

593
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:53,159
first things to go was the Panama Red

594
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:55,079
and today I I know like there are people

595
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:56,280
that sell different kinds of panamanians

596
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:58,379
out there

597
00:24:56,279 --> 00:25:01,500
um but as far as what a true Panama Red

598
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:03,539
is I don't know if anybody agrees can

599
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,339
either of you comment on Panama Red or

600
00:25:03,538 --> 00:25:08,359
your experience with the red

601
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:08,359
or did you have any

602
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,960
um

603
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:16,259
well you know I I didn't know whether

604
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:19,679
what I got was a Colombian red or Panama

605
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:22,079
Red I like to think it was Panama Red it

606
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:25,679
was certainly an amazing plant

607
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:27,599
um the weed itself was amazing

608
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,759
um

609
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:32,219
you know it's pretty pretty lame

610
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:34,278
descriptive words but

611
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,278
um

612
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,400
you know

613
00:25:35,819 --> 00:25:42,720
I just looked up to see if when we gave

614
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:44,519
up the Panama Canal to back to Panama I

615
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,860
was trying to figure out what might have

616
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:48,599
you know besides you know maybe they

617
00:25:46,859 --> 00:25:50,099
just got tired of growing weed down

618
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:52,619
there I don't know you know but what

619
00:25:50,099 --> 00:25:56,099
what would be the reasons why something

620
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:58,558
like that might happen sure yeah it

621
00:25:56,099 --> 00:26:00,658
didn't it looks like

622
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:02,940
part of that happened during the Carter

623
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:05,220
presidency which would have would have

624
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,778
been a right around the right timeline

625
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,839
yeah

626
00:26:06,778 --> 00:26:08,839
um

627
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:14,519
yeah I don't know I'm not sure why but

628
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:16,200
you know as as far as the quality of

629
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:19,980
that

630
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:21,419
of that weed

631
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:26,120
um

632
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:30,659
you know potent tasty uh unique effect

633
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:33,959
what good effects but um you know

634
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:36,960
definitely in a kind of rarified air

635
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,700
like you know man I can't you know I

636
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,220
hope I ever get to smoke something like

637
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:44,038
this good again when it happens you know

638
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:46,259
it yeah and um you know it just was so

639
00:26:44,038 --> 00:26:47,759
uncommon that talking about it

640
00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:49,679
disappearing

641
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:50,940
um you know would have been like what

642
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,278
you mean

643
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:55,679
it's true I am never gonna get to smoke

644
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:57,480
this again for the rest of my life yes I

645
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:00,480
already I already believed it you know

646
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:02,339
yeah um you know maybe maybe different

647
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,339
people in different circles got that

648
00:27:02,339 --> 00:27:07,558
connoisseur uh stuff flowing through

649
00:27:05,339 --> 00:27:11,099
non-stop like that that would have been

650
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:12,720
amazing but that wasn't my experience so

651
00:27:11,099 --> 00:27:15,418
what about you Jackie what was your

652
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:18,558
experience with the Panama City

653
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:21,538
four finger baggie for 15 in Denver

654
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:26,158
nineteen seventy nineteen seventy that's

655
00:27:21,538 --> 00:27:31,440
early man well 69 and 70. I was in

656
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:33,900
Denver 69 70 and 71. and it was um

657
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,400
excellent weed it was right up there it

658
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:38,759
was

659
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:40,500
at the Advent of sinsemia where seedless

660
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:45,058
weed was starting to separate itself

661
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:48,599
from the traditional seeded weed and

662
00:27:45,058 --> 00:27:51,538
yeah less pressed from the super press

663
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:55,740
started the same you know even oaxacan

664
00:27:51,538 --> 00:27:58,919
Spears in entirety just cola's uh

665
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:01,558
wrapped in cellophane pressed lightly

666
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:03,480
but you know some big bundle in your

667
00:28:01,558 --> 00:28:05,759
arms might only weigh four pounds or

668
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:09,839
five pounds because yeah it would

669
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:10,980
um and true there was more stem that way

670
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:13,798
but

671
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:16,440
wow for the quality of the spears it

672
00:28:13,798 --> 00:28:19,819
what didn't matter Panama Red

673
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:23,278
to me it was in that top tier back then

674
00:28:19,819 --> 00:28:27,058
1970 quality wise

675
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:30,298
I don't remember the smell the aroma

676
00:28:27,058 --> 00:28:32,759
but yeah

677
00:28:30,298 --> 00:28:36,058
do you remember it standing out any more

678
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:39,778
than Colombian gold or anything else

679
00:28:36,058 --> 00:28:41,220
I think it might have had an edge

680
00:28:39,778 --> 00:28:43,500
well

681
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:46,380
it disappeared at some point pretty

682
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:47,819
quickly and and has has our

683
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:51,539
his R has

684
00:28:47,819 --> 00:28:53,599
explained his gold just you know the

685
00:28:51,538 --> 00:28:56,579
Columbians don't do anything small

686
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:57,899
they're very organized so they started

687
00:28:56,579 --> 00:29:01,199
shipping

688
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:02,759
not just tons but

689
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,919
freighters

690
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:08,640
I met a guy

691
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:12,720
who brought in Freighters in like the

692
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:16,500
east coast of Florida with 200 250

693
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:18,480
000 pounds in a load he eventually

694
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,220
he had too many employees I mean the

695
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,620
just the offloaders on the docks there

696
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:25,079
was like 30 people and eventually

697
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:27,599
someone got in trouble and they they

698
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:30,538
were facing big time and they rolled and

699
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:32,398
it went right up the chain to him and I

700
00:29:30,538 --> 00:29:33,839
probably bought my first ounce of weed

701
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:36,959
in Denver from

702
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:40,980
his group because they were sending from

703
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:44,100
these freighter loads to Chicago Denver

704
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:46,740
New York all the major cities

705
00:29:44,099 --> 00:29:49,439
and it

706
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:52,919
I think Colombian just eclipsed the

707
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:55,259
Panama Red it along with Mexican too it

708
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:57,840
wasn't until Mexico got really

709
00:29:55,259 --> 00:30:02,819
focused on high quality you know the

710
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:04,980
guerreran the sinaloan oaxacan and they

711
00:30:02,819 --> 00:30:06,839
were mostly people bringing small loads

712
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:08,880
like airplane loads where they didn't

713
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:11,398
have to have them

714
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:14,460
sitting in a freighter for three weeks

715
00:30:11,398 --> 00:30:18,000
while it's coming up from Colombia but

716
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:21,000
but gold the gold was a very big

717
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,278
presence super presence when it came

718
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:26,099
and it came big

719
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:28,019
that's why I think people wanted it so

720
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:30,119
badly you know because you might get

721
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:31,679
some one time that was super potent and

722
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:34,019
then another one next time that was

723
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,700
super moldy you know it was very

724
00:30:34,019 --> 00:30:39,720
difficult unless you've had an inside

725
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:41,640
line to the importers themselves yeah

726
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:46,259
where you could get the tops and the the

727
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:48,720
best parts of each pack yeah definitely

728
00:30:46,259 --> 00:30:50,579
yeah that's fascinating man I wonder I

729
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,399
wonder if because I noticed in a lot of

730
00:30:50,579 --> 00:30:54,778
these old articles uh he repeatedly

731
00:30:53,398 --> 00:30:56,939
talks about The Disappearance of

732
00:30:54,778 --> 00:30:58,759
Colombian too at some point that that

733
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:01,919
Colombian kind of died off for a while

734
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:04,019
and you know at first was a Panama then

735
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,360
came Colombian and I wonder if it was

736
00:31:04,019 --> 00:31:08,278
just the the

737
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:09,778
push of Mexico being so much closer to

738
00:31:08,278 --> 00:31:12,058
the U.S and being that it was so much

739
00:31:09,778 --> 00:31:13,740
easier to smuggle for Mexico than having

740
00:31:12,058 --> 00:31:15,839
to go all the way down to South America

741
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:18,120
for Colombia move it all the way up

742
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:20,759
until they had some kind of in-route

743
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:22,678
worked with the the groups in Mexico to

744
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:24,898
smuggle up for them you know and

745
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:26,340
eventually Colombians did come back they

746
00:31:24,898 --> 00:31:27,479
made a return for a little bit and he

747
00:31:26,339 --> 00:31:29,879
talks about that in some of the later

748
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:32,880
articles yeah you know I I think a lot

749
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:35,640
of the the rise of homegrown in America

750
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:38,399
happened about the same time that that

751
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:40,740
cocaine started taking over as far as

752
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:43,678
what they wanted to fill their airplanes

753
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:45,839
with the smuggle yeah um you know those

754
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,538
two things happened about the same time

755
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:51,599
so commercial Colombian you know the

756
00:31:48,538 --> 00:31:53,579
Heyday of of Colombian dominating the

757
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:54,240
weed Market

758
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:58,558
um

759
00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:00,720
it it literally went away like

760
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:03,720
over it it seemed like it was almost

761
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,240
overnight you know it's definitely over

762
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:08,460
the course of one year it went from you

763
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,159
know Colombian was everywhere to who

764
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:12,120
wants that [ __ ] to you can't even find

765
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:14,159
it anymore

766
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:16,558
yeah right

767
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:19,380
um it just happened so fast with with

768
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:22,379
good homegrown showing up around the

769
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:24,480
country the the indicas show Indica

770
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:26,120
seeds showing up around the country all

771
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:30,778
around that same

772
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:32,579
82-83 1983 time frame really is when it

773
00:32:30,778 --> 00:32:34,319
when it was everywhere

774
00:32:32,579 --> 00:32:35,339
yeah

775
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:37,859
yeah

776
00:32:35,339 --> 00:32:40,259
I have a photo here I'll see if it'll

777
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:43,139
show up it goes along with what we're

778
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:46,579
talking about okay yeah but on the share

779
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:46,580
thing uh

780
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:55,200
well I here go to presenters

781
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:57,720
it's Columbia's green right this is

782
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:01,798
an article that was

783
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:03,659
I think let's see in 2019 this was

784
00:33:01,798 --> 00:33:05,579
published but it shows all the major

785
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:09,299
weed growing areas

786
00:33:05,579 --> 00:33:12,119
in the cocoa Valley Cali is right up

787
00:33:09,298 --> 00:33:15,058
here but at the bottom Pope Leon down

788
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:17,359
here is a famous area too so they have a

789
00:33:15,058 --> 00:33:22,139
lot of famous areas yeah I guess so

790
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:23,459
Highlands Highlands let's see corinto

791
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:26,038
yeah

792
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:30,179
purple corinto that's a famous One

793
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:32,038
yep really I have not heard that no so

794
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:33,538
one of the the quotes that R has here it

795
00:33:32,038 --> 00:33:35,398
says gold looks so good that people

796
00:33:33,538 --> 00:33:37,798
became conditioned to the notion if

797
00:33:35,398 --> 00:33:40,439
grass wasn't gold it couldn't be good

798
00:33:37,798 --> 00:33:43,259
all the Glitters Is Not Great Grass and

799
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:45,419
not all great grasses gold and this to

800
00:33:43,259 --> 00:33:48,778
me like as a as a person who grew up

801
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:52,740
post you know it really heavily started

802
00:33:48,778 --> 00:33:56,579
smoking in the 90s the idea of gold or

803
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:58,980
brown weed to me was just like uh bummer

804
00:33:56,579 --> 00:34:01,500
you know but at some point in the US

805
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:04,140
like we've talked about people really

806
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,880
did genuinely expect gold

807
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:07,259
um and people were trying to figure out

808
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,179
home Growers were trying to figure out

809
00:34:07,259 --> 00:34:11,338
how to get their plants to dry gold

810
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:13,440
because it just wasn't selling for a

811
00:34:11,338 --> 00:34:14,878
while

812
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,918
and that's kind of what this is

813
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:20,398
referring to

814
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:22,980
well you know this is this is like 76 or

815
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:25,739
77 there 79

816
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:28,320
yeah yeah this is yeah I mean you just

817
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:31,199
have to understand that it it a very

818
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,599
small window of time where markets

819
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:35,579
transitioning and reacting to demand for

820
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:39,139
something like like a color

821
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:42,179
right and how and how you know Growers

822
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:44,639
and middlemen around you know around the

823
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:46,378
world are trying to trying to make what

824
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:50,099
they have

825
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:53,519
sell yeah so I mean we saw it with

826
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:56,280
cookies and you know the the the wide

827
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:58,019
variety of dessert weed out there

828
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:00,480
um when cookies first came out you know

829
00:34:58,019 --> 00:35:03,539
it was uh the cut was hoarded you know

830
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,940
it didn't exist in seed seed form you

831
00:35:03,539 --> 00:35:06,599
know the people that had it

832
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:09,480
um

833
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:12,000
you know everybody wanted it but it

834
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:13,380
didn't exist so the market invented it

835
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,960
right just like what we were talking

836
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:19,200
about Matt the other day was you know if

837
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:21,659
you give people the CR the traits that

838
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:24,838
the product has they will change all

839
00:35:21,659 --> 00:35:27,179
their labeling without without changing

840
00:35:24,838 --> 00:35:28,739
the contents of the package exactly

841
00:35:27,179 --> 00:35:30,419
exactly right

842
00:35:28,739 --> 00:35:32,759
so I mean you know all of a sudden

843
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:35,760
everybody had cookies but nobody had

844
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:37,380
cookies right yeah and um and that's the

845
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,480
same thing with this gold except back

846
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:41,700
then I mean we were stupid because it

847
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:44,940
was the 70s and and you know you could

848
00:35:41,699 --> 00:35:47,279
get away with being stupid but people

849
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:49,559
would do things physically to the weed

850
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,079
to try and change the color you know

851
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:53,460
putting it out in the sun I mean you

852
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,560
want if you want to know how to kill

853
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:58,380
cannabinoids that's that's how you kill

854
00:35:55,559 --> 00:36:00,358
Canada right in the sun yeah all right

855
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:03,180
just stick it right out there yeah it's

856
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:04,858
gold but now nobody gets high yeah or

857
00:36:03,179 --> 00:36:07,259
girdle it you know like they talk about

858
00:36:04,858 --> 00:36:10,679
that stabbing the stem in the middle

859
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:13,320
yeah all that sort of uh you know things

860
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:16,019
to stress the plant and make it

861
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,980
make it die a particularly colorful

862
00:36:16,019 --> 00:36:19,259
death

863
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:21,059
well you remember hanging a plant upside

864
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:23,599
down at Harvest was supposed to make it

865
00:36:21,059 --> 00:36:26,880
more potent because the red tops

866
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:28,940
downhill from in the from the stock into

867
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,858
the flowers

868
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:33,659
I remember that that uh old wives tale

869
00:36:31,858 --> 00:36:36,358
but if you hung it upside down the THC

870
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:38,578
would spike to the top of the tops oh

871
00:36:36,358 --> 00:36:41,699
yeah gotta have the juices you know yeah

872
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:45,240
yeah so this is interesting or people

873
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:47,939
understood trichomes and oh yeah oh well

874
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:50,279
exactly this is this is interesting so

875
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:52,139
it looks like right here uh our answers

876
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,760
the question on if Santa Marta was the

877
00:36:52,139 --> 00:36:56,639
first Golds to hit

878
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:59,460
actually looks like Chiba was the first

879
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:02,519
wave of Colombians and Santa Marta

880
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:04,740
started in 74 to 75. it says Santa Marta

881
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:06,239
was an authentic high level gold it

882
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:08,098
didn't have the Psychedelic upper

883
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:10,319
reaches of Chiba but it was powerful and

884
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:12,180
energetic a very up high more than that

885
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:15,119
Santa Marta set a new standard for

886
00:37:12,179 --> 00:37:17,338
beauty that pleased the physical senses

887
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:19,559
it was pretty to see with its plump

888
00:37:17,338 --> 00:37:21,719
blonde buds bursting with pollen furred

889
00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:24,960
flowers it smelled delicious with the

890
00:37:21,719 --> 00:37:26,939
fresh spicy pequa peppery flowery

891
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,039
fragrance it tasted especially good

892
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:32,760
Tangy warm and spicy on the tongue with

893
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:34,380
a fruity tinge that it tested I hate

894
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,900
when it does this

895
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,858
it had tested uh to its flowery

896
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:38,940
freshness

897
00:37:37,858 --> 00:37:40,199
um so there's some pretty good

898
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,760
descriptions of Chloe would you guys

899
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:44,098
agree with some of those descriptions of

900
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:47,400
what you saw

901
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:49,920
yeah I mean he uh he he dances around

902
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:53,160
some of it I think um you know he hints

903
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:55,320
at some of the wood or incensey type

904
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:58,379
uh traits that are there it's a it's a

905
00:37:55,320 --> 00:38:02,880
an amazing combination with the you know

906
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:06,420
The Buttery hashy citrusy kind of uh

907
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:09,358
Tangy I think is what I I read a word he

908
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:10,019
used in some of these articles

909
00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:13,380
um

910
00:38:10,019 --> 00:38:16,440
you know still got that to have those

911
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:20,940
kind of high notes mixed with the earthy

912
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:23,639
wooden incensey stuff it makes it very

913
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:27,900
hard hitting uh as a terp combination

914
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:30,299
you know incense with with Citrus uh

915
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:33,559
can can really can really deliver the

916
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,560
goods so oh I bet

917
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:39,240
well being 45 years ago I can't really

918
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:42,000
tell you I

919
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:46,139
honestly it would be a stretch but I'm

920
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:51,019
sure it did you think it was hashings

921
00:38:46,139 --> 00:38:51,019
Jack did you think it was hashy tasting

922
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:58,440
I no I wouldn't call Santa Marta has she

923
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,060
um or

924
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:04,139
maybe those

925
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:07,500
those blacks the blacks from Colombia

926
00:39:04,139 --> 00:39:09,838
could go that way but even even the

927
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,679
wacky weed or the candy bar my friend

928
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:13,078
had

929
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:16,199
though you had to cut it like it was

930
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:19,859
hash it didn't smoke like hash it it was

931
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:22,379
well I'll take that back it might be

932
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:24,598
equivalent to smoking hash in a joint

933
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:26,460
because my friend in Tempe used to roll

934
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:29,160
joints out of hash that he crumbled up

935
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:32,280
and they were little pin joints but boy

936
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:34,259
they were potent so maybe there but I I

937
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:37,019
don't remember

938
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:39,839
this being at all a Santa Marta being at

939
00:39:37,019 --> 00:39:42,599
all ashy they it was just

940
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:44,639
a delicate

941
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:46,680
High you know it was it was an up high

942
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:48,179
maybe that's what was so special well

943
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:50,460
how can was similar at the beginning

944
00:39:48,179 --> 00:39:52,559
just a super

945
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:54,358
space shot you know you just went up

946
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:56,279
higher and higher kind of psychedelic I

947
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:59,900
think that's where they applied the word

948
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,900
psychedelic to some weeds

949
00:40:00,179 --> 00:40:05,940
though at the time most of us were also

950
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:07,939
experimenting with psychedelics so it's

951
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:11,280
kind of hard to

952
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:13,519
decide when we were accurate and when we

953
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,519
weren't

954
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:18,720
here's a new interesting one it says a

955
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:21,358
promising new entry in 77 for instance

956
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:22,980
was the man is Alice block is this have

957
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:26,000
you guys ever heard of this one

958
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:27,900
not by that name but I know

959
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,719
where's that at

960
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:33,240
well that map of the cow cut I think it

961
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:35,939
was on on in that era let me look at it

962
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:38,719
I can look it on my desktop here yeah

963
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:38,720
uh

964
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,358
nope

965
00:40:42,659 --> 00:40:46,799
I think monizales was one of the Low

966
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:48,799
Land

967
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,900
um West Coast

968
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:56,539
areas yeah

969
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:58,260
I'll bring up a quick Google view

970
00:40:56,539 --> 00:41:00,779
yeah that's

971
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:02,940
that's Mexican there for sure well

972
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:05,400
Hawking tops and and right here is a

973
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:07,019
picture of the Chiba for and like I said

974
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,480
this has been brought up a lot lately

975
00:41:07,019 --> 00:41:11,219
the Chiba the choco Chiba

976
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:14,159
um I I guess maybe some seed companies

977
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:16,019
are playing with some purported jiba but

978
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:18,899
this is what uh it actually looked like

979
00:41:16,019 --> 00:41:21,119
documented back in 1979 the real Chiba

980
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:22,800
right here

981
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:26,820
as best we know it's a real cheap

982
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:28,440
anyways well it's a real name yeah well

983
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:30,119
the thing is like I always try to remind

984
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:32,880
people I'm not sure about it this time

985
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:35,700
but later on High Times would use pretty

986
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,619
much any picture they wanted to and

987
00:41:35,699 --> 00:41:39,419
insert it and just put a name on top of

988
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:40,680
it and that did happen when like they

989
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:42,420
didn't have a picture handy for

990
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:44,219
something wow so a lot of times

991
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:46,139
especially during the 80s and 90s and

992
00:41:44,219 --> 00:41:47,519
and on to the 90s it became standard

993
00:41:46,139 --> 00:41:48,900
practice if you look at like some of the

994
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:51,119
chem dog

995
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:53,039
um pictures like the pictures of chem

996
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:55,619
dog over the years are not even related

997
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:56,880
to it it was just stock photos so but I

998
00:41:55,619 --> 00:42:00,780
think during this time these probably

999
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:03,000
are not stock photos I'm guessing no no

1000
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:05,460
That'll Walk and that's that's that

1001
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,659
looks legit I remember when it came out

1002
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:08,659
thinking yeah okay

1003
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:13,680
yeah

1004
00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:16,199
so it looks it sounds like during the

1005
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:18,059
summer of 76 was the big drought like

1006
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:20,460
the first real hit of drought in the

1007
00:42:18,059 --> 00:42:23,759
United States and just getting really

1008
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:26,159
crappy weed was coming in

1009
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,960
you know it's one thing Matt the people

1010
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:30,059
get confused about this they don't

1011
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:32,820
understand that the the United States

1012
00:42:30,059 --> 00:42:35,578
was not just this one monolithic Market

1013
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:39,480
yeah right and so even though High Times

1014
00:42:35,579 --> 00:42:41,039
uh writes about it that way often

1015
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:43,219
um because you know it's just a much

1016
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:45,659
better story to just tell tell

1017
00:42:43,219 --> 00:42:48,239
intimately what's happening right there

1018
00:42:45,659 --> 00:42:50,460
around you you know instead of saying I

1019
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:53,039
think it might be dry in Tucson you know

1020
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:55,079
I mean yeah you know so talk about where

1021
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:56,940
you are as if that's the center of the

1022
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:59,099
world and and everybody else will kind

1023
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:01,139
of Ride Along with you but

1024
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:03,960
um you know the market was divided up

1025
00:43:01,139 --> 00:43:07,500
into you know thousands of little micro

1026
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:09,480
markets that yeah you just you know one

1027
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:12,059
place you could get one thing all the

1028
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:13,740
time another place you know they would

1029
00:43:12,059 --> 00:43:16,980
kill to have that but they've got

1030
00:43:13,739 --> 00:43:19,379
everything else I'm sure um and it's

1031
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:21,300
just um you can't people today they get

1032
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:23,880
really confused when they read this old

1033
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:28,200
stuff they think you know that's that

1034
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:31,140
was America yeah right America's too big

1035
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:34,379
for that for for that to be you know

1036
00:43:31,139 --> 00:43:37,679
it's this is just a a tiny little

1037
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:40,019
snapshot of and and it's accurate you

1038
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:42,779
know for for that moment in time in that

1039
00:43:40,019 --> 00:43:44,880
place yes but it's America's big place

1040
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:46,380
yeah it was probably accurate for New

1041
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,000
York which is where they thought the

1042
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:50,940
center of the world was at High Times

1043
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,300
Like notoriously you know right like

1044
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:57,900
like a group of the 20 most famous

1045
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:59,400
potheads in New York exactly right with

1046
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:02,039
everybody bringing them all their best

1047
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:04,619
[ __ ] on a regular basis oh interesting

1048
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:06,719
Ed rosenthal's referenced here according

1049
00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:09,358
to the grass growing expert Ed Rosenthal

1050
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:11,459
the longer grass lies around the greater

1051
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:13,519
the disintegration of the high inspiring

1052
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:16,318
cannabinoids into the crater cannabinoid

1053
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:18,719
cannabidiols these latter according to

1054
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:20,639
Roosevelt give us confused sleepy dizzy

1055
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:23,639
fuzzy undertone that undercuts the

1056
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:25,799
clarity of the cannabinole highs so he's

1057
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:27,838
talking about early CBD and stuff I

1058
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:31,700
don't know I know a lot of people say

1059
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:34,440
cbd's sleepy and all this kind of CBN

1060
00:44:31,699 --> 00:44:37,139
degrades it turns to CBN

1061
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:40,559
um manazales is straight west of Bogota

1062
00:44:37,139 --> 00:44:44,519
it's the Colombians uh coffee growing

1063
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:49,019
region and it's 7 000 feet elevation so

1064
00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:51,539
wow Madness black would be

1065
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:53,699
probably pretty potent yeah I would

1066
00:44:51,539 --> 00:44:55,739
think so high elevation probably really

1067
00:44:53,699 --> 00:44:57,659
dark black weed from the from the

1068
00:44:55,739 --> 00:44:59,279
weather yeah that sounds good might have

1069
00:44:57,659 --> 00:45:01,799
been yeah yeah

1070
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,300
it sounds delicious I mean I always

1071
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:06,780
wanted to go down there and visit my

1072
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:10,140
friend but it was the kidnap capital of

1073
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:11,040
the world at that time and into the 90s

1074
00:45:10,139 --> 00:45:13,618
even

1075
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:16,019
um then Mexico took over as the kidnap

1076
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:18,300
come but if you were an American there

1077
00:45:16,019 --> 00:45:20,759
was someone who was always willing to

1078
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:23,579
grab you because someone would care

1079
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:25,800
about you enough to pay money and yeah I

1080
00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:27,180
guess I just couldn't see doing it so I

1081
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:30,359
never went down

1082
00:45:27,179 --> 00:45:32,098
yeah sorry unless they would have gotten

1083
00:45:30,358 --> 00:45:34,739
all your stickers too

1084
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:37,940
yeah right

1085
00:45:34,739 --> 00:45:37,939
confiscate them right

1086
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:43,079
he says uh

1087
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:46,079
since Amelia is the surfer girl of dope

1088
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:48,119
missing the wild trippy exoticism of the

1089
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:50,460
best imported weed and the soaring

1090
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:52,920
cerebral sensual reaches of Thai in

1091
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:54,960
Hawaii so I I guess what he's referring

1092
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:57,240
to Cincinnati here it's just a general

1093
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,639
term for stuff like homegrown without

1094
00:45:57,239 --> 00:46:01,078
seeds even local homegrown it looks like

1095
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:03,838
based on what he's writing around here

1096
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:05,579
you know so yeah one thing one thing you

1097
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:07,078
pick up from that you know it's he's

1098
00:46:05,579 --> 00:46:09,839
talking about basically it just doesn't

1099
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:12,780
have legs it doesn't have the the depth

1100
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:15,239
of power and complexity and effects but

1101
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:17,460
you know that's honestly those first

1102
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:19,500
couple years when when you know

1103
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:21,358
domestically grown weed was taking over

1104
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:23,519
that market there was a lot of stuff

1105
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:26,098
that didn't that was harvested before it

1106
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:28,199
was mature oh sure yeah and so when you

1107
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:30,780
read what he says you know it's kind of

1108
00:46:28,199 --> 00:46:32,519
like this this empty-headed surfer girl

1109
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:35,640
you get high and then you're not high

1110
00:46:32,519 --> 00:46:37,440
and it's over you know that's that think

1111
00:46:35,639 --> 00:46:40,318
about it for a second this is these are

1112
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:43,260
new Growers their first crop or two you

1113
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:46,440
know harvested early it looks good but

1114
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:48,599
it's not packing the full punch it's not

1115
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:50,579
because of genetics it was because of

1116
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:52,980
you know Growers learning how to deal

1117
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:55,200
with those with you know how to produce

1118
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:57,838
the product that their customers really

1119
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:59,338
wanted so yeah in their area I mean they

1120
00:46:57,838 --> 00:47:01,559
were the pioneers of it so it wasn't

1121
00:46:59,338 --> 00:47:03,659
like there was tons of books or tons of

1122
00:47:01,559 --> 00:47:05,400
resources to go learn how to grow this

1123
00:47:03,659 --> 00:47:07,920
properly or when to harvest or any of

1124
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:10,559
that this is also new at that time yeah

1125
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:13,380
yeah I mean it was you know just you

1126
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:15,358
know bring it to maturity is is not easy

1127
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:18,539
especially when you you know this is

1128
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:21,119
before the full indica

1129
00:47:18,539 --> 00:47:23,338
um Invasion took place so there was

1130
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:24,900
still a lot of Highly worked hybrids

1131
00:47:23,338 --> 00:47:27,059
that were just barely getting it done

1132
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:29,818
before the frost you know

1133
00:47:27,059 --> 00:47:31,739
so it mentions even Congolese black here

1134
00:47:29,818 --> 00:47:33,500
which I'm kind of surprised there's a

1135
00:47:31,739 --> 00:47:35,519
it's something called

1136
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:37,679
Tanganyika green

1137
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:40,500
never even heard of that never heard of

1138
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:42,358
it some kind of African grass

1139
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:44,880
one of the forums that I've been on

1140
00:47:42,358 --> 00:47:47,699
there was a fellow from Namibia

1141
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:50,338
and he sent me some seeds from the

1142
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:52,559
country just north of him Angola and

1143
00:47:50,338 --> 00:47:55,559
they've been growing weed there for

1144
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:58,318
Angola red as one of them and yeah

1145
00:47:55,559 --> 00:47:59,940
um I I've never grown them I still have

1146
00:47:58,318 --> 00:48:02,818
them but it's supposed to be pretty

1147
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:03,720
potent was that the LA mono Negra Angola

1148
00:48:02,818 --> 00:48:06,719
red

1149
00:48:03,719 --> 00:48:10,259
so you got uh no it's it's actually from

1150
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:13,500
a fella who lives in Namibia and got

1151
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:15,660
them himself that's cool Namibia is

1152
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:18,059
famous for the the

1153
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:20,940
no there's like it's sort of like the

1154
00:48:18,059 --> 00:48:23,279
Lost Coast it's sand dunes that come

1155
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:25,639
down to the ocean and for the longest

1156
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:29,220
time it was closed to people because

1157
00:48:25,639 --> 00:48:31,639
diamonds washed up onto the shores oh

1158
00:48:29,219 --> 00:48:34,919
wow that had been released from certain

1159
00:48:31,639 --> 00:48:37,318
certain geological structures under

1160
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:39,659
water or something

1161
00:48:37,318 --> 00:48:42,420
um yeah he's

1162
00:48:39,659 --> 00:48:43,739
he got them himself I I know who La Mano

1163
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,639
Negra

1164
00:48:43,739 --> 00:48:47,399
um

1165
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:48,539
mustafung talked a bit about him yeah

1166
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:50,960
and

1167
00:48:48,539 --> 00:48:54,659
that's another whole show on itself like

1168
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:55,858
yeah yeah it was a very well admired guy

1169
00:48:54,659 --> 00:48:58,920
but

1170
00:48:55,858 --> 00:49:00,659
um I think uh I think there may it

1171
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:02,700
for people who are really anal about

1172
00:49:00,659 --> 00:49:04,379
things being either Pure or not that's

1173
00:49:02,699 --> 00:49:06,358
where some of the fuzziness comes in

1174
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:08,640
with LA mono Negra but he did do some

1175
00:49:06,358 --> 00:49:10,799
cool stuff at least a lot of cool stuff

1176
00:49:08,639 --> 00:49:13,519
yes you know this this the whole thing

1177

know sometimes you read R and it's like

1180
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:22,980

um you know that's he's he's a

1186
00:49:36,358 --> 00:49:42,598
Storyteller he really is and um you know

1187
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:45,420
he he understood the power of evoking

1188
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:47,940
this sort of exotic and you know life of

1189
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:51,838
adventure around all this stuff he was

1190
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:56,039

you know for that that about all the all

1192
00:49:56,039 --> 00:50:00,420
the adventurous stuff people were doing

1193
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:04,079
out there and he was probably taking a

1194
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:06,300
lot of exotic uh license with with the

1195
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:09,599
stories he told but

1196
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:11,400
um man I mean what a what a job he did

1197
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:13,318
you know I mean it's a great word Smith

1198
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,000
definitely

1199
00:50:13,318 --> 00:50:16,920
yeah well look at the different

1200
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,639
Generations he's inspired just sitting

1201
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:21,180
here

1202
00:50:17,639 --> 00:50:22,980
you know like I uh many years separate

1203
00:50:21,179 --> 00:50:24,719
us you know and if not so was here

1204
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:27,719
that's a whole nother generation you

1205
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:29,699
know in there and and to this day he's

1206
00:50:27,719 --> 00:50:32,699
still inspiring people

1207
00:50:29,699 --> 00:50:34,919
um I I don't know how easy he will be or

1208
00:50:32,699 --> 00:50:36,539
won't be to get a hold of I do hope that

1209
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:39,480
somehow someone shows him this episode

1210
00:50:36,539 --> 00:50:40,679
uh whether right I mean his name's out

1211
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:42,659
there

1212
00:50:40,679 --> 00:50:45,239
um you could easily find it his name's

1213
00:50:42,659 --> 00:50:46,920
Ron Rosenbaum so if anybody does know

1214
00:50:45,239 --> 00:50:48,659
him and can get in contact with the

1215
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:50,880
author Ron Rosenbaum I'd love to speak

1216
00:50:48,659 --> 00:50:53,338
to him all of us would so yeah maybe

1217
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:55,640
this is our our way to reach out to him

1218
00:50:53,338 --> 00:50:55,639
foreign

1219
00:50:57,619 --> 00:51:02,880
you know the idea of of getting him on

1220
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:04,500
the show and you know getting us to tell

1221
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,960
stories about

1222
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:09,420
what his life was like at the time and

1223
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,338
you know what it I mean because he was

1224
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:12,780
so far ahead of his time as far as

1225
00:51:11,338 --> 00:51:16,318
lifestyle

1226
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:18,059
uh you know I mean geez man half the

1227
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:20,818
people on Instagram are basically

1228
00:51:18,059 --> 00:51:23,519
telling their own stories basically like

1229
00:51:20,818 --> 00:51:26,219
he was telling the story of a generation

1230
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:27,000
of Outlaws you know yeah

1231
00:51:26,219 --> 00:51:28,059
um

1232
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,719
influencer

1233
00:51:28,059 --> 00:51:34,619
[Music]

1234
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:37,259
just you know viral marketing absolutely

1235
00:51:34,619 --> 00:51:39,240
just like you know skateboarding did in

1236
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:41,640
the 70s for

1237
00:51:39,239 --> 00:51:43,979
um you know for that sport this he was

1238
00:51:41,639 --> 00:51:47,519
kind of like this did the same thing for

1239
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:49,019
uh of any of anyone like I know Sam

1240
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:50,880
beats his drum and stuff but I think

1241
00:51:49,019 --> 00:51:52,679
this dude probably inspired quite a few

1242
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:55,500
more people than Sam did or I mean

1243
00:51:52,679 --> 00:51:57,659
honestly yeah with his position in life

1244
00:51:55,500 --> 00:52:00,179
I agree with you there yeah definitely

1245
00:51:57,659 --> 00:52:04,259
he's a Counter Culture hero and a king

1246
00:52:00,179 --> 00:52:07,078
maker and uh you know the the Scribe of

1247
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:10,680
of an era

1248
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:13,680
really was I I I'm trying to hold back

1249
00:52:10,679 --> 00:52:16,199
on you know my praise for the guy

1250
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:18,419
um but if we can get him on that would

1251
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:20,219
be the best but it wasn't honor a tree

1252
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:22,380
yeah you know I wanted to ask you

1253
00:52:20,219 --> 00:52:25,259
remember I wanted to ask you about what

1254
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:28,680
what your um conversations with Neville

1255
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:31,319
were like yeah factor in those Mr Nice

1256
00:52:28,679 --> 00:52:33,480
days I guess we don't have to do it this

1257
00:52:31,318 --> 00:52:36,719
time but I'm writing it down for the

1258
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:39,358
next one yeah with devil yeah that would

1259
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:42,000
be cool I mean just from a personal you

1260
00:52:39,358 --> 00:52:44,818
know here I am talking with you know the

1261
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:47,639
real king of cannabis no bobble head

1262
00:52:44,818 --> 00:52:49,739
yeah and you know just like he's another

1263
00:52:47,639 --> 00:52:51,779
guy you know we share this passion and

1264
00:52:49,739 --> 00:52:54,058
it's just

1265
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:55,920
I remember I remember the first time he

1266
00:52:54,059 --> 00:52:58,319
responded

1267
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:00,059
um it was on the actual forum and it was

1268
00:52:58,318 --> 00:53:02,099
just like him chiming in a little bit

1269
00:53:00,059 --> 00:53:04,140
and responding to me directly and I

1270
00:53:02,099 --> 00:53:06,420
remember that [ __ ] it's it's not so

1271
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:08,578
nerdy to say it now but I got this like

1272
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:12,300
exhilarating feeling in my chest like

1273
00:53:08,579 --> 00:53:14,039
yep I just I just spoke to the dude the

1274
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:16,500
dude responded to me you know like it

1275
00:53:14,039 --> 00:53:19,079
was that really special feeling where

1276
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:22,139
you know I and for me I had spent a lot

1277
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:24,119
of my my early career as you saw like

1278
00:53:22,139 --> 00:53:27,539
rubbing a lot of people the wrong way

1279
00:53:24,119 --> 00:53:28,800
with how I approached everything and to

1280
00:53:27,539 --> 00:53:30,179
be able to get a response from someone

1281
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,859
like that and for him to take me

1282
00:53:30,179 --> 00:53:33,960
seriously not only that take the time to

1283
00:53:31,858 --> 00:53:37,318
talk to me and then

1284
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:39,539
to to have some sort of form of respect

1285
00:53:37,318 --> 00:53:42,000
and admiration for each other and become

1286
00:53:39,539 --> 00:53:43,858
peers was probably one of the most

1287
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,858
special moments of my life at that time

1288
00:53:43,858 --> 00:53:48,358
because I didn't feel like I earned it

1289
00:53:46,858 --> 00:53:50,058
but he was still giving me that respect

1290
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:52,920
so it was special

1291
00:53:50,059 --> 00:53:55,019
he was very generous that way wasn't he

1292
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:57,180
yeah he was absolutely he never treated

1293
00:53:55,019 --> 00:53:59,219
me like oh you're just some dumb kid let

1294
00:53:57,179 --> 00:54:00,838
me tell you how it was it was never like

1295
00:53:59,219 --> 00:54:02,939
that he was wanted he wanted to know

1296
00:54:00,838 --> 00:54:04,679
more about the American scene

1297
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:07,019
um the American clones he was more

1298
00:54:04,679 --> 00:54:08,639
specifically interested in so while I

1299
00:54:07,019 --> 00:54:10,500
was asking him stuff about the old stuff

1300
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:12,420
that I was interested in and his

1301
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:15,599
experiences he was asking me more about

1302
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:17,159
Bubba Kush OG Kush what was in those

1303
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:18,359
where did they come from he was more

1304
00:54:17,159 --> 00:54:20,039
interested in chasing down the lineages

1305
00:54:18,358 --> 00:54:21,598
of stuff that he didn't know about and

1306
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:24,119
trying to trace it back to his own work

1307
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:25,680
yeah yeah because he was he was

1308
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:27,539
absolutely positive pretty much

1309
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:31,019
everything that we were coveting over

1310
00:54:27,539 --> 00:54:33,719
here by that point had had come come all

1311
00:54:31,019 --> 00:54:36,358
go gone through his hands and come back

1312
00:54:33,719 --> 00:54:38,879
here here yeah and you know worked and

1313
00:54:36,358 --> 00:54:40,980
evolved but uh I'm not sure he's

1314
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,318
terribly wrong you know like he might

1315
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:45,480
even be right still that's oh yeah the

1316
00:54:43,318 --> 00:54:47,099
most nuts about all of it yeah at the

1317
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:49,159
time I thought he was a little nuts on

1318
00:54:47,099 --> 00:54:52,740
on a lot of it but um

1319
00:54:49,159 --> 00:54:54,779
time has proven it to be more true than

1320
00:54:52,739 --> 00:54:56,459
we would have liked I guess yeah I

1321
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:57,960
thought it was a lot of arrogance to be

1322
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,579
honest with you like how how would you

1323
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:01,260
know how would you know you know but

1324
00:54:59,579 --> 00:55:04,140
over time as I talked to him I realized

1325
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:06,540
he was able to see and identify traits

1326
00:55:04,139 --> 00:55:08,400
long before he could smell the bud just

1327
00:55:06,539 --> 00:55:09,659
by sight and that was something I had

1328
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,579
never seen before someone who could

1329
00:55:09,659 --> 00:55:14,818
identify traits and lines just through

1330
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:16,680
sight that's a special special talent a

1331
00:55:14,818 --> 00:55:18,358
lot of people think they can do it but

1332
00:55:16,679 --> 00:55:20,279
not a lot of people can do it with many

1333
00:55:18,358 --> 00:55:21,838
many strains you'd be lucky if you can

1334
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:24,180
do that with one strain in your life you

1335
00:55:21,838 --> 00:55:26,699
know yeah you know for me it kind of

1336
00:55:24,179 --> 00:55:28,618
made me a little sad because

1337
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:31,618
um you know the realization that so much

1338
00:55:28,619 --> 00:55:33,240
of what's around is directly related to

1339
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:36,059
his work

1340
00:55:33,239 --> 00:55:38,519
um it makes me sad for all the thousands

1341
00:55:36,059 --> 00:55:40,500
of air wounds that got worked in the

1342
00:55:38,519 --> 00:55:42,659
hills and and the seeds never made it

1343
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:45,838
out to Neville

1344
00:55:42,659 --> 00:55:47,818
um you know the diversity the I mean

1345
00:55:45,838 --> 00:55:50,880
just staggering you know and for the

1346
00:55:47,818 --> 00:55:53,579
longest time it I it confused the hell

1347
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:56,760
out of me that people seem so obsessed

1348
00:55:53,579 --> 00:55:59,460
with well okay if that's that then it

1349
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:02,520
must be this plus this plus this as if

1350
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:05,460
you know they were in the you know

1351
00:56:02,519 --> 00:56:08,159
individual plants like skunk one was was

1352
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:10,440
a cutting yeah and when everybody used

1353
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:12,779
it they all used the same thing you know

1354
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:14,639
yeah and Northern Lights was a cutting

1355
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:17,460
and everybody when they used that it was

1356
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:20,400
always the same thing yeah um you know

1357
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:25,619
but but damn man there's just been so

1358
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:27,480
much so much reuse and and renaming and

1359
00:56:25,619 --> 00:56:29,700
um inbreeding on inbreeding on

1360
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:32,039
inbreeding and it just it just seems

1361
00:56:29,699 --> 00:56:34,379
like so much of what we have to work

1362
00:56:32,039 --> 00:56:37,079
with today came straight through

1363
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:39,660
Neville's hands at one point

1364
00:56:37,079 --> 00:56:42,480
um I think I think I think with the

1365
00:56:39,659 --> 00:56:45,058
Resurgence of uh legalization

1366
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:47,579
especially in areas like Mendocino and

1367
00:56:45,059 --> 00:56:49,140
Humboldt I'm hoping anyways and I've

1368
00:56:47,579 --> 00:56:50,700
seen some examples of this brief

1369
00:56:49,139 --> 00:56:52,259
examples

1370
00:56:50,699 --> 00:56:54,598
um that some of these lines that didn't

1371
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:57,420
necessarily make it to Neville but

1372
00:56:54,599 --> 00:56:59,280
stayed in certain areas of Humboldt

1373
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:01,079
Mendocino and were kept worked by these

1374
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:03,720
guys who just wanted nothing to do with

1375
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:05,339
being in public yeah some of those do

1376
00:57:03,719 --> 00:57:06,419
still exist and are being passed to

1377
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:09,719
their

1378
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:11,940
Protege you know is there is there uh

1379
00:57:09,719 --> 00:57:13,858
going to their next destination in

1380
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:15,300
spiritual journey you know before that

1381
00:57:13,858 --> 00:57:17,219
some of them have passed it to the

1382
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:19,019
Protege I know

1383
00:57:17,219 --> 00:57:21,058
um I know Tom Hills

1384
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:23,460
um would you would consider probably a

1385
00:57:21,059 --> 00:57:24,720
mentor type as as recently um talking

1386
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:26,338
about giving him a bunch of the stuff

1387
00:57:24,719 --> 00:57:28,558
you know stuff that was used to make

1388
00:57:26,338 --> 00:57:30,299
like ptk you know a lot of those lines

1389
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:32,880
so that's going to be interesting you

1390
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:33,660
know so there are little

1391
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:36,480
um

1392
00:57:33,659 --> 00:57:38,699
little sections little treasure chests

1393
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:40,318
out there but I think it's way far fewer

1394
00:57:38,699 --> 00:57:42,779
between than we could ever want or

1395
00:57:40,318 --> 00:57:45,058
anticipate unfortunately and it seems

1396
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:47,280
like over time Neville really was the

1397
00:57:45,059 --> 00:57:48,599
Time Capsule to save a lot of this stuff

1398
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:51,660
because it's the only way we still have

1399
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:53,338
a lot of it yeah and look if it does

1400
00:57:51,659 --> 00:57:55,920
become available it's going to be

1401
00:57:53,338 --> 00:57:59,279
crossed with cookies and OG and Kim and

1402
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:00,780
instantly you know I mean it's I don't

1403
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:03,960
know I just um

1404
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:05,579
I I sometimes I get depressed when I

1405
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:07,199
think about what's been lost but then I

1406
00:58:05,579 --> 00:58:10,619
look around and see what we've got right

1407
00:58:07,199 --> 00:58:12,299
now it's it's pretty fantastic and

1408
00:58:10,619 --> 00:58:14,039
um you know the idea that there could be

1409
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:15,720
some of those Treasures out there like

1410
00:58:14,039 --> 00:58:17,759
what you're talking about uh just just

1411
00:58:15,719 --> 00:58:20,399
waiting to pop up again I I hope you're

1412
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:21,300
right I'm just trying to stay optimistic

1413
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,358
and

1414
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:26,519
you know maybe maybe it'll happen in my

1415
00:58:24,358 --> 00:58:28,558
lifetime I've been waiting very

1416
00:58:26,519 --> 00:58:31,259
impossible some of this stuff to happen

1417
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:33,000
so it's very possible I mean we got

1418
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:36,359
Treasures like you and Mad Jack popping

1419
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:39,960
up so anything's possible guy anything's

1420
00:58:36,358 --> 00:58:42,900
possible that's the way I look at it

1421
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:46,019
with a with a mustache like mad Jags for

1422
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:49,019
sure exactly

1423
00:58:46,019 --> 00:58:49,019
exactly

1424
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:55,200
pretty much go anywhere with a mustache

1425
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:56,760
like that it opens every door yeah

1426
00:58:55,199 --> 00:59:00,078
so do you guys want to get anything in

1427
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:00,079
before we uh sign off

1428
00:59:01,019 --> 00:59:06,000
um how did not so dog get his handle not

1429
00:59:04,318 --> 00:59:08,219
so dog

1430
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,400
um so he was going and meeting up with a

1431
00:59:08,219 --> 00:59:12,719
friend to buy some chem dogweed and his

1432
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:15,119
friend was showing him some of the bud

1433
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:16,919
and he looked at it and goes this is not

1434
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:19,079
so dog bro because they used to refer to

1435
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:21,180
him dog as dog he's like this is not so

1436
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:23,160
dog and they just kind of stuck with him

1437
00:59:21,179 --> 00:59:25,199
after that and it was a Kim dog it was

1438
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:26,818
something else

1439
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:29,939
so that's how he actually got his thing

1440
00:59:26,818 --> 00:59:32,219
and oddly enough it was at a uh really

1441
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:33,900
well-known rest stop so yeah that's a

1442
00:59:32,219 --> 00:59:35,279
hidden part of the story rest stop the

1443
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:37,858
action if not so

1444
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:39,859
oh my God now I'm pretty sure that's the

1445
00:59:37,858 --> 00:59:42,420
