welcome to breeder Syndicate 2.0 where

2
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:09,839
we explore the history of a clandestine

3
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:12,059
scene researching everything from

4
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:13,859
Cannabis string history old smuggling

5
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:16,019
Tales from the first person perspective

6
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:17,519
to breeding science and news on current

7
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:19,379
subculture

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,939
I'm your host Matthew and I'll

9
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:23,099
occasionally be joined by my homie not

10
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,198
so dog breeder and grower from Mendocino

11
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,660
to speak on these subjects and sometimes

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,400
interview other participants our goal is

13
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,140
to document this history before it's

14
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:32,399
written by corporations and others who

15
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,219
just weren't there

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,299
let's start writing some wrongs welcome

17
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:38,300
to the underground

18
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,760
all right one of the first things I

19
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,480
think since since we have you here

20
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:50,099
Shawnee like you know one of the things

21
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,259
that we're often talking about like

22
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,700
we're in Discord and stuff is hype

23
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:54,479
strains

24
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,820
um

25
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,979
people admiration different things

26
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,198
people experience as like as they're

27
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:03,358
just getting back into buying seeds and

28
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:06,060
and getting into the scene or in your

29
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,799
case getting back into it from um you

30
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,159
know being into it real heavy at one

31
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,900
point and one of the biggest things that

32
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,880
people come to you with is why you hate

33
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,520
root beer so much what's your problem

34
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:20,219
with Gene what what is this root beer

35
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,780
hate you have and you know I I've always

36
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:23,519
seen it from your angle but I would like

37
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,019
you to explain it from your angle for

38
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:26,938
everyone to hear because because when I

39
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:28,200
hear it I don't hear what they're

40
00:01:26,938 --> 00:01:30,899
hearing

41
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,460
yeah well I I don't hear what they're he

42
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,799
I I can kind of

43
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:35,759
uh imagine what they're hearing but I

44
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,100
don't know what they're hearing either

45
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,379
but it's something kind of went like

46
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:41,759
viral in our server and it just kind of

47
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:43,920
blew up and

48
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,099
I think because there was a lot of uh

49
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,340
arguments around it as well yeah but

50
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:49,339
like

51
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,560
so yeah so like

52
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:57,898
I entered the I the the computer world

53
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,460
with IG and all this stuff and like you

54
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,140
don't know when you don't know people

55
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:03,118
you don't know all these like Brands and

56
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,799
you don't know all this stuff you really

57
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:08,038
don't have any idea what you're looking

58
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,080
at but like I I started to like well

59
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:12,839
hanging out with you guys it's like

60
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,700
question when I'm buying trying to

61
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,280
understand on a deeper level all this

62
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:19,199
sort of stuff so like when there's

63
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,180
certain things that are like super super

64
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:23,219
big and I'm like why are they big why

65
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,560
why is this like why does everybody want

66
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:27,719
this but when I ask those questions to

67
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,000
other people it's like I don't get an

68
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:32,699
answer either yeah

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,080
um and root beer was like the one I

70
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:36,719
don't know why that was the one that

71
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,219
stuck but like everybody wanted root

72
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,800
beer but I don't I didn't really

73
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:42,359
understand why and I don't think anybody

74
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,459
else really did either

75
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,459
I mean I think it was because like it

76
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:49,439
was just how you asked but why root beer

77
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,000
and I think someone took that as an

78
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:52,919
offense like it was so offensive that

79
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,360
you would even ask well but why what do

80
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:56,039
you mean why there's 30 of us talking

81
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,800
about how much we want it what do you

82
00:02:56,039 --> 00:03:00,000
mean why yeah and Gene's cool and all

83
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,920
this stuff and like everything's

84
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,199
verified and it's like you know what's

85
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,839
the problem but I mean

86
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:09,060
it's nobody really experienced it like

87
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,180
very few people ever experienced it and

88
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,598
nobody really has any idea it isn't

89
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,980
really proven on any level that we know

90
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:19,079
but it just kind of like blew up because

91
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:22,259
of the memes right and all the joking

92
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:25,319
and and I like there was that podcast

93
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:27,479
episode where Gene was talking about it

94
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:29,518
and he he seemed really open about it

95
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:31,679
and he that he didn't want to release it

96
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,658
because he didn't think it would live up

97
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,000
to the expectation that had already

98
00:03:33,658 --> 00:03:38,098
built up sure and that you know he

99
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,158
mentioned like her M issues if people

100
00:03:38,098 --> 00:03:44,158
were running it indoor and all kinds of

101
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:46,620
stuff and people still wanted it like

102
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:49,259
crazy you know it's like I don't think

103
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,360
people even listen to him in that

104
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:52,798
section because what I heard was you

105
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,319
know maybe it's not as good as everyone

106
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,760
thinks right yeah sure I think he was

107
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:59,219
just being realistic yeah giving people

108
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:01,139
realistic expectations and um and that's

109
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:02,280
fair I mean like I like I've tried to

110
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:04,139
tell people when they were arguing with

111
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,060
you I don't think it is even necessarily

112
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:08,279
about root beer and it certainly isn't

113
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,658
about just Gene you know like don't even

114
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,239
have a problem with Jean it means a nice

115
00:04:09,658 --> 00:04:15,719
dude but it's more about

116
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:18,540
the idea of why why is there height

117
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:19,858
behind this and and why are we feeling

118
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,600
that it's like sheep what's it what's

119
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:23,519
what's the cult the phenomenon of it

120
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,800
right yeah it's a phenomenon

121
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:28,978
because it just like it's this hive mind

122
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,439
mentality where you know certain things

123
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:33,120
get mentioned enough that everyone's

124
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:37,079
like damn I want to try that you know

125
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:39,780
but like what I want more people to be

126
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:42,599
doing is is to like understand what they

127
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:45,478
like what they what they want and if

128
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,100
it's something that they want you know

129
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:50,099
um

130
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:53,460
like I I haven't run any of Gene's stuff

131
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:57,240
but mainly because he from my

132
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:59,819
understanding he breeds outdoors in a

133
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,860
region that is far from me and I grow

134
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:04,860
indoors and it doesn't it doesn't make

135
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,000
sense for me to run his seed sure I like

136
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,400
I don't know I kind of like there's

137
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,319
other things I would rather do not not

138
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,599
because of anything against him or

139
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:15,360
anything like that but like

140
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,820
I've sort of ruled certain certain

141
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,560
things out due to things like I just

142
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:21,839
mentioned right like it's outdoor seed

143
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,600
yeah I mean I think that's something I

144
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:26,579
wish I not even just you or has and

145
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,759
again not even in relation to Gene

146
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:32,038
anyone should be taking that into into

147
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,500
what they're doing like okay I'm growing

148
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:36,959
indoor I need to have seeds and bread

149
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,399
indoor are these breeders breeding my

150
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:39,418
seeds indoor because if they're bringing

151
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:41,159
them outdoor and you're trying to bring

152
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:43,500
them indoor a lot of stuff that does

153
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,539
really well outdoor will have intersex

154
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,279
traits indoor it's common it's very

155
00:05:45,538 --> 00:05:48,719
common so that's something people should

156
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:51,239
be asking but I don't even think anybody

157
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,320
even asks that like I don't you think

158
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,879
that was that's not even a part of the

159
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,599
equation when people think about buying

160
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:59,519
seeds like oh it's a breeders

161
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,820
it often isn't and like that like from

162
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:04,258
my experience like the average person

163
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:06,240
they're really looking at all the wrong

164
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:08,340
things usually you know they're looking

165
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,379
at like a name that sticks out that

166
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:13,319
either they have attachment to or what

167
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:15,360
whatever the reason or a certain like

168
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:16,879
term profile that it's supposed to be

169
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,160
promising you

170
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:22,500
or you know like very surface level

171
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,220
things yeah

172
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,139
um

173
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,240
and I find it interesting actually too

174
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:29,038
like in our server watching a lot of

175
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,918
people pop some things

176
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:33,719
that you know are probably going to be

177
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:36,599
like a high potency and then they're

178
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,160
like whoa this is a little much you know

179
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,319
like

180
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,699
maybe they got hit with that for the

181
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,979
first time and they're just like yeah

182
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:45,600
it's it's definitely potent but it might

183
00:06:43,978 --> 00:06:49,019
not be what I want to smoke every day

184
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,120
you know exactly yeah so like I think

185
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:53,339
that's really great growth for for

186
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,620
people and I like I love that's what I

187
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:57,000
love about popping seed and trying new

188
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,918
things is like

189
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,899
you know it's all about what you like

190
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:03,538
and experiencing that and then trying to

191
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:05,339
search for the things that you know do

192
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:07,620
it for you yeah

193
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:10,560
that's perfect welcome pack

194
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,959
okay guys laptop pack and we also have

195
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,300
local botanist here with us so we kind

196
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:17,459
of just Joy jumped into the conversation

197
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,280
um it's we're recording it a little late

198
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:22,258
on Friday and uh we're just gonna have a

199
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:23,698
small round table talk about some

200
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:25,439
different things

201
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:27,240
um and of course we're going to talk a

202
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,160
little bit and and that kind of leads

203
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,660
into a little bit of what I was going to

204
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:35,520
get into about like putting people on

205
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:38,280
pedestals like yeah I think that is a

206
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:40,379
another factor I mean we see it and it

207
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:42,119
happens here you know like just being

208
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:45,360
totally transparent I see it happen here

209
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,280
with me with not so we try to keep it as

210
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,639
as real as possible and remind people

211
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:52,978
we're just [ __ ] like low rent Farmers

212
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,720
like I I grow a few types of plants but

213
00:07:52,978 --> 00:07:56,939
I'm I'm not even

214
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,979
capable of being called a real farmer

215
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:00,180
let alone needing a pedestal you know

216
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,098
and other people don't necessarily

217
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,780
deserve that either but

218
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:05,879
um in the world of marketing and hype

219
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:07,679
you know dudes flashing Rolexes or fake

220
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:09,959
Rolexes that doesn't matter if it flips

221
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,879
by real fast you know uh pedestals

222
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:14,818
happen a lot and

223
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:16,560
and one thing I've noticed is what

224
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:18,960
happens when people have their their

225
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,459
Paradigm shifted on a breeder like let's

226
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:21,899
say that this is their hero breeder and

227
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:24,478
they find out something very devastating

228
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:25,978
it almost it almost breaks people

229
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,139
sometimes

230
00:08:25,978 --> 00:08:33,198
you guys have seen it like people flip

231
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:33,198
the [ __ ] out sometimes yeah they do yeah

232
00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:39,658
um it's kind of

233
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:43,080
it's really weird with like grown adult

234
00:08:39,658 --> 00:08:44,639
men you know yeah it is that they're so

235
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,339
passionate

236
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:49,259
to that level it's like I'm not a sports

237
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:52,260
fan but I also get that Vibe when people

238
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:53,879
are like super into like sports dudes

239
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:56,399
yeah yeah I know it's like you're a

240
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:59,220
grown-up you know it's

241
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,740
a dream man yeah

242
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:04,139
it's a trip uh uh the the

243
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,899
um attachment people get to other grown

244
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:08,278
men like that yeah and admiration that

245
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:10,019
they hold and I get I get it like

246
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:12,659
because I had that like it's it's not

247
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:14,580
like something I don't understand when I

248
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:17,519
got in the scene like I I remember

249
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,899
looking up to um Adam Dunn like he was

250
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,620
one of the Americans that went over

251
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:24,299
there to Amsterdam you know and like

252
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,919
I've done Aaron we're over there too but

253
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:27,599
they were kind of like Hollywood knobs

254
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:30,360
so I didn't have I didn't like have any

255
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,220
kind of anything Vibe with them you know

256
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,839
but Adam seemed to be smart like he

257
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,360
would talk about his strains and

258
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,880
sourcing these these uh old California

259
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,159
and and American Colonial strain so I

260
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,838
was real into him and then over time

261
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:44,458
when you get to meet people and have

262
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:45,899
relationships with them and they become

263
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,759
much more human

264
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:49,019
you realize how much you did have them

265
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:50,939
on a pedestal at a time when people

266
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:52,679
because and very often you're

267
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,080
disappointed and sometimes you're not

268
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:56,819
sometimes people are as special as you

269
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,680
kind of always hoped they would be but

270
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,200
that's a that's a rare occurrence local

271
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:02,519
when you first got into seeds what were

272
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,899
some of the dudes that you were hearing

273
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:06,539
about that

274
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:08,278
um maybe maybe you got you excited at

275
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:10,620
first and later you you found like maybe

276
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:13,559
maybe I'm not so into it

277
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,459
yeah um so seats were really weird for

278
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:17,579
me

279
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:20,099
um you know like I bought like from

280
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,139
Nirvana here and there like

281
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:25,019
um Dutch Passion was another one but

282
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:29,159
like this was already like you know like

283
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:31,259
I don't know 2015 2016 so it's like

284
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:34,919
by then it's like nobody was really

285
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:37,200
looking into that yeah um and then I had

286
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:38,939
a friend who was generous enough just to

287
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,740
give me like a bunch of different seeds

288
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,459
you know

289
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,459
um

290
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:46,679
I think one of them was like uh

291
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:49,739
something called Blackberry cheesecake

292
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:51,778
uh like a heavy duty fruity cross you

293
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,940
know things like that

294
00:10:51,778 --> 00:10:55,679
um I grew them and you know for the time

295
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,779
for me I thought they were good because

296
00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:00,359
like they smelled different like it

297
00:10:57,778 --> 00:11:02,220
wasn't just like a cheap ass bag on the

298
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,459
street you know yeah

299
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:07,980
um and then you know after that I I kind

300
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:11,338
of just started like thinking about

301
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:13,680
um you know like how do people claim

302
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:15,420
that they are making these crosses that

303
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:17,159
you know like for example like blue

304
00:11:15,419 --> 00:11:20,519
dream you have 20 different [ __ ] blue

305
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:22,980
Dreams yeah and like you know a little

306
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:24,959
bit about me like my background is in

307
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,700
like genetics and botany and all that

308
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:29,099
and

309
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,480
um you know more so population genetics

310
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:33,300
and it's when you're going to college

311
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,700
for this your University yeah I went

312
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:36,778
yeah I got my degree uh two years ago

313
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:40,140
and that

314
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:41,759
um and so you know like instinctually I

315
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:44,578
kind of just thought okay like these

316
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:46,740
people say they have like you know this

317
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:50,039
blue dream or whatever

318
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:51,419
um it's like you know what's to say that

319
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:53,039
they're all gonna be the same you know

320
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:55,259
you have different pollen donors you

321
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:57,439
have different like you know uh pollen

322
00:11:55,259 --> 00:12:00,179
receivers and all that so it's like

323
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,980
who's to see what's what and I I think

324
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:04,379
that's kind of like what struck like the

325
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:07,259
whole like provenance type of like you

326
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:10,259
know understanding it like knowing that

327
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:13,620
like not anyone is just gonna give you

328
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:15,958
what they say it is you know because it

329
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:17,820
the sad truth of it is is like it's a

330
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:19,439
it's a sketchy scene you know there are

331
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:23,399
sketchy people

332
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,440
um but yeah and you know as a little

333
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:27,659
time went on like I began to get a

334
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,279
little interested in history and that's

335
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:31,019
kind of like when I stumbled upon this

336
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:32,759
podcast yeah

337
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:35,039
um I listened to the first episode and

338
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:38,338
like I believe you gave crybaby a shout

339
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:40,078
out yeah um that's right like just a

340
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:43,920
little after that I joined breeder

341
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:45,239
Syndicate and like yeah I mean it kind

342
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:48,719
of went from there

343
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,720
um right

344
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,360
um luckily I was like

345
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:56,220
um

346
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,740
adopted into like a good Community

347
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:00,959
relatively early on

348
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,759
um so like I didn't have to go through

349
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:04,619
like any [ __ ] or anything or like

350
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:07,100
get my [ __ ] hopes and dreams Crush

351
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:11,339
like some of these other people do and

352
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:13,440
yeah at the end of it like

353
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:16,860
I mean you see these dogs they're almost

354
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,800
in the days when they hear about like

355
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:22,440
Our Heroes being Tweakers snitches and

356
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:25,078
stuff yeah and yeah the crazy thing is

357
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,579
it's like it's you know we're all humans

358
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:29,578
and it's like I feel like we should all

359
00:13:26,578 --> 00:13:31,379
be true to ourselves and it's like you

360
00:13:29,578 --> 00:13:33,778
know by claiming all these things you're

361
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:36,240
like lying to yourself and and what good

362
00:13:33,778 --> 00:13:39,539
is that you know a lot of delusion yeah

363
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,639
exactly and it's kind of sad I guess but

364
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:44,278
I mean that's cool what's cool about the

365
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:46,680
server here is like like I remember when

366
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:49,620
I I was early on in there but like

367
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:52,138
everybody has bought [ __ ] you know

368
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,879
everybody's been taken and like it's not

369
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:55,860
like there's people in there that are

370
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:57,419
very experienced that are like never had

371
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:00,060
that happen everyone's had that hell

372
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:01,979
yeah you know and that's where it's like

373
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:03,899
some people take it super personally

374
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:05,879
some people are super invested

375
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:09,120
financially and emotionally

376
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:11,220
but I mean when the when open

377
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,679
conversations happen and it's like look

378
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:16,440
like this is kind of what we know

379
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:20,338
and it's not the greatest thing to hear

380
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:22,200
like I mean it's I don't understand when

381
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:24,300
people just don't want to hear it they

382
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,639
don't want to accept it or they're they

383
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:28,679
start fights over it or

384
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,860
you know

385
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:34,138
I I was not like that I'm just like holy

386
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:36,659
[ __ ] really tell me more you know yeah

387
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:39,180
like I don't like being wrong so help me

388
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:40,919
be right like that's get me there well

389
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:42,719
understanding is the most important part

390
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:44,399
right it's not about who good and who's

391
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,740
bad and who's this and who you know it's

392
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,839
just understanding situations and like

393
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:52,079
you said humanizing people like

394
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:53,279
like nobody's perfect you know there's

395
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:55,078
in the person in the world that's

396
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:57,958
perfect there's another person in the

397
00:14:55,078 --> 00:15:01,799
world that hasn't done a stupid thing or

398
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:03,958
misstep or whatever but like

399
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:06,059
people that are actively like learning

400
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:07,559
and trying to move forward it's like

401
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:09,719
they're moving forward you know yeah

402
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:11,698
always

403
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,680
yeah you know one of the biggest

404
00:15:11,698 --> 00:15:15,299
problems that I found since local you're

405
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:18,120
like a

406
00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:21,359
um a university type dude was like I'm

407
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:24,179
still having trouble communicating with

408
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,639
University people on on the level of

409
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:28,679
like their geneticists their botanists

410
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,320
they understand breeding it in these

411
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:33,958
deep levels but trying to communicate to

412
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:36,420
them the history of cannabis

413
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:39,539
how we came to to the conclusions that

414
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:41,399
we have why we're there and why it

415
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:43,198
matters to what they're doing and why

416
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:45,000
they need to know this stuff before they

417
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:46,620
start like doing these tests on these

418
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,299
strains and comparing The Strain To The

419
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,399
Strain and why they need to know all

420
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:52,979
this stuff like how do we how do you

421
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,078
tell people that are obviously much more

422
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,940
educated and smart you know in their own

423
00:15:55,078 --> 00:15:58,979
mind than we are

424
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:01,320
um how do you how do you explain that to

425
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:03,300
them what would you do from Europe

426
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:07,199
it's kind of a hard question but I mean

427
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:09,719
yeah it is a complex question I mean you

428
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:12,000
know I I after all like I just got my

429
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,920
undergrad like I'm not a PhD or like

430
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,778
Masters by like any means but like

431
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:16,799
there's definitely intentions for that

432
00:16:15,778 --> 00:16:19,620
yeah

433
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:22,500
um but like I don't know I I think it's

434
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:25,620
really hard for them to kind of accept

435
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,000
us somewhat and maybe it's because you

436
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:29,220
know we're just a bunch of Deeds that

437
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,019
like smoke weed and nerd out about you

438
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,540
know [ __ ] that doesn't really matter to

439
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:35,339
the world even though it does yeah

440
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:37,198
um and that's like one thing I kind of

441
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:39,240
joked about like with people like when

442
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:41,099
they ask like oh hey what do you do as a

443
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,259
botanist and I was like oh yeah like I

444
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,600
study this you know it you know it

445
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:47,278
doesn't matter in the grand scheme of

446
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,800
things but to me it's really interesting

447
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:51,240
so yeah I'm gonna say [ __ ] in and do it

448
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:53,578
you know

449
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,440
um but I think like one way to maybe get

450
00:16:53,578 --> 00:16:57,778
like attention of some scientists is

451
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,779
maybe trying to like integrate some of

452
00:16:57,778 --> 00:17:03,419
like maybe the hypotheses that like we

453
00:17:00,778 --> 00:17:05,880
have maybe a about certain families of

454
00:17:03,419 --> 00:17:09,058
plants you know or groups of plants you

455
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:11,339
know like how can we integrate this into

456
00:17:09,058 --> 00:17:13,798
like how they're study like what they're

457
00:17:11,338 --> 00:17:15,779
studying so like for example the

458
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:17,160
professor that I was studying under at

459
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:19,259
my school

460
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,298
um she was interested in plant breeding

461
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:25,500
systems so like you know how like wheat

462
00:17:21,298 --> 00:17:26,879
is is a [ __ ] dialysis right you know

463
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:30,000
you have your your male and your female

464
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,880
plants well you know she was studying

465
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,099
plants that were uh gyno-dialicious

466
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,960
which are female and like you know

467
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:39,418
hermaphroditic plants even their true

468
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,460
males so it's like you know I think

469
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:44,100
there are ways to kind of integrate like

470
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,240
studies between like the two topics so

471
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:49,139
it's like I think it's more about

472
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:52,019
relating it to their topic of study than

473
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:54,299
you know trying to achieve this goal of

474
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:56,700
you know maybe just sequencing DNA or

475
00:17:54,298 --> 00:17:57,839
whatever just to see it's related to me

476
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,819
like it's like

477
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:01,619
I look at them at what they're doing and

478
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:03,960
I'm like how can you even waste your

479
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:05,579
time sequencing the DNA of this blue

480
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:09,538
dream cut that you went and Source from

481
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:11,099
a collective that you say 95 of the cuts

482
00:18:09,538 --> 00:18:12,720
are similar to this one but it's

483
00:18:11,099 --> 00:18:14,339
probably not even [ __ ] blue dream why

484
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,019
are you wasting your time because that's

485
00:18:14,339 --> 00:18:17,459
not even having anything to do that

486
00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:19,200
everybody in history is talking about

487
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:23,058
and that you're going to be comparing

488
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,058
this data to you know

489
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:29,639
we have to also consider that we need to

490
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,200
have information on what the parents

491
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,000
actually were it's not like you can just

492
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,860
take what what was it like a [ __ ]

493
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,960
Super Silver Haze and a blueberry like

494
00:18:34,859 --> 00:18:41,339
you can't do sequences too separately

495
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:43,440
and expect it exactly to be related to

496
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:44,659
the blue dream that they sequence so

497
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,679
it's

498
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:48,419
obviously they're there they don't even

499
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:49,919
understand that part like they don't

500
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:51,840
yeah I know for sure and it seems to me

501
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,980
it's so scientifically obvious like if

502
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,298
you're gonna start at a place you're

503
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,980
going to [ __ ] crawl back up to the

504
00:18:54,298 --> 00:18:57,900
parent line maybe you should figure this

505
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:00,779
[ __ ] up out along the way but like their

506
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:02,400
their ideas were like basically we don't

507
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:04,678
think or what

508
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,360
the most common sentiment I'm getting

509
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:08,220
from them I shouldn't say all of them

510
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:11,579
the most common sentiment I've gotten

511
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:14,960
from multiple people in that field is

512
00:19:11,579 --> 00:19:14,960
how do you know you're right

513
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:20,460
that so that's that's I guess the beauty

514
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:21,899
of science you know like yeah and that's

515
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,759
what I've been trying to work on like

516
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:26,880
interpreting like or not interpreting

517
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:29,700
using the Bayes theorem to bring in to

518
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,100
to actually working that into how we

519
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,440
approach history and how we prove past

520
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:37,079
historical events

521
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,519
um within reason and within science and

522
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:41,819
I think like that's something that I've

523
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:42,538
been looking at as it's used in other

524
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:44,579
um

525
00:19:42,538 --> 00:19:45,960
like in ancient religions and stuff to

526
00:19:44,579 --> 00:19:47,819
prove what happened in ancient religions

527
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,038
even though all we have is texts you

528
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:52,200
know yeah and that's really the key

529
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:53,819
honestly like you know people who

530
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,620
witness certain events you know like

531
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:57,960
primary sources and all that you know

532
00:19:55,619 --> 00:19:59,579
like uh primary sources are I mean

533
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,679
sometimes going to be some of the most

534
00:19:59,579 --> 00:20:03,960
valuable sources but you know obviously

535
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,000
those may be biased defending yeah for

536
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,919
sure you know as you've seen dude like

537
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,960
we've seen firsthand like the best

538
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:13,020
primary sources and then it gets kind of

539
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,558
scary yeah I know yeah yeah yeah

540
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:16,259
um

541
00:20:13,558 --> 00:20:17,579
but yeah like I mean I I feel I feel

542
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:19,140
awesome knowing that there's actually

543
00:20:17,579 --> 00:20:21,359
like this theorem that people have

544
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:24,299
figured out that helps prove history

545
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:26,819
when it's based on written evidence in

546
00:20:24,298 --> 00:20:29,819
the past it's pretty cool

547
00:20:26,819 --> 00:20:31,439
for reference it was Dr Richard carrier

548
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:33,359
in

549
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,880
um one second I want to make sure I give

550
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:39,839
him credit for this because it is a

551
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:42,780
pretty uh uh it was proving the history

552
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:44,639
and on the proving history

553
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:46,740
yeah I think that's what it is Richard

554
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,559
carrier proving history

555
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:51,599
yeah and the Science World is like the

556
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:53,460
type of world that like if it's not on

557
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:55,199
paper it's

558
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,360
you know exactly probably not going to

559
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,400
be real so you know that's another thing

560
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:03,298
to take into consideration you know what

561
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:05,820
my mind why do these tests if none of

562
00:21:03,298 --> 00:21:08,099
that matters why even do the tests like

563
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:10,139
it's you know it at that point it's

564
00:21:08,099 --> 00:21:11,819
[ __ ] with ethics and it's like if

565
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:14,280
this is really something that they

566
00:21:11,819 --> 00:21:16,259
wanted it to per se uh integrate into

567
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:18,839
like Pharmaceuticals and stuff it's like

568
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:21,000
you're also [ __ ] with that yeah yeah

569
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:22,740
if if you want to make it medicine then

570
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,480
you need the data that people use but

571
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,798
you need to go access that data that

572
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,179
people had you need to know what they

573
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:30,359
were smoking at the time not what you

574
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:33,240
think yeah and that but it just I don't

575
00:21:30,359 --> 00:21:34,379
know it's it's been a long long drawn

576
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,880
out process trying to have these

577
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:38,580
conversations with these University

578
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:40,740
professors and phds and

579
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:44,339
and it's still gotten to me I feel like

580
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:45,659
it's gotten not very far yeah and you'd

581
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:48,480
hope things would get better with

582
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:50,280
Federal legalization but I just feel

583
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,659
like it's still gonna be rather tricky

584
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:54,960
to conduct any

585
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:57,000
kind of like uh ecological based studies

586
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,919
like I feel like it's gonna take I feel

587
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,839
like it's gonna take someone as that

588
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:03,360
just happens to get into the head of one

589
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:06,379
of these programs to end up being a

590
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:06,379
massive C nerd

591
00:22:08,298 --> 00:22:13,139
actually gain interest in history and

592
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,640
really dive in and that's like a dice

593
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,520
roll because look at how few of us there

594
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,480
are in cannabis let alone this is a tiny

595
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:20,519
community

596
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,220
it really is yeah

597
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:28,019
what's your thoughts on it pack

598
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:29,819
oh um uh you caught me off guard here we

599
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:32,038
were just talking about the the trying

600
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:35,158
to talk to the university people about

601
00:22:32,038 --> 00:22:37,679
why why they need to take

602
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:39,659
the history of strange seriously before

603
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:42,298
they start trying to [ __ ] with

604
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:45,000
sequencing and doing all that

605
00:22:42,298 --> 00:22:46,619
um sure chasing it I I just have a real

606
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,140
hard time communicating with them on it

607
00:22:46,619 --> 00:22:51,298
and if you know

608
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:53,460
I'm not sure if it's the Lost in

609
00:22:51,298 --> 00:22:55,500
Translation possibly you know not having

610
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:58,259
the the same kind of reference point to

611
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,460
be able to speak their language uh you

612
00:22:58,259 --> 00:23:01,379
know maybe it's something along those

613
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:04,620
lines but I I would imagine anybody

614
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:06,900
who's truly you know stepping up to the

615
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:08,879
plate from a scientific practitioner

616
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:12,900
level they're going to want to consider

617
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,760
you know all variables right and

618
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,860
you know

619
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:19,500
just the fact that it's been taboo to

620
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:21,658
research you know I wonder

621
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,400
you know people have kind of become my

622
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:25,140
optic or sort of conditioned into their

623
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,000
own as much as scientists are open

624
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:29,340
they're also you know kind of looking

625
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,159
along their own agenda for things and so

626
00:23:29,339 --> 00:23:34,439
how you how you kind of introduce uh

627
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,960
another lens to look there is a good

628
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,298
question some of these people even smoke

629
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,659
which is like okay so you've been

630
00:23:39,298 --> 00:23:44,879
smoking forever

631
00:23:41,659 --> 00:23:46,080
I don't know I don't know it's just one

632
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,520
of those Stone thoughts they're not

633
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:50,639
they're not smoking the right [ __ ] it's

634
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:52,259
a problem exactly so one of the things I

635
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,120
also wanted to get into was one of the

636
00:23:52,259 --> 00:23:56,700
number one questions we get asked and we

637
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:59,339
have you know we have me and pack on

638
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:02,038
here and we have Shawnee and local was

639
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:04,339
males people have questions about males

640
00:24:02,038 --> 00:24:07,019
all the time Shawnee

641
00:24:04,339 --> 00:24:08,220
load up some mail questions like that

642
00:24:07,019 --> 00:24:12,058
you think people would want to know

643
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:14,279
about local users load them up

644
00:24:12,058 --> 00:24:15,899
well like

645
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:18,779
um

646
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:20,460
like number one right like like if

647
00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:21,918
you're looking for a male and you like

648
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:25,019
to use a mail

649
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,880
the only way you know is if you grow The

650
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:29,579
Offspring and observe the females

651
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,440
correct correct yeah

652
00:24:29,579 --> 00:24:34,079
so I mean like

653
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,298
this I read this article and like me and

654
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:38,220
crybaby had a little conversation

655
00:24:36,298 --> 00:24:39,298
about it

656
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:41,339
um

657
00:24:39,298 --> 00:24:42,900
but like what the first question that

658
00:24:41,339 --> 00:24:45,720
popped into my head was like how many

659
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:47,820
how many Elite males exist today like

660
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,558
how many people are holding males that

661
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:51,658
they breed with that they've been like

662
00:24:49,558 --> 00:24:54,538
held on to for a significant amount of

663
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:57,919
time yeah and uh the answer was pretty

664
00:24:54,538 --> 00:25:00,538
low right yeah very very low

665
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:04,559
very low I don't think that there's a

666
00:25:00,538 --> 00:25:06,480
lot of um revisiting with certain males

667
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:07,859
um I think people when they do it they

668
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,319
tend to select another male from the

669
00:25:07,859 --> 00:25:11,819
seed line it's very hard to do I know

670
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:15,480
when we were keeping Mel's alive over

671
00:25:11,819 --> 00:25:18,298
the years before uh the moon situation

672
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:20,038
um it would it's just constant repotting

673
00:25:18,298 --> 00:25:22,619
making sure the pot's big enough making

674
00:25:20,038 --> 00:25:25,500
sure your mail isn't flowering uh my

675
00:25:22,619 --> 00:25:28,619
bedroom is constantly 24 7. like just 24

676
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:30,538
on there's never any kind of darkness in

677
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:32,399
my bedroom because of males constantly

678
00:25:30,538 --> 00:25:33,658
trying to keep males around second they

679
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,220
hit the bottom of the pot they'd always

680
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:36,840
start flowering in there and if it's in

681
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,400
the same location as a female room that

682
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:39,599
could be a serious problem like if

683
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,700
you're trying to take meals alive while

684
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:43,798
also making seeds of something else with

685
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:46,140
another meal that's not really that good

686
00:25:43,798 --> 00:25:48,658
it's not it's not beneficial so you

687
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:50,100
always have to learn on the fly over

688
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:53,400
time when it comes to stuff like that

689
00:25:50,099 --> 00:25:55,199
using special events really isolating

690
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,480
um still not advised to keep them in the

691
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,220
same room but yeah it's why you don't

692
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:03,058
see it very often there's like the haze

693
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:05,400
Haze AC mil that were real famous

694
00:26:03,058 --> 00:26:06,658
um we kept the blue bonnet one alive for

695
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,538
a long time and it was over at Radio

696
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:11,640
Ridge until we got hplv and now it's no

697
00:26:09,538 --> 00:26:13,140
longer with us it was a bummer but we

698
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,580
tried we tried to keep it alive to pass

699
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:16,799
out for other people to do blueberry

700
00:26:14,579 --> 00:26:19,139
work that was the intent yeah it's not

701
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:21,058
that common and um I think the first

702
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:23,038
question I get the most is

703
00:26:21,058 --> 00:26:26,460
what do you look for When selecting a

704
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:28,379
male uh the number one

705
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:31,259
well like

706
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:32,760
great they're pretty much all myths

707
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:35,640
though right or not myths but like

708
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:39,658
they're not all like 100 confirmed sort

709
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:40,860
of I mean it just like if you okay like

710
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:44,880
back in the day I remember when I

711
00:26:40,859 --> 00:26:45,899
started I was told by by the Hunts

712
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,480
breath guy

713
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,740
if you want to find a male you want to

714
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,778
look for the one that looks most like

715
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:53,640
the female and grows most like a female

716
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:55,380
and the one you think is least like a

717
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,600
male in the end

718
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,919
like it looks like a female and at the

719
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:00,178
very last minute you realize oh it's a

720
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:02,820
male and that's a one so for a long time

721
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:04,380
I just did that you know and then as I

722
00:27:02,819 --> 00:27:06,599
as I started going I was like I'm not

723
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:08,039
really getting anything anywhere by

724
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:10,079
doing that like it's not doing anything

725
00:27:08,038 --> 00:27:11,278
special for me like I I didn't know if I

726
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:12,899
was trying to just make sure there was

727
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:13,919
no Herms at the beginning is that what

728
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,059
I'm trying to do because that seems to

729
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,759
be what people complain about the most

730
00:27:15,058 --> 00:27:19,558
you just don't want herbs you know yeah

731
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:21,119
and as you're doing this stuff you're

732
00:27:19,558 --> 00:27:22,440
seeing different traits pop out right

733
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:24,359
and then you see certain things from

734
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,038
from the mail land certain Leaf shapes

735
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:28,439
certain certain serrations like oh wait

736
00:27:26,038 --> 00:27:31,740
that's a trade I can identify you know

737
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:34,980
and slowly you kind of realize

738
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:37,500
there's not just one male one trait one

739
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:39,659
one it's like trying to constantly fit a

740
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:41,519
square peg in a circle you know like if

741
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:43,140
you if you're looking for the same trait

742
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:45,538
in every male you're trying to fit a

743
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:47,220
square peg in a circle like if when it

744
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:48,900
came to the blue bonnet stuff it was

745
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,579
like I wanted blueberry versions of

746
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,900
everything if I want that I'm not going

747
00:27:50,579 --> 00:27:55,079
to go to a

748
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:57,298
to I don't know Apple mints or whatever

749
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:59,460
and and try to make that Mail work you

750
00:27:57,298 --> 00:28:02,460
know and just until it works it's just

751
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:04,259
not how it works so um yeah I mean when

752
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:06,778
you're selecting for a mail

753
00:28:04,259 --> 00:28:08,940
you've got to start somewhere sometimes

754
00:28:06,778 --> 00:28:10,679
it's as easy as one two three roll a

755
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:12,419
dice pick one if you don't know anything

756
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:15,000
about the line

757
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:17,038
um it's a lot easier to know a line grow

758
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,419
the line out know the females and that

759
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:20,099
way when you start seeing these males

760
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:21,840
pop out you can see their counterparts

761
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:23,819
in the female slowly but surely with

762
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:26,158
what traits line up with both of them

763
00:28:23,819 --> 00:28:27,778
and uh yeah that's the best advice know

764
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,340
your line before you work it know your

765
00:28:27,778 --> 00:28:31,019
line before you know your line before

766
00:28:29,339 --> 00:28:32,639
you choose a male and and it'll tell you

767
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:34,619
everything you don't have to have any

768
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,600
questions I think I think your

769
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:38,399
intentions you know say a lot to you I

770
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:41,099
mean if you're somebody who's really

771
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:44,159
trying to go deep and uh you know you

772
00:28:41,099 --> 00:28:47,038
got the means uh space wise time wise

773
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:49,200
and what have you to to go that way then

774
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:51,839
sure you know but if let's say you just

775
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,120
grab a bag of seeds right and you pop it

776
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:55,918
you got a couple males and you know

777
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:58,079
you're not a lifer necessarily but you

778
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,940
want to mess around

779
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:02,099
um or even like open pollination

780
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:03,960
situations right sure

781
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:05,759
um you can open Parliament with more

782
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:09,480
than one male you don't have to have

783
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:11,460
12 males in there if you have a 4x4 sure

784
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,720
there's like all kinds of consideration

785
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,340
in terms of what you're trying to get

786
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,019
into as well yeah it's what you're

787
00:29:14,339 --> 00:29:17,939
trying to achieve are you trying to make

788
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:19,619
seats for sale are you trying to make it

789
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:21,058
just to learn the line I mean there's

790
00:29:19,619 --> 00:29:23,099
all kinds of different reasons and

791
00:29:21,058 --> 00:29:24,898
appropriate uses of things like that

792
00:29:23,099 --> 00:29:27,058
sure yeah you may not have an

793
00:29:24,898 --> 00:29:29,099
opportunity to go through five males and

794
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:31,500
grow out all their Prodigy and continue

795
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:35,298
to select and figure out how to you know

796
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:35,298
dial it in the way you want so

797
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:39,359
that makes a lot of sense

798
00:29:37,339 --> 00:29:43,379
what about you local you have any

799
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:47,158
questions on males yeah right yes yeah

800
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:49,380
the question is like how is one maybe

801
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:52,080
able to distinguish

802
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:54,899
um one to let's say pull a mail from it

803
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:57,119
you know the original F1 versus maybe

804
00:29:54,898 --> 00:29:59,939
pulling a mail for breeding later down

805
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:01,558
in the generation like are are there

806
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:03,720
instances like where people actually

807
00:30:01,558 --> 00:30:05,898
like you know move a line forward to

808
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:09,000
select a mail or like

809
00:30:05,898 --> 00:30:11,278
it just seems really odd

810
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,859
when I I can't think of a situation

811
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:16,440
unless I was like doing

812
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:18,839
like parallel breeding where I'm working

813
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:20,880
two two different expressions from the

814
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:23,038
same line then I would choose a male at

815
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,240
like F5 to cross to a nail like F5 up

816
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:25,500
here that's a that's a good case for

817
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,759
doing something like that like going

818
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,380
down she's in the middle up here as

819
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:29,398
opposed to down here

820
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:32,039
um

821
00:30:29,398 --> 00:30:34,859
mm-hmm I I can't really think of any

822
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:37,619
situation where I would purposely choose

823
00:30:34,859 --> 00:30:39,778
like an F3 male over an F1 mail for any

824
00:30:37,619 --> 00:30:41,639
situation

825
00:30:39,778 --> 00:30:44,159
I'm sure there are occasions where that

826
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,380
comes up but I can't think of one

827
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,179
um I mean yeah I guess maybe the only

828
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:50,220
instance I could think of is maybe

829
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:53,159
pulling like a male from an F2 because

830
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:54,659
it is your you know largest window for

831
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:57,059
selection

832
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:59,460
you know and maybe you to just bring

833
00:30:57,058 --> 00:31:01,038
diverse more diversity yeah maybe yeah

834
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:03,720
but

835
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:04,679
but yeah I don't know usually yeah the

836
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,659
thing is usually if I'm working

837
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:08,159
something in my mind if I'm working

838
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:10,919
something forward I'm only going forward

839
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:13,320
for uniformity yeah of a trait never for

840
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:14,820
diversity but I'm sure like if someone

841
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:16,619
had like

842
00:31:14,819 --> 00:31:18,740
10 seeds of a line that might actually

843
00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:20,699
be a decent thing to do you know like

844
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:22,980
and with me when it comes to open

845
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:26,278
pollinations like I'm I'm All or Nothing

846
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:27,778
with open pollinations it's like yeah I

847
00:31:26,278 --> 00:31:30,179
have to leave all the males in there

848
00:31:27,778 --> 00:31:31,679
with all the females or one male one

849
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:35,220
female

850
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:37,620
um or or one male all females

851
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:40,980
um and that's only because like I feel

852
00:31:37,619 --> 00:31:42,719
like if you're doing any kind of pulling

853
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:44,339
out based on like oh this thing's

854
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,259
herming that let's all remove that one

855
00:31:44,339 --> 00:31:48,000
I'm artificially selecting just one

856
00:31:46,259 --> 00:31:49,619
little thing away from that pool it's

857
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,419
only one little thing but I'm taking

858
00:31:49,619 --> 00:31:52,500
away a trait you know I think it's not a

859
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:53,640
great trait but I'm taking it away but

860
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,500
it might be a link trait to something

861
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:57,960
very special in that line and you might

862
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,339
have just pulled it so so that's the

863
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,960
only time I would say like it's more

864
00:31:59,339 --> 00:32:02,879
beneficial to have all the males versus

865
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,259
just choosing a few but if it's a space

866
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,539
consideration like pack was talking

867
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:08,158
about that's an excellent time when it's

868
00:32:06,538 --> 00:32:09,960
like you know like you're not probably

869
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,039
not even making seeds to sell at that

870
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,538
point but you're trying to go through

871
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:15,359
the line that's a perfect time to you

872
00:32:12,538 --> 00:32:17,099
know use what works for you you know

873
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:19,079
whatever's going to help you get through

874
00:32:17,099 --> 00:32:22,158
that line more to understand it more

875
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:22,158
perfect case for it

876
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:26,820
I mean you know most people nowadays

877
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,940
dude are in it for themselves right um

878
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:32,278
yeah and this idea of like it being

879
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:33,600
you know a lifestyle versus like a

880
00:32:32,278 --> 00:32:34,798
window of opportunity you have to jump

881
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:36,298
through

882
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:38,099
you know what I'm saying that kind of

883
00:32:36,298 --> 00:32:40,220
separates the men from the boys I guess

884
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:43,459
like the ones yeah

885
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:45,839
it always has yeah

886
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:48,778
like when somebody gets the opportunity

887
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:51,418
to [ __ ] [ __ ] you over to try and make

888
00:32:48,778 --> 00:32:52,619
the situation better it happened all the

889
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:56,120
time

890
00:32:52,619 --> 00:32:56,119
like you know

891
00:32:57,019 --> 00:33:04,558
because it ruins friendships man

892
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:05,879
Yeah well yeah yeah yeah what's the

893
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:07,619
difference between the long timers and

894
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,539
the short term timers in cannabis you

895
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:12,058
know like being in being in the seed

896
00:33:09,538 --> 00:33:14,339
scene for over 15 years now I've watched

897
00:33:12,058 --> 00:33:16,740
a revolving door of characters some of

898
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:18,599
them the most popular dudes you couldn't

899
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:20,399
imagine the biggest top of the scene

900
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:23,398
totally gone no one even remembers them

901
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:26,099
anymore you know um yeah it flashes in

902
00:33:23,398 --> 00:33:27,839
the pan like that happened all the time

903
00:33:26,099 --> 00:33:31,319
there's a high turnover rate in cannabis

904
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:33,359
at very few are people that have been in

905
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:34,980
it longer than 10 years in the seed

906
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:37,259
scene that have lasted that long and

907
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:38,819
that are still going through researching

908
00:33:37,259 --> 00:33:40,740
trying to find the truth doing all that

909
00:33:38,819 --> 00:33:43,259
stuff it doesn't yeah it's a hard thing

910
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:45,298
to to stick with you don't make friends

911
00:33:43,259 --> 00:33:46,619
trying to find history and dude you know

and uh yeah in the world there's no

917
