stick with it baby yeah all right uh

30
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:13,840
false flag operations

31
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:18,719
they've existed in the past so let's

32
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:22,400
let's say let's move on home simply

33
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:25,280
because okay let me clarify uap

34
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,759
false flag narratives

35
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,879
well we know that actually has occurred

36
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:32,000
in the past so we can't say bs and

37
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:33,359
i don't want to say stick with it

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,078
because it's not occurring now so that's

39
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:38,000
why i said let's move on simply because

40
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:40,158
there's elements that that that have

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,159
some truth on that in the past but i

42
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,439
don't i don't see that right now as

43
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,880
being

44
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:46,559
at least publicly there's some

45
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,560
resistance that i'm facing inside the

46
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,560
government but that's not your concern

47
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,600
and that's you know a fight that we have

48
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,759
to deal with um it's more obfuscation i

49
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:56,798
think than it is false flag

50
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,680
got it

51
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,680
