117
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:59,918
know

118
00:04:55,279 --> 00:05:01,679
[ __ ] uh so so that was the intro at

119
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:04,758
the

120
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,038
time seeing nothing but greenbud my

121
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:09,400
whole my whole life every once in a

122
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:10,879
while we would get the uh brick or you

123
00:05:09,399 --> 00:05:13,839
know you'd see it in the neighborhood

124
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:17,879
but you had you had a a [ __ ] ton of

125
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:21,519
options right um cat cat piss was huge

126
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:23,519
back then we had probably uh five or six

127
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:26,399
different varieties of cat piss at that

128
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:28,918
point um just a skunk I mean we didn't

129
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:35,120
have names back then it was just it it

130
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:40,799
was dank swag green Bud kind bud

131
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,800
um was this like the era of swag

132
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,120
shirts no I think it was a little bit

133
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:49,478
before that okay when uh the terms kind

134
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,639
of caught on it was like kind of after

135
00:05:49,478 --> 00:05:53,439
the uh people calling herb and you just

136
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:56,160
call anything dank and schwag at that

137
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:57,478
point actually I remember I think um

138
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,759
there was some dude on the David

139
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:02,918
Letterman show hippie that he picked up

140
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:05,080
David Letterman picked up on in San

141
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:07,680
Francisco and the guy was like teaching

142
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:11,240
David Letterman the [ __ ] terminology

143
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,560
and he was like this is G this is swag I

144
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,720
think that's one it kind of caught on

145
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,280
probably that

146
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,639
name

147
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:22,399
right um was making seeds just part of

148
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:26,280
growing for you at the time as well it's

149
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:30,198
just part of the process no

150
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:33,879
um so you know I was I was also doing my

151
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:38,478
thing um you know back in the day at

152
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:42,478
twamp sacks $20 grams and $60 Ace and

153
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:45,240
whatnot uh the seeds never really came

154
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:48,038
to me until

155
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:52,439
my probably like late

156
00:06:48,038 --> 00:06:55,318
20s um you know you know by buying the

157
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:57,319
High Times back then I remember seeing

158
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:00,080
like super silver hay first coming out

159
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:02,639
or White Widow and all these cool things

160
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:05,639
and so I I always just like would go

161
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,000
through the cataloges and fantasize of

162
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,960
what I'm going to buy and what I'm going

163
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,959
to

164
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:13,680
grow so when I first started really

165
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:15,959
growing um I did the Bay Area thing in

166
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,439
the park for a couple years that you

167
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:21,638
know like I said it just got me by and

168
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:23,759
then um I got my foot in the door by one

169
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:28,038
of my old dealers called him tweaker

170
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:30,360
Rick back then um he ended up he ended

171
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:32,719
up burning his dealer

172
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,000
by spending all of like the guy's money

173
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,360
on El John [ __ ] tickets thinking he's

174
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,918
going to scalp him in the [ __ ]

175
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:42,720
concert and and make triple his

176
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:44,598
money um anyhow I he might have sold two

177
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,960
tickets and he took everybody he knew to

178
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:46,959
Elton

179
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:54,598
John so the you know his dealer ended up

180
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:57,399
getting burned and the way tweaker Rick

181
00:07:54,598 --> 00:08:00,120
repaid him back was he introduced him to

182
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:03,120
me and then we started working together

183
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,840
but I was paying still twe Rick's ticket

184
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,759
at that point the guy you know slowly

185
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:08,918
made his money back and then we made a

186
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:10,360
relationship you know and and started

187
00:08:08,918 --> 00:08:13,079
you know he started trusting me he was

188
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,439
much older than me at that time um and

189
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:16,959
then one day he's like hey come out to

190
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:18,918
Santa Cruz and I went over there and he

191
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:21,959
had a house in Scott's Valley and he had

192
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:23,719
this sweet like uh um underground in his

193
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:25,959
house was a three three story house and

194
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:28,280
like pretty much the attic was all

195
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:30,959
converted but like he had like a secret

196
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:33,120
door and everything and um I love that

197
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,639
so he showed me that we started you know

198
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,879
I started trimming for him a little bit

199
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,120
I thought it was the coolest thing ever

200
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:40,679
at first and then uh eventually he was

201

to check up hey there you go that's what

262
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,320
I do yeah so yeah there was no

263
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:19,359
information it was all you learn by

264
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:22,440
trial and error right um You you had

265
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,039
asked that but that was about it and you

266
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,720
know there was a couple other books out

267
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:28,240
there too that I had read back in the

268
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,839
day um but pretty much for the most part

269
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:34,959
it was trial there you know yeah that

270
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:37,800
makes sense um so so after you you start

271
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:40,479
working for this dude right um at what

272
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:44,838
point do you start taking it on your

273
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:49,120
own so we ended up getting busted with

274
00:11:44,839 --> 00:11:50,160
uh operation green fire it's where um

275
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,919
this was in

276
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:55,799
96 uh the DEA ended up following

277
00:11:52,919 --> 00:12:00,078
everybody home from the Hydra

278
00:11:55,799 --> 00:12:02,519
stores uh back then in the Bay Area had

279
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:04,599
you had Berkeley indoor Hydra store you

280
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:07,480
had one in Berkeley called the

281
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:11,440
vivaran there was a store in Sacramento

282
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:13,639
called greenf fire and there was store

283
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,839
in um I don't remember the name of it

284
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:18,759
but the guy Hans and that was it for

285
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,480
Hydra stores back then right and then uh

286
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:24,039
finally in Santa Cruz they had to open

287
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,680
one up an nap toss and the [ __ ] da

288
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:28,078
were following everybody so they

289
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:29,519
followed my boss to a different grow

290
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:33,198
where he had another

291
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:35,198
grown um so the de would like when they

292
00:12:33,198 --> 00:12:37,439
would throw out their trash the DEA went

293
00:12:35,198 --> 00:12:40,319
took their trash searched through it

294
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,160
found something from there raided their

295
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,720
house and then from there they raided

296
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:47,278
our house and like I said I was a kid

297
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,360
back then CPS knew who they were going

298
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:52,958
for so they ended up grabbing boss man

299
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,159
and left me alone I went back to

300
00:12:52,958 --> 00:13:00,399
the

301
00:12:55,159 --> 00:13:03,919
um hustling and then the the beers came

302
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:06,799
in the BC weed came in and pretty much

303
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:10,519
annihilated my my hustle because I was

304
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:13,359
still going for you know highgrade

305
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:16,278
flavorful the BC came in it looked

306
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:19,720
pretty but you know now pounds that were

307
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:22,399
going for 4,000 bucks are now 2,000

308
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:24,560
bucks yeah right I mean the first few

309
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,000
years of BC if you found somebody that

310
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:29,879
was bringing it in um I I know some

311
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,958
people that made hella money hell fast

312
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:34,679
then ended doing like 10 years prison

313
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:36,559
right they just made way too much way

314
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:38,000
too fast I mean I'm talking millions and

315
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:38,879
and then they ended up getting busted

316
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,799
and

317
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:45,919
whatnot um so so when the BC came in it

318
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:47,559
pretty much wiped out my hustle uh

319
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:49,439
people didn't want to play that high

320
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:51,838
ticket anymore and just wanted that

321
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:56,240
cheap as you see it happen like every 10

322
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:57,759
years or so right yeah U so at that

323
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,799
point I was just like you know what [ __ ]

324
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:01,680
it uh I love

325
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:05,519
snowboarding I wanted to be up in the

326
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:07,838
mountains so Taho area and uh was

327
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,399
working at the ski resorts and and then

328
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,040
that's when I started just doing my own

329
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:14,440
thing pretty much full-time started with

330
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:17,319
indoors uh did the flood and Dr or not

331
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:20,519
the flood the uh the how was top with

332
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:23,720
the rock top feeding

333
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:27,639
recycle um and then you know [ __ ] [ __ ]

334
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:30,600
never really turned out that great and I

335
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:32,039
don't remember how it happened or if I

336
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,278
read something or somebody told me

337
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:37,639
they're like stop the recycle system and

338
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:39,879
just go to drain and waste and then as

339
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:43,039
soon as I did that all my problems went

340
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:45,320
away um everything turned out incredible

341
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:46,879
still using GH at that

342
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:50,680
time

343
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:52,720
um um any know so that was that started

344
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:56,198
what do you think what do you think

345
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,800
about changing to to uh drain to waste

346
00:14:56,198 --> 00:14:59,439
what do you think changed the the

347
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:01,479
scenario

348
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,120
salt buildup salt build up the salt

349
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:06,240
would before you do the recycle right

350
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:10,799
and then on once you do drink salt build

351
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:12,959
up so fixes everything right um so then

352
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:15,919
um so now I'm doing a little I had like

353
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:17,679
eight lights at that time um

354
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:19,439
everything's going good and then I

355
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:21,159
started incorporating a little bit of

356
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,759
outdoor at the property I was living on

357
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:25,719
it was it was a 5 acre par but my

358
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:29,519
landlord lived right next door on the

359
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:31,600
other five acres so I still had to like

360
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,240
be pretty discreet and where I was

361
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,879
living was come on vacation leave on

362
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,198
probation type place right they they wer

363
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:42,519
they weren't having it at all so what I

364
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:45,318
did was uh there's this huge Blackberry

365
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:46,679
patch um and there was like a little

366
00:15:45,318 --> 00:15:48,519
crawlway where some Critters were

367
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:50,758
crawling underneath it and I ended up

368
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:53,198
following that into the middle cut

369
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:55,360
everything out of the middle of it ended

370
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:57,078
up digging down probably like two three

371
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,919
feet so I can get some more height out

372
00:15:57,078 --> 00:16:01,679
of it and and then that's where I play

373
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:03,439
my plants and then you know occasionally

374
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:05,838
my landlord would come over and she was

375
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,440
like it it smells really skunky is there

376
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,959
Dead Skunk or something like I don't

377
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,480
know you're

378
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:14,318
talking that was my start of like really

379
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:19,079
trying to do out outside growing you

380
00:16:14,318 --> 00:16:21,559
know it's still now at this time it's 99

381
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:23,479
right yeah so even outdoor weed is still

382
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:27,719
getting four grand um you don't have to

383
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:29,319
grow very much you know I'm young so uh

384
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,160
you know and I came from nothing so

385
00:16:29,318 --> 00:16:35,559
little the money I was making was

386
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:37,159
incredible for me it was right um and

387
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:40,039
then and then you know slowly every year

388
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:42,439
after that uh the the little blackberry

389
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:45,159
bush patch got a little bit bigger a

390
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:47,959
little bit bigger and then finally I was

391
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:52,240
able to um move out of there and get a

392
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:55,198
bigger spot and do more of the outdoor

393
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,799
um yeah somebody told

394
00:16:55,198 --> 00:17:01,000
me somebody told me you pay your bills

395
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:04,438
with indoor and you retire off outdoor

396
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,078
back then oh [ __ ] that's smart right

397
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:09,000
back then that was that was the thing

398
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:10,759
right yeah so I just I just started

399
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,199
doing the outdoor more and more and more

400
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:18,318
and then uh finally let's see I've got

401
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,360
in trouble a few times in this town so

402
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:23,199
uh the last time they were pretty much

403
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:27,279
like you know don't give us a problem we

404
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,480
won't give you a problem and left to

405
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:31,639
wets Menda

406
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,960
um pretty much where it was a

407
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:37,480
free-for-all if you uh if you had money

408
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,840
for an attorney you're it was pretty

409
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,440
much legal if you didn't have money for

410
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:45,678
an attorney you're going to jail yeah so

411
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:49,038
I started doing that um life was good so

412
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:51,960
so as I'm starting to do more outdoor I

413
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:54,558
I knew like you know a seed you'll get

414
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,440
double the yield less the pro you know

415
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:59,240
half the problems than growing a clone

416
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,558
outside yep and so you know I'm buying

417
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,679
I'm buying seeds from everybody and I'm

418
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:05,240
growing them out and every time I'm

419
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,519
[ __ ] buying them you know I'm reading

420
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,960
their descriptions sounds great I get

421
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:12,960
hard on from it and then I grow them out

422
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:15,079
and it's like uh you know it's like not

423
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,519
not even one of them fit the description

424
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:20,240
or maybe if I was lucky one of the

425
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:22,038
plants would fit the description of what

426
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,960
how they're describing them right but

427
00:18:22,038 --> 00:18:27,640
most times out of 10 seeds I'm getting

428
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:30,679
10 completely different plants and uh it

429
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:34,080
it just wasn't Happ happening right it's

430
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:36,559
not it's not feasible for a big monocrop

431
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:38,079
outdoor exactly so then that's that's

432
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:40,480
when I was like you know what I could

433
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:42,519
[ __ ] do better um and decided to

434
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:46,519
start playing around and making my own

435
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:49,200
seats so most my seed was made for

436
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:51,200
commercial outdoor um different time you

437
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,759
know different Harvest times different

438
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,720
flavors mostly flavor I'm I'm a flavor

439
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:57,119
guy you know it's if it doesn't make

440
00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:00,120
soft water I don't really want to [ __ ]

441
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:02,479
with it um

442
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:04,399
so what were some of the PLS you were

443
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,440
you were growing out door and first

444
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,400
making seeds with like what what got you

445
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:12,080
going on that as far as strains go uh

446
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:14,400
actually the the cat piss was the oh

447
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:18,798
well my very first my very first

448
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:23,320

452
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:38,080
right uh you know SE making the seeds is

453
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:41,319
kind of like U it's like art to me it's

454
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:44,558
it's my creation it's my art um it's my

455
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:47,079
passion and not just seeds like you know

456
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:50,639
I breed chickens like I breed rabbits

457
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:53,519
dogs uh I love that creating and making

458
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,400
my own thing um so that I mean that's

459
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:57,679
where the real passion lies and then

460
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,798
just being able you know the gamble the

461
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,600
Russia it it's like you never know what

462
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:04,079
you're going to get until you grow them

463
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:05,599
out you know until the very end and you

464
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:08,879
know some you sometimes you're waiting

465
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:12,359
six months then you know it's crapshoot

466
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:16,120
who knows with other people but um so

467
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:17,798
yeah that's what was the L Uno um train

468
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:19,959
wreck was that just like a super lemony

469
00:20:17,798 --> 00:20:24,158
type strain in the end how did that come

470
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:28,400
out the train wreck cover pretty much um

471
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:31,000
yeah yeah so so that was the first just

472
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:34,600
playing around and then I got my I got

473
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,200
the cat piss cut which I had inserch the

474
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:40,439
Pittsburgh piss yeah so we we had we had

475
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:44,880
several different cat pisses we had um

476
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:47,480
so and we named them after the dealer or

477
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,600
the town we bought it from so like we

478
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:54,000
had uh uh the Nate piss or we had Tom

479
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:55,798

480
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,599
would call it the Claire piss or then

481
00:20:55,798 --> 00:21:01,720
you had you know the Martina piss or the

483
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:07,200
cities you got

484
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:11,000
to I'm thinking you know that that was

485
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:14,080
like the the the Amsterdam turp probably

486
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,839
profile back then yeah um everything was

487
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:21,319
skunky everything was skunky right and

488
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:24,759
yeah so not it's about

489
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:27,000
2 four fiveish I got I got the cat piss

490
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:28,158
strain and what I when I was I was

491
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,519
looking for the C piss and I looking for

492
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,679
the roadkill skunk yeah and I roadkill

493
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:35,599
skunk could find anywhere and I always

494
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:39,240
thought that the ciss and the roadkill

495
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:42,439
were related a little bit Yeah so I got

496
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:46,400
cat piss and I was like cool these make

497
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:49,840
some seeds grow them out and hopefully

498
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:53,600
find the roadkill um so I did it didn't

499
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:57,158
find the roadkill uh then I crossed back

500
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:58,719
made some more seeds tried it out uh I I

501
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:01,000
couldn't find the road kill inside there

502
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:05,319
it was all just cat

503
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:08,240
piss so okay back to cat piss the

504
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:10,720
Pittsburgh piss which I worked was

505
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,240
actually the least of my favorite out of

506
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:16,240
them all um why did you choose to work

507
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,400
that one then what's that why did you

508
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,759
choose

509
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:23,360
work only only one I could find oh okay

510
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:25,278
got yeah I se I searched for days days

511
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:27,000
and days uh spent thousands and

512
00:22:25,278 --> 00:22:30,798
thousands of dollars on people claiming

513
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,400
they had it and sure um traveled all

514
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:36,319
over uh you know same thing with the

515
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:39,519
skunk spent who knows how much and

516
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:43,158
traveled all over and so been bunked

517
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:45,000
so at this point sha um because you you

518
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:47,720
mentioned kind of making seeds partly to

519
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,038
solve your own problem as a grower uh

520
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:52,640
how how do you go from that point to

521
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:54,158
actually selling seeds is that quite a

522
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,159
is that quite a gap or does that happen

523
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,559
quite

524
00:22:55,159 --> 00:23:01,400
quickly huge gap um so sorry seeds in

525
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:03,480
the early 2000s uh just for stash you

526
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,360
know just fun

527
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:08,079
passion

528
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:09,359
um and then I didn't I didn't start

529
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:12,158
selling seeds

530
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:14,918
until 2018 or

531
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:17,480
19 and and all reason I kind of did it

532
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:22,200
was just seeing uh you know I was

533
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:23,919
sharing seeds with people and then um a

534
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:26,360
few of these people started seed

535
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,600
companies with my seeds oh yeah and at

536
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:29,959
that point I was like hey maybe I got

537
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:32,759
some on here and so that's what I

538
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,759
decided to come out

539
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,759
with yeah that makes sense I remember I

540
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,880
know what you're talking about

541
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:42,079
specifically for sure uh but back to

542
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,480

what you know um it's like those old

559
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:28,840
flavors that just remind you of of you

560
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:31,918
know little

561
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:34,480
incident or or the past or something

562
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:37,240
like that

563
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,200

at the

565
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,798
piss

566
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:46,000
um and

567
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:49,359
then oh so at at the same time as I'm

568
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:53,798
working the piss I'm going to a uh

569
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:55,798
computer tech school um at the time and

570
00:24:53,798 --> 00:24:58,599
the one one of my classmates their

571
00:24:55,798 --> 00:25:01,119
family owns this huge Farm

572
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:04,678
in Northern California they pretty much

573
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:07,278
own like half this town Williams and one

574
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:08,919
day the guy comes to school and uh he's

575
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:10,240
got all these brown spots all over his

576
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:13,200
shirt and I'm like what the [ __ ] were

577
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,759
you doing and he said he was

578
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,880
spraying he was spraying their melons or

579
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:20,000
their

580
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:22,520
cucumbers with silver nitrate and I'm

581
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,119
like what [ __ ] why would you do that and

582
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:28,200
he was like well you get femin seeds and

583
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:29,959
I was like oh [ __ ] uh

584
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,519
yeah I'm pretty sure those cucumbers

585
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:35,079
they were they were spraying with silver

586
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:36,918
nitrate for the seeds right and you know

587
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:40,079
he doesn't know I'm growing weed at all

588
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:42,240
but uh uh so so he you know I'm picking

589
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:44,480
his brain a little bit and then he tells

590
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:48,159
me and there's this other thing called

591
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:50,200
florel that will reverse males into

592
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:53,120
females and and now my [ __ ] head's

593
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:55,278
just spinning I'm like this about

594
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:58,038
cucumbers uh no I I don't remember what

595
00:25:55,278 --> 00:26:02,119
the florel was for but I was like what

596
00:25:58,038 --> 00:26:04,359
yeah was the uh and so now head I can't

597
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:07,639
wait to get [ __ ] home to like start

598
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:11,798
looking the [ __ ] up and play around with

599
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:13,840
it uh so so the the reversing the males

600
00:26:11,798 --> 00:26:17,398
I thought you know I still think it it

601
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:19,199
was is a is a huge tool to the breeder

602
00:26:17,398 --> 00:26:21,319
because the female's easy you smell it

603
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,000
you smoke it you know exactly what it is

604
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:24,359
the

605
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,759
males um you know back in the day before

606
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:29,158
I even knew I would do the stem rub and

607
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:32,599
and how they grew and and that's pretty

608
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:33,840
much how I selected but yeah you never

609
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:37,398
knew what you were getting at the end

610
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:39,439
until you grew them out um so you know

611
00:26:37,398 --> 00:26:42,398
with reversing the males now you can

612
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:45,440
[ __ ] pinpoint exactly the flavor

613
00:26:42,398 --> 00:26:47,959
you're looking for right uh I I wouldn't

614
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,080
smoke it I wouldn't put that you know I

615
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:54,200
cover up pretty good when I spray

616
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:56,038
that um but uh so I was doing that and I

617
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:58,679
could pinpoint chps at least right and

618
00:26:56,038 --> 00:27:00,398
then I use exactly and then sometimes

619
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:03,159
you'd find you know like three or four

620
00:27:00,398 --> 00:27:05,359
different males you really like so I

621
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:08,960
take each one of those and I would cross

622
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:11,798
each male to its own clone right like so

623
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:15,000
let's say uh the cat piss so I took four

624
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:18,278
different cat piss um males and I would

625
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:21,159
cross each one to its own original cus

626
00:27:18,278 --> 00:27:24,200
clone then grow all those out and now I

627
00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:26,278
can pinpoint exactly what male is doing

628
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,960
what yeah what male is passing which

629
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:32,679
trait it exactly and then pick out the

630
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:35,038
best one um so I mean the process takes

631
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:37,080
a [ __ ] long time but you like I said

632
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:40,398
I I wasn't making seed to sell I was I

633
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:42,720
was breeding solely for myself just so

634
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:46,599
you know in 20 years I can have what I

635
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:49,240
want um and not lose those

636
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:52,000
genetics question here go ahead oh you

637
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:53,679
go mat okay I'll ask this one go ah side

638
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
question for you sha is when do the

639
00:27:53,679 --> 00:28:00,038
forums come into play for you forums

640
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,519
came in play in

641
00:28:00,038 --> 00:28:05,720
2002 I started blowing

642

my start of the forums got introduced it

708
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:26,360
by a Jeff and uh no look back ever since

709
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:29,000
and then what a [ __ ] game changer

710
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:32,479
that was right um because now you can

711
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:35,079
ask questions and whatnot and you know I

712
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,000
remember like I remember bogs posts back

713
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:39,678
then and I thought that was pretty

714
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,119
trippy and you know and and I tried out

715
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:44,360
everybody's tricks um whatnot did you

716
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:46,599
ever pee on your plants like Kenda said

717
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:49,240
I never peed on my

718
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:52,398
plants never peed on my plants that's

719
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:55,120
one of my favorites I pee on my

720
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:58,439
plants like a kid

721
00:31:55,119 --> 00:32:00,000
though yeah like that who like who who

722
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:02,038
when you just first got on the forums

723
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,319
was most influential was it like the bog

724
00:32:02,038 --> 00:32:06,879
type

725
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:09,599
people bog yeah yeah he the only one it

726
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,960
really stands out to me and remember um

727
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:14,158
yeah he seems to be a big like uh point

728
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,600
for a lot of people from your era like

729
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:19,399

00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:27,440
anymore myself personally um not not

754
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,720
only the cost live in California and the

755
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,240
power bills [ __ ] ridiculous but just

756
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:34,360
the smoke of it um doesn't really get

757
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,839
high anymore like I need the the

758
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:41,119
sungrown is is is is my by far my

759
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:43,678
favorite or or Greenhouse very cool it

760
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:46,518
definitely has more of a kick than

761
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:48,759
indoor green indoor grown weed you know

762
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:49,919
yeah a lot a lot of dudes say that I I

763
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:51,599
don't have as much experience with

764
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,639
outdoor being that where I came from

765
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:56,519
like it was so freaking hot that nobody

766
00:33:53,638 --> 00:33:58,519
was really getting good outdoor so like

767
00:33:56,519 --> 00:34:00,159
I am so blind when it comes to outdoor

768
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:02,960
that I never really got to experience a

769
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:06,840
lot of really great outdoor even

770
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,840
still I need to cruise up

771
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:16,039
bro yeah I switched my style up now now

772
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,079
like I I don't buy anything anymore um I

773
00:34:16,039 --> 00:34:21,480
get all my nutrients for my critters uh

774
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:23,800
mostly rabbit [ __ ] um chicken [ __ ] and

775
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:27,519
then you know of course I use like bone

776
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:32,159
meal and and uh what else gips

777
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:34,960
or yeah alala you know amendments um

778
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:37,039
calos and whatnot but for the most part

779
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,559
it's just chicken or rabbit [ __ ] and

780
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:41,079
then the chicken [ __ ] I amend in the

781
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:44,239
soil as well but I just make rabbit [ __ ]

782
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:46,079
tea [ __ ] or or I just top dress with

783
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:49,918
it

784
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:52,320
and that's awesome actually it's

785
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:54,279
[ __ ] one of our mates had a question

786
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,159
for you about your outdoor style which

787
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:58,720
was uh do you grow in big uh do you grow

788
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:03,358
in the ground or containers and

789
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:05,759
um uh I I grew with um pretty much I've

790
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:08,078
had over a dozen Farms um different

791
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:11,000
areas all all throughout Northern

792
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:13,000
California so it it just depends on the

793
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,719
location I've grown in the soil I've

794
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,880
grown straight in the ground um I I grow

795
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:21,879
in pots uh

796
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:25,079
beds Ju Just location wise but I've done

797
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:27,400
it all I've even um like when money

798
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:30,160
isn't all up there and I can't afford

799
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:32,880
some stuff I've even just thrown mounds

800
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:34,519
of dirt on top of the the ground and

801
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,440
just planted in that without using pots

802
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:38,440
or anything like that

803
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:46,400
um um what do I

804
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:48,598
prefer so in smart pots they definitely

805
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:52,079
grow the best they grow the fastest and

806
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:54,160
the biggest but then like you're growing

807
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:57,280
12 foot plants and now you got this two

808
00:35:54,159 --> 00:36:00,358
foot pot you know I [ __ ] hate getting on

809
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,160
the ladders and having a work with super

810
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:03,559
super tall plants but that's what we did

811
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:04,960
back in the day you try to grow big

812
00:36:03,559 --> 00:36:08,199
[ __ ] plants and stay within your

813
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:10,679
limit so in the came it's like here's my

814
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:15,960
medical script and here's PL go [ __ ] off

815
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:15,960
now there's six of them at 400 pounds

816
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:23,680
total right like yeah like you're trying

817
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:28,358
to max out with those six plants yeah

818
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:30,960
tot um um and and then you know

819
00:36:28,358 --> 00:36:35,000
it it so different styles for different

820
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:38,960
areas uh where where I am now you'd

821
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:42,079
stay in their guidelines and you know

822
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:44,440
you just grew as big plant as you could

823
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:47,560
um I went up to Trinity County and

824
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:48,838
pretty much Trinity County was uh as

825
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:51,400
long as your neighbors don't call the

826
00:36:48,838 --> 00:36:55,440
cops on you you're fine it's not a crime

827
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:58,079
so there you were able to go all out um

828
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:01,519
I still I still did mostly big plants

829
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:04,000
there but then I started catching on um

830
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:06,679
smaller plants smaller plants do much

831
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,199
better Outdoors quality-wise

832
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:13,399
uh the buds look better they taste

833
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:15,799
better um are they stonier yeah they're

834
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:19,599
stonier too and it like once you start

835
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:22,119
passing five pounds plants the the

836
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:25,599
quality goes down the look

837
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:28,358
goes right the tradeoff right

838
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:31,519
um last couple years I was working at a

839
00:37:28,358 --> 00:37:33,358
legal farm for a company and there you

840
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:35,519
know I told them I was like dude pack

841
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:38,078
them in there let's go a [ __ ] ton of

842
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:40,239
small plants and and so that's what we

843
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:44,240
did and that was that was hella of fun

844
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:47,919
like um we did we did uh I think it was

845
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:49,719
like 20,000 seeds last year um I gotta

846
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,639
grow a [ __ ] ton of my own stuff so that

847
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:55,000
was cool and then uh grew a bunch of

848
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:57,159
other people's stuff and uh still

849
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,639
growing other people's stuff you know

850
00:37:57,159 --> 00:38:03,159
that I want to toot my own horn but um

851
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:05,400
you know my shit's got to go you know

852
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:07,440
right the other people's stuff same [ __ ]

853
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:09,480
you know it's like one out of the 10

854
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,760
would [ __ ] be whatever they described

855
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:14,440
or it was you know every plant turned

856
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,960
out completely different it's

857
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:19,679
like

858
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:21,800
um yeah so as a as a breeder and and as

859
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:23,358
someone that bought seeds like when at

860
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,920
least when I started my company that was

861
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:26,279
like one of the main factors that I

862
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:28,760
wanted to hit because it was the most

863
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:32,000
Anno part for me was that I could not

864
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:33,200
get any kind of reliability in these

865
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,719
strange descriptions because like if you

866
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:36,399
think about like Dutch Flowers they had

867
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:38,679
some of the best copywriting ever like

868
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:41,559
you'd read that and be like damn really

869
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:44,440
metal tastes like [ __ ] what you know

870
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:45,759
like that's right and you get it it kind

871
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:48,838
of

872
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:51,680
sucks yeah yeah I I grew out a bunch of

873
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:53,838
those the metal the metal Haze yeah

874
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:57,039
what' you think yeah there was a couple

875
00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:58,838
of them that floated around and uh

876
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:00,800
actually that one still stands out to me

877
00:38:58,838 --> 00:39:04,239
I remember how easy it was to trim and

878
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:06,760
like the spear Buds and yeah but I mean

879
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:08,959
you know it was good it wasn't you know

880
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,400
mind-blowing but it was good and the

881
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,960
structure I think it was more the

882
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:14,480
structure that I um remember just how

883
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,838
well it grew

884
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:19,119
outside

885
00:39:16,838 --> 00:39:22,960
um so yeah so the

886
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:25,920
outdoor we did we for years and then um

887
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:28,960
you know getting raided kicking out then

888
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:31,039
kicking me out of town and then uh you

889
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:33,519
know every time I got raided and I'd

890
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:36,759
have to put my property up for sale like

891
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:39,119
the value had just skyrocketed and and

892
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:40,440
even with with like telling people hey

893
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:42,680
you know the cops said they're coming

894
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:45,838
back they would still want to buy these

895
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:48,480
properties oh [ __ ] so then I was like

896
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:51,480
hey well [ __ ] maybe maybe that's the

897
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:54,280
ticket right there so then I started

898
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:56,599
buying properties building them up you

899
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:58,960
know I'd grow a year or two out of of

900
00:39:56,599 --> 00:40:02,160
them and then flip them and and that

901
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:04,920
[ __ ] fantastic but you know like that

902
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:06,519
ended too with everything else fun um

903
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,559
you know Pro properties up north that

904
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:11,440
used to sell for five five million and

905
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:13,358
like humble won't even sell for 500,000

906
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:18,838
now

907
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:21,279
yeah so yeah so that was that um and and

908
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:23,679
with like the seed breeding it it's it's

909
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:26,560
what I [ __ ] love to do I I I I love

910
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:29,358
the hunt I love the gamble love being

911
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:32,318
create my own thing

912
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:34,799
um and and I love the fact that you know

913
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:37,920
I I know like in 10 years let's say OG

914
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,400
goes extinct I got OG seats and I know

915
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,159
they're gonna come out OG you know I

916
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,440
don't have to dig through them all or

917
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:44,679
nothing like that so they're they're

918
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:48,760
going to be OG or you know the cat piss

919
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:50,799
it's C gonna be cat piss or Betsy or

920
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:53,520
whatnot

921
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:57,839
um you tell us a little bit about some

922
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:59,079
of your main breeding males

923
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:03,400
uh the

924
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:06,000
males uh shoot um the chem dog is what

925
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:09,160
put me on the map is is what a lot of

926
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:13,039
people were using um to start seed

927
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:16,239
companies uh so chemp dog like I I don't

928
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:18,519
I don't even have these males anymore um

929
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:21,439
and then you know every year growing

930
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:23,960
Outdoors would pick out you know what I

931
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:26,318
thought was be cool males and whatnot

932
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:29,000
and you know I take them in Reverse them

933
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:30,838
play around and I and I grew Kush

934
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:35,639
cleaner was one of my major cash

935
00:41:30,838 --> 00:41:37,279
droppers for a long long time so uh it's

936
00:41:35,639 --> 00:41:38,920
it's similar to train wreck but

937
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:42,800
different it's just it's got that old

938
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:45,280
Amsterdam 90s Jack turps was that um the

939
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,160
cleaner or was it uh Jack cleaner that

940
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:50,000
you

941
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:51,639
used uh so it came the mail for that

942
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,440
came from

943
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:56,838
Lauren uh he was on canab Banner one of

944
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,039
those

945
00:41:56,838 --> 00:42:00,440
yeah um the mail came from that it was a

946
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:04,239
jack cleaner

947
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:06,318
2 and and uh I kept on pestering him for

948
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:08,519
cush cleaner seeds year after year after

949
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:09,759
year and he kep guy was so generous

950
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:11,559
every year he'd give them to me and then

951
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,440
one year he was like look here's the

952
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:18,358
[ __ ] mail just make your own seat

953
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:20,838
right that's awesome um so you know I

954
00:42:18,358 --> 00:42:22,759
made my own then uh what was cool you

955
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:24,719
know he ran out of seeds and I was able

956
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:26,880
to give him back thousands of seeds of

957
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:28,439
it you know

958
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,800
and he had crossed that mail to a bunch

959
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:33,639
of different things and I had grown them

960
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:36,000
all out in that kush the one with the SF

961
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:38,318
was by far the

962
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,599
winter I just I just kept growing that

963
00:42:38,318 --> 00:42:43,000
out and then every year I'd save the

964
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:46,400
males reverse them and see what was what

965
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,519
and now at this point we got Labs out so

966
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,119
now I can take after I revers the males

967
00:42:48,519 --> 00:42:52,358
and I can pinpoint the turps now I can

968
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:56,280
send them in the lab to get them tested

969
00:42:52,358 --> 00:42:58,838
for potency and whatnot um so the for

970
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:01,960
like the the cush cleaner mail that I

971
00:42:58,838 --> 00:43:04,159
use that to to dat has been my highest

972
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:06,960
testing mail and like when you're

973
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:09,399
testing males you know there's just like

974
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,880
the males turn out like um what's that

975
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:14,480
string green green spool Green Spoon or

976
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:17,280
something like that or just a grin spoon

977
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:21,240
quaz yeah where it's just like a stem

978
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:22,640
with little tiny no little bracks yeah

979
00:43:21,239 --> 00:43:24,598
yeah little brackets that that's how

980
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:29,000
when you reverse a male that's what they

981
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:30,160
look like so to get what's that can I

982
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,559
know people are going to be bugging the

983
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:32,879
[ __ ] out of me to ask you about this and

984
00:43:31,559 --> 00:43:34,920
I wanted to hit it when we first talked

985
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,440
about reversing Ms can you explain the

986
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:39,280
different structures that form and why

987
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,800
one not only not only because of the

988
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,519
florel why you don't smoke it but how

989
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,559
they actually form when you spray

990
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:45,960
because I think a lot of people are

991
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:48,800
picturing you spraying this and all of a

992
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:51,079
sudden you have a big buted female no no

993
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:54,318
not at all uh like I said it's it's like

994
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:56,640
the Green Spoon a little tiny seed

995
00:43:54,318 --> 00:44:00,279
bracket one on top of

996
00:43:56,639 --> 00:44:02,358
going up uh barely anything on there

997
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:05,400
some strains i' know I've noticed more

998
00:44:02,358 --> 00:44:08,039
like uh short Stout indicas will

999
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:11,358
actually produce a tiny tiny little bud

1000
00:44:08,039 --> 00:44:13,119
on top but it's still more of just that

1001
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:17,039
little node right or little bracket

1002
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:19,720
growing on um but not not not full buds

1003
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:22,759
or anything like that just enough to

1004
00:44:19,719 --> 00:44:26,039
where you can smell it um get a little

1005
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:28,160
stickiness on your finger um essentially

1006
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:31,000
doing it to make the mail produce more

1007
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:32,318
uh oils so you can get at least a few

1008
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:36,079
traits breeding

1009
00:44:32,318 --> 00:44:38,318
traits yeah yeah just uh just the turbs

1010
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:40,160
and then so when you're able to um with

1011
00:44:38,318 --> 00:44:42,558
the labs opening

1012
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:45,318
up uh you know and and then the mail

1013
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:48,240
will also seed itself right so it's got

1014
00:44:45,318 --> 00:44:52,199
seeds in it and whatnot um so your your

1015
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:56,000
lab samples aren't that great right so

1016
00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:58,598
like uh when I tested my cat piss males

1017
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:03,280
would be anywhere from 10 to 12% and

1018
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:06,200
that's it and then uh you know anywhere

1019
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:10,440
from my average at that time was like

1020
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:13,399
eight to 15% THC with testing males yeah

1021
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:15,599
and then um the Kush cleaner mail that I

1022
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:18,160
tested and I had reversed a ton of these

1023
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:19,720
Kush cleaner males every year just going

1024
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:22,239
through them reversing keeping the best

1025
00:45:19,719 --> 00:45:23,838
one playing with it next year goow out

1026
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:25,598
more cush cleaners and just repeating

1027
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:27,799
the same process over and over again for

1028
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:29,119
quite a few years and then finally I

1029
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:31,160
came with the one that I used for my

1030
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:32,318
cush cleaner experience and then that

1031
00:45:31,159 --> 00:45:35,920
one tested at

1032
00:45:32,318 --> 00:45:39,639
19% um the thing was yeah it's [ __ ]

1033
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:42,358
strong right and so when I made uh my

1034
00:45:39,639 --> 00:45:44,838
little Kush cleer experiment I pretty

1035
00:45:42,358 --> 00:45:47,960
much took everything that had really

1036
00:45:44,838 --> 00:45:50,279
good flavor to me but lacked

1037
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:52,559
potency and so I hit everything with

1038
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:55,319
that and then grew them all out that

1039
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:56,880
that that Jack tpps is super dominant

1040
00:45:55,318 --> 00:45:59,719
with stuff

1041
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:02,838
so like half the stuff was all Jack

1042
00:45:59,719 --> 00:46:05,118
which I just discarded and then the ones

1043
00:46:02,838 --> 00:46:07,199
that were the mom flavor carried

1044
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:10,800
through um those are the ones that I

1045
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:12,919
ended up releasing which which is um you

1046
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:15,839
know like like the forbidden fruit one

1047
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:19,838
is one of my favorites is I call it push

1048
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:22,318
andore and the the uh Kush cleaner mail

1049
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:25,159
totally add added potency to

1050
00:46:22,318 --> 00:46:28,279
it the the fenos that I have the

1051
00:46:25,159 --> 00:46:30,440
genotypes kept um

1052
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:32,880
it's green ones that you really want to

1053
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:35,880
go after it's those are more of the cush

1054
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:38,160
cleaner stoniness but it that forbidden

1055
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:40,280
fruit flavor where the purple ones are

1056
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:42,679
more leaning towards the forbidden fruit

1057
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:44,400
where it has no no power behind it at

1058
00:46:42,679 --> 00:46:47,318
all yeah

1059
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:49,200
um so actually that's where I am right

1060
00:46:47,318 --> 00:46:51,440
now is uh I'm digging through all these

1061
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:54,078
cush cleaner ones all these Kush cleaner

1062
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:57,039
crosses uh The Forbidden fruits I

1063
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:58,839
started making some feminine with them

1064
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:01,639
right not or the potions I started

1065
00:46:58,838 --> 00:47:04,480
making feminize with the green ones and

1066
00:47:01,639 --> 00:47:07,159
uh like these things they they taste so

1067
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,760
good I'll roll aie up thinking I'm just

1068
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:11,078
G to take one or two

1069
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:12,520
Puffs but it tastes so good I end up

1070
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:15,519
smoking the whole [ __ ] thing and it

1071
00:47:12,519 --> 00:47:19,639
ruins my day like yeah

1072
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:22,719
bet they taste so good they it's

1073
00:47:19,639 --> 00:47:27,719
dangerous can I ask what made you return

1074
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:27,719
to fim fim breeding

1075
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:35,160
um it's what people want and and it's uh

1076
00:47:32,199 --> 00:47:39,039
it's easy it's hell easy and and it

1077
00:47:35,159 --> 00:47:41,118
saves me a year of of uh breeding with

1078
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:43,880
males maybe even more than a year rather

1079
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:48,358
than having to pick out the

1080
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:49,760
males um then then reverse them so F

1081
00:47:48,358 --> 00:47:52,358
first you grow them out you pick out

1082
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:55,280
what you think is cool right so that

1083
00:47:52,358 --> 00:47:57,639
that's let's say h four months now you

1084
00:47:55,280 --> 00:48:00,480
got to grow them out reverse them

1085
00:47:57,639 --> 00:48:02,920
there's another four months right uh

1086
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,358
then you pollinate and grow and grow

1087
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:08,318
them out now you're looking at another

1088
00:48:04,358 --> 00:48:10,358
six to eight months right also I can

1089
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:12,039
just uh narrowing narrowing the the

1090
00:48:10,358 --> 00:48:13,759
traits I mean you're skipping years at

1091
00:48:12,039 --> 00:48:18,279
that

1092
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:21,280
point yeah yeah um so yeah without uh

1093
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:24,319
you know there's the plus side of fem

1094
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:27,160
are it it's it's hella easy and it's

1095
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:31,679
cutting out hell of time

1096
00:48:27,159 --> 00:48:34,440
um but the downside of it is is things

1097
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:37,879
are going to get bottleneck right uh

1098
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:40,000
there there's not going to be much

1099
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:41,880
um everything's like if everybody's

1100
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,519
making F of the same [ __ ] you're going

1101
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:48,039
to lose out on a bunch of different FL

1102
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:50,679
flavors so I'm still doing I'm still

1103
00:48:48,039 --> 00:48:53,079
doing both you know I'm still like uh

1104
00:48:50,679 --> 00:48:54,960
I'm digging I just dug through the

1105
00:48:53,079 --> 00:48:58,119
potions um and I'm going to turn those

1106
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:02,039
into f now and then my next project is

1107
00:48:58,119 --> 00:49:04,039
the uh the um blue not blue moonshine

1108
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:06,159
blue blueberry muffins are something

1109
00:49:04,039 --> 00:49:11,000
from Humble Seed

1110
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:12,798
Company H Seed delicious but again no no

1111
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,280
potency but some of these cush cleaner

1112
00:49:12,798 --> 00:49:17,480
ones has all the flavor and all the

1113
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:21,240
potency so like with those I'm going to

1114
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:24,318
start going F2 F3 F4 with them

1115
00:49:21,239 --> 00:49:27,798
um I'm hoping uh I'm working on trying

1116
00:49:24,318 --> 00:49:31,599
to get a legal spot small just do a

1117
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:35,280
10,000 10,000 square foot area

1118
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:38,359
greenhouse and uh do some real breeding

1119
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:40,000
so uh numbers is where it's at I want to

1120
00:49:38,358 --> 00:49:42,440
be able to pick through thousands of

1121
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,199
plants right there's something about

1122
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:46,079
being able to see thousands of your own

1123
00:49:44,199 --> 00:49:48,519
strain and be able to go through that

1124
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,839
huge population that really that really

1125
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:51,960
changes how you're able to look at your

1126
00:49:49,838 --> 00:49:54,039
own line too because like you pop 10 you

1127
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:55,679
might see seven be one way but you pop a

1128
00:49:54,039 --> 00:49:58,480
thousand you might not see that again

1129
00:49:55,679 --> 00:50:02,279
the same same distribution so for

1130
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:04,599
sure right so

1131
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:08,200
hopefully fingers cross everything works

1132
00:50:04,599 --> 00:50:10,318
out well I'm hoping by within a year uh

1133
00:50:08,199 --> 00:50:11,879
to at least get my foot in the door on

1134
00:50:10,318 --> 00:50:15,159
that who knows if I'll be up and running

1135
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:16,880
but that's that's the goal for now so we

1136
00:50:15,159 --> 00:50:20,639
have a question from high and Lonesome

1137
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:22,720
about I believe your 707 OG Kush mail

1138
00:50:20,639 --> 00:50:25,519
and he asked why did why did CH decide

1139
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:27,639
to use the sfv did he try to select for

1140
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:31,199
deal OG traits or for a seedline

1141
00:50:27,639 --> 00:50:33,879
representation of the mother

1142
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:37,439
um he was able to improve

1143
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:39,079
on I'm sorry I missed the last part oh

1144
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,760
just were there traits he felt he was

1145
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:44,920
able to improve

1146
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:47,480
on um so I picked the I I grew out all

1147
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:51,400
the ogs one year um every OG I could get

1148
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:54,639
all my hands on and that SF and my body

1149
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:57,920
chemistry uh just matched um by far my

1150
00:50:54,639 --> 00:50:59,159
favorite of the of all the ogs some of

1151
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:02,760
them yielded

1152
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:04,798
more um this one didn't yield as much

1153
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:07,079
but the flavor was there and and the

1154
00:51:04,798 --> 00:51:09,920
[ __ ] high for me is

1155
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:12,680
incredible so that was that was why I

1156
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:15,200
chose the sfv but um like know I've

1157
00:51:12,679 --> 00:51:16,838
worked the triangle I worked ghosts and

1158
00:51:15,199 --> 00:51:20,480
all and I

1159
00:51:16,838 --> 00:51:22,078
mean it would be hard for that I think

1160
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,280
it would be pretty hard for the average

1161
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:26,720
smoker if like you gave him a Bud of

1162
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:29,160
each one of those ogs for them to be

1163
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:33,279
able to tell a difference like splitting

1164
00:51:29,159 --> 00:51:36,159
hairs right yeah yeah exactly um but

1165
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:39,839
that that the the sfv for me was by far

1166
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:42,558
my fave and like I said it was it's

1167
00:51:39,838 --> 00:51:46,599
making the seed so I can smoke them or

1168
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:48,760
smoke that in 20 years or whatnot right

1169
00:51:46,599 --> 00:51:50,318
yeah I mean when you're breeding like

1170
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:52,640
and you actually smoke which a lot of

1171
00:51:50,318 --> 00:51:54,039
people don't like your own personal

1172
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:56,279
preference and brain chemistry comes

1173
00:51:54,039 --> 00:51:57,960
heavily into play and I can definitely

1174
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:01,440
uh appreciate that for

1175
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:05,559
sure right yeah so that SF was uh you

1176
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:09,960
know that's head stash for sure um I got

1177
00:52:05,559 --> 00:52:12,400
Betsy which is uh San Diego old Betsy

1178
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,880
which uh great can you tell the story a

1179
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,400
little bit about Betsy because I know

1180
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:17,160
that's one that's starting to build up a

1181
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,880
lot more popularity again thanks to you

1182
00:52:17,159 --> 00:52:22,759
and

1183
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:26,798
CSI oh [ __ ] uh so Betsy came from a guy

1184
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:29,079
bud bud online um he got it from

1185
00:52:26,798 --> 00:52:31,880
somebody down south brought it up to

1186
00:52:29,079 --> 00:52:33,599
humble and kept on saying Betsy Betsy

1187
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:36,160
and I remember thinking I was like dude

1188
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:39,280
what a [ __ ] lame

1189
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:43,679
name yeah right

1190
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:46,880
what yeah U I remember him bringing it

1191
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:50,000
one year and just these massive big buds

1192
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:51,640
uh fruity mangoe like a like a baby ate

1193
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:56,239
a [ __ ] ton of mangoes and then [ __ ] them

1194
00:52:51,639 --> 00:52:58,199
out um stinky funky stuff uh and I was

1195
00:52:56,239 --> 00:53:00,959
like okay this is cool you know it's

1196
00:52:58,199 --> 00:53:03,639
cool it's not OG but it's been still

1197
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:06,159
cool and then I grew it out one year

1198
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:09,480
outside and I was like whoa yeah like

1199
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:11,920
this is um it [ __ ] yields hella good

1200
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:14,400
it's hella easy to grow finished mid

1201
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:17,480
middle of October and it's one of those

1202
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:20,240
strains where you could uh vac seal it

1203
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:23,000
up put it put it aside for eight months

1204
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:26,279
come back open it up and it smells like

1205
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,719
you just harvested it um the flavor

1206
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:31,160
right

1207
00:53:27,719 --> 00:53:32,959
and uh it it was one of those strains

1208
00:53:31,159 --> 00:53:36,399
where it was either you loved it hated

1209
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:39,280
it um had people say both you know and

1210
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:43,160
then uh sometimes they got fed up with

1211
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:44,960
old Betsy you know I'd label the bags OB

1212
00:53:43,159 --> 00:53:48,679
and if they got fed up with it I would

1213
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:52,240
say oh I got organ blueberry now right

1214
00:53:48,679 --> 00:53:56,358
yeah all they love the or blueberry but

1215
00:53:52,239 --> 00:53:59,558
hate the old Betsy it's like right yeah

1216
00:53:56,358 --> 00:54:02,279
mango cush yeah the mango cush that's

1217
00:53:59,559 --> 00:54:04,880
right I think it was called the mango

1218
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:07,280
cush but yeah so so Betsy was it's a

1219
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:09,680
[ __ ] great cash Cropper it's it's

1220
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:12,760
awesome it finished middle of October

1221
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:14,879
for me so that was awesome too because I

1222
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:16,079
had to I had to split up my Harvesters

1223
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:20,920
to be able to fit everything in the

1224
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:24,119
dryer room so I made so pineapple tie

1225
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:26,798
another big plant nice pineapple but

1226
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:29,838
finished early right so that was like

1227
00:54:26,798 --> 00:54:31,599
first week of October was it no I got

1228
00:54:29,838 --> 00:54:34,440
them switched around Betsy was first

1229
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:36,599
week of October pineapple ties middle of

1230
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:38,798
October and then all the kushes and the

1231
00:54:36,599 --> 00:54:40,519
sours would be at the end of October so

1232
00:54:38,798 --> 00:54:41,920
P you had a tie that was finishing super

1233
00:54:40,519 --> 00:54:44,759
fast do you know the history on the

1234
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:47,318
pineapple tie at all no I don't not at

1235
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:49,640
all but um when I was find anybody who

1236
00:54:47,318 --> 00:54:52,159
does yeah it's it's it's been floating

1237
00:54:49,639 --> 00:54:54,000
around Northern California for a while

1238
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:56,159
um but when I was digging through the

1239
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,679
seeds like it's definitely got some kind

1240
00:54:56,159 --> 00:55:02,879
of haze in there because some like super

1241
00:54:58,679 --> 00:55:05,199
like nl5 Haze turfs would be popping up

1242
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:07,480
interesting yeah but but besides I have

1243
00:55:05,199 --> 00:55:10,358
no I have no idea who brought it what it

1244
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:13,079
is or anything like that have you ever

1245
00:55:10,358 --> 00:55:17,358
um had the C the Fort Collins cough

1246
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:19,000
Colorado cough yeah yeah cough dog [ __ ]

1247
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:21,199
how do you think that the cough compares

1248
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:25,798
to um the pineapple

1249
00:55:21,199 --> 00:55:27,960
tie purple C cough uh they grow they

1250
00:55:25,798 --> 00:55:29,400
grow the same they grow the same

1251
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:31,639
different Flor different finishing times

1252
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:33,480
and different flavors yeah different

1253
00:55:31,639 --> 00:55:37,239
different flavor and definitely finish

1254
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:39,719
different finishing time p is the

1255
00:55:37,239 --> 00:55:42,798
earliest sativ looking play I've ever

1256
00:55:39,719 --> 00:55:45,078
come across um

1257
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:48,358
Spears kind of grows like that metal

1258
00:55:45,079 --> 00:55:52,720
Haze actually but taller

1259
00:55:48,358 --> 00:55:54,480
uh yeah yeah the nl5 stuff it it it

1260
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:56,959
might have that or maybe some kind of

1261
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:59,639
other Haze in it but definitely that

1262
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:02,519
flavor pops up when I was

1263
00:55:59,639 --> 00:56:05,118
first like the first generation of seeds

1264
00:56:02,519 --> 00:56:06,280
that was coming out um but not anymore I

1265
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:07,720
don't think you'd be able to find

1266
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:10,240
anything like that in the seeds that I

1267
00:56:07,719 --> 00:56:12,399
have anymore it's just all pineapple

1268
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:15,239
Yeah question

1269
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:17,599
from question from booze on I think

1270
00:56:15,239 --> 00:56:19,759
comes back to the old bitsy uh his

1271
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:22,079
question was what are your thoughts on

1272
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:25,839
acclimatizing typically or historically

1273
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:27,798
outdoor varieties to suit indoor okay um

1274
00:56:25,838 --> 00:56:30,119
so in my

1275
00:56:27,798 --> 00:56:33,679
experience I've

1276
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:36,760
noticed not all strains that do great

1277
00:56:33,679 --> 00:56:40,038
indoor will do good

1278
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:41,319
outside um I'll give you an example the

1279
00:56:40,039 --> 00:56:45,720
uh humbled

1280
00:56:41,318 --> 00:56:48,599
snow humble snow is [ __ ] incredible

1281
00:56:45,719 --> 00:56:51,480
indoors it's white it's kind of got this

1282
00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:54,119
bubba skunkin flavor to it when it's

1283
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:55,480
done really good um but when you grow it

1284
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:58,680
outside

1285
00:56:55,480 --> 00:57:01,760
it's uh it's barely

1286
00:56:58,679 --> 00:57:06,118
Frosty um and kind of just has a watered

1287
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:09,359
down like wet animal or cardboard smell

1288
00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:12,160
to it nothing uh and I've noticed a lot

1289
00:57:09,358 --> 00:57:13,719
of strains like that where indoor some

1290
00:57:12,159 --> 00:57:17,679
things do really great but when you take

1291
00:57:13,719 --> 00:57:19,959
it outside not so great yeah um now

1292
00:57:17,679 --> 00:57:23,358
strains that do really good

1293
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:26,000
outside I've noticed do great inside as

1294
00:57:23,358 --> 00:57:28,838
well um

1295
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:32,079
so the opposite right uh so like Betsy

1296
00:57:28,838 --> 00:57:35,480
was originally made as a indoor

1297
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:37,440
commercial sh right like bll Rider and

1298
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:41,318
all that the St it's supposed to be the

1299
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:44,639
sister yeah like allegedly allegedly I

1300
00:57:41,318 --> 00:57:48,440
don't know I've heard so many stories um

1301
00:57:44,639 --> 00:57:51,038
the one that kind of sticks out to me is

1302
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:53,519
that somebody said White Widow super

1303
00:57:51,039 --> 00:57:55,559
skunk and when I was and when I was

1304
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:57,038
digging through the seeds I I I

1305
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:59,798
definitely had some White Widow looking

1306
00:57:57,039 --> 00:58:03,119
plants and smells coming out that would

1307
00:57:59,798 --> 00:58:05,318
be great white shark I think right white

1308
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:06,400
Wy that great white shark was one of

1309
00:58:05,318 --> 00:58:08,038
those other ones who were growing in

1310
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,358
Santa Cruz Back in the Day funny you

1311
00:58:08,039 --> 00:58:12,640

1312
00:58:10,358 --> 00:58:14,480
great white shark bro still that was

1313
00:58:12,639 --> 00:58:16,038

1314
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,880

1315
00:58:16,039 --> 00:58:19,599
one of those was flet she had one that

1316
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:23,358

1317
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:25,559
Frosty kind of a grapey flavor too oh

1320
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:30,240

1321

1341
00:59:25,639 --> 00:59:29,279
mobile one work he did and I've been

1342
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:32,240
trying to push him to do that for years

1343
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:34,079
so I'm super stoked about that we also

1344
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:35,719
have in part two there's going to be

1345
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:36,720
some good reveals from Shaw because

1346
00:59:35,719 --> 00:59:38,879
there were things that I thought were

1347
00:59:36,719 --> 00:59:42,879
common knowledge that aren't necessarily

1348
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:44,720
common knowledge and um he is the reason

1349
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,640
a lot of us have some of the most rare

1350
00:59:44,719 --> 00:59:48,879
clones we do and I think that'll be

1351
00:59:46,639 --> 00:59:50,118
really cool to bring that forward

1352
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:52,798
because a lot of people don't know that

1353
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:54,280
stuff and maybe um I don't know maybe

1354
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:55,480
you'll see why we hold him in such high

1355
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:59,200
esteem
