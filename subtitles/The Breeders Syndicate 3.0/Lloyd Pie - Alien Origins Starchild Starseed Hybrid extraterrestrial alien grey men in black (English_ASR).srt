12
00:02:54,878 --> 00:03:06,129
so

13
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:06,130
[Music]

14
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:10,079
all right

15
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,800
we're going to kick off now with the

16
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,640
first part of it which is human origins

17
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,599
and we'll start with the fact that the

18
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:19,279
bible says that in the beginning

19
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:20,878
in the beginning you've all heard this

20
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,120
was the word

21
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:25,280
but in order to explain everything that

22
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,080
followed after that the word would have

23
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,439
to be something on the order of this

24
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,239
as you can see

25
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:35,120
supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

26
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:38,719
it had to be a heck of a word to cover

27
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,439
all the ascension the sense of intuition

28
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:43,680
over time the creationists

29
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:45,199
changed it they expanded a little bit to

30
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,959
three words

31
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,560
god did it

32
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,519
god did everything

33
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,080
and that's all you needed for an answer

34
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,879
why does it rain god did it

35
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,480
i did

36
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:59,840
everything god did

37
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:02,238
and that worked for a couple thousand

38
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,959
thousand years that was all you needed

39
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,599
but then 145 years ago a new group of

40
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,080
people came on the scene the darkness

41
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:12,479
with what they thought was a better

42
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,200
more rational explanation which is that

43
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:17,918
nature did delete god

44
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:19,759
that nature and nature only

45
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,560
did it it was a line drawn down the

46
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,639
middle

47
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,478
god here nature here

48
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,840
and no mix

49
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:27,758
no next

50
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:31,359
145 years

51
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:33,520
and then the creationists tried an end

52
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,639
run by bringing in a group of much

53
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:38,399
smarter individuals much better educated

54
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,720
than the original ones and they are

55
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:43,359
called intelligent designers

56
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,199
intelligent designer but still basically

57
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,720
god is at the bottom of their theory as

58
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,639
well

59
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,040
everything is so complex it couldn't

60
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,360
have happened by accident

61
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,280
therefore god didn't do it

62
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,439
only recently he has a

63
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:58,959
much smaller group of individuals

64
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:01,360
started putting forth a theory called

65
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:04,000
intervention and i'm one of those

66
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,919
i'm an interventionist and what we say

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,120
is that it wasn't a god with a capital g

68
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:12,399
an anthropomorphic god it was a group of

69
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,199
gods

70
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:17,120
multiple people multiple beings

71
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,120
small g

72
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,038
gods and that

73
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,959
they that's our mantra they did it

74
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:26,079
my god did it

75
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,399
they did it

76
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:30,399
and that accounts for everything

77
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:31,918
in its own way that's come to be on the

78
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,638
earth and that's what i'm going to be

79
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:36,879
showing you here basically tonight in my

80
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,038
beginning next slide please in my

81
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,240
beginning okay am i beginning to book

82
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:43,038
everything you know is wrong which is

83
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,079
not here you can't you can't get it we

84
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:48,240
tried to ship it here and it didn't work

85
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:51,599
out with the publisher a lot of problems

86
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,439
australia the long time etc you will be

87
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,879
able eventually if you wanted to get it

88
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:57,600
through duncan road's nexus magazine

89
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:59,519
so

90
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,520
if you want keep in mind

91
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:02,719
if you want to order it from the states

92
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:04,799
direct

93
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,319
go through barnes and noble

94
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,560
the barnes noble has the best shipping

95
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,560
work wwwbn.com

96
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,479
barnes noble all right what i'm trying

97
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,400
to show in the cover here is the

98
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:18,719
interventionist point of view boiled

99
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:22,079
down that the

100
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,960
gods multiple gods small g handed the

101
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:27,038
spark of human life to the primitives

102
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:28,478
that were on the earth at the time

103
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:29,839
by means of

104
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:30,879
intervention

105
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:33,038
via

106
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:35,279
genetic engineering which is symbolized

107
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:36,959
by a test tube

108
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:39,519
that is the theory that we are

109
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:41,359
genetically and genetically engineered

110
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:43,918
species product and we'll talk about

111
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,600
those samples by the next slide

112
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:47,279
in the beginning

113
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,720
in the beginning what every one of these

114
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:50,399
is apparently going to be cut off at the

115
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,800
top and i'm sorry for that i don't know

116
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:55,918
how to fix this but in the beginning

117
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,759
what you have is the cloud so in

118
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:00,000
the bible's beginning was the word in my

119
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,680
beginning was the book and now in the

120
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,478
beginning was that the cloud of dust and

121
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,319
gas

122
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:07,519
swirling around in over

123
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:10,240
about 10 billion years down to about 4.5

124
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:12,000
billion years ago where the solar system

125
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,720
took the shape basically that we know

126
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,680
now and the earth was basically

127
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,160
coalesced out of the cloud as the

128
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,280
proto-earth next slide and then that

129
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,160
proto-earth for 4.5 to 3.5 billion years

130
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:26,959
ago

131
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,919
the proto-earth which is deceiving mass

132
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:33,598
of magma being bombarded by asteroids

133
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:36,399
and meteorites it was just an impossible

134
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:38,319
place to live as you can see excellent

135
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:41,038
then as it began to cool off over time

136
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,840
from 3.5 to around 2.5 the next billion

137
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:44,639
years

138
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:46,719
and we have cooling enough to where you

139
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,478
have mississippi plan beginning to show

140
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,560
that's still supposed to be multilateral

141
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:53,279
but at least the bombardment of

142
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,680
meteorites and all this stuff now

143
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:59,038
there's no one would have thought at one

144
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,280
time that life could have begun on earth

145
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:03,598
at a time like this

146
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:05,519
so the theory was that life didn't begin

147
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:08,399
until around 2 billion years ago when it

148
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:09,359
was cooled off enough to have water at

149
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:11,439
least

150
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,759
and that inorganic

151
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:15,918
molecules were somehow swirled together

152
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,038
and became a living thing nobody quite

153
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:19,598
understood

154
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:21,439
but since nature was at the core of

155
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:23,038
everything according to the darkness it

156
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:25,199
had to happen

157
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:27,279
it just had to happen they couldn't

158
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,199
quite figure it out didn't matter we'll

159
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:31,758
figure it out we kept assuring everybody

160
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,759
we'll figure it out and then about 30

161
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,519
years ago that was what they taught us

162
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:37,439
what all you you were taught which kids

163
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,879
being taught today your grandkids can

164
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,800
talk

165
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:42,320
but about 30 years ago they found out

166
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,319
that in fact

167
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,560
life had already come to earth around 4

168
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,278
billion years ago

169
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:50,559
back when it was seething magma you saw

170
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,399
what it looked like and everyone pretty

171
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:55,838
much agrees that's what it was this is

172
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:57,120
what came prokaryotic bacteria now if

173
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,120
the real

174
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,959
beginning of life recipient life had

175
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,320
really started the way they say it would

176
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,838
have been something extremely simple

177
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,120
kind of like a virus it would have been

178
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,440
about the size of one of these little

179
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,560
spots in here like this

180
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,839
instead is this really large complex

181
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:16,799
kind of one single cell bacteria

182
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,560
called prokaryotic bacteria now

183
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,039
the one thing that distinguishes it is

184
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:23,199
though it has a number of dna strands it

185
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:25,919
doesn't have a nucleus

186
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,240
the dna is not held within a nucleus it

187
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:31,439
kind of floats free and loose that's

188
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,600
what distinguishes prokaryotic bacteria

189
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,480
and it came at about four billion years

190
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,240
ago only about a half a billion years

191
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,920
from when the earth was first beginning

192
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,600
to coalesce out

193
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:44,159
so it's

194
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,800
extremely unlikely that in fact

195
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,879
impossible that life formed on earth it

196
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:51,359
came here whole and complete

197
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:54,240
why because it didn't come in only one

198
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,560
form there are two types of prokaryotic

199
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,839
bacteria the archaea and the true

200
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:59,199
bacteria

201
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:03,440
two types

202
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:06,000
distinct different types

203
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,000
so it absolutely is for certain that

204
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,519
life came here now the question really

205
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,519
is

206
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,278
how did it get here was it directed here

207
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,959
was it sent here was it delivered here

208
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:18,159
on purpose or did it just accidentally

209
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:20,319
show up somehow

210
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:23,759
is the question that has to be answered

211
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,120
now for the prokaryotic bacteria

212
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:27,600
the thing you need to keep in mind about

213
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,360
it is it is indestructible

214
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,480
indestructible that's what's so cool

215
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,000
about it

216
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,079
the earth got what it needed exactly

217
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,200
when it needed it when it was just

218
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:39,359
beginning

219
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,040
if you want to turn a planet into

220
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,278
something that can support higher life

221
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:44,799
forms you've got to give it something

222
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:48,240
that will turn

223
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:50,000
the environment and turn oxygen in loose

224
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,639
in the atmosphere

225
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,480
in the water to tie up the free iron to

226
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:58,799
turn iron into rust iron oxide and then

227
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,759
have an excess of oxygen so that higher

228
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:03,519
life forms can live on that place

229
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,360
exactly what the earth needed which in

230
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,720
these creatures right here to do that

231
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,440
that got early on two forms all of them

232
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:15,040
indestructible early on

233
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:17,040
pretty neat what an amazing coincidence

234
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:19,360
amazing coincidence

235
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:20,958
okay and two billion years ago

236
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,800
remember we've gone now two billion

237
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:24,559
years approximately four billion years

238
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:26,879
with the procare two billion years of

239
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:29,199
the prokaryotes from four billion years

240
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:31,200
just those two kinds and then suddenly

241
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,680
around two billion years ago these

242
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,360
things appear out of nowhere just like

243
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:38,078
the prokaryotes did

244
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,519
out of nowhere come the eukaryotes

245
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:41,838
strata with that and suddenly you have

246
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,839
to travel

247
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,159
and they're extremely complicated

248
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,639
hundreds to thousands of times larger

249
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:50,879
than the prokaryotes with a nucleus

250
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:54,319
surrounding many many many more strands

251
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:57,679
of dna this is a sophisticated yet still

252
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:00,000
one cell creature pumping out much more

253
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:01,599
oxygen much more efficiently but they

254
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,958
couldn't come any sooner because the

255
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,360
earth wasn't

256
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:07,919
prepared these are fragile these are not

257
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,399
indestructible these are destructive

258
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:12,479
so they couldn't come until

259
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,799
the earth had been fixed

260
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,000
to a certain extent by the prokaryotes

261
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:20,399
two billion years of prokaryotic

262
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,919
activity allowed these to appear and

263
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,480
when they do appear

264
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:26,879
the darkness went with the prokaryotes

265
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,039
they can argue that well they came from

266
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,399
you know maybe space from a meteorite or

267
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:32,000
something like that

268
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,078
but the

269
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,879
eukaryotes have to be explained in

270
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:38,239
practical terms and what's the only way

271
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:40,720
that could have happened if you don't

272
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:44,000
see any transition from prokaryotes to

273
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,399
eukaryotes i mean from no nucleus to a

274
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,759
nucleus from none of this to all of this

275
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,240
how did it happen

276
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:53,039
what they say is this yet

277
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,278
that after a couple of billion years of

278
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:58,639
living side by side

279
00:12:55,278 --> 00:13:01,600
the larger prokaryotes suddenly decide

280
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:04,000
to eat some of the smaller prokaryotes

281
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,079
and instead of becoming food the smaller

282
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,759
prokaryotes change their physical

283
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:09,519
structure into all these different

284
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:11,838
things including the nucleus of the

285
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:15,360
eukaryotes

286
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:16,240
that magically somehow

287
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,839
they

288
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,680
they cannibalized each other and it

289
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,040
worked and a new much more sophisticated

290
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:24,638
living thing

291
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:26,639
came to be

292
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,759
and for as absurd as it sounds it's

293
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:32,399
gospel among biologists it's ridiculous

294
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:34,480
but it is acceptable next

295
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,000
now this is how this is how they say it

296
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,120
happened

297
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,639
these

298
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,639
turned into all this

299
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:45,679
it didn't

300
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,000
it's ridiculous excellent

301
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:50,799
after another billion and a half years

302
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,399
from two billion years to around 560

303
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:55,039
million years ago

304
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,320
just round it up to 500 million

305
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:57,919
give or take

306
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,560
another billion and a half with the

307
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:02,879
prokaryotes and the eukaryotes pumping

308
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:05,119
oxygen into the atmosphere tying up the

309
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:07,439
iron making iron oxide and having an

310
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,799
excess of oxygen suddenly

311
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,760
out of nowhere

312
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:13,919
you have the seas filled with creatures

313
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:17,198
this is called a cambrian explosion and

314
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:20,000
it's exactly what it was thousands of

315
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:22,000
species of animals and plants none of

316
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,399
them looking anything like anything we

317
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,919
have on earth today except the horseshoe

318
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,600
crab that's the only thing that's left

319
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:30,399
and it looks kind of like

320
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,839
maybe even the descendant of this one

321
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,600
other than that

322
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,519
they don't look like anything we have

323
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,399
today

324
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,560
and yet it came out of nowhere within

325
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,519
about a five million year period which

326
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:46,000
is an idling compared to of billions of

327
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,000
years that have come preceding that

328
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,120
the cambrian explosion

329
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,198
there it all is all 26 animal phylum

330
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,320
animal follow that we have today

331
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:56,159
came

332
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,879
at the same time

333
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:01,600
again overnight

334
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:04,799
no catastrophe nothing leading into it

335
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,959
it just came when it came happy and it

336
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:08,879
was big

337
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,399
this is the timeline to show you what

338
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:12,559
i've been telling you

339
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,240
the beginnings at 4.5

340
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:16,479
and then you have the bombardment and

341
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,159
there are the prokaryotes around 4

342
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,800
billion years ago while the

343
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:24,480
bombardment's still going on prokaryotes

344
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:25,919
prokaryotes prokaryotes down here 2

345
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,480
billion years ago and then the

346
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:30,639
eukaryotes joined them and noticed that

347
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,560
they're still the same today as they

348
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,639
were when they started out no

349
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:37,278
appreciable companies no

350
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,720
darwinian evolution at all it's the same

351
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:40,639
you would think that the first and the

352
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,079
simplest would have had a heck of a lot

353
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,079
we told you

354
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:45,679
but they don't seem to know

355
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:46,879
they seem to breathe as true today as

356
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:48,638
they did then

357
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,958
anyway so the eukaryotes and the

358
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,799
prokaryotes continue on and right here

359
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:55,758
in this little blink right here that

360
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:57,919
little window is the five to ten million

361
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,600
years when the camera explosion occurred

362
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:02,559
and then after that came the full

363
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,560
panoply of complex life as we know it in

364
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:06,399
only the last five

365
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:09,599
point five built half a billion years

366
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,639
500 million years so it's a small part

367
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,560
of what

368
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,360
came before

369
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:16,799
all of complex life as we know

370
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,278
and how didn't happen

371
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:20,639
well next level what the darwinians

372
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,519
tell us is that this is the way it

373
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,278
happened

374
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,839
it went from each survived reproduce

375
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:29,519
it's about reproduce to this guy who can

376
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,519
stand here and say what's it all about

377
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:34,399
that it was the fish became amphibians

378
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:36,638
amphibians became reptiles reptiles

379
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,120
become mammals and birds and mammals

380
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:42,320
become us

381
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,440
macro evolutionary two parts to this two

382
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,560
parts

383
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:49,920
macro evolution and micro revolution

384
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:53,039
this is macro evolution this is species

385
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:54,799
into species into species into species

386
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:58,319
and this is the the cornerstone of

387
00:16:54,799 --> 00:17:00,958
darwinian evolution is macro evolution

388
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,278
and darwin himself said

389
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:06,958
i can see at this point in time when i'm

390
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:10,480
doing this in the late middle late 1800s

391
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:12,400
1869 when he published his book

392
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,919
excuse me 1859

393
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:18,319
that we are short of transitional

394
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,600
species in the fossil record but now

395
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:21,759
that we know

396
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:23,279
to look we're going to find the species

397
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:25,279
that are going to exist in the cracks

398
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:28,639
here that are going to show

399
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:30,480
a transition here from one to another

400
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,640
the missing links they're going to be

401
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,279
found darlin said if they are not it

402
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:38,240
will be clear that my theory is wrong

403
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:41,279
well they've been looking now for 145

404
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:45,200
years and they still don't have

405
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:47,440
one single solitary unambiguous

406
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,279
transitioned from one species to another

407
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,600
and the problem is there should be

408
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:53,678
hundreds literally hundreds of them

409
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:55,599
now what they argue is that well we

410
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,759
don't have a complete fossil record yet

411
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:59,678
you can't hold us to account on this

412
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:02,960
because the fossil record is not

413
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:05,038
complete that is true it isn't complete

414
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,240
but what they what the reality of it is

415
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:09,759
is whole sheets of it are completed

416
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,519
you'll have whole sheets that are

417
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:13,200
complete and then you have sections that

418
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:14,960
aren't complete then you'll have more

419
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,120
sections that are complete and you'll

420
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,798
have sections that aren't complete

421
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:20,639
and so they're hiding behind the fact

422
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:21,599
that the fossil record isn't completely

423
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,840
filled in

424
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:26,240
but the truth of it is within the areas

425
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:28,079
the long sheets the long periods of time

426
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,279
that are complete there are no

427
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:33,439
transitional species so they know the

428
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:34,879
theory is wrong and they've known it for

429
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,558
quite some time

430
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,240
but they can't acknowledge that it's

431
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:40,160
wrong because the creationists are

432
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,000
standing right there

433
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,759
knocking on the door saying well if you

434
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,839
don't know what's going on we want our

435
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:48,240
theory to be taught in schools

436
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:50,240
i don't want that the darwinists don't

437
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,919
want that i don't blame them the

438
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,480
creationist point of view should be kept

439
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,720
in churches where it belongs

440
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,759
if they weren't so belligerent about

441
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,440
that

442
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:01,679
the darwinists could acknowledge and

443
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,919
admit what they don't know and we have a

444
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,798
much better chance of getting to the

445
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:09,038
truth of what really happened

446
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:10,879
but as long as the situation as it is as

447
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:12,640
it is with the creationists we're going

448
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,080
to be stuck with the darwinists

449
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,520
pretending

450
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:17,599
that somehow

451
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:19,519
darwinian evolution and the transitional

452
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:20,558
species are going to be found and

453
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:21,839
they're not

454
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:24,079
next slide

455
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:27,038
all right this is microevolution

456
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:29,038
this is indeed a real point of fact in

457
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:31,519
the world around us these are hawaiian

458
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:34,480
honey creepers darwin saw this

459
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:37,519
phenomenon of creatures adapting

460
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,360
themselves in part on the galapagos he

461
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:41,279
saw it with darwin's finches he saw the

462
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:44,000
tortoises he saw it with other things

463
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:47,119
and what he said was okay if we can see

464
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,038
changes in parts as clearly as this

465
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:51,199
we can extrapolate

466
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:53,919
we can assume

467
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,279
that changes in whole bodies are not out

468
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,720
of the question and in fact we're

469
00:19:55,279 --> 00:20:01,200
logical and he's right it is logical

470
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,519
to assume that but the problem is it

471
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,720
doesn't work in reality the evidence is

472
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:08,879
just not there there is no macro

473
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,519
evolutionary his micro evolution is

474
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,120
clear he saw it he saw it first and

475
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:16,000
documented it

476
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:17,439
but there is no to this day true macro

477
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,480
evolution

478
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,919
it doesn't extend past the parts

479
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,000
the honey creepers still the honey

480
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,600
creeper still reproduces like a honey

481
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,558
creature still just like underground

482
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:30,480
nissan all these are hungry

483
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:32,639
that's the key

484
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,440
micro evolution yes macro evolution that

485
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,400
looks like this is the macro evolution

486
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,720
of man supposedly we start out around 4

487
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,759
million years ago maybe 5 million years

488
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:46,079
ago as a couple as a pair of upright

489
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:48,798
walking chimps and upright walking

490
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:51,119
gorillas known as the australopithecines

491
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:54,079
and they go from around 4 million years

492
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:57,038
ago 9 billion now 4 million to around 2

493
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:59,279
million years ago when a new type of

494
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:01,759
being appears and these are called the

495
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:04,079
early homos the early men

496
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:05,599
we met homo erectus off me homo villa

497
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:07,839
sono erectus

498
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:10,879
down to neanderthal and then suddenly

499
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:12,720
around 120 000 years ago you have a new

500
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,799
thing that is again as completely

501
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,480
different as this one is from this one

502
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:20,158
from this one to this one

503
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:23,440
pro magnet pro magnum around 120 000

504
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:25,919
years ago in the fossil record

505
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,679
and what what they're trying to tell you

506
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,400
make us they want us all to believe that

507
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:34,000
this is somehow a transition when in

508
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:36,400
fact at each of these stages there is a

509
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,798
transformation

510
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,200
whole and complete these are upright

511
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:43,599
walking chimps and gorillas these are

512
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,120
more man-like but they are still very

513
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:48,879
unhuman-like

514
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:50,719
these are your true humans only 120 000

515
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,200
years ago in the fossil record so you go

516
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,839
from 4 million here for these guys down

517
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:59,840
to 2 million of these and then down to

518
00:21:55,839 --> 00:22:02,079
120 000 for the grown magnets keep that

519
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:04,399
in mind next slide

520
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:06,158
now walking is the key

521
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,640
go back if you would please know we let

522
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,880
me stress them walking is the key to

523
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,200
what makes these and these

524
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,760
be considered pre-humans

525
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,679
walking walking is the key

526
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:19,679
and what walking is according to

527
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,519
darkness is the sure

528
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,919
sign that

529
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:26,720
something is on the way to learning to

530
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:29,038
be a human they say that this has this

531
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,038
is a process of learning it starts with

532
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:32,879
walking they used to say the brain was

533
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:34,640
first and everything followed that until

534
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,799
they found these guys at times they had

535
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,960
brains like gems and gorillas and they

536
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:41,759
said all right well then it was walking

537
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,840
walking came first not tool use not

538
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:46,319
brains walking

539
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:48,639
so walking is the key

540
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:51,119
walking is very important now the thing

541
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:54,559
is do you really learn to walk

542
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:57,119
can you go from being a quadruped

543
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:59,119
down on all fours to being upright on

544
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:01,519
all twos can you

545
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:05,038
biologically change your body to do that

546
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:06,400
by sheer adaptation yes you could

547
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:08,400
and here's how you have to do it and

548
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,720
here is the theory as it's put forth

549
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,519
believed and preached as gospel

550
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,798
that

551
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:19,038
as the forests of africa began to shrink

552
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:21,599
some group of quadrupeds decided to get

553
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:23,359
out of the forest move out onto the

554
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:25,359
savannahs

555
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:28,719
out on the savannas

556
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:30,879
and begin to stand upright more and more

557
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,480
and more and more first first just stand

558
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,159
up to look over the grass and then go

559
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,400
back down stand up to look over the

560
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,799
grass for for lions and tigers and

561
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,360
whatever and do that

562
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:43,918
over and over and over again for

563
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:45,678
hundreds and thousands of years and in

564
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,278
that process as they're standing up to

565
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:50,080
look over the grass of the predators

566
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:52,640
that are coming to eat them they end up

567
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:54,960
at the end of those thousands of years

568
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,720
standing upright like us becoming

569
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,200
upright walking creatures

570
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,720
now this is again theory as it's taught

571
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,919
and as it's believed and this is

572
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,558
preached

573
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:07,520
the problem is how do you get through

574
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:09,359
thousands of generations when as soon as

575
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:12,079
you come out of those trees and walk out

576
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:14,319
on the savannah you are nothing but a

577
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:16,798
walking snack treat

578
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:19,759
you have no fans you have no claws you

579
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:23,519
have no tough skin or anything you're

580
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:26,720
just a big bag of food moving to the big

581
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:28,960
cats out on the savannah

582
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,440
it requires that you have generation

583
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,240
after generation doing this

584
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,480
altering their their bodies as they move

585
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,400
as they learn to stand upright

586
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,480
couldn't happen you can't get from the

587
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,240
beginning to the end

588
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,919
because everything in between has been

589
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,240
eaten by the big cats before they could

590
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,240
reproduce

591
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,240
off

592
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,798
you understand it couldn't happen and

593
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,558
yet that is what they t because

594
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:56,558
from their point of view it can't happen

595
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:58,319
any other way

596
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:00,798
that has to be the way it happened and

597
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:02,720
yet common sense tells anybody that it

598
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:04,798
could

599
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,798
so where do these walking creatures come

600
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:08,798
from it's clear that they're walking we

601
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:11,599
have the tracks at leotoly of 3.2

602
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:14,400
million years ago perfectly upright

603
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:16,240
and we have lucy at 3.5 million years

604
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,320
ago

605
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,599
hips and everything pelvis arranged to

606
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:21,439
walk upright

607
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:23,119
so we know they're walking upright

608
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,640
how if they didn't if they couldn't

609
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:26,959
learn it in the way that we just

610
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,799
described we just talked about

611
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,960
where'd it come from

612
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:34,000
perfect answer never talked about

613
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,400
perfect answer next slide the myosin

614
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,960
and my scene here goes from around 25

615
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,640
million years ago out here to around 5

616
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,400
million years ago right here into the

617
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,520
plastic

618
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:48,240
in those 20 million years

619
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:50,480
you have two dozen

620
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,400
two dozen

621
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,679
genera of

622
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,759
apes

623
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:59,840
apes not monkeys monkeys are from 35

624
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:01,440
million years to 25 million years you

625
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:03,599
have nothing but monkeys so they've been

626
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,519
around about 10 million years but when

627
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:07,359
the apes when the myosin apes hit the

628
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:08,639
scene hit the fossil record they

629
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:11,599
dominate

630
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:15,120
very few monkeys lots of eggs

631
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:16,558
lots of eggs and guess what

632
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:17,918
a bunch of them now we're talking

633
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:19,440
tailless

634
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,840
apes

635
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,080
50 different species

636
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:26,000
a couple of dozen genera we're talking a

637
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:28,079
lot of different kinds we're talking

638
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
from small ones

639
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:32,480
given size

640
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,480
up to man sized

641
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,759
up to giant size touch that roof with

642
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:40,880
their heads gigantopithecus

643
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:43,359
every size ape you can imagine

644
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,360
and guess what else out of those 50

645
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:49,199
different species

646
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:50,959
24 generic have come only four survivors

647
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,200
on four survivors

648
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,798
chimpanzees gorillas give them some

649
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,120
orangutans

650
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:58,240
what happened to the rest of them

651
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:00,319
what happened

652
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,720
well they say

653
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:04,879
science tells us that all of these all

654
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,720
of these were quadrupeds down on all

655
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,919
fours because the only four that came

656
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,360
out

657
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:14,159
that they acknowledge are water pads

658
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:16,240
but you have the real problem next slide

659
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,000
with the short arm base

660
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,399
a bunch of them like procrastinate for

661
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,240
example have arms that are equal in

662
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:24,398
length to their legs

663
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,798
and so they try to say that well

664
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:28,319
they must walk like this

665
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:30,558
because

666
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:33,038
if you're a quadruped a true quadruped

667
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:35,359
your arms have to be longer than your

668
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:37,359
legs for you to walk comfortably for you

669
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:39,599
to locomotive it's not walking for you

670
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:43,038
to lock them up comfortably your arms

671
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:44,158
have to be longer than your legs

672
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:47,119
so

673
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,720
keep in mind our arms are shorter

674
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:51,278
than our legs

675
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,278
significantly shorter but the myosin

676
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:55,119
apes have arms that are equal to the

677
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:57,200
length of their legs approximately which

678
00:27:55,119 --> 00:27:59,038
means that their arms would dangle down

679
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,038
around their knees if they can walk

680
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:03,679
upright

681
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:05,278
these are the short-rapes are a real

682
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:09,120
embarrassment and this is why you don't

683
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:11,278
hear much out of the magazine

684
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:13,359
because they don't want to imply that

685
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:15,038
they were walking

686
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:16,879
but they were

687
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:18,879
there's no other way for a short armed

688
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:22,080
aid to locomote comfortably

689
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,080
except on two feet

690
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:27,599
so it's very very fair to assume that

691
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:30,480
those short-armed ioc names were walking

692
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:32,319
upright and that what we find in the

693
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,480
fossil record at

694
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:36,319
four and five and now they're arguing

695
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,480
six million years ago walking upright

696
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:40,240
versus nothing more than five teenagers

697
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,919
walking right out of the myocene doing

698
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,038
what they've always done the short arm

699
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:47,759
base walking upright next slide

700
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:50,398
so what they try to do with three humans

701
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:52,640
to make you think

702
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:54,319
to to brainwash you into believing these

703
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,240
things really were

704
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:58,879
pre-human

705
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:02,240
is that they put these butt ugly heads

706
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:04,399
on human bodies human looking bodies

707
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:08,960
and you come to believe

708
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:08,959
you come to think that that's how it was

709
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:13,199
when in fact there's nothing at all

710
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:14,720
human about these bodies of the

711
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,880
pre-humans

712
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,919
bones are different bones are thicker

713
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:23,120
heavier arms are longer

714
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:26,320
nothing about it's the same next level

715
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:27,839
and here we see the early now again over

716
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:30,079
here to the left with this thing's given

717
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:33,119
out on me of the australopithecines

718
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:34,558
isn't working at all

719
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:36,959
so let me just give it up just use my

720
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:39,200
hand since i'm so close anyway these are

721
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,558
the australopithecines would be here

722
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:45,519
this is homomobilism erectus neanderthal

723
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:48,319
and then over here

724
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:52,240
pro-magnum right in there now all of

725
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:53,519
these are indeed transitional forms tran

726
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,640
transition

727
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:58,558
this is a transformation from these

728
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,200
to this just the same way that you have

729
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:02,398
a transformation here from the

730
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:04,399
australopithecines to here

731
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:06,079
transformation and then you have

732
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:07,678
basically the brain just getting bigger

733
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:09,918
that's basically it the brains are just

734
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:13,120
getting bigger but with the skulls

735
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:15,200
themselves the bones are very heavy

736
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:17,839
compared to ours very thick compared to

737
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,399
ours the brow ridges are very heavy and

738
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:22,879
thick compared to hours the eyes are big

739
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:25,199
brown night vision eyes you guys like

740
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,520
this you've got night vision noses look

741
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,880
how big and wide the noses are and these

742
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:31,679
little passages

743
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,919
big wide flat noses you got a mouth

744
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,519
sticking off the face these teeth are

745
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,559
jutting out it's hard to see this but

746
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:38,240
they do

747
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:39,839
they have no chance at the jaws from

748
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,200
here you see they have no chance to just

749
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:44,639
slant back

750
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:48,080
this guy pro magnum comes from all this

751
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,200
with exactly the opposite in every way

752
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:52,240
he's got

753
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:55,120
a forehead they all lack a forehead they

754
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:58,319
just go back from the eyebrows

755
00:30:55,119 --> 00:31:01,278
very reduced brow ridges very reduced

756
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:03,519
eye sockets and poor night vision a nose

757
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:07,119
pinched up off the face

758
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:08,558
a mouth squashed back in flat and chin

759
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:10,398
sticking out

760
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:12,240
exactly the opposite

761
00:31:10,398 --> 00:31:13,599
and yet somehow that's supposed to be a

762
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,960
transition that you go from this one

763
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:16,879
looking pretty much the same this is

764
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,558
missing and suddenly

765
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,919
totally different and that's a

766
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:22,558
transition

767
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,880
that is somehow a natural flow of events

768
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:25,918
no even the darwinists acknowledge that

769
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,760
can't be

770
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,759
so they say all right well yeah we

771
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:31,839
acknowledge that real problem we're

772
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:33,679
going to plug that hole with a missing

773
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:35,599
link that's going to go in there

774
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:37,120
and show some transition

775
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:38,639
well the problem is

776
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:40,079
anybody that knows anything they need a

777
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:43,038
couple of dozen

778
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:45,038
to transition from this to this you need

779
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:47,679
a couple of dozen

780
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:49,679
species in there to show that they don't

781
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:52,080
have a fingerling

782
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,960
there is no missing link

783
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:56,079
in the human chain never has been never

784
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,960
going to be

785
00:31:56,079 --> 00:32:01,839
there is no missing link it's just a

786
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,159
plug and a huge gaping hole

787
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:06,079
in darwinian theory because again

788
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:09,360
they're trying to keep the creationists

789
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:11,278
at bay as long as possible

790
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:12,240
as long as possible and they'll do

791
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:14,720
anything

792
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,679
say anything pull any absurdity out of

793
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,200
the hat to keep the charade alive

794
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,120
that's how it works

795
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,200
okay well if everything i'm telling you

796
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:26,239
is true and these guys are not

797
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,919
pre-humans as we're told what are they

798
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,519
if they're they're in the fossil record

799
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:32,559
they lasted for millions of years and

800
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:34,480
they walked up right what are they

801
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:36,319
they are hominoids

802
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,159
hominoids

803
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:40,960
hominoids of human-like creatures that

804
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:43,360
are not really human homologous what are

805
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,880
hominoids next slide you have here we

806
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:47,439
have that they are they're all over the

807
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,760
world every continent except antarctica

808
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,880
bigfoot sasquatch

809
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:52,079
yowie

810
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,080
almas

811
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:56,480
they have names wherever they are in the

812
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:58,240
world they are everywhere in the world

813
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:01,120
there are deep forests

814
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:03,038
jungles and swamps and they live in the

815
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:05,839
part of the world parts of the world

816
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:09,038
that we don't live in

817
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:12,079
now we think that we are everywhere that

818
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:13,599
we know everything about our planet that

819
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:16,480
there's no place that we don't really

820
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:19,278
know about that we have been on

821
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,919
and that is absolute garbage that is so

822
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:24,480
untrue in the united states alone which

823
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,679
is a very populated country very well

824
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,399
covered country

825
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:31,360
in the united states alone 25 of the

826
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:33,678
land has never once been foot surveyed

827
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:36,639
never once foots and mayors go in there

828
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:38,559
why can't get in there it's too hard

829
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,278
too difficult the terrain is too

830
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:43,200
difficult that is where they live

831
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:44,798
here in australia i don't know

832
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,960
what it is but people were telling me if

833
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:48,398
you fly over huge parts of australia you

834
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,440
just look down it's just a blanket of

835
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:51,038
trees

836
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,798
people never move

837
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:54,960
i'm sure it's the same year

838
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:57,278
it's the same wherever you get the

839
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:00,319
reports of these creatures living

840
00:33:57,278 --> 00:34:01,919
upright walking hair covered

841
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:04,558
primates

842
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,880
just upright walking chimps and gorillas

843
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:09,199
myoscene apes they've been going doing

844
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,200
like this been living on this earth this

845
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:13,519
has been their planet since the myosin

846
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:15,118
20 million years ago

847
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:16,878
they've been out there making their

848
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,720
living

849
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:19,679
living in those places where we don't

850
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,239
live

851
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,159
right now to this day fifty percent of

852
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:26,719
the arable land of the earth fifty

853
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:29,679
percent take away the ice caps take away

854
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:31,118
the deserts arable land fifty percent of

855
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,280
it

856
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,720
consider terra incognita we don't know

857
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,399
what it is we basically don't know

858
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:39,118
what's out there

859
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:40,398
we don't live there we live in about

860
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,960
half

861
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:43,918
to any extent in about half of the arab

862
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,320
land

863
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:49,519
of the earth

864
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:52,240
there's plenty of room for them to roam

865
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:53,838
to be to live

866
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:56,078
plenty

867
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:57,358
perfect example next level

868
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,280
the panda

869
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:01,279
was the

870
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:03,599
1800s you know how now in the last 50

871
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:07,119
years we hear about the commonwealth's

872
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:09,440
bigfoot says watch out for all that

873
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:12,160
in the early part of the 1800s

874
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:16,079
it was panda stories kept coming out of

875
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:18,000
china of a black and white bear that ate

876
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,599
bamboo

877
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,079
and of course every expert in the world

878
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:24,160
knew that was impossible

879
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:26,079
that there were no vegetarian bears they

880
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:27,199
were omnivores and that they were black

881
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,200
and white

882
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:32,799
brown

883
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:36,399
other color bears but not two tones

884
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:39,440
until in 1869 a french naturalist

885
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,039
sent the hide of one back to the french

886
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,720
museum of natural history and they

887
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:46,719
stuffed it and knew what it looked like

888
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:48,559
and then every scientist who had been

889
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:50,879
saying that such a thing is impossible

890
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:52,880
said well we were just maintaining

891
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,960
healthy skepticism as scientists are

892
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,400
supposed to do instead of admitting to

893
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,960
the fact that they were just ruling it

894
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:02,160
out because it was beyond their their

895
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,440
conception their imagination

896
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:05,440
and so they said now that we know

897
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,200
they're for real we're going to get off

898
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,559
our thumbs and we're going to go out

899
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:10,559
there and we're going to be the first to

900
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:12,799
bring another one in

901
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:14,639
such juan province china is not that big

902
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,880
place

903
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:19,199
it's just tough rugged terrain

904
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:22,000
mountainous with bamboo forests instead

905
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:23,358
of regular forests but other than that

906
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,960
how long do you think it took to bring

907
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:27,358
in the next one when they knew it was

908
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,720
there and it was sending in top quality

909
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:32,078
teams

910
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:34,239
to find it long they took

911
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:36,960
60 years

912
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:39,039
60 years and then over the next 20 years

913
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,960
they brought in half a dozen more and to

914
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:43,440
this day it's really hard to go out into

915
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:46,480
those jungles i mean those baby forests

916
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:49,039
and and find a live panda from the wild

917
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:51,119
why what's the panda doing nothing it's

918
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:53,199
a it's a brightly colored slow-moving

919
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:55,760
dim-witted animal

920
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:57,519
that really doesn't do anything that's

921
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,960
in the day doesn't hive doesn't anything

922
00:36:57,519 --> 00:37:00,400
sophisticated to stay out of the way

923
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,199
getting caught

924
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,119
the problem is we don't function well in

925
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:07,919
its environment

926
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:10,400
but we think we function well everywhere

927
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,000
excuse me but we don't

928
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,400
we do not

929
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,159
and so

930
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,960
imagine if you will

931
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:22,239
a creature that is bigger

932
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:24,720
faster lives at night eats anything can

933
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:26,239
really move

934
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:28,078
if it wants to

935
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:30,078
and it's absolute master of its

936
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:32,160
environment and it is smart

937
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:35,359
now imagine going out and trying to find

938
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:37,920
that when you can't find pandas

939
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:39,838
that are really stupid animals

940
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,358
it isn't going to happen deliberately

941
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:43,679
you're going to see these creatures

942
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:46,639
accidentally and that's how it happens

943
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:49,118
when it happens and it happens about 150

944
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:50,480
times a year around the world good

945
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:54,400
silence

946
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,400
about 150 times every year

947
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:58,960
okay when it happens

948
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:01,920
evidence is left behind

949
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:05,199
and the evidence in most cases is tracks

950
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,159
in most cases it's tracks we have right

951
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,919
now

952
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:11,759
over the last 50 years that we've been

953
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:15,519
keeping track about 10 000 plaster cast

954
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:18,079
photographs are both of tracks

955
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:20,480
all of which according to the darwinian

956
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:22,800
paradigm the darwinian mainstream is

957
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:25,440
impossible because why

958
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:28,160
hominoids can't exist

959
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,960
they can't not that they don't exist

960
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:32,960
they can't exist on the darwinian

961
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:34,320
paradigm crumbles

962
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,199
it crumbles

963
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,240
so

964
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:40,159
is it hard to know one way or the other

965
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:41,679
whether these things do exist based on

966
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:43,039
the proof that they leave behind yes

967
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:45,039
because they're big creatures they're

968
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:47,679
heavy creatures and they leave tracks

969
00:38:45,039 --> 00:38:48,880
and tracks are indeed

970
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:50,719
readable

971
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,559
there's a whole branch of science called

972
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:55,199
technology that does nothing but read

973
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:57,838
the tracks left in fossil shales and

974
00:38:55,199 --> 00:39:00,000
other fossils of creatures that lived

975
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:01,599
millions of years ago well if they can

976
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,838
read those tracks and tell you what

977
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,280
those animals look like they can read

978
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:07,279
the tracks and homomorphs and tell you

979
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,440
what they look like but suddenly when it

980
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:11,200
comes time to read a homonym track all

981
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,880
rules are out the window and they have

982
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:15,039
to be false and you can't even get them

983
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,760
out of their offices hardly to go out

984
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:20,639
and take a look only a handful

985
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,000
of scientists that support the reality

986
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:24,000
of homonymous will go out and take a

987
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,400
look you can't get them to go why

988
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,960
because it can't be real not that it

989
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,880
isn't it can't be real well here's what

990
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,159
you get when you go out and take a look

991
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,599
when a living

992
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:38,078
fleshy foot with all its multiple bones

993
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:41,119
makes a track in a suitable medium in

994
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:44,240
doing so it pushes the medium out

995
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:46,240
sequentially smoothly flowing out and

996
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:48,799
what you get it lines cracks in the

997
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:50,159
inside of the tracks called compression

998
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,960
lines

999
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:54,960
vertical little lines along here

1000
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,519
very easy to see

1001
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,920
next slide if you take a

1002
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:02,079
phony foot of any kind

1003
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:05,200
wood plaster plastic it doesn't matter

1004
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:07,599
it is not going to articulate the way a

1005
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:09,358
real living fleshy foot does so when it

1006
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:11,200
goes down you have to press it or stamp

1007
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:13,279
it and when you do that the medium

1008
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:15,598
pushes out in a completely different way

1009
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:18,000
you get these these impact ridges on the

1010
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:20,318
sides and the lines crack on the outside

1011
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,480
instead of the inside

1012
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:24,960
now we can give this little lesson to a

1013
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,199
group of first graders of six year old

1014
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,639
kids give them magnifying glasses with

1015
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:32,078
as many tracks as you want out here

1016
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:35,358
phony and real and they won't miss one

1017
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:38,000
that's really how easy it is

1018
00:40:35,358 --> 00:40:40,000
and yet every track that shows the

1019
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,318
compression lines that they

1020
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,639
that the real ones produce

1021
00:40:42,318 --> 00:40:47,519
in that case in that case only can't be

1022
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:49,838
true got to be faked some kind of way

1023
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:52,800
the fakers have figured out how to do it

1024
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:54,799
how to produce articulating feet that if

1025
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,160
instead of making fake bigfoot tracks

1026
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,839
all over the world

1027
00:40:56,159 --> 00:41:00,799
all they have to do is apply that

1028
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:02,400
technology to prosthesis and people with

1029
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,800
with missing limbs

1030
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,358
could walk a heck of a lot better

1031
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,800
and they'd be millionaires to boot

1032
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:11,440
and remember all this faking has been

1033
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,880
going on for like 50 years

1034
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,200
next level

1035
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:17,838
here's how human foot works you have the

1036
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:20,000
heel coming down because our ankle sits

1037
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:21,679
to the rear of our foot so we have a

1038
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,318
heel strike we come down hard on the

1039
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:26,639
heel the momentum swings around the

1040
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:29,119
outside of our arch it cuts over here

1041
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:31,519
into the ball of our foot it comes out

1042
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:34,480
our toe our big toe axes and thrusting

1043
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:36,400
mechanism our four other toes act as

1044
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:39,119
balancers and they pull up and leave an

1045
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,519
undisturbed line of medium underneath

1046
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,599
here while this flattens out next slide

1047
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:45,838
and what we see is a drawing of exactly

1048
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:48,318
that we see the heel strike we see the

1049
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:50,639
momentum swinging around the arch we see

1050
00:41:48,318 --> 00:41:52,239
it cut over under the ball we see it

1051
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:55,039
thrust out through the big toe we see

1052
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:57,039
the four toes here acting as as

1053
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:58,400
balancers and leaving an undisturbed

1054
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:00,960
track of medium

1055
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:03,599
in there that's how we walk

1056
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,838
next slide this is how hominoids walk

1057
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,599
all of them this is a bigfoot track 16

1058
00:42:05,838 --> 00:42:10,159
inches long seven inches wide very

1059
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:12,160
typical track it was just taking a

1060
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:14,318
really nice soft dirt road so you got a

1061
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:15,598
real nice clear print you see something

1062
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:17,599
very different

1063
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:19,200
you see an ankle set up here toward the

1064
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:21,280
middle of the foot you see an extended

1065
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:23,679
heel you see a widened heel you see a

1066
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:26,800
shortened forefoot you see a very wide

1067
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:28,960
forefoot you see all five toes acting as

1068
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,440
balancers you see the medium through

1069
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:34,159
here so the thrusting mechanism is the

1070
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,838
whole four foot here

1071
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:38,078
and most importantly instead of that

1072
00:42:35,838 --> 00:42:41,440
swinging around the arch and having an

1073
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:43,599
imbalanced kind of walk this thing has a

1074
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,200
no heel strike the foot comes down

1075
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,800
together and the line of momentum is

1076
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:48,078
straight up the chute you can see that

1077
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,280
right here

1078
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:53,599
a totally different foot

1079
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:56,160
a totally different foot walking a

1080
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:59,200
totally different way from us and guess

1081
00:42:56,159 --> 00:43:00,879
what tracks of leia told me 3.2 million

1082
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:02,799
years ago that's how they look that's

1083
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,720
how they walk

1084
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,599
and furthermore they walk better than we

1085
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:07,598
did

1086
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:09,359
because that foot instead of like us

1087
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:13,838
coming down heel strike toe out heel

1088
00:43:09,358 --> 00:43:13,838
strike toe out that foot's coming down

1089
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:18,799
smoothly smoothly

1090
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,440
this thing is walking better than us

1091
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,640
it's keeping its knees

1092
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,760
unlocked

1093
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:26,480
bent

1094
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:30,400
so it's using its muscles it's muscles

1095
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:32,400
in its thighs muscles in its behind

1096
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,400
the way to do it the right way to do it

1097
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,720
its joints don't wear out like allergy

1098
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,240
if you look at us walking in slow motion

1099
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:39,838
we're actually doing it wrong we're

1100
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:41,679
doing it inefficiently

1101
00:43:39,838 --> 00:43:43,599
we're locking our knees we're throwing

1102
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:46,159
ourselves through our hips

1103
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:47,519
and over time our joints wear out as we

1104
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:49,759
get old all you have to do is go to

1105
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:53,440
nursing home you can see it it shouldn't

1106
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:55,200
happen if you were walking correctly

1107
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,358
something is wrong these guys do it

1108
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:58,960
right we do it wrong

1109
00:43:57,358 --> 00:44:01,279
here's another one and it's a different

1110
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:03,760
foot and what what this one shows is

1111
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:05,280
that there are different feet among the

1112
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,960
hormones

1113
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,640
fundamentally the same but check the

1114
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,800
difference in the toes these toes are

1115
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:12,239
all the same size it's called the peas

1116
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,240
and pod type

1117
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:17,039
but again still all five of them acting

1118
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:18,959
as balancers four foot ankle underneath

1119
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:20,960
extended yield

1120
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:23,280
the same the same different design but

1121
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,800
with different toes we all have the same

1122
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,960
fundamental foot but they have different

1123
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,880
ones very unusual

1124
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:31,039
next slide

1125
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:33,119
dermal ridges in the best humanoid

1126
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:34,880
tracks dermal ridges show up very

1127
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,720
clearly what are dermal ridges they're

1128
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,920
the fingerprints your fingerprints of

1129
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:39,358
your feet

1130
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,480
you know how when a baby's born if the

1131
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:42,000
hands are too small to do the

1132
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:45,199
fingerprints they just do the whole foot

1133
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:48,079
boom print the foot

1134
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:49,598
fingerprints on your feet thermal ridges

1135
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:50,720
what do they say what does the darwinist

1136
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:53,440
say when they

1137
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:55,759
see a hanoi track with dermal ridges

1138
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:58,800
whoever faked it took the time to sit

1139
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,800
down and carve them in

1140
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:03,838
when in fact they're so so fine and so

1141
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,240
complicated and each one is unique

1142
00:45:03,838 --> 00:45:08,078
remember each one is unique

1143
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:09,838
just like fingerprints

1144
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:12,560
lasers couldn't do it

1145
00:45:09,838 --> 00:45:15,358
and yet somehow those fakers have taken

1146
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:17,440
trouble to sit down and make a foot that

1147
00:45:15,358 --> 00:45:20,239
fully articulates so that it leaves

1148
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:24,559
compression lines and it leaves dermal

1149
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:26,719
ridges those fakers know their business

1150
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:29,440
see how silly it is

1151
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:31,118
it's absolutely absurd next slide

1152
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,039
this is a stride comparison with a six

1153
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:34,318
foot man you see the track here and a

1154
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:36,318
track here

1155
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:38,318
see how it is if somebody was in need

1156
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:41,039
faking them and wearing fake tracks

1157
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:42,719
because they they make such

1158
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:43,759
they go into the mediums in such depth

1159
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:45,598
that we can

1160
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,680
judge how much they weigh we know

1161
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:50,640
they're weighing 500 pounds 600 pounds

1162
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:52,639
700 pounds 800 pounds depends but you

1163
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:55,118
can tell for the medium technology can

1164
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:56,960
do this it's amazing what they can do

1165
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:59,519
that means that the person who's making

1166
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:02,240
these tracks has to be in the range of

1167
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:04,239
seven eight feet tall themselves and

1168
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:05,598
they have to be very heavy people to

1169
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:06,879
begin with and then they have to put

1170
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:08,079
three or four hundred pounds on a

1171
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,440
barbell

1172
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:11,839
and carry that

1173

1174
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:16,000
you know

1175
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:19,039
making the tracks

1176
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,679
the problem is if it's a human foot it

1177
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:23,519
it has a it's going to have a deep

1178
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:25,118
heel prep it's going to have the

1179
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:27,838
standard

1180
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:30,160
heel impact that we have and those who

1181
00:46:27,838 --> 00:46:32,480
are just not visible in the hominoid

1182
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:32,480
tracks

1183
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,559
it's clear that these are living

1184
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:38,480
creatures making these tracks that don't

1185
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:40,480
walk the way we do it don't walk

1186
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,800
anywhere close to us just forget about

1187
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,719
the size differential the walk is not

1188
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,760
the same next level

1189
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:47,519
but

1190
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,040
here is the differential and i mean the

1191
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:50,239
difference in the way that your foot's

1192
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:52,079
put together

1193
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:54,239
this has been studied by broken prince

1194
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:55,760
he was an anatomist human animus put an

1195
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:58,318
anatomist and he said my estimate is

1196
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:00,240
that 31 of the total foot length is

1197
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:03,039
behind the ankle joint compared with

1198
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:04,959
only 23 percent of the humans so you see

1199
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:08,719
you're looking at a fundamental redesign

1200
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:11,679
why because it's so much bigger denser

1201
00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:13,358
thicker heavier body

1202
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:15,118
all the homonyms whether they're small

1203
00:47:13,358 --> 00:47:17,039
or whether they're big and by the way

1204
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:19,920
there are different sizes of them there

1205
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:21,838
are pygmy size there are human size and

1206
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,920
there are the giant size bigfoot

1207
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:25,519
sasquatch those are the giant size you

1208
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,519
always i'm sure you've heard you have

1209
00:47:25,519 --> 00:47:29,440
tall ones and you have more human we

1210
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:31,039
have the same thing there everything

1211
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,480
seems to get lumped around the big ones

1212
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:34,239
because the big ones are so awesome but

1213
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:38,079
there are many that are seen that are

1214
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:41,358
human size there are different types

1215
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:44,318
like the miocene apes just like my sea

1216
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:47,358
names they are these are my c names

1217
00:47:44,318 --> 00:47:50,000
living today among us it's their planet

1218
00:47:47,358 --> 00:47:52,558
they are the indigenous upright walking

1219
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,358
primates of planet earth

1220
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:56,559
okay so we see the redesign the next

1221
00:47:55,358 --> 00:47:58,480
level

1222
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:00,240
we also i want you to keep in mind the

1223
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:02,000
difference of the motion

1224
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:04,479
the forward motion the way the momentum

1225
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:08,480
carries much better here than here

1226
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:10,639
next slide this is a look at the

1227
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:13,358
difference in the shadow of the area

1228
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:15,759
that they put down and he says thus last

1229
00:48:13,358 --> 00:48:18,480
line thus the sasquatch foot had given

1230
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:20,640
us in lessons does the suspect squatch

1231
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:23,358
foot at a given statute has just to

1232
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:24,879
trace over twice the surface area of a

1233
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:28,159
human foot

1234
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:29,920
at a given size twice the surface area

1235
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:31,759
why because it's supporting whatever

1236
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,079
that given size is supporting much

1237
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:36,640
bigger body so you need a much broader

1238
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:38,400
platform and a much thicker sole

1239
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:40,639
to be able to walk barefoot for the

1240
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,000
entire life supporting that so it's as

1241
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:44,799
you saw in the other drawing it's

1242
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,400
thicker on the bottom around the sole

1243
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,400
okay next slide

1244
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,760
now here's a comparison of a standard

1245
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,720
ten and a half's

1246
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:55,920
foot about my size and a standard eight

1247
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:58,318
foot fifteen ten by five and fifteen by

1248
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,838
six and a half but again keep the

1249
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:02,880
bigfoot

1250
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:04,719
look the hominoid look in mind

1251
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:07,440
it's very different than the human next

1252
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:09,279
life now we see another pair of them

1253
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,960
and these it looks like this because

1254
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:14,000
instead of being in dirt this was taken

1255
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:16,240
from a from clay from hardened clutch

1256
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,239
but otherwise in every other respect

1257
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:20,479
these are hominoid tracks are they not

1258
00:49:18,239 --> 00:49:23,199
well they look exactly the same widened

1259
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:24,800
heel ankle up to the way they were those

1260
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:27,439
are those are hominoid tracks are they

1261
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:29,599
not don't you agree

1262
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:32,480
well they aren't as it turns out they

1263
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:35,680
are not contrasted they are in fact

1264
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:38,240
without doubt neanderthal traps

1265
00:49:35,679 --> 00:49:41,679
the anderthal tracks taken from the cave

1266
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:44,000
toriyama italy 30 000 years ago no doubt

1267
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:46,639
about it neanderthal artifacts in the

1268
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,480
cave these are neanderthal tracks

1269
00:49:46,639 --> 00:49:51,679
looking exactly

1270
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:54,159
like hominoid prince of this day

1271
00:49:51,679 --> 00:49:57,440
which would lead one to suspect that

1272
00:49:54,159 --> 00:50:00,000
perhaps neanderthals might be

1273
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,200
homonoids rather than for humans next

1274
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,519
level

1275
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:05,199
in fact we have the feet of the

1276
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:07,440
intervals we don't have the feet of any

1277
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:09,598
other pre-humans it turns out when wild

1278
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:11,760
creatures eat you the first thing they

1279
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:13,519
go for is your feet is like you know the

1280
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,680
cherry on sunday or something you know

1281
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:18,079
but for whatever reason

1282
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:19,358
we have very few females out of the

1283
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:21,440
fossil record

1284
00:50:19,358 --> 00:50:24,239
but we have whole feet of neanderthals

1285
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:26,960
because a few of them got buried

1286
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:29,519
a few got here and so what we have is a

1287
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:31,358
comparison here on the info foot human

1288
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:32,800
foot human foot the end of the foot and

1289
00:50:31,358 --> 00:50:34,960
look at the difference

1290
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,880
you have the huge extension of the heel

1291
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:39,199
here relative to this you have the ankle

1292
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:41,200
moving forward and widening compared to

1293
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:42,960
this you have a flattening of the arch

1294
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:44,879
compared to this and most importantly

1295
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,400
look at the kind of sway that you have

1296
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:49,440
here in our foot you can just see the

1297
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:51,680
imbalance caused by our momentum working

1298
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,039
around our arch as opposed to this big

1299
00:50:51,679 --> 00:50:56,318
flat

1300
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:59,119
solid thing with the heel the big wide

1301
00:50:56,318 --> 00:51:01,920
ankle by comparative comparison shifted

1302
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:04,240
forward the widening of the forefoot the

1303
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:06,639
forefoot being the thrusting mechanism

1304
00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:08,879
the big toe here being the dominant one

1305
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:08,879
the four

1306
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:13,119
as opposed to these big all five of them

1307
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:15,439
working as balancers

1308
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:17,760
this is a very different it's the same

1309
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:21,280
bones it's amazing it's the same bones

1310
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:23,599
completely redesigned for a different

1311
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:26,800
function and understand that this foot

1312
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:27,920
is wrapping around here like it's a big

1313
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:32,880
wide

1314
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:32,880
foot relative to this one within here

1315
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:36,640
everything that you see in a common

1316
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:39,119
motor foot

1317
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:40,879
is sitting right here in the neanderthal

1318
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:42,720
foot

1319
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,680
next slide

1320
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:45,759
same

1321
00:51:43,679 --> 00:51:46,558
with the comparing with the drawing see

1322
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,920
the

1323
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:49,280
difference

1324
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,119
very clear

1325
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:55,040
just what the guy drew

1326
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:58,800
is what you get and what you see

1327
00:51:55,039 --> 00:52:02,000
pre-human feet are hominoid feet

1328
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:04,599
there's no doubt about it

1329
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,559
all of the pre-humans that's all the

1330
00:52:04,599 --> 00:52:10,079
australopithecines that's all the early

1331
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:12,720
homos up through neanderthal

1332
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:16,318
to pro-magnum

1333
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:20,239
those are nominees not three humans

1334
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:21,759
just miocene apes living their lives and

1335
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:24,318
leaving their traces in the fossil

1336
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:27,760
record humans don't appear in the fossil

1337
00:52:24,318 --> 00:52:31,599
record until 120 000 years ago suddenly

1338
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:34,240
overnight like everything else

1339
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:35,920
so what they what they do now try to get

1340
00:52:34,239 --> 00:52:37,838
you to believe part of the brainwashing

1341
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,440
is that neanderthals which initially

1342
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:41,838
were considered roots pretty much like

1343
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:44,318
what they are they're now just ugly

1344
00:52:41,838 --> 00:52:47,039
humans wearing firms

1345
00:52:44,318 --> 00:52:49,599
why because neanderthals clearly lived

1346
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:52,159
during the ice ages in where the ice

1347
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:54,400
ages were at their works

1348
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:56,480
so somehow they were living in sub-zero

1349
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,400
temperatures and so they wrap them up in

1350
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,920
fur you take any of these guys and you

1351
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,480
put them one night above the arctic

1352
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:04,960
circle just above the arc circle

1353
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:07,920
which is not as bad as it was during the

1354
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:09,599
ice ages and those those folks are dead

1355
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,358
one night

1356
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:13,519
yeah

1357
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:14,880
first not gonna make i'm going to get a

1358
00:53:13,519 --> 00:53:17,199
human through that you have to have a

1359
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:19,280
different physiology to survive that

1360
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:20,960
kind of climate

1361
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,319
and the neanderthals clearly did because

1362
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,960
they did it for a couple hundred

1363
00:53:22,318 --> 00:53:24,960
thousand years

1364
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:31,040
they were covered in fur

1365
00:53:27,519 --> 00:53:32,480
have different physiology than we do

1366
00:53:31,039 --> 00:53:34,079
so if you want to see the true face of

1367
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,440
neanderthal

1368
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:38,000
next slide it's going to look an awful

1369
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:40,000
lot more like this

1370
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,838
which is grill than anything like what

1371
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:45,519
you just saw like what you were told to

1372
00:53:41,838 --> 00:53:47,440
believe what you were taught to believe

1373
00:53:45,519 --> 00:53:49,519
nothing human on the horizon until you

1374
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:52,240
get to pro magnum everything prior to

1375
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:55,239
that looking like this covered with hair

1376
00:53:52,239 --> 00:53:55,239
um

1377
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,960
next slide

1378
00:53:57,039 --> 00:53:59,838
now if everything i'm telling you is

1379
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,720
true

1380
00:53:59,838 --> 00:54:05,519
how how where we come from

1381
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:07,439
if the earth belongs to the upright

1382
00:54:05,519 --> 00:54:10,719
indigenous

1383
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,720
primates from

1384
00:54:12,639 --> 00:54:16,480
well i choose to believe the best

1385
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,159
evidence that i have

1386
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,519
is from the work of a man named

1387
00:54:18,159 --> 00:54:21,279
zechariah sitchin which i'm not going to

1388
00:54:19,519 --> 00:54:23,440
go into in great detail here just to

1389
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:26,319
tell you that summer

1390
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:28,960
the original culture that we

1391
00:54:26,318 --> 00:54:31,440
have that we accept that scientists and

1392
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:33,280
scholars accept as the first one around

1393
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:35,519
five thousand years ago consumer which

1394
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,880
is modern-day iraq tigers referred to

1395
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:38,719
these modern day wreck where the war's

1396
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:42,079
going on

1397
00:54:38,719 --> 00:54:44,480
that culture appeared out of nowhere

1398
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:47,119
they came from the stone age out of the

1399
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:48,960
zagros mountains supposedly down into

1400
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:52,720
the valley there and produced this

1401
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:55,599
fantastic culture that gave us over a

1402
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:58,318
hundred of the firsts that we attribute

1403
00:54:55,599 --> 00:55:00,640
to the society now how did they do that

1404
00:54:58,318 --> 00:55:02,798
how they produce a culture that was as

1405
00:55:00,639 --> 00:55:05,279
good as in many ways better than the

1406
00:55:02,798 --> 00:55:07,119
later egyptians greeks and romans

1407
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,200
come right out of the stone agent boom

1408
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:10,318
just explode this wonderful culture how

1409
00:55:09,199 --> 00:55:11,439
do they do that

1410
00:55:10,318 --> 00:55:13,440
well

1411
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:15,119
we don't talk about it

1412
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,559
they just leave that one off the table

1413
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:18,400
because it's just too impossible to

1414
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:20,400
explain and all you really talk about

1415
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,760
the sumerians if you went to school you

1416
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,119
were taught anything about experience at

1417
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,079
all you were talking thank you you did

1418
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:25,838
it right

1419
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:28,640
of the hundred and some things they

1420
00:55:25,838 --> 00:55:30,400
introduced next slide they introduced

1421
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:33,118
writing uniform

1422
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:34,559
and why because we have over 100 it

1423
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:36,559
would be that would be denied if we

1424
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:39,040
didn't have the hundred thousand plus

1425
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:40,640
tablets many of which got stolen by the

1426
00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:43,119
way when the americans invaded you might

1427
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:44,318
remember the both tablets and cylinder

1428
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:46,559
sales were

1429
00:55:44,318 --> 00:55:49,279
confiscated but disappeared

1430
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:51,280
but nonetheless only it's unfortunate

1431
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:53,839
because only about 20 of them have been

1432
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:57,119
translated at that point

1433
00:55:53,838 --> 00:55:58,960
but the 20 were translated many about 5

1434
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:00,480
000 of them told things about their

1435
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,559
history most of them were about business

1436
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:05,599
and business deals and

1437
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:07,920
who knew how many sheep or whatever but

1438
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:09,680
about five thousand of them told stories

1439
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:12,559
that the sumerians believed about

1440
00:56:09,679 --> 00:56:14,798
themselves about their history

1441
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:16,319
that's all considered mythology

1442
00:56:14,798 --> 00:56:18,079
our scientists consider it total

1443
00:56:16,318 --> 00:56:20,880
mythology because it just can't be true

1444
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:20,880
the things they were saying

1445
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:27,200
they were saying things like this that

1446
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:29,520
multiple gods came down from the heavens

1447
00:56:27,199 --> 00:56:31,919
lived on the earth needed a slave and a

1448
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:34,480
serpent created that slave of a servant

1449
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:36,720
in a a house of fashion basically a

1450
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:38,480
genetic engineering map and not only did

1451
00:56:36,719 --> 00:56:40,798
they create humans to be their slaves

1452
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:43,358
and servants they created domesticated

1453
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:46,480
plants and domesticated animals

1454
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:48,239
to give the gods their needs

1455
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:50,240
now whether you believe that or not

1456
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:52,399
doesn't matter i think the evidence is

1457
00:56:50,239 --> 00:56:55,039
there that somebody was here whether it

1458
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:57,440
was the annunaki as the sumerians called

1459
00:56:55,039 --> 00:57:00,318
him or somebody else somebody a

1460
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:01,920
superculture was here in the dim past

1461
00:57:00,318 --> 00:57:04,239
and they left their fingerprints all

1462
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:06,079
over the place we just refused to

1463
00:57:04,239 --> 00:57:08,318
acknowledge that their fingerprints are

1464
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:08,318
here

1465
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,358
one of the things that these people left

1466
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:13,358
us

1467
00:57:11,358 --> 00:57:16,159
with a legacy of as an explanation for

1468
00:57:13,358 --> 00:57:18,558
how the earth came to be like this

1469
00:57:16,159 --> 00:57:19,598
the earth itself

1470
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:22,000
all

1471
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:24,880
liquid bodies in a vacuum formed

1472
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,480
themselves into a tight spherical ball

1473
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:28,559
you've all seen milk get loose in the

1474
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:30,798
space shuttle and all that all forms

1475
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:32,480
into a ball this is what liquids do in

1476
00:57:30,798 --> 00:57:34,400
the vacuum

1477
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:36,079
all other natural bodies that we know of

1478
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,480
except for the meteorites and comics

1479
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:40,318
which are started out as pieces of this

1480
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:42,639
supposedly the planets exploding and

1481
00:57:40,318 --> 00:57:45,119
things like that to create them

1482
00:57:42,639 --> 00:57:47,920
but anything that formed as a viscous

1483
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:51,519
mass which clearly the earth did

1484
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:54,240
forms in a complete smooth ball

1485
00:57:51,519 --> 00:57:56,159
what happened to the earth the sumerians

1486
00:57:54,239 --> 00:57:58,558
have an explanation our guys are still

1487
00:57:56,159 --> 00:58:00,719
trying to figure it out

1488
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:02,720
that's in my book it's in sichuan's book

1489
00:58:00,719 --> 00:58:04,879
if you want to find out more about it

1490
00:58:02,719 --> 00:58:06,838
the point is there are some answers next

1491
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:08,400
slide

1492
00:58:06,838 --> 00:58:11,039
another

1493
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:13,358
basic proof of the existence of these

1494
00:58:11,039 --> 00:58:15,199
multiple super people super gods or

1495
00:58:13,358 --> 00:58:17,519
whatever you want to call them are

1496
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:19,598
megalithic structures around the world

1497
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:21,440
megalithic structures that sexual mind

1498
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:23,359
like these if i was standing here i wish

1499
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:24,960
i was in this picture i'd be about right

1500
00:58:23,358 --> 00:58:27,759
my head would be about right here that's

1501
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,760
how big they are

1502
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:33,759
high in the mountains of above cusco

1503
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:36,559
impossible for humans to put this

1504
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,520
together and yet we're told that they

1505
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:40,480
did

1506
00:58:37,519 --> 00:58:42,000
and the same holds true for tiwanako te

1507
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:44,159
ote wakan

1508
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,400
paul beck in lebanon

1509
00:58:44,159 --> 00:58:47,838
stonehenge around the world any

1510
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,639
megalithic structure we want to talk

1511
00:58:47,838 --> 00:58:51,358
about

1512
00:58:48,639 --> 00:58:53,440
humans somehow did it because nothing

1513
00:58:51,358 --> 00:58:55,759
else is allowed no outside intervention

1514
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,400
is permitted so they have to explain it

1515
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,760
in

1516
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:00,639
rational

1517
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:02,640
natural terms and so they just say

1518
00:59:00,639 --> 00:59:05,440
somehow they did it but we can't do it

1519
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:06,879
today we cannot begin to reproduce this

1520
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:09,358
kind of precision

1521
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:13,119
in our work today

1522
00:59:09,358 --> 00:59:16,078
playing one stone every 8.5 minutes now

1523
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:18,880
right there that story is over with

1524
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:21,519
right there that story is a fraud that

1525
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:24,160
story is absurd

1526
00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:25,440
and yet if they the egyptologists will

1527
00:59:24,159 --> 00:59:27,920
not hear

1528
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:29,760
that it couldn't be done

1529
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:31,680
more than that they weren't just

1530
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:33,920
slamming these things into place like

1531
00:59:31,679 --> 00:59:35,519
these look like they were but still they

1532
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,760
were being laid pretty carefully because

1533
00:59:35,519 --> 00:59:39,280
they're all flat and they all worked out

1534
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:41,599
such that they went up to the top

1535
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:44,160
perfectly but here's what's the amazing

1536
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:47,760
thing they were covered with polished

1537
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:49,039
limestone each of which was placed to

1538
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,559
perfection

1539
00:59:49,039 --> 00:59:52,558
and it couldn't be any other way because

1540
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:54,319
if you have mistakes down at the bottom

1541
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:57,280
the size of the postage stamp go the

1542
00:59:54,318 --> 00:59:59,519
size of the car at the top

1543
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:02,240
every single stone in these three

1544
00:59:59,519 --> 01:00:04,239
pyramids had to be perfect and they were

1545
01:00:02,239 --> 01:00:06,239
next slide thank goodness after that

1546
01:00:04,239 --> 01:00:08,399
while they were stripping off the

1547
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:10,159
covering limestone they left a few down

1548
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,160
at the bottom so you can see how

1549
01:00:10,159 --> 01:00:14,078
marvelous the workmanship was and here

1550
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:16,480
it is this is a connecting line between

1551
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:18,960
two of the stones it's the width of a

1552
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:20,880
human hair next slide

1553
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:23,119
see it coin

1554
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:26,400
connecting line right here

1555
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:28,400
we cannot in our wildest dreams

1556
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,760
put stones together with this kind of

1557
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:32,960
accuracy

1558
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:36,000
not in our wildest dreams can we do this

1559
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:38,400
on a massive scale this is a rolex watch

1560
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,960
folks built to the size of the mountain

1561
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,960
thrills

1562
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:45,519
impossible

1563
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:48,079
today and yet somehow these primitive

1564
01:00:45,519 --> 01:00:51,519
people did it using ropes

1565
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:53,359
stone tools and wood rollers to do the

1566
01:00:51,519 --> 01:00:55,358
stones would they did not have and

1567
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:56,558
they'll grow in the nile valley they

1568
01:00:55,358 --> 01:00:59,279
would have had to import them from

1569
01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:02,319
lebanon which would back then

1570
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:04,720
3 500 years ago would have been you know

1571
01:01:02,318 --> 01:01:06,719
tough effort

1572
01:01:04,719 --> 01:01:08,000
okay next slide

1573
01:01:06,719 --> 01:01:10,399
the sphinx

1574
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,159
you've all seen it too i want to look at

1575
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:14,000
this wall over here for a minute next

1576
01:01:12,159 --> 01:01:15,679
slide

1577
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,838
i hope you've all seen the mystery of

1578
01:01:15,679 --> 01:01:20,480
the sphinx and seen the idea that this

1579
01:01:17,838 --> 01:01:23,279
is caused by running water these these

1580
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:25,519
are running water marks after the sphinx

1581
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:28,400
was carved out the walls were smoothed

1582
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:29,759
over and gouged by running water well

1583
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:32,639
what does that mean

1584
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:35,520
that the sphinx was carved at a minimum

1585
01:01:32,639 --> 01:01:37,920
of eight to ten thousand years ago

1586
01:01:35,519 --> 01:01:40,079
before the desert desiccated in that

1587
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:41,119
area

1588
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:43,280
with me

1589
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:44,480
it's more likely that it's more like 15

1590
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:47,040
to 16

1591
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:49,440
000 years ago to have it sitting there

1592
01:01:47,039 --> 01:01:51,358
and give enough rain time

1593
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:53,039
so that all this could happen

1594
01:01:51,358 --> 01:01:55,199
well fifteen to sixteen thousand years

1595
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:57,038
ago no egyptologists don't come up with

1596
01:01:55,199 --> 01:01:59,199
that but they've had it pretty much

1597
01:01:57,039 --> 01:02:00,480
crammed down their throats so some of

1598
01:01:59,199 --> 01:02:02,159
them are beginning to say well yeah i

1599
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,358
mean that happened but then the pyramids

1600
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:06,159
were still

1601
01:02:03,358 --> 01:02:08,880
made within that 100 year period but

1602
01:02:06,159 --> 01:02:11,279
they're trying their very best to get

1603
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:13,680
the sphinx back on the page and at the

1604
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:16,240
same time as the pyramids

1605
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:18,639
next time but however or whenever it was

1606
01:02:16,239 --> 01:02:20,479
done one thing is for sure when they cut

1607
01:02:18,639 --> 01:02:22,318
these stones out of here they move some

1608
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:23,920
of them they move them up here to build

1609
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:26,480
two temples the sphinx temple and the

1610
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:27,599
valley temple

1611
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:29,119
next slide

1612
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:31,280
and as you see this looking the other

1613
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:33,039
way now sinks here

1614
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:34,880
swings temple valley temple you see the

1615
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:36,240
size of some of the stones and they too

1616
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:38,079
were by the way covered with those

1617
01:02:36,239 --> 01:02:40,239
perfect polished limestones that got

1618
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:41,920
stripped off to build buildings in cairo

1619
01:02:40,239 --> 01:02:43,439
which i think it's one of the great sins

1620
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:45,920
of the past

1621
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:47,440
people doing that ruining the beauty and

1622
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:48,798
perfection of these things nonetheless

1623
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,838
they didn't use what we're left with

1624
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:50,798
next slide

1625
01:02:49,838 --> 01:02:52,719
we have

1626
01:02:50,798 --> 01:02:54,480
this is me back when i was younger and

1627
01:02:52,719 --> 01:02:57,439
had hair and was cool and it was a

1628
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:57,440
snappy dresser

1629
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:01,280
no it's not true but i've never had hair

1630
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:02,720
and i was never cool and i'm still not

1631
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:04,960
sniping

1632
01:03:02,719 --> 01:03:08,399
but anyhow this was another guy but you

1633
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:09,599
see 170 tons of stone

1634
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:12,480
just one of them

1635
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:14,480
in the pyramids 1500 not that unusual on

1636
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:15,440
the inside all of it perfect again

1637
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:18,480
perfect

1638
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:21,358
but here's what it takes to move

1639
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:24,719
170 tons next night today

1640
01:03:21,358 --> 01:03:24,719
this big bumper right here

1641
01:03:24,798 --> 01:03:28,079
and to move it from where you saw that

1642
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:30,480
drawing out it would be three or four

1643
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:31,519
days to set up each time to move it just

1644
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,039
a little bit

1645
01:03:31,519 --> 01:03:35,038
then you have to put it down you have to

1646
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:36,640
roll this thing forward and rebook and

1647
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:39,119
do you know

1648
01:03:36,639 --> 01:03:42,480
eight and a half minutes

1649
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:42,480
eight and a half minutes all you got

1650
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:48,480
to move 170 tons of snow and there are

1651
01:03:45,679 --> 01:03:52,480
stones all over the world

1652
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:52,480
way bigger than 170 tons

1653
01:03:54,239 --> 01:03:59,358
one of my favorites is the ancient 1

1654
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:01,358
thousand one thousand one hundred and

1655
01:03:59,358 --> 01:04:03,038
seventy ton obelisk the unfinished

1656
01:04:01,358 --> 01:04:04,639
novelist at asimon

1657
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:05,680
pink granite one of the hardest stones

1658
01:04:04,639 --> 01:04:07,598
in the world

1659
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:09,679
cut out obviously with

1660
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:11,119
some other stone that was harder than it

1661
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:13,038
but we don't know where they would have

1662
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:16,000
gotten that but nonetheless they carved

1663
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:17,760
it out of this hole in a hole

1664
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,760
the guy had taken the pictures up holder

1665
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:23,359
on blowing and there's the edge of the

1666
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:25,119
wreckage about 15 feet deep in a hole

1667
01:04:23,358 --> 01:04:27,038
and yet as you can see it's been worked

1668
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:29,059
and polished and it's pretty much done

1669
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:30,480
and they're just finishing off the spire

1670
01:04:29,059 --> 01:04:33,679
[Music]

1671
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:35,039
and something is digging out

1672
01:04:33,679 --> 01:04:36,960
pink granite

1673
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:39,280
and chunks the size of the seats that

1674
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:42,400
you're sitting on

1675
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:45,359
some big machine just gouging

1676
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:47,599
and as that machine presses down

1677
01:04:45,358 --> 01:04:50,078
it cracks it finds a fault and it cracks

1678
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:52,798
it and those building it with that

1679
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:54,480
machine just say oops we're broken they

1680
01:04:52,798 --> 01:04:56,880
unhook it off the nose and they go away

1681
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:58,719
and they just leave it for us tomorrow

1682
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:00,160
correct now understand they fixed a

1683
01:04:58,719 --> 01:05:02,639
bunch of them i mean it did a bunch of

1684
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:05,118
them perfectly you've got optimus huge

1685
01:05:02,639 --> 01:05:06,879
gigantic analysts around egypt and then

1686
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:08,480
they got stolen and taken to other parts

1687
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:10,798
of the world

1688
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:13,039
but here's this one which is you know

1689
01:05:10,798 --> 01:05:14,239
average size

1690
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:18,640
problem

1691
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:18,639
problem how do you get it i'm opposed

1692
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:23,119
better yet even bigger problem

1693
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:26,000
how do you cut it loose

1694
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:28,318
from its base

1695
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,318
with the finest drill we have today

1696
01:05:28,318 --> 01:05:32,880
covered in diamonds

1697
01:05:30,318 --> 01:05:34,639
you could not make it go through there

1698
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:38,798
the weight would press it down and

1699
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:38,798
compress it and not let it go

1700
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:43,760
how did these primitive people cut this

1701
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:45,599
stone which is very much loose

1702
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:47,119
according to the darkness according to i

1703
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:49,039
mean according to scientists rather

1704
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:50,798
according to the deuteronologists

1705
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:52,799
some poor schmuck got down there with

1706
01:05:50,798 --> 01:05:53,920
his little stone accents and went to

1707
01:05:52,798 --> 01:05:55,679
hammering

1708
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:57,760
and somehow worked his way all the way

1709
01:05:55,679 --> 01:06:00,000
through and underneath

1710
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:01,119
and worked their way

1711
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:05,039
they would have been crushed and there's

1712
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:05,039
just no physical way to do this

1713
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:10,798
and but if you could if you could

1714
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:12,798
somehow do it next slide this is what it

1715
01:06:10,798 --> 01:06:16,079
would take to move only a thousand times

1716
01:06:12,798 --> 01:06:16,079
it doesn't get much bigger than this

1717
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:21,440
and yeah you have stones in ballpark

1718
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:25,440
ball back lebanon that are two thousand

1719
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:25,440
times two thousand times

1720
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:29,039
and yet there they stood up in a wall

1721
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:30,838
high up in a wall

1722
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:34,160
and a

1723
01:06:30,838 --> 01:06:36,400
template primitive people did that

1724
01:06:34,159 --> 01:06:38,960
it's just like the hominoids how why

1725
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:40,480
because they had to

1726
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:42,720
no intervention is allowed are you

1727
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:44,159
laughing are you coughing

1728
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:47,079
okay

1729
01:06:44,159 --> 01:06:50,230
good job okay you need some water

1730
01:06:47,079 --> 01:06:50,230
[Music]

1731
01:06:51,358 --> 01:06:56,318
all right

1732
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:58,240
if it's if it's true next slide

1733
01:06:56,318 --> 01:07:00,639
then

1734
01:06:58,239 --> 01:07:03,519
they weren't if they were here we have

1735
01:07:00,639 --> 01:07:06,239
other evidence to show that they were we

1736
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:07,838
the as i said earlier domestication of

1737
01:07:06,239 --> 01:07:09,838
plants and animals

1738
01:07:07,838 --> 01:07:11,838
well the story we're told now is that

1739
01:07:09,838 --> 01:07:14,239
all domesticated plants and animals and

1740
01:07:11,838 --> 01:07:16,078
pretty much seems to be this way all

1741
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:18,959
domesticated plants and animals come in

1742
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:20,880
a period from ten thousand years ago to

1743
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,720
five thousand years ago

1744
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:24,559
ten thousand years ago to five thousand

1745
01:07:22,719 --> 01:07:26,399
years ago we've had none since really

1746
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:28,559
that amount to anything

1747
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:30,880
the big big big ones the sheep the

1748
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:34,160
cattle the goats the corn

1749
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:36,079
the maize i mean the corn wheat

1750
01:07:34,159 --> 01:07:39,358
barley all that came

1751
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:41,280
within that period stuff we really use

1752
01:07:39,358 --> 01:07:42,798
now how is that explained

1753
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:45,519
well in terms of the plants it's

1754
01:07:42,798 --> 01:07:46,880
explained this way somehow these stone

1755
01:07:45,519 --> 01:07:49,038
age people

1756
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:50,960
looked out of the cave one day

1757
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:53,839
and one of them got the bright idea that

1758
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:56,000
hey if we pull up some of these grasses

1759
01:07:53,838 --> 01:07:58,318
and grains and cereals that we're

1760
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:00,159
looking at which are out there today

1761
01:07:58,318 --> 01:08:02,880
in california

1762
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:05,279
with their little bitty tiny tiny seeds

1763
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:07,920
that are the size of pepper flakes

1764
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:11,680
or salt crystals

1765
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:14,798
and hard as salt crystals

1766
01:08:11,679 --> 01:08:16,479
and biochemically only suited to feeding

1767
01:08:14,798 --> 01:08:20,000
grazing animals

1768
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:22,718
this this stone age wizard got the idea

1769
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:24,880
hey if we pick through those little

1770
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:27,119
pepper flakes and soft bristles and pick

1771
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:28,719
out the biggest ones

1772
01:08:27,119 --> 01:08:31,599
and they're marginally bigger than the

1773
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:34,079
others and we plant them figuring out

1774
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:35,759
how to plant and grow and plant them and

1775
01:08:34,079 --> 01:08:37,679
make them produce

1776
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:38,880
and then we pick out the biggest ones of

1777
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:40,319
that

1778
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:41,359
then we're just

1779
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:46,080
over

1780
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:47,759
a couple of thousand years or more

1781
01:08:46,079 --> 01:08:50,079
over a couple thousand years or more

1782
01:08:47,759 --> 01:08:52,319
those little bitty pepper flake salt

1783
01:08:50,079 --> 01:08:54,960
crystal seeds will grow into something

1784
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:57,359
we can actually use you know seed easily

1785
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:58,880
and use in our hands they will soften

1786
01:08:57,359 --> 01:09:00,159
the seeds will soften and turn from

1787
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:02,798
rocks into something that we can

1788
01:09:00,158 --> 01:09:05,920
actually cook and eat and and the

1789
01:09:02,798 --> 01:09:08,158
biochemistry of them will change so that

1790
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:09,920
they're not suitable for

1791
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:13,278
animals anymore but they're suitable for

1792
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:15,440
us that our bodies can use

1793
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:17,759
it won't that be cool

1794
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:20,559
and that cave guy supposedly talked all

1795
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:22,238
his buddies into doing this

1796
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:23,759
and doing it for generation after

1797
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:26,399
generation after generation after

1798
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:28,798
generation planning and sewing and

1799
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:32,079
picking out the best and somehow doing

1800
01:09:28,798 --> 01:09:34,079
this something we can't do today

1801
01:09:32,079 --> 01:09:36,559
i've not been able to reproduce today

1802
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:38,798
but somehow these this genius did it and

1803
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:41,359
not only that multiple geniuses did it

1804
01:09:38,798 --> 01:09:43,519
because this was done all over the world

1805
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:46,480
in different places at different times

1806
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:49,040
within that 5 000 year window

1807
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:52,238
and you get things that go from being

1808
01:09:49,039 --> 01:09:53,439
these wild hearty grasses like teosinte

1809
01:09:52,238 --> 01:09:56,479
into

1810
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:58,158
from this to corn next slide and you go

1811
01:09:56,479 --> 01:09:59,759
from this hearty little perennial that

1812
01:09:58,158 --> 01:10:03,039
can just grow anywhere anytime doesn't

1813
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:05,280
need any um to this which is

1814
01:10:03,039 --> 01:10:07,359
riddled with genetic defects i mean

1815
01:10:05,279 --> 01:10:09,519
riddled to the point where it can't live

1816
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:12,479
by itself without human intervention

1817
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:14,480
corn as we know it that won't grow

1818
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:16,479
doesn't matter we need it we use it

1819
01:10:14,479 --> 01:10:19,839
we're happy to have it

1820
01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:22,879
but it is clearly not a natural

1821
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:27,199
not a natural species or anything

1822
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:27,199
this is natural this is very natural

1823
01:10:28,158 --> 01:10:32,158
same thing with wheat and ember early

1824
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:34,319
weed in them

1825
01:10:32,158 --> 01:10:35,759
same process where you go from these

1826
01:10:34,319 --> 01:10:37,039
little tiny

1827
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:39,520
grass-like

1828
01:10:37,039 --> 01:10:41,920
things into a much bigger seed a much

1829
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:43,600
plumper seed softer seed and its

1830
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:46,158
biochemistry changes from feeding

1831
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:47,600
animals to feeding us

1832
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:51,439
these these

1833
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:54,159
stone age geniuses somehow pull that off

1834
01:10:51,439 --> 01:10:56,479
and more than that next slide what every

1835
01:10:54,158 --> 01:10:58,238
what they had to do with every one of

1836
01:10:56,479 --> 01:10:59,759
the domesticated plants that they were

1837
01:10:58,238 --> 01:11:01,759
going to turn into greens and cereals

1838
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,480
and grass and little maturing food they

1839
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:05,039
had

1840
01:11:02,479 --> 01:11:07,359
to solve the problem of ranches and

1841
01:11:05,039 --> 01:11:10,399
blenders now blooms are

1842
01:11:07,359 --> 01:11:12,880
the husks that wrap around the seeds and

1843
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:15,279
raches are this area right here where

1844
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:18,719
they break off

1845
01:11:15,279 --> 01:11:21,359
now in the wild rages and blooms have a

1846
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:22,960
cycle where they're pretty tough when

1847
01:11:21,359 --> 01:11:25,359
the seed is broken

1848
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:27,840
to hold it on to the stem

1849
01:11:25,359 --> 01:11:30,238
during wind storms and rain and all that

1850
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:33,279
but as it matures and when it matures

1851
01:11:30,238 --> 01:11:35,279
they turn incredibly brittle

1852
01:11:33,279 --> 01:11:37,759
so that the seeds can propagate you know

1853
01:11:35,279 --> 01:11:39,599
you pick up a dandelion

1854
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:41,119
right that's that's the righteous

1855
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:43,360
letting go

1856
01:11:41,119 --> 01:11:45,920
inches and blooms the seed popping out

1857
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:47,920
of the moon the rage is letting it go

1858
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:49,679
that's how wild things are well if the

1859
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:51,840
rages in bloom stay the same it didn't

1860
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:53,199
matter how big it got you couldn't

1861
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:55,199
harvest it

1862
01:11:53,198 --> 01:11:57,039
because when it ripen what would happen

1863
01:11:55,198 --> 01:11:59,039
if you hit it with a scythe every one of

1864
01:11:57,039 --> 01:12:00,399
the seeds would drop on the ground

1865
01:11:59,039 --> 01:12:03,039
couldn't collect it

1866
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:04,000
somehow the rages had i mean the glooms

1867
01:12:03,039 --> 01:12:05,359
had to be

1868
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:08,079
made strengthened

1869
01:12:05,359 --> 01:12:08,799
past the period of ripening so that they

1870
01:12:08,079 --> 01:12:10,479
would

1871
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:12,560
they would hold together

1872
01:12:10,479 --> 01:12:14,799
during harvesting

1873
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:17,120
somehow the righteous had to do the same

1874
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:19,039
thing but the righteous had to be set so

1875
01:12:17,119 --> 01:12:20,880
that when you harvested it and got it

1876
01:12:19,039 --> 01:12:23,439
back to where you wanted to

1877
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:26,239
to thrash it and get the seeds out

1878
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:29,198
in the thrashing process the racists had

1879
01:12:26,238 --> 01:12:29,198
nowhere to let go

1880
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:35,920
it had to be perfect it had to be

1881
01:12:32,079 --> 01:12:39,198
precise for every single cereal grass

1882
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:40,960
and grain that was domesticated

1883
01:12:39,198 --> 01:12:42,960
so in addition to the biochemistry and

1884
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:44,800
the change in the cytosol you had to

1885
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:46,319
solve these two problems for each one

1886
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:48,640
each one was different each one had to

1887
01:12:46,319 --> 01:12:51,599
be perfect as perfect as the stones of

1888
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:53,520
the pyramid and they work

1889
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:56,640
and they work

1890
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:59,360
that's what's impossible to accept that

1891
01:12:56,640 --> 01:13:00,640
humans could have done this

1892
01:12:59,359 --> 01:13:02,238
impossible

1893
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:04,800
next slide

1894
01:13:02,238 --> 01:13:06,559
same thing with the animals except it's

1895
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:08,960
different instead of making

1896
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:10,880
little bitty seeds bigger

1897
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:13,198
and softer and all that they took big

1898
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:15,359
tough bad news animals and shrunk them

1899
01:13:13,198 --> 01:13:17,519
down made them gentle

1900
01:13:15,359 --> 01:13:20,079
gentle their spirits change them

1901
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:23,280
psychologically change their brains

1902
01:13:20,079 --> 01:13:25,760
wild goats domesticate again wild works

1903
01:13:23,279 --> 01:13:28,479
cattle domesticated cattle shrunk them

1904
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:30,159
down and made them docile and made them

1905
01:13:28,479 --> 01:13:32,799
domestic so

1906
01:13:30,158 --> 01:13:35,359
they could serve me

1907
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:37,520
give the gods their ease as it says in

1908
01:13:35,359 --> 01:13:38,880
the sumerian texts no doubt about it

1909
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:40,800
next slide

1910
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:43,520
same thing with pigs from

1911
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:45,039
wild boar to domesticated pig imagine

1912
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:48,480
bringing this sucker the first one and

1913
01:13:45,039 --> 01:13:50,560
what they say is of course the farmers

1914
01:13:48,479 --> 01:13:51,919
that were growing those domestic

1915
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:53,600
domesticating the plants were at the

1916
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:56,000
same time domesticating the animals

1917
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:58,079
another one had the right idea let's

1918
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,880
take these wild bad news animals bring

1919
01:13:58,079 --> 01:14:00,880
them in live with them

1920
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:06,800
and turn them into things we can use way

1921
01:14:04,238 --> 01:14:08,238
downstream from our lives

1922
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:10,480
not going to happen

1923
01:14:08,238 --> 01:14:12,718
absolutely absurd imagine the first guy

1924
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:15,439
bringing anything behind

1925
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:17,600
these big barks cattle bad news wolves

1926
01:14:15,439 --> 01:14:19,678
tournament of dogs just didn't gonna

1927
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:22,640
happen next slide

1928
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:23,600
the cheetah the king of domestication

1929
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:26,159
okay

1930
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:29,039
this if nothing else proves it this does

1931
01:14:26,158 --> 01:14:30,719
that genetic engineering took place in

1932
01:14:29,039 --> 01:14:34,238
the distant past

1933
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:37,920
the cheetah is a hunting cat a cat

1934
01:14:34,238 --> 01:14:40,238
designed to hunt at a very high level of

1935
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:41,440
efficiency not that cats aren't good

1936
01:14:40,238 --> 01:14:43,678
hunters

1937
01:14:41,439 --> 01:14:45,759
but nothing is like the cheetah on the

1938
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:48,399
savannah

1939
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:49,360
it's the fastest animal in the world by

1940
01:14:48,399 --> 01:14:51,920
far

1941
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:53,839
70 miles an hour

1942
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:58,079
70 miles an hour

1943
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:59,440
good resource of 140 top speed

1944
01:14:58,079 --> 01:15:02,479
okay

1945
01:14:59,439 --> 01:15:04,479
not only that it is designed to hunt

1946
01:15:02,479 --> 01:15:06,559
it's got a different aerodynamically

1947
01:15:04,479 --> 01:15:08,479
designed body more like a greyhound than

1948
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:10,800
a true cat you know how heavy lions and

1949
01:15:08,479 --> 01:15:13,599
tigers and all the hunting cats are this

1950
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:14,960
one is slimmed down like a dog like like

1951
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,880
a greyhound

1952
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:19,679
more than that it's got a different

1953
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:22,000
attitude it doesn't have a cat attitude

1954
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:24,079
it's one of the very first domesticated

1955
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:27,359
animals we have records of it going back

1956
01:15:24,079 --> 01:15:30,319
almost to 10 000 years ago in asia india

1957
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:32,238
and africa it was very widespread very

1958
01:15:30,319 --> 01:15:33,599
tame the pharaohs used to hunt with

1959
01:15:32,238 --> 01:15:36,639
these guys

1960
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:38,400
okay they were hunting in animals

1961
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:40,800
designed for that purpose

1962
01:15:38,399 --> 01:15:43,759
there has never been a report of a

1963
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:47,119
cheetah attacking and killing a human

1964
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:51,199
they have dog mentality

1965
01:15:47,119 --> 01:15:52,800
in cat bodies they have dog-like bodies

1966
01:15:51,198 --> 01:15:55,279
in the sense that the bones are much

1967
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:57,440
lighter the lungs have been modified the

1968
01:15:55,279 --> 01:16:00,559
breathing rate has been modified like no

1969
01:15:57,439 --> 01:16:03,359
other dog nor the cat

1970
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:04,840
but more importantly than that yet this

1971
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:06,719
they have dog

1972
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:10,560
feet

1973
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:13,198
with cat feet soft pads and retractable

1974
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:14,880
claws you can't make a turn at 70 miles

1975
01:16:13,198 --> 01:16:17,839
an hour

1976
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:20,719
but with a dog foot a thick heavy pad

1977
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:23,039
and a permanently extended claws

1978
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:25,840
you're running on track shoes you can

1979
01:16:23,039 --> 01:16:30,158
turn at 70 miles an hour

1980
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:33,360
the cheetah among all cats has dog feet

1981
01:16:30,158 --> 01:16:35,920
more than that you see this brown fur

1982
01:16:33,359 --> 01:16:37,920
that's short-haired dog fur

1983
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:40,239
steals black spots

1984
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:42,640
cat fur

1985
01:16:40,238 --> 01:16:45,279
cheetahs sit like a dog

1986
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:48,840
they get dog-only diseases they get

1987
01:16:45,279 --> 01:16:48,840
caffeine diseases

1988
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:53,679
now as if that isn't bizarre enough

1989
01:16:51,439 --> 01:16:56,000
about cheetahs guess what they all have

1990
01:16:53,679 --> 01:17:00,640
the same dna

1991
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:04,560
same chromosome package they're clones

1992
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:07,199
you can take a cheetah from africa

1993
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:08,960
and you can take a cheetah from asia

1994
01:17:07,198 --> 01:17:12,079
you could strip their skin off of them

1995
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:13,760
and swap the skin and it would heal

1996
01:17:12,079 --> 01:17:15,439
you could trade hearts

1997
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:18,480
no rejection

1998
01:17:15,439 --> 01:17:18,479
they're all the same

1999
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:21,199
now

2000
01:17:19,439 --> 01:17:22,238
when faced with this evidence what do

2001
01:17:21,198 --> 01:17:24,000
you think

2002
01:17:22,238 --> 01:17:25,519
the darwinists and the geneticists and

2003
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,198
the scientists said what do you think

2004
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:28,880
they came up with

2005
01:17:27,198 --> 01:17:30,799
there had to be an answer and it got to

2006
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:31,600
be a natural answer so they came up with

2007
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:34,480
one

2008
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:36,960
these cheetahs got squeezed through a

2009
01:17:34,479 --> 01:17:39,759
bottleneck a genetic bottleneck and

2010
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:43,439
here's the bottleneck somehow

2011
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:45,920
somehow before 10 000 years ago

2012
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:49,599
every cheetah on earth

2013
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:52,480
in asia india africa all of them died

2014
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:54,800
except for one breeding pair or just a

2015
01:17:52,479 --> 01:17:54,799
couple

2016
01:17:55,279 --> 01:18:01,198
and then they repopulated from those

2017
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:02,880
that's why they all have the same teams

2018
01:18:01,198 --> 01:18:04,719
because it came from scene two original

2019
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:06,719
ones

2020
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:08,480
isn't that plausible doesn't that make

2021
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:10,560
sense

2022
01:18:08,479 --> 01:18:13,678
no of course not

2023
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:15,520
it's just an excuse

2024
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:17,279
and yet it's taught as preachers believe

2025
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:18,880
like everything else they put out it's

2026
01:18:17,279 --> 01:18:21,439
garbage

2027
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:23,039
our next slide

2028
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:24,319
there you're looking at

2029
01:18:23,039 --> 01:18:25,760
somebody else who got put through a

2030
01:18:24,319 --> 01:18:28,000
bottleneck

2031
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:30,000
we've got put through a bottom same

2032
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:32,719
thing everybody in this room has been

2033
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,880
put through the same kind of bottleneck

2034
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:38,319
that the cheetahs went through why

2035
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:41,039
because in 1987 as you see here

2036
01:18:38,319 --> 01:18:44,000
newsweek magazine it was found by a

2037
01:18:41,039 --> 01:18:45,279
study of mitochondrial dna of women

2038
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,359
around the world

2039
01:18:45,279 --> 01:18:50,079
women have carried women

2040
01:18:47,359 --> 01:18:51,920
produced and carried mitochondrial dna

2041
01:18:50,079 --> 01:18:54,719
forward we all have it we must have it

2042
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:56,800
but we don't pass it on he passes on

2043
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:58,719
through the egg so they did a study of

2044
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:00,320
women around the world and they found

2045
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:03,198
that

2046
01:19:00,319 --> 01:19:05,599
we did not in fact descend from any

2047
01:19:03,198 --> 01:19:07,039
creatures four million years ago which

2048
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:09,520
is what they went into the experiment

2049
01:19:07,039 --> 01:19:12,079
looking to prove was it closer to five

2050
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:14,239
or eight or you know when did we really

2051
01:19:12,079 --> 01:19:15,920
separate from our last common ancestor

2052
01:19:14,238 --> 01:19:17,839
with the apes as it was believed at the

2053
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:19,600
time

2054
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:22,640
they found that

2055
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:25,280
the oldest of us

2056
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:26,400
the oldest dogs were only about 200 000

2057
01:19:25,279 --> 01:19:30,319
years old

2058
01:19:26,399 --> 01:19:32,399
200 000 not millions of years old we

2059
01:19:30,319 --> 01:19:35,279
were like brand new

2060
01:19:32,399 --> 01:19:38,559
a brand new species which matches up

2061
01:19:35,279 --> 01:19:41,759
pretty well with the promagnons at 120

2062
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:44,800
000 years ago if our mitochondrial dna

2063
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:47,039
says we're only between 150 and 200 000

2064
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:49,440
years old that matches up pretty well

2065
01:19:47,039 --> 01:19:51,600
when our apostles begin to appear

2066
01:19:49,439 --> 01:19:54,399
and furthermore the oldest of us come

2067
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:56,400
from southern africa

2068
01:19:54,399 --> 01:19:58,399
making avenue black

2069
01:19:56,399 --> 01:20:00,079
if there was

2070
01:19:58,399 --> 01:20:03,519
you can imagine how this went over in

2071
01:20:00,079 --> 01:20:04,960
the south of the united states

2072
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:07,120
but nonetheless that's the way it would

2073
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:08,800
be the oldest of us come from southern

2074
01:20:07,119 --> 01:20:11,840
africa

2075
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:12,880
and we only start up as a species around

2076
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:15,119
100

2077
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:16,960
50 to 200 000 years ago so what does

2078
01:20:15,119 --> 01:20:19,279
that mean just like the cheetahs

2079
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:21,039
all of us got wiped out

2080
01:20:19,279 --> 01:20:24,079
and you know that we have

2081
01:20:21,039 --> 01:20:25,679
animal rectus all over there you know in

2082
01:20:24,079 --> 01:20:27,198
india and china

2083
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:28,880
in asia

2084
01:20:27,198 --> 01:20:30,879
and in africa

2085
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:33,440
all of those got wiped out

2086
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:36,400
the ones that were going to become us

2087
01:20:33,439 --> 01:20:38,319
leaving only a couple or a couple of

2088
01:20:36,399 --> 01:20:40,000
pairs

2089
01:20:38,319 --> 01:20:41,840
to produce us within the last two

2090
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:43,679
hundred thousand years same bottleneck

2091
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:44,639
same kind of story that worked with the

2092
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:46,480
cheetah

2093
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:49,119
they it to work with us and it has

2094
01:20:46,479 --> 01:20:51,678
worked people just you know

2095
01:20:49,119 --> 01:20:51,679
no question

2096
01:20:52,079 --> 01:20:59,198
well it's not true we we are supposedly

2097
01:20:56,158 --> 01:21:02,000
descended from primates and yet

2098
01:20:59,198 --> 01:21:03,599
all of this about us is not the same

2099
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,840
we don't have the same bones same

2100
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:08,480
muscles same skin same adipose tissue

2101
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:10,000
same body hair patterns head hair and

2102
01:21:08,479 --> 01:21:11,519
nails and different

2103
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,039
skulls and brains are different

2104
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:15,040
locomotion is different speech is

2105
01:21:13,039 --> 01:21:18,479
different sex is different genetic

2106
01:21:15,039 --> 01:21:20,639
disorders we have over 4 000 genetic

2107
01:21:18,479 --> 01:21:22,799
disorders folks

2108
01:21:20,639 --> 01:21:25,039
how would we get over 4 000 genetic

2109
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:28,880
disorders work into the whole gene pool

2110
01:21:25,039 --> 01:21:31,600
in only a couple hundred thousand years

2111
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:34,000
when you consider that at least two

2112
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:35,920
dozen of them actually two dozen by 24

2113
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,119
or 25

2114
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:38,079
kill you

2115
01:21:37,119 --> 01:21:40,158
dead

2116
01:21:38,079 --> 01:21:44,238
before you reach the age of maturity

2117
01:21:40,158 --> 01:21:45,920
before you can pass that on before you

2118
01:21:44,238 --> 01:21:48,799
can reproduce

2119
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:51,600
how does a disorder like that

2120
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:55,760
get into the whole gene pool how can you

2121
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:58,000
find it among eskimos and watuses

2122
01:21:55,760 --> 01:22:00,320
there's only one way

2123
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:02,319
they were put there and put there just

2124
01:22:00,319 --> 01:22:04,639
like the corn's genetic disorder just

2125
01:22:02,319 --> 01:22:06,238
like other domesticated plants and

2126
01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:08,239
domesticated animals and genetic

2127
01:22:06,238 --> 01:22:10,718
disorders were put there because they

2128
01:22:08,238 --> 01:22:12,319
were the results of cutting and splicing

2129
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:14,880
in a lab

2130
01:22:12,319 --> 01:22:16,559
as they were being put together mistakes

2131
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:19,119
get made

2132
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:22,400
it's the only way you get

2133
01:22:19,119 --> 01:22:24,800
that many genetic disorders and genetic

2134
01:22:22,399 --> 01:22:27,439
disorders that kill you before you can

2135
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:27,440
reproduce

2136
01:22:28,238 --> 01:22:33,039
but most importantly our chromosome

2137
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:36,000
package has been reduced from 48

2138
01:22:33,039 --> 01:22:39,238
chromosomes with all other primates

2139
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:39,238
to 46.

2140
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:44,880
how do we go

2141
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:46,880
for to be so much better supposedly

2142
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:48,800
while losing two full chromosomes that's

2143
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:50,400
a lot of dna

2144
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:52,159
how could that happen

2145
01:22:50,399 --> 01:22:53,839
next slide well we look and we see a

2146
01:22:52,158 --> 01:22:55,519
comparison of human chimp drill and

2147
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:58,000
orangutan and you see that as you've

2148
01:22:55,520 --> 01:23:00,880
heard there's a lot of similarities a

2149
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:03,279
lot of similarities between us and so

2150
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:05,600
they use this as an argument to say well

2151
01:23:03,279 --> 01:23:06,479
you know it's clear that we evolve from

2152
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:09,120
them

2153
01:23:06,479 --> 01:23:12,799
because our gene package is so close

2154
01:23:09,119 --> 01:23:16,800
it's only that funny little change

2155
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:18,880
from 48 chromosomes to 46.

2156
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:20,880
a little bump in the road but otherwise

2157
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:23,199
it's clear to see that we evolve from

2158
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:24,159
that but let's look at that change next

2159
01:23:23,198 --> 01:23:25,759
slide

2160
01:23:24,158 --> 01:23:27,920
here we see it in

2161
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:29,360
just so happens the second and third

2162
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:30,960
chromosome with the champ and the

2163
01:23:29,359 --> 01:23:32,158
gorilla and orangutan they're separate

2164
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:33,119
but with us

2165
01:23:32,158 --> 01:23:35,599
look

2166
01:23:33,119 --> 01:23:38,719
they've been fused

2167
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:41,520
fused two genes fused

2168
01:23:38,719 --> 01:23:44,158
this doesn't happen in nature

2169
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:45,679
that's only done in the lab

2170
01:23:44,158 --> 01:23:48,559
you don't see that anywhere else but in

2171
01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:51,600
the lab just like you don't see the

2172
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:55,520
cheetahs chromosomal similarity anywhere

2173
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:58,159
but in a lab a genetics lab lab rats

2174
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:58,159
clones

2175
01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:01,440
we

2176
01:23:59,359 --> 01:24:03,920
just like darwin said

2177
01:24:01,439 --> 01:24:06,719
are domesticated animals created to

2178
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:06,719
serve a purpose

2179
01:24:08,158 --> 01:24:12,399
five the super race whoever you want to

2180
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:15,039
call them

2181
01:24:12,399 --> 01:24:17,439
who were here and who built the pyramids

2182
01:24:15,039 --> 01:24:20,220
and created the domesticated plants and

2183
01:24:17,439 --> 01:24:34,869
created the domesticated animals

2184
01:24:20,220 --> 01:24:36,100

[Music]

2190
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:08,800
this is the storchild skull antrina's

2191
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:11,840
question the star child is composed

2192
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:14,800
undeniably mammalian bone with the major

2193
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:18,000
human components evident from the bone

2194
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:19,840
sphenoid temporal parietal and occipital

2195
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:21,920
back here

2196
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:24,159
however each part is profoundly

2197
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:26,560
redesigned with the bone itself

2198
01:26:24,158 --> 01:26:29,359
astonishingly reconstituted into

2199
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:31,760
something uniformly less than one half

2200
01:26:29,359 --> 01:26:33,839
as thick as normal weighing one half as

2201
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:35,760
much as it should it feels kind of a dry

2202
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:37,600
gourd in your hand right and by the way

2203
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:40,079
the model is the same weight so you'll

2204
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:42,400
see right the real human skull you see

2205
01:26:40,079 --> 01:26:45,600
how thin that bone is there

2206
01:26:42,399 --> 01:26:48,839
it's like that all over

2207
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:51,280
weighs half as much half as thin it's

2208
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:55,360
incredible uniform

2209
01:26:51,279 --> 01:26:57,599
taking 30 points of reference on it 0.1

2210
01:26:55,359 --> 01:26:59,439
30 points of reference on it and

2211
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:01,600
comparing them to the average of those

2212
01:26:59,439 --> 01:27:04,319
same 30 points on 100 normal skulls the

2213
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:07,039
result calls 10 standard deviations from

2214
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:09,599
the statistical norm off the chart the

2215
01:27:07,039 --> 01:27:12,158
next slide suggests but do not yet prove

2216
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:14,960
that the star child is from a me other

2217
01:27:12,158 --> 01:27:17,279
than a normal human

2218
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:18,639
this is significant folks

2219
01:27:17,279 --> 01:27:21,439
next slide

2220
01:27:18,639 --> 01:27:24,480
what we see in comparison of the two

2221
01:27:21,439 --> 01:27:25,919
skulls that were found is that they're

2222
01:27:24,479 --> 01:27:28,000
completely different now let me give you

2223
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:30,000
the background on how they were found

2224
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:33,279
about 1930

2225
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:35,279
a woman a young girl about 15 years old

2226
01:27:33,279 --> 01:27:37,119
of mexican heritage was taken by her

2227
01:27:35,279 --> 01:27:39,279
parents to visit the old family

2228
01:27:37,119 --> 01:27:41,279
homestead in a small village about a

2229
01:27:39,279 --> 01:27:43,198
hundred miles southwest of chihuahua we

2230
01:27:41,279 --> 01:27:45,840
do not know exactly where that building

2231
01:27:43,198 --> 01:27:47,759
was so we can't just run back there we

2232
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:50,639
think we can find it we don't know it at

2233
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:53,679
this point there it was but at that

2234
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:56,319
village she was told not to go into the

2235
01:27:53,679 --> 01:27:58,319
caves and the mine tunnels in the air

2236
01:27:56,319 --> 01:27:59,679
that number one it was dangerous number

2237
01:27:58,319 --> 01:28:02,799
two it was just forbidden there was

2238
01:27:59,679 --> 01:28:02,800
taboo don't do it

2239
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:08,239
tell most any teenager anywhere what not

2240
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:10,079
to do and you know

2241
01:28:08,238 --> 01:28:11,919
find a way to try to do it

2242
01:28:10,079 --> 01:28:13,279
so she snuck off

2243
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:15,520
and went explore

2244
01:28:13,279 --> 01:28:19,840
and she went into a mine tunnel and she

2245
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:21,840
found a human skeleton lying on its back

2246
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:23,679
and she got close to it she noticed that

2247
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:25,440
there was what she called a misshapen

2248
01:28:23,679 --> 01:28:27,520
hand

2249
01:28:25,439 --> 01:28:28,399
coming up out of the dirt beside that

2250
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:29,920
skeleton

2251
01:28:28,399 --> 01:28:32,079
lying on the ground

2252
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:34,239
and that hand was wrapped around the

2253
01:28:32,079 --> 01:28:36,399
upper arm bottom

2254
01:28:34,238 --> 01:28:38,718
of the human skeleton

2255
01:28:36,399 --> 01:28:41,839
and she noticed as she got even closer

2256
01:28:38,719 --> 01:28:44,639
that the dirt was all crumbly and

2257
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:46,880
beside the skeleton and over that hand

2258
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:50,000
that was coming up so using your own

2259
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:51,359
hands and this bears out because in a

2260
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,960
mine tunnel there would have been no

2261
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:54,639
rain there would have been no compacting

2262
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:56,399
in the soil and it would have been as

2263
01:28:54,639 --> 01:28:59,119
loose as the day

2264
01:28:56,399 --> 01:29:01,359
that the grade was dug which we know

2265
01:28:59,119 --> 01:29:04,238
from carbon 14 testing of both these

2266
01:29:01,359 --> 01:29:06,238
skulls was 900 years ago plus or minus

2267
01:29:04,238 --> 01:29:08,559
four years those skulls tested out that

2268
01:29:06,238 --> 01:29:11,759
way so we're pretty likely that this

2269
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:14,159
story is true so with her own hand she

2270
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:15,119
dug out and she found the full skeleton

2271
01:29:14,158 --> 01:29:17,039
there

2272
01:29:15,119 --> 01:29:19,519
and she said that it was smaller than

2273
01:29:17,039 --> 01:29:21,840
the human and the human is about a five

2274
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:23,360
foot tall female so the skull the

2275
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:24,719
skeleton would have been about four feet

2276
01:29:23,359 --> 01:29:27,279
tall

2277
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:29,119
and that it had a misshapen body

2278
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:30,960
that's all she said because she didn't

2279
01:29:29,119 --> 01:29:32,479
know that some years after her death it

2280
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:35,679
would be important

2281
01:29:32,479 --> 01:29:38,158
but she from the age of 15 she smuggled

2282
01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:39,920
the two skulls not the full skeletons

2283
01:29:38,158 --> 01:29:41,920
just the two skulls

2284
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:44,319
back to the states

2285
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:46,800
shellacked both skulls on the outside

2286
01:29:44,319 --> 01:29:48,639
you see that shine is from shellac

2287
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:49,920
put them in a cardboard box and just

2288
01:29:48,639 --> 01:29:51,119
kept it

2289
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:53,600
until it came

2290
01:29:51,119 --> 01:29:55,599
time for her to die in the early 90s and

2291
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:57,039
she willed them to another couple

2292
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:59,199
friends of hers

2293
01:29:57,039 --> 01:30:01,439
they put that box in their garage and

2294
01:29:59,198 --> 01:30:02,238
kept it for five years but it didn't

2295
01:30:01,439 --> 01:30:04,158
like

2296
01:30:02,238 --> 01:30:06,718
two skulls and a cardboard box in their

2297
01:30:04,158 --> 01:30:07,920
garage so he said the wife said find

2298
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:10,000
somebody else

2299
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:12,399
so they had a younger couple that they

2300
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:15,039
knew that were ufo

2301
01:30:12,399 --> 01:30:17,039
knowledgeable they were into ufo stuff

2302
01:30:15,039 --> 01:30:18,560
and they showed them this call

2303
01:30:17,039 --> 01:30:20,960
but we showed them hostile they said

2304
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:20,960
would you like

2305
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:33,199
so they did

2306
01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:35,279
and they contacted me because of my work

2307
01:30:33,198 --> 01:30:37,919
in human origins that you saw i was

2308
01:30:35,279 --> 01:30:38,800
already known for my work with skulls

2309
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:40,239
and

2310
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:42,320
bones already

2311
01:30:40,238 --> 01:30:43,198
so they contacted me and they said could

2312
01:30:42,319 --> 01:30:45,359
you

2313
01:30:43,198 --> 01:30:48,399
take this and get it tested by

2314
01:30:45,359 --> 01:30:50,238
scientists to find out what it is

2315
01:30:48,399 --> 01:30:52,158
and i said yeah sure this is so cool

2316
01:30:50,238 --> 01:30:54,959
this is so unique this is so different i

2317
01:30:52,158 --> 01:30:57,279
mean an idiot can see

2318
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:59,198
that surely scientists will jump all

2319
01:30:57,279 --> 01:31:02,238
over this and we'll have this tested out

2320
01:30:59,198 --> 01:31:04,479
probably within six months or so which

2321
01:31:02,238 --> 01:31:06,638
could have been the case if scientists

2322
01:31:04,479 --> 01:31:09,039
were really scientists interested in

2323
01:31:06,639 --> 01:31:10,400
finding out truth or not

2324
01:31:09,039 --> 01:31:12,319
they're interested in keeping their

2325
01:31:10,399 --> 01:31:15,039
peers off their necks

2326
01:31:12,319 --> 01:31:17,359
and covering their bodies

2327
01:31:15,039 --> 01:31:19,760
and so we couldn't get the help that we

2328
01:31:17,359 --> 01:31:21,679
wanted and anticipated and so now here

2329
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:24,159
we are instead of six months down the

2330
01:31:21,679 --> 01:31:25,679
road with answers we will

2331
01:31:24,158 --> 01:31:28,238
be six years

2332
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:30,719
six years

2333
01:31:28,238 --> 01:31:32,559
geez it is sorry it's a visual

2334
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:34,560
performance by everybody involved

2335
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:35,760
including myself not much of a

2336
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:38,080
fundraiser

2337
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:40,079
i just don't know how to do that glad

2338
01:31:38,079 --> 01:31:41,519
any kind of thing that fundraisers do i

2339
01:31:40,079 --> 01:31:43,679
just put it out there and tell people

2340
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:45,120
here's what we need here's what we why

2341
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:46,560
we needed

2342
01:31:45,119 --> 01:31:47,679
i expect them to cough it up and they

2343
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:50,080
never do

2344
01:31:47,679 --> 01:31:51,119
because it turns out that in the states

2345
01:31:50,079 --> 01:31:52,960
at least

2346
01:31:51,119 --> 01:31:55,359
the ufo community

2347
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:57,600
is very social

2348
01:31:55,359 --> 01:31:59,198
they like the game they don't want the

2349
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:01,199
game over with

2350
01:31:59,198 --> 01:32:02,479
they all say they do they all say they

2351
01:32:01,198 --> 01:32:03,919
want answers

2352
01:32:02,479 --> 01:32:06,238
and you present them with something that

2353
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:08,719
might provide answers might really

2354
01:32:06,238 --> 01:32:10,799
absolutely convince everybody that this

2355
01:32:08,719 --> 01:32:13,198
is a real phenomena

2356
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:16,800
and they skitter the other way they

2357
01:32:13,198 --> 01:32:18,879
don't want the party to be over

2358
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:20,159
and that's a fact that's what i found to

2359
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:21,760
be the case

2360
01:32:20,158 --> 01:32:24,719
you can argue with that if you want to

2361
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:27,679
but that's my experience

2362
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:29,439
it's fun it's a social thing and they

2363
01:32:27,679 --> 01:32:32,079
don't want it and so they don't really

2364
01:32:29,439 --> 01:32:34,000
support it very well

2365
01:32:32,079 --> 01:32:35,600
so that's why i'm talking to you almost

2366
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:37,520
six years later

2367
01:32:35,600 --> 01:32:39,039
and you're still struggling but for one

2368
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:42,639
woman it would be over with and this

2369
01:32:39,039 --> 01:32:45,039
would be back in the you know unboxing

2370
01:32:42,639 --> 01:32:47,600
but for one moment

2371
01:32:45,039 --> 01:32:49,760
okay now when you look at the two things

2372
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:51,440
that's that's the back story that's how

2373
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:52,800
it all came to be when you look at two

2374
01:32:51,439 --> 01:32:54,559
things the first thing you notice

2375
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:56,960
obviously is the eyesight

2376
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:58,960
if i stick my finger in a human eyesight

2377
01:32:56,960 --> 01:33:00,639
yours line anyways don't go about that

2378
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:02,319
deep about two inches

2379
01:33:00,639 --> 01:33:04,239
our eye sockets are deeper and bigger

2380
01:33:02,319 --> 01:33:06,000
than you suspect

2381
01:33:04,238 --> 01:33:09,119
put them in the star child as you'll see

2382
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:12,079
for yourself it'll go maybe up to there

2383
01:33:09,119 --> 01:33:14,559
not quite an inch at a steepest point as

2384
01:33:12,079 --> 01:33:16,960
you notice the optic framings where the

2385
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:19,199
occupant opening blood vessels and all

2386
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:21,359
are come into or back at the center of

2387
01:33:19,198 --> 01:33:23,279
the cone in the back they've been pushed

2388
01:33:21,359 --> 01:33:24,799
down at the bottom here if this thing

2389
01:33:23,279 --> 01:33:27,599
has eyes like we do they're sitting

2390
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:27,600
about right here

2391
01:33:27,679 --> 01:33:31,760
rather than

2392
01:33:29,198 --> 01:33:34,238
back in deep like out but if it has eyes

2393
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:36,400
like we do because it's so shallow

2394
01:33:34,238 --> 01:33:37,759
they're sticking off the face like frog

2395
01:33:36,399 --> 01:33:39,679
eyes

2396
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:41,440
in a very dangerous position for a kid

2397
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:42,719
growing up just doing the normal things

2398
01:33:41,439 --> 01:33:45,198
that kids do

2399
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:47,279
and get popped right out of their head

2400
01:33:45,198 --> 01:33:49,678
so maybe it doesn't even have eyes quite

2401
01:33:47,279 --> 01:33:52,479
like we have

2402
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:54,719
but one thing significant about it is

2403
01:33:52,479 --> 01:33:56,158
when you take this and anybody any any

2404
01:33:54,719 --> 01:33:58,239
specialist that will say anything about

2405
01:33:56,158 --> 01:34:01,039
it they'll say well it looks like

2406
01:33:58,238 --> 01:34:03,198
i mean look like it's got to be as

2407
01:34:01,039 --> 01:34:06,158
bigfoot can't be real and the cheetah

2408
01:34:03,198 --> 01:34:09,279
and all that it's got to be

2409
01:34:06,158 --> 01:34:10,319
got to be some kind of genetic

2410
01:34:09,279 --> 01:34:12,960
or

2411
01:34:10,319 --> 01:34:14,238
birth defect genetic defect and birth

2412
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:16,480
defect because that's the only two

2413
01:34:14,238 --> 01:34:17,439
possibilities now let's look at it for a

2414
01:34:16,479 --> 01:34:19,519
minute

2415
01:34:17,439 --> 01:34:21,678
genetic defect

2416
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:23,520
no genetic defect produces anything

2417
01:34:21,679 --> 01:34:25,520
approaching this we've looked at every

2418
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:27,040
manual every book every

2419
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:29,440
thing we can find

2420
01:34:27,039 --> 01:34:31,279
and not just me we have a craniofacial

2421
01:34:29,439 --> 01:34:33,198
plastic surgeon named ted robinson in

2422
01:34:31,279 --> 01:34:36,399
canada who spent six weeks trying to

2423
01:34:33,198 --> 01:34:39,119
find anything similar to this can't find

2424
01:34:36,399 --> 01:34:41,359
a genetic defect that produces anything

2425
01:34:39,119 --> 01:34:44,000
like these effects

2426
01:34:41,359 --> 01:34:45,599
so eliminate genetic defects you take it

2427
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:50,399
to any specialist and they'll all say

2428
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:51,920
the same thing that that birth defects

2429
01:34:50,399 --> 01:34:54,319
one time only

2430
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:57,480
sperm egg misconnects

2431
01:34:54,319 --> 01:35:01,359
are capable of producing anything

2432
01:34:57,479 --> 01:35:03,919
absolutely anything is possible

2433
01:35:01,359 --> 01:35:05,519
it's just like this huge big garbage bin

2434
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:07,679
where they can dump anything they don't

2435
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:09,199
want to deal with

2436
01:35:07,679 --> 01:35:11,920
birth defect

2437
01:35:09,198 --> 01:35:14,638
one time only sperm egg misconduct but

2438
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:18,000
in fact there are rules to that game

2439
01:35:14,639 --> 01:35:20,239
sperm egg misconnects everything is ugly

2440
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:22,960
everything is asymmetrical

2441
01:35:20,238 --> 01:35:24,879
nothing is all encompassing nothing is

2442
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:26,880
all unconstant now you can have

2443
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:28,319
something born completely without a head

2444
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:30,319
you can have something born completely

2445
01:35:28,319 --> 01:35:32,000
without a brain you've heard of those

2446
01:35:30,319 --> 01:35:32,799
i'm sure

2447
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:35,439
but

2448
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:37,679
normally they don't live they're dead

2449
01:35:35,439 --> 01:35:39,599
out of a shooting

2450
01:35:37,679 --> 01:35:42,399
this thing lived

2451
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:43,679
and lived apparently for quite some time

2452
01:35:42,399 --> 01:35:46,799
as it was

2453
01:35:43,679 --> 01:35:49,600
well 900 years ago plus or minus 40

2454
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:52,960
years you were born in a primitive

2455
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:54,800
isolated village in mexico and you had

2456
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:57,600
one thing wrong with you you had a cleft

2457
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:59,600
palate you might make

2458
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:01,280
you had two things wrong with your face

2459
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:04,079
and your head

2460
01:36:01,279 --> 01:36:05,840
you were now skating on thin ice they

2461
01:36:04,079 --> 01:36:08,719
might choose not to keep you and start

2462
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:10,319
over with some new ones

2463
01:36:08,719 --> 01:36:13,279
you were born with three things wrong

2464
01:36:10,319 --> 01:36:15,039
with your head you were done for life

2465
01:36:13,279 --> 01:36:16,960
you were a faulty copy and you were

2466
01:36:15,039 --> 01:36:20,399
gotten rid of it that's another reason

2467
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:22,480
why we don't have 4000 genetic disorders

2468
01:36:20,399 --> 01:36:25,118
in a natural way because

2469
01:36:22,479 --> 01:36:27,759
nature weeds out the defects

2470
01:36:25,118 --> 01:36:30,319
and all animals parents get rid of the

2471
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:32,880
faulty cockpits and humans did that too

2472
01:36:30,319 --> 01:36:35,198
only up until recent times infanticide

2473
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:39,039
was not a problem in the old days if you

2474
01:36:35,198 --> 01:36:39,039
had a faulty copy you got rid of it and

2475
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:46,320
so

2476
01:36:44,399 --> 01:36:48,960
that being the case

2477
01:36:46,319 --> 01:36:51,198
one would have to argue that

2478
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:52,399
something with everything wrong with its

2479
01:36:51,198 --> 01:36:53,599
head

2480
01:36:52,399 --> 01:36:56,799
everything

2481
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:59,440
there's nothing right about this

2482
01:36:56,800 --> 01:37:01,440
nothing the same except the parts

2483
01:36:59,439 --> 01:37:02,879
would not have been kept would not be

2484
01:37:01,439 --> 01:37:04,559
allowed to live

2485
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:05,679
could have lived

2486
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:09,119
and yet

2487
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:11,279
not only that it is symmetrical

2488
01:37:09,118 --> 01:37:13,599
it's not asymmetrical it's not ugly it's

2489
01:37:11,279 --> 01:37:15,679
not lopsided

2490
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:18,239
like any other birth defect that you see

2491
01:37:15,679 --> 01:37:20,960
the skeleton of if you see it

2492
01:37:18,238 --> 01:37:23,519
it's wonderfully well put together she's

2493
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:25,600
put together different its genes told it

2494
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:28,800
to grow in a completely different way

2495
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:31,199
furthermore it's so subtle

2496
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:33,039
it's so subtle and it's symmetry that

2497
01:37:31,198 --> 01:37:34,559
you can look at these eye sockets and

2498
01:37:33,039 --> 01:37:36,800
you can look at the copy and see you can

2499
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:39,440
look at it and you cannot see anything

2500
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:41,840
other than my nice smooth scoop in both

2501
01:37:39,439 --> 01:37:43,678
of them your eyes

2502
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:45,279
see nothing but smoothness but yet you

2503
01:37:43,679 --> 01:37:47,359
put your fingers your fingers are much

2504
01:37:45,279 --> 01:37:49,039
more sensitive

2505
01:37:47,359 --> 01:37:51,039
you put your fingers in here you can

2506
01:37:49,039 --> 01:37:52,560
feel a dent right here

2507
01:37:51,039 --> 01:37:54,319
right here

2508
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:55,520
drag your finger at this angle right

2509
01:37:54,319 --> 01:37:58,079
here

2510
01:37:55,520 --> 01:38:00,400
you'll feel a little rise right in here

2511
01:37:58,079 --> 01:38:03,760
right here and you'll sit back down into

2512
01:38:00,399 --> 01:38:08,158
another little dent right here

2513
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:08,159
absolutely perfect on both sides

2514
01:38:08,319 --> 01:38:13,519
absolutely perfect and subtlety shifts

2515
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:16,480
the train of the eyesight

2516
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:17,760
no possibility that that is a defect

2517
01:38:16,479 --> 01:38:18,959
causing this

2518
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:20,960
one

2519
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:22,480
its genes told it to grow this way if

2520
01:38:20,960 --> 01:38:25,198
this genes told it to grow this way

2521
01:38:22,479 --> 01:38:27,439
those genes are not human

2522
01:38:25,198 --> 01:38:29,919
this is not the way humans look

2523
01:38:27,439 --> 01:38:33,279
this is not the thickness of human bone

2524
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:33,279
this is not the weight of you

2525
01:38:34,158 --> 01:38:38,319
oh excuse me

2526
01:38:36,479 --> 01:38:39,919
behind in here people that know the

2527
01:38:38,319 --> 01:38:42,000
gossip

2528
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:42,880
um before they also look at this

2529
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,760
holes

2530
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:47,520
for

2531
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:48,800
yeah it's in here you can see it right

2532
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:51,360
there

2533
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:51,360
they're in there

2534
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:56,238
the pictures aren't always revealing of

2535
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:58,719
everything but the optic nerve holes are

2536
01:38:56,238 --> 01:39:00,158
in fact there and both of them and yeah

2537
01:38:58,719 --> 01:39:01,840
they're there

2538
01:39:00,158 --> 01:39:03,599
round little round holes you can see

2539
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:05,440
them they're not as clear on the model

2540
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:08,159
as they are in the real one let's say

2541
01:39:05,439 --> 01:39:11,158
are they bones that come out because

2542
01:39:08,158 --> 01:39:11,158
um

2543
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:22,000
this is just broken off here okay the

2544
01:39:19,198 --> 01:39:23,279
lower part of the face is broken off

2545
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:25,118
but

2546
01:39:23,279 --> 01:39:26,800
it was there at one time and we have a

2547
01:39:25,118 --> 01:39:28,399
piece of maxilla that we'll see later if

2548
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:30,159
you just wait probably most of your

2549
01:39:28,399 --> 01:39:31,439
questions will be covered as we go

2550
01:39:30,158 --> 01:39:33,359
through but yeah oh i see what you're

2551
01:39:31,439 --> 01:39:35,279
talking about yeah okay here's a point

2552
01:39:33,359 --> 01:39:37,279
that needs to be made and the gentleman

2553
01:39:35,279 --> 01:39:39,840
is pointed out

2554
01:39:37,279 --> 01:39:42,960
in a normal human skull

2555
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:45,520
the cheekbone wraps around here and as

2556
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:47,439
you see it wraps in and forms part of

2557
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:49,920
the orbit of the eye that's what he's

2558
01:39:47,439 --> 01:39:52,960
talking about you see how it folds in

2559
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:56,000
and there's no line of demarcation and

2560
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:58,399
this line here comes down through here

2561
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:59,920
you see that the orbit it's a rounded

2562
01:39:58,399 --> 01:40:04,879
piece of bomb

2563
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:04,880
here but not so it snaps off clean

2564
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:10,800
a pretty major difference we don't know

2565
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:15,679
how this happens

2566
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:17,119
here because that could not happen there

2567
01:40:15,679 --> 01:40:18,480
but it's just one of many many

2568
01:40:17,118 --> 01:40:19,759
differences that you're going to see

2569
01:40:18,479 --> 01:40:22,238
good point and thank you for bringing

2570
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:24,480
that okay next level

2571
01:40:22,238 --> 01:40:25,839
okay we see a side view again the same

2572
01:40:24,479 --> 01:40:28,479
parts of the bone

2573
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:29,920
now this human skull was cradleboarding

2574
01:40:28,479 --> 01:40:31,678
you take these two experts and they'll

2575
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:33,279
say oh it's a it's a cradle-boarded

2576
01:40:31,679 --> 01:40:34,399
hydrocephalic that's the first thing

2577
01:40:33,279 --> 01:40:36,639
that pops out

2578
01:40:34,399 --> 01:40:39,359
but most of their mouths

2579
01:40:36,639 --> 01:40:42,400
a hydrocephalic because the head the

2580
01:40:39,359 --> 01:40:44,960
cranium is swollen relative to that

2581
01:40:42,399 --> 01:40:49,039
swollen and misshapen hydrocephaly

2582
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:51,679
meaning water on the brain longer

2583
01:40:49,039 --> 01:40:53,760
cradleboarded because of the flatness of

2584
01:40:51,679 --> 01:40:55,600
the rear of the head

2585
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:57,039
and that's all they want to know i mean

2586
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:58,639
you start beginning to give them

2587
01:40:57,039 --> 01:41:00,880
arguments about why you know it's not

2588
01:40:58,639 --> 01:41:02,719
hypocritical it's not credible they're

2589
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:05,440
showing you the door they have made

2590
01:41:02,719 --> 01:41:08,158
their statement they have explained it

2591
01:41:05,439 --> 01:41:10,079
in their terms in natural terms

2592
01:41:08,158 --> 01:41:12,319
creditwood and i just felt it forget

2593
01:41:10,079 --> 01:41:16,079
about it i mean i had the late stephen j

2594
01:41:12,319 --> 01:41:18,639
gould himself the man the number one guy

2595
01:41:16,079 --> 01:41:20,399
do that to me incredible word i just

2596
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:22,400
felt the most to google it's not for

2597
01:41:20,399 --> 01:41:23,759
this reason i don't care what it is it's

2598
01:41:22,399 --> 01:41:26,399
natural

2599
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:26,400
take it away

2600
01:41:27,198 --> 01:41:33,198
standard response well it's not this

2601
01:41:30,479 --> 01:41:34,319
isn't crazy what it's called

2602
01:41:33,198 --> 01:41:36,638
right here

2603
01:41:34,319 --> 01:41:38,399
now cradleboarding is very common

2604
01:41:36,639 --> 01:41:40,719
in primitive cultures

2605
01:41:38,399 --> 01:41:42,238
what it is is mother has a baby she's

2606
01:41:40,719 --> 01:41:44,960
got to go to work in three or four days

2607
01:41:42,238 --> 01:41:47,279
back to work they need her hands so

2608
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:49,279
she's got to strap her baby on her back

2609
01:41:47,279 --> 01:41:51,118
if she is stooping and bending and

2610
01:41:49,279 --> 01:41:53,198
stooping and bending she can't have the

2611
01:41:51,118 --> 01:41:55,198
baby's head lolling around like that

2612
01:41:53,198 --> 01:41:57,759
because it will snap his neck

2613
01:41:55,198 --> 01:42:00,079
so she has to tie the baby's head to a

2614
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:02,320
board to keep it on her back so she can

2615
01:42:00,079 --> 01:42:04,960
work and it's very again very common

2616
01:42:02,319 --> 01:42:07,359
what you get because a baby's bones are

2617
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:09,118
so soft is the back of the head that

2618
01:42:07,359 --> 01:42:11,279
comes out as flat as the board you put

2619
01:42:09,118 --> 01:42:12,880
it on as flat as that table if you feel

2620
01:42:11,279 --> 01:42:14,960
the back of her head

2621
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:17,199
it is as flat as a board

2622
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:18,800
i mean no bumps at all

2623
01:42:17,198 --> 01:42:20,319
you feel the back of this head you can

2624
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:22,560
feel it for yourself

2625
01:42:20,319 --> 01:42:23,840
and you feel the subtle convolutions of

2626
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:26,400
the bum

2627
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:28,560
was never credible

2628
01:42:26,399 --> 01:42:30,238
never created and it's not a

2629
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:31,920
hydrocephaly because as you'll see in

2630
01:42:30,238 --> 01:42:34,399
among the visual pitch down the middle

2631
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:35,920
up here and if it was pressure from

2632
01:42:34,399 --> 01:42:37,039
pushing from the inside the brain

2633
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:39,600
pushing out

2634
01:42:37,039 --> 01:42:41,039
that crease would not be there

2635
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:44,239
it's not credible it's not

2636
01:42:41,039 --> 01:42:45,679
hydrocentrified however when a skull is

2637
01:42:44,238 --> 01:42:47,519
crediborted

2638
01:42:45,679 --> 01:42:49,118
the cradle boarding always stops at the

2639
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:51,440
knot at the rear of the head called the

2640
01:42:49,118 --> 01:42:53,118
external external occipital pro tumor so

2641
01:42:51,439 --> 01:42:54,479
the indian reach around everybody and

2642
01:42:53,118 --> 01:42:56,479
feel that knot in the back in the center

2643
01:42:54,479 --> 01:42:59,118
of your head right right here

2644
01:42:56,479 --> 01:43:01,439
okay everybody has that

2645
01:42:59,118 --> 01:43:02,559
it's a knot and your neck starts right

2646
01:43:01,439 --> 01:43:04,638
underneath

2647
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:06,960
if you were cradle-boarded as an infant

2648
01:43:04,639 --> 01:43:09,039
it stops there it goes from the crown up

2649
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:10,719
here to there it's about the size of the

2650
01:43:09,039 --> 01:43:13,039
palm of my hand the area that gets

2651
01:43:10,719 --> 01:43:14,800
flattened

2652
01:43:13,039 --> 01:43:16,399
but you can't go past the end because

2653
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:17,440
you're tearing into the neck muscles if

2654
01:43:16,399 --> 01:43:21,118
you do that

2655
01:43:17,439 --> 01:43:22,879
this thing has no medium

2656
01:43:21,118 --> 01:43:24,559
as you'll see in a moment and his neck

2657
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:27,039
doesn't start to go down here it's got a

2658
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:29,679
very small neck this neck starts up here

2659
01:43:27,039 --> 01:43:31,679
and covers all this area here

2660
01:43:29,679 --> 01:43:34,000
excellent

2661
01:43:31,679 --> 01:43:35,440
let's see those lines just to show that

2662
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:38,238
it's balanced we're not trying to fudge

2663
01:43:35,439 --> 01:43:39,919
it

2664
01:43:38,238 --> 01:43:40,718
oh excuse me can you go back real quick

2665
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:43,279
sure

2666
01:43:40,719 --> 01:43:44,158
here's your hole

2667
01:43:43,279 --> 01:43:46,079
your

2668
01:43:44,158 --> 01:43:48,399
cheek bone

2669
01:43:46,079 --> 01:43:50,158
see his little nub right here cheekbone

2670
01:43:48,399 --> 01:43:51,599
is going to come up attached here where

2671
01:43:50,158 --> 01:43:54,000
it's turned

2672
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:55,840
you can get two fingers up through here

2673
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:58,399
in the real skull my two fingers fit

2674
01:43:55,840 --> 01:44:00,079
very easily up through here

2675
01:43:58,399 --> 01:44:02,399
a couple soda straws will fit through

2676
01:44:00,079 --> 01:44:03,600
here the chewing muscles that come up

2677
01:44:02,399 --> 01:44:05,519
and attach

2678
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:06,400
chewing muscles they come up through

2679
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:08,880
here

2680
01:44:06,399 --> 01:44:10,559
go up through here this whole area right

2681
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:11,679
here you can see it clearer in another

2682
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:14,000
place

2683
01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:17,279
chewing muscles cover this whole area

2684
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:20,000
storage out you come up through here

2685
01:44:17,279 --> 01:44:22,158
and cut around your much much reduced to

2686
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:23,039
children's it's a much smaller global

2687
01:44:22,158 --> 01:44:25,679
face

2688
01:44:23,039 --> 01:44:28,880
and and when i say reduced i don't mean

2689
01:44:25,679 --> 01:44:30,079
they're going to grow as it gets older

2690
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:31,840
they

2691
01:44:30,079 --> 01:44:33,920
you're born with them

2692
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:35,760
fitting up here this thing was one of

2693
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:37,679
them fitting down here

2694
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:39,199
born different

2695
01:44:37,679 --> 01:44:40,480
neck

2696
01:44:39,198 --> 01:44:42,238
all this

2697
01:44:40,479 --> 01:44:44,718
and that completely reconfigured like

2698
01:44:42,238 --> 01:44:46,638
everything else

2699
01:44:44,719 --> 01:44:49,039
rear of the head

2700
01:44:46,639 --> 01:44:51,199
box the sutures you know about sutures

2701
01:44:49,039 --> 01:44:52,960
right a baby's born with all this wide

2702
01:44:51,198 --> 01:44:55,279
open with ligaments in here little

2703
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:57,039
patches of bone so that the head can

2704
01:44:55,279 --> 01:44:59,679
shake to fit through the birth canal

2705
01:44:57,039 --> 01:45:02,319
over the next two years or so these

2706
01:44:59,679 --> 01:45:04,800
sutures close up and the last one closes

2707
01:45:02,319 --> 01:45:07,439
up here at the top the soft the soft

2708
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:10,079
spot where three will come together

2709
01:45:07,439 --> 01:45:12,079
all right looks like the occipital here

2710
01:45:10,079 --> 01:45:14,800
is not simple has been just stretched

2711
01:45:12,079 --> 01:45:17,519
out and flattened see the crease

2712
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:20,960
down the middle here and the top

2713
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:23,199
this area here which is now a dent

2714
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:25,600
is where the indian should be

2715
01:45:23,198 --> 01:45:27,759
right here it's not and you see the neck

2716
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:29,119
muscles attaching and going through here

2717
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:31,280
big big

2718
01:45:29,118 --> 01:45:33,279
fossa where the magnets attach and go

2719
01:45:31,279 --> 01:45:35,759
through well you see they don't attach

2720
01:45:33,279 --> 01:45:38,639
till down here about an inch below where

2721
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:41,920
they should so the neck is a much

2722
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:44,960
much smaller much reducing neck

2723
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:47,039
just like a much reduced face

2724
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:49,679
and the crown again completely different

2725
01:45:47,039 --> 01:45:52,800
relative to which

2726
01:45:49,679 --> 01:45:55,679
these bones here called marian bones

2727
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:57,840
indicate that it's more than

2728
01:45:55,679 --> 01:46:01,039
four and a half five years old it's up

2729
01:45:57,840 --> 01:46:03,199
in the teens maybe even twenties

2730
01:46:01,039 --> 01:46:05,439
not necessarily a child but there's a

2731
01:46:03,198 --> 01:46:07,198
lot of debate on how old it was when it

2732
01:46:05,439 --> 01:46:09,759
died because its teeth look very

2733
01:46:07,198 --> 01:46:09,759
childish

2734
01:46:10,399 --> 01:46:14,960
top of the head

2735
01:46:12,639 --> 01:46:15,760
showing a difference the staining by the

2736
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:17,439
way

2737
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:19,600
on the starch island you saw on its

2738
01:46:17,439 --> 01:46:22,158
cheek is from the fact that it was

2739
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:24,159
buried in soil

2740
01:46:22,158 --> 01:46:27,039
and probably picked up some stains from

2741
01:46:24,158 --> 01:46:29,920
the very next slide

2742
01:46:27,039 --> 01:46:32,960
okay here we see that the underside now

2743
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:34,960
this bone right here the basal part

2744
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:36,480
basically

2745
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:38,800
is missing here

2746
01:46:36,479 --> 01:46:42,000
this bone fuses in all of us by around

2747
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:44,480
the age of 25 so this one was post 25

2748
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:45,920
this female when she died

2749
01:46:44,479 --> 01:46:47,439
but the one died

2750
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:49,760
and by the way we first thought

2751
01:46:47,439 --> 01:46:52,158
initially that it was its mother maybe

2752
01:46:49,760 --> 01:46:53,199
you know that her baby died she buried

2753
01:46:52,158 --> 01:46:55,519
it

2754
01:46:53,198 --> 01:46:57,519
because that's clearly a death and a

2755
01:46:55,520 --> 01:46:58,880
suicide

2756
01:46:57,520 --> 01:47:00,880
and she

2757
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:02,719
laid down to die with her wrapped his

2758
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:04,480
arm around her arm cut her throat to the

2759
01:47:02,719 --> 01:47:06,000
poison whatever she lay down there to

2760
01:47:04,479 --> 01:47:08,718
die with this

2761
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:09,920
child that had died or this being died

2762
01:47:08,719 --> 01:47:11,600
whatever it was that's what we

2763
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:14,399
originally thought

2764
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:16,639
now we know because of genetic testing

2765
01:47:14,399 --> 01:47:18,719
she was not its mother

2766
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:20,400
they're not genetically related they

2767
01:47:18,719 --> 01:47:22,880
were husband and wife they were a

2768
01:47:20,399 --> 01:47:24,000
caretaker a child and

2769
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:25,600
lovers

2770
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:28,560
we don't know what she had enough

2771
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:30,719
commitment to it to bury and die and

2772
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:32,239
kill herself take her own life to be

2773
01:47:30,719 --> 01:47:35,439
there

2774
01:47:32,238 --> 01:47:37,678
so anyway so she was in her 30s

2775
01:47:35,439 --> 01:47:39,439
her teeth are flattened down

2776
01:47:37,679 --> 01:47:41,279
like horse teeth

2777
01:47:39,439 --> 01:47:43,678
you can see the cusps all running away

2778
01:47:41,279 --> 01:47:44,639
but that's eating a very gritty diet of

2779
01:47:43,679 --> 01:47:45,440
corn

2780
01:47:44,639 --> 01:47:50,239
grit

2781
01:47:45,439 --> 01:47:52,559
so 30s is a good age probably for her

2782
01:47:50,238 --> 01:47:54,079
with this we're not as sure everything

2783
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:56,400
here is much smaller you see the

2784
01:47:54,079 --> 01:47:57,279
condyles how much smaller relative to

2785
01:47:56,399 --> 01:48:00,879
these

2786
01:47:57,279 --> 01:48:01,840
you see the mandibular fossa

2787
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:03,760
right here

2788
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:06,079
as opposed to the size of that so you're

2789
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:09,280
just looking at a much reduced

2790
01:48:06,079 --> 01:48:12,079
roll of face here but this indicates

2791
01:48:09,279 --> 01:48:14,399
a death agent death of less than 25 if

2792
01:48:12,079 --> 01:48:14,399
needed

2793
01:48:16,158 --> 01:48:18,559
this is an

2794
01:48:17,279 --> 01:48:21,039
x-ray

2795
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:24,880
of the two and you see the human eye

2796
01:48:21,039 --> 01:48:27,279
sockets and the frontal sinuses of the

2797
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:29,440
spront size is normal of human little

2798
01:48:27,279 --> 01:48:32,639
cauliflower and you see with the star

2799
01:48:29,439 --> 01:48:35,118
child completely missing no funds not

2800
01:48:32,639 --> 01:48:37,279
even vestigial not even nubs nothing

2801
01:48:35,118 --> 01:48:40,880
this thing didn't have

2802
01:48:37,279 --> 01:48:42,639
sinuses at all that's very immune

2803
01:48:40,880 --> 01:48:45,118
and notice if you will look at the

2804
01:48:42,639 --> 01:48:47,199
normal eye sockets look look at these

2805
01:48:45,118 --> 01:48:49,439
kind of this this flare thing to go in

2806
01:48:47,198 --> 01:48:51,118
here that weird

2807
01:48:49,439 --> 01:48:53,919
we don't know what it means but that's

2808
01:48:51,118 --> 01:48:55,839
how it came out of the x-ray also notice

2809
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:57,679
if you will how the brain kind of looks

2810
01:48:55,840 --> 01:49:01,400
when this fills up solid and you have

2811
01:48:57,679 --> 01:49:01,399
here a kind of brain

2812
01:49:06,319 --> 01:49:12,000
okay here we have some real strong proof

2813
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:14,159
against hydrocephaly from the outside

2814
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:16,000
you see the veins

2815
01:49:14,158 --> 01:49:17,279
the brain presses up into the bone and

2816
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:19,760
because the bone is soft and this is

2817
01:49:17,279 --> 01:49:22,158
from when your baby bone is soft the

2818
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:23,760
veins make dents in your bone it kind of

2819
01:49:22,158 --> 01:49:26,238
wraps around the veins and you see the

2820
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:28,000
tracks going all the way up here you see

2821
01:49:26,238 --> 01:49:30,479
the same thing you see the tracks going

2822
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:33,198
up all the way so but then you see this

2823
01:49:30,479 --> 01:49:34,559
this bulge in the rival that you don't

2824
01:49:33,198 --> 01:49:36,799
have

2825
01:49:34,560 --> 01:49:38,639
it's the same area here so much more

2826
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:40,719
correct this was the area by the way

2827
01:49:38,639 --> 01:49:42,639
that was a little extended in einstein

2828
01:49:40,719 --> 01:49:44,399
to make him a jeans

2829
01:49:42,639 --> 01:49:45,359
look a little bigger than her

2830
01:49:44,399 --> 01:49:48,158
so

2831
01:49:45,359 --> 01:49:48,158
it makes you wonder

2832
01:49:48,319 --> 01:49:51,519
anyway next up

2833
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:54,320
the t

2834
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:56,719
okay we have the little piece of maximum

2835
01:49:54,319 --> 01:49:58,719
upper right maxilla this is this piece

2836
01:49:56,719 --> 01:50:02,079
of bone right here from the middle of

2837
01:49:58,719 --> 01:50:03,599
your upper jaw around to the right okay

2838
01:50:02,079 --> 01:50:06,079
this is the size

2839
01:50:03,599 --> 01:50:08,319
forget how it looks here it's real small

2840
01:50:06,079 --> 01:50:10,639
and it's basically the size of a child

2841
01:50:08,319 --> 01:50:13,118
this is the nose openings and opening

2842
01:50:10,639 --> 01:50:15,679
for so it had it had a breathing

2843
01:50:13,118 --> 01:50:18,000
capacity like we have

2844
01:50:15,679 --> 01:50:19,599
those opening like we have

2845
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:21,840
and these are the two teeth that were

2846
01:50:19,599 --> 01:50:24,000
there this tooth has been lost to dna

2847
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:27,279
testing unsuccessfully enforced the

2848
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:29,359
first time around we still have this one

2849
01:50:27,279 --> 01:50:31,519
if you look in these holes here you

2850
01:50:29,359 --> 01:50:33,359
could see other teeth

2851
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:35,599
come waiting to come out

2852
01:50:33,359 --> 01:50:37,759
and you x-ray this and you see four

2853
01:50:35,599 --> 01:50:40,000
teeth up in here so it's pretty clear

2854
01:50:37,760 --> 01:50:41,840
that it has a child's dentition and

2855
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:43,039
that's why we call it the star child

2856
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:44,719
initiative

2857
01:50:43,039 --> 01:50:47,039
we were told well it's got you know

2858
01:50:44,719 --> 01:50:48,880
teeth down teeth up it's small it's

2859
01:50:47,039 --> 01:50:50,719
weird it's a child

2860
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:52,400
so we call it the star child for a very

2861
01:50:50,719 --> 01:50:53,520
long time before they began to really

2862
01:50:52,399 --> 01:50:55,359
wonder

2863
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:57,440
if the wormy and bone issue might

2864
01:50:55,359 --> 01:50:59,118
indicate that it was older than a child

2865
01:50:57,439 --> 01:51:01,439
you still don't know about the next

2866
01:50:59,118 --> 01:51:04,319
slide we take a close-up of the

2867
01:51:01,439 --> 01:51:06,638
remaining tooth what you see is a lot of

2868
01:51:04,319 --> 01:51:08,960
a lot of wear on the enamel

2869
01:51:06,639 --> 01:51:11,279
shearing across the enamel to that point

2870
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:13,520
right there you see pitting with the pit

2871
01:51:11,279 --> 01:51:15,519
here in the mirror pits and you see this

2872
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:17,440
crack here this is called phrasing this

2873
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:19,280
is like an adult

2874
01:51:17,439 --> 01:51:21,118
two career pattern

2875
01:51:19,279 --> 01:51:23,519
seen in what seems to be about a four

2876
01:51:21,118 --> 01:51:25,198
and a half five year old child

2877
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:26,960
hard to figure

2878
01:51:25,198 --> 01:51:28,799
again still won't have answers to the

2879
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:29,760
next slide

2880
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:32,400
now

2881
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:36,159
when now it gets interesting so

2882
01:51:32,399 --> 01:51:38,799
we cut some bone to do some dna testing

2883
01:51:36,158 --> 01:51:40,000
karina was there when it was cut two

2884
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:42,400
things happened

2885
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:44,479
the geneticists who had dealt with it

2886
01:51:42,399 --> 01:51:46,799
cutting bone for quite some time and

2887
01:51:44,479 --> 01:51:49,118
knew a lot about it said

2888
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:51,119
boy this with a dremel blades boy this

2889
01:51:49,118 --> 01:51:52,000
is tough to cut this is much tougher

2890
01:51:51,118 --> 01:51:54,158
than

2891
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:56,238
it should be for such thin bones this

2892
01:51:54,158 --> 01:51:58,319
thin like bone you think it just cracked

2893
01:51:56,238 --> 01:52:01,198
through like an action it didn't it was

2894
01:51:58,319 --> 01:52:03,359
resistant to the dremel adrenal blade

2895
01:52:01,198 --> 01:52:05,839
being a circular blade and you know a

2896
01:52:03,359 --> 01:52:06,719
little thing like a kind of a flashlight

2897
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:08,960
like that

2898
01:52:06,719 --> 01:52:12,319
okay so

2899
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:14,719
and now with that it produced a profound

2900
01:52:12,319 --> 01:52:16,639
profound smell of burning tooth you know

2901
01:52:14,719 --> 01:52:18,800
when you get your teeth drilled that

2902
01:52:16,639 --> 01:52:19,760
smell everybody recognizes it's not in

2903
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:22,079
them

2904
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:24,560
it's collagen that is collagen i didn't

2905
01:52:22,079 --> 01:52:26,639
know that until fairly recent

2906
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:27,840
that smell is burning collagen not

2907
01:52:26,639 --> 01:52:30,319
enamel

2908
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:32,880
bone is made of two things hydroxy

2909
01:52:30,319 --> 01:52:35,439
calcium hydroxyapatite or apatite and

2910
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:35,440
collagen

2911
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:38,880
mammal is distinctive for tooth so that

2912
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:41,199
is burning

2913
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:43,039
collagen that you smell strong spinal

2914
01:52:41,198 --> 01:52:44,638
columns so we were surprised by those

2915
01:52:43,039 --> 01:52:46,319
two things but the hardness issue was

2916
01:52:44,639 --> 01:52:50,319
the one to god and they said you want to

2917
01:52:46,319 --> 01:52:52,079
have this tested now the dna proved

2918
01:52:50,319 --> 01:52:54,319
first time through

2919
01:52:52,079 --> 01:52:55,920
they took the bone like this piece like

2920
01:52:54,319 --> 01:52:57,279
this and they put it in the normal

2921
01:52:55,920 --> 01:53:01,520
dissolving

2922
01:52:57,279 --> 01:53:03,840
fluid which is called edta an edta is

2923
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:06,000
just a dissolver that you take normal

2924
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:07,360
bone and it will dissolve it away in

2925
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:09,279
about a week

2926
01:53:07,359 --> 01:53:11,359
and then they go to work on taking away

2927
01:53:09,279 --> 01:53:13,840
everything except the dna and do the dna

2928
01:53:11,359 --> 01:53:15,519
testing

2929
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:17,199
they said well it's so thin and so

2930
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:18,880
different so like you know it's probably

2931
01:53:17,198 --> 01:53:22,399
going to be maybe three days maybe four

2932
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:26,000
days and edta will dissolve

2933
01:53:22,399 --> 01:53:28,079
ten weeks later it looked the same

2934
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:29,760
weeks later it looked the same and not

2935
01:53:28,079 --> 01:53:31,359
dissolved at all

2936
01:53:29,760 --> 01:53:33,440
so they said we're going to put a

2937
01:53:31,359 --> 01:53:34,719
detergent in it called tween 20 and

2938
01:53:33,439 --> 01:53:35,678
that's pretty strong and that should

2939
01:53:34,719 --> 01:53:37,439
take it

2940
01:53:35,679 --> 01:53:39,760
now you should take at least some of it

2941
01:53:37,439 --> 01:53:43,118
down so we can work with them they put

2942
01:53:39,760 --> 01:53:45,119
the 20 20 in it poop gone overnight gone

2943
01:53:43,118 --> 01:53:47,198
gone gone

2944
01:53:45,118 --> 01:53:49,759
completely dissolved overnight

2945
01:53:47,198 --> 01:53:51,759
that was a surprise too

2946
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:54,000
but they used what the liquid was left

2947
01:53:51,760 --> 01:53:55,280
and they they tested it and now the

2948
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:57,760
mother

2949
01:53:55,279 --> 01:54:02,158
her mitochondrial dna and her nuclear

2950
01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:04,719
dna came up really beautiful no problem

2951
01:54:02,158 --> 01:54:06,879
the assumption being that in 900 years

2952
01:54:04,719 --> 01:54:08,880
being in a mind tunnel not being rained

2953
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:10,880
on not being dried out not being

2954
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:13,679
bleached by the sun all that it should

2955
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:15,359
be the dna should be well preserved and

2956
01:54:13,679 --> 01:54:17,039
it was in the human

2957
01:54:15,359 --> 01:54:18,479
star child only difference being it was

2958
01:54:17,039 --> 01:54:20,800
buried

2959
01:54:18,479 --> 01:54:22,638
its mitochondrial dna its mother part

2960
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:25,119
that comes from his mother came up

2961
01:54:22,639 --> 01:54:26,960
beautiful no problem the nuclear dna

2962
01:54:25,118 --> 01:54:28,799
which is the from the inside of the

2963
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:31,279
nucleus you know in the cell the

2964
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:33,039
mitochondrial dna flows outside the cell

2965
01:54:31,279 --> 01:54:35,439
and it's like little chips of stone and

2966
01:54:33,039 --> 01:54:38,000
it's very durable the nuclear dna is the

2967
01:54:35,439 --> 01:54:41,118
chromosome package inside the nucleus

2968
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:43,599
and it's fairly fragile

2969
01:54:41,118 --> 01:54:46,960
it didn't for whatever reason come up

2970
01:54:43,599 --> 01:54:48,719
they tried four times each time the

2971
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:51,359
mitochondrial dna came up easy the

2972
01:54:48,719 --> 01:54:53,198
nuclear dna did not

2973
01:54:51,359 --> 01:54:55,039
couldn't figure it out they said well

2974
01:54:53,198 --> 01:54:57,198
there must have been some kind of weird

2975
01:54:55,039 --> 01:54:59,359
degradation going on

2976
01:54:57,198 --> 01:55:01,118
it's understandable buried might have

2977
01:54:59,359 --> 01:55:02,960
been very acidic soil it was buried in

2978
01:55:01,118 --> 01:55:05,359
got some staining so we kind of excused

2979
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:07,520
it away we just said we're going to have

2980
01:55:05,359 --> 01:55:09,439
to wait a while until the primers get

2981
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:12,159
more sophisticated to get the nuclear

2982
01:55:09,439 --> 01:55:14,960
dna but we believe nuclear dna is here

2983
01:55:12,158 --> 01:55:16,238
because the mitochondrial dna is so easy

2984
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:17,118
to recover

2985
01:55:16,238 --> 01:55:18,959
okay

2986
01:55:17,118 --> 01:55:21,118
so they said in the meanwhile you should

2987
01:55:18,960 --> 01:55:22,639
test the bomb

2988
01:55:21,118 --> 01:55:25,439
for to see about the chemistry to see

2989
01:55:22,639 --> 01:55:27,359
why it's so hard to cut

2990
01:55:25,439 --> 01:55:29,678
because that's unusual

2991
01:55:27,359 --> 01:55:33,158
not worry too much about the smell the

2992
01:55:29,679 --> 01:55:33,158
smell is the secondary

2993
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:39,760
finally this the lady who put up the

2994
01:55:36,399 --> 01:55:41,359
money for the dna testing

2995
01:55:39,760 --> 01:55:43,520
she had taken a partner named grant

2996
01:55:41,359 --> 01:55:44,399
singleton who's now partnering in the

2997
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:45,440
deal

2998
01:55:44,399 --> 01:55:47,920
and

2999
01:55:45,439 --> 01:55:49,039
he now runs cognoscence and he arranged

3000
01:55:47,920 --> 01:55:51,760
to have

3001
01:55:49,039 --> 01:55:54,079
the bone tested with the scanning

3002
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:57,039
electron microscope

3003
01:55:54,079 --> 01:55:59,439
at the royal holloway scientific

3004
01:55:57,039 --> 01:56:01,439
institute in london which is a castle

3005
01:55:59,439 --> 01:56:03,439
really big castle that's been converted

3006
01:56:01,439 --> 01:56:05,359
into scientific institute

3007
01:56:03,439 --> 01:56:06,559
so in the scanning electron microscope

3008
01:56:05,359 --> 01:56:08,000
this is what

3009
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:11,199
we saw

3010
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:13,760
this is a cortical bone layer outer it's

3011
01:56:11,198 --> 01:56:15,919
like a sandwich bone is like a sandwich

3012
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:18,159
at this time the cord of the layer

3013
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:20,639
outside and underneath and the inside

3014
01:56:18,158 --> 01:56:22,479
are the cancellous holes and in here is

3015
01:56:20,639 --> 01:56:25,118
where the marrow goes

3016
01:56:22,479 --> 01:56:26,559
the marrow moves

3017
01:56:25,118 --> 01:56:28,880
bone

3018
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:31,840
has it doesn't have vessels and things

3019
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:33,760
like that it has it has these holes and

3020
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:36,560
and the marrow just kind of loses

3021
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:38,079
through the cancellous valves

3022
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:39,440
so when they looked at the scanning

3023
01:56:38,079 --> 01:56:42,158
electron microscope and took the

3024
01:56:39,439 --> 01:56:44,879
pictures and they saw this they said

3025
01:56:42,158 --> 01:56:46,960
holy smokes what is this

3026
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:49,520
these things here

3027
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:49,520
see these

3028
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:54,239
these are not known

3029
01:56:51,679 --> 01:56:54,239
involved

3030
01:56:54,719 --> 01:56:58,560
never seen before don't know what they

3031
01:56:56,880 --> 01:57:01,039
are next slide we're going to look at a

3032
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:04,080
couple of them up close but these are

3033
01:57:01,039 --> 01:57:06,319
just samples of others that you can that

3034
01:57:04,079 --> 01:57:08,960
we're in many of the cancellous holes

3035
01:57:06,319 --> 01:57:13,279
and stores home restraints mixed up

3036
01:57:08,960 --> 01:57:13,279
look at that one first we call it a lot

3037
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:17,920
now this looks like a little thin piece

3038
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:19,679
here that got wrapped up somehow in this

3039
01:57:17,920 --> 01:57:20,719
came out here and all this is wrapped

3040
01:57:19,679 --> 01:57:22,158
around it

3041
01:57:20,719 --> 01:57:24,079
we first saw this we thought well it

3042
01:57:22,158 --> 01:57:25,359
must be some kind of capillary of some

3043
01:57:24,079 --> 01:57:28,000
kind

3044
01:57:25,359 --> 01:57:30,399
but there are no capillaries involved

3045
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:32,319
it's not the way bone is set up

3046
01:57:30,399 --> 01:57:33,839
what is it next slide

3047
01:57:32,319 --> 01:57:37,039
this doesn't look the same it's more

3048
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:38,960
like threads or hairs

3049
01:57:37,039 --> 01:57:40,880
what is it

3050
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:43,359
no idea

3051
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:43,359
next slide

3052
01:57:43,679 --> 01:57:47,679
this was a piece of just another area of

3053
01:57:46,158 --> 01:57:49,118
the same piece of bone which by the way

3054
01:57:47,679 --> 01:57:51,359
is as big as my thumbnail or your

3055
01:57:49,118 --> 01:57:53,759
thumbnail i'm not a big piece

3056
01:57:51,359 --> 01:57:54,960
cut out a storage hole but up here

3057
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:57,679
use your thumb

3058
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:59,520
the blade was cutting as fast as it came

3059
01:57:57,679 --> 01:58:01,520
to the end of the cut and let up on it a

3060
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:03,599
little bit the speed is we got a rougher

3061
01:58:01,520 --> 01:58:05,440
cut here now just

3062
01:58:03,599 --> 01:58:08,719
we're going to focus on this screw right

3063
01:58:05,439 --> 01:58:08,719
here next slide

3064
01:58:09,198 --> 01:58:14,238
see what you get look at these ready

3065
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:16,639
like things start to appear next slide

3066
01:58:14,238 --> 01:58:16,638
closer

3067
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:23,119
see

3068
01:58:18,840 --> 01:58:25,440
it here up to here to here shredded now

3069
01:58:23,118 --> 01:58:27,519
this chips of stuff were just the bomb

3070
01:58:25,439 --> 01:58:29,279
residue thrown out by the cutting

3071
01:58:27,520 --> 01:58:31,119
process and you saw it all in the

3072
01:58:29,279 --> 01:58:33,039
castle's holes

3073
01:58:31,118 --> 01:58:34,719
look at this little knobby thing here

3074
01:58:33,039 --> 01:58:37,118
next slide

3075
01:58:34,719 --> 01:58:39,760
up to there here it is up here

3076
01:58:37,118 --> 01:58:41,598
you see this going up and we see

3077
01:58:39,760 --> 01:58:44,960
this whatever it is is a different kind

3078
01:58:41,599 --> 01:58:46,840
of thing and this is a piece of it

3079
01:58:44,960 --> 01:58:50,399
but it's shredded folks

3080
01:58:46,840 --> 01:58:51,840
understand it resisted the dremel

3081
01:58:50,399 --> 01:58:54,158
whatever it is

3082
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:57,199
stronger than the bone

3083
01:58:54,158 --> 01:58:57,198
that's what's amazing

3084
01:58:57,520 --> 01:59:02,159
now you see this going up this is this

3085
01:59:00,079 --> 01:59:03,840
stuff thing here goes in and disappears

3086
01:59:02,158 --> 01:59:05,359
into here and there's another piece

3087
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:06,800
growing here

3088
01:59:05,359 --> 01:59:09,519
that's different

3089
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:10,800
and it looks like fans out here so when

3090
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:13,040
we saw this

3091
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:15,440
the experts in with us said you know

3092
01:59:13,039 --> 01:59:17,679
this looks like it might be fungi or

3093
01:59:15,439 --> 01:59:21,198
bacteria or something that's wrong on

3094
01:59:17,679 --> 01:59:22,560
the bone since you cut it

3095
01:59:21,198 --> 01:59:24,319
why don't we have it tested by a

3096
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:25,760
mycologist or at least looked at my

3097
01:59:24,319 --> 01:59:27,840
mycologists and see what they say

3098
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:30,800
mycologists being specialists in fungi

3099
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:33,679
bacteria we took it to three in england

3100
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:36,000
including the very best england has

3101
01:59:33,679 --> 01:59:37,760
that's my colleague he said i've never

3102
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:40,719
seen anything like this i've never seen

3103
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:42,840
this in mine no idea what it is but

3104
01:59:40,719 --> 01:59:46,239
there are 30 000

3105
01:59:42,840 --> 01:59:48,079
possible examples of fungi or bacteria

3106
01:59:46,238 --> 01:59:49,839
maybe i don't want them all

3107
01:59:48,079 --> 01:59:51,279
and you need to have it tested to find

3108
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:52,960
out what it is for sure which we agree

3109
01:59:51,279 --> 01:59:55,439
with we do need to have a testimony test

3110
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:57,118
called long talk and intelligence fairly

3111
01:59:55,439 --> 01:59:58,879
sophisticated fairly expensive but it

3112
01:59:57,118 --> 02:00:00,319
can nail this down one way or the other

3113
01:59:58,880 --> 02:00:02,159
but he says i don't think this is

3114
02:00:00,319 --> 02:00:03,279
bacteria or punch it looks like

3115
02:00:02,158 --> 02:00:04,238
something

3116
02:00:03,279 --> 02:00:07,359
something

3117
02:00:04,238 --> 02:00:07,359
built into the bottle

3118
02:00:07,920 --> 02:00:13,039
now what also is weird about it is it

3119
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:15,920
these things are high in silicon they

3120
02:00:13,039 --> 02:00:18,479
have about 25 silicon

3121
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:21,920
whatever they are

3122
02:00:18,479 --> 02:00:24,238
you see here in the base of it

3123
02:00:21,920 --> 02:00:24,239
hold

3124
02:00:25,599 --> 02:00:29,840
now on another one that's not out of a

3125
02:00:27,920 --> 02:00:32,000
cancellous hole it probably came from a

3126
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:33,840
cancellous hole but it got sheared loose

3127
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:37,920
and it ended up here it could have come

3128
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:39,520
from here we don't know but this is

3129
02:00:37,920 --> 02:00:42,239
no

3130
02:00:39,520 --> 02:00:46,080
no idea what it is

3131
02:00:42,238 --> 02:00:46,079
i'm going to look at this piece here

3132
02:00:46,399 --> 02:00:49,839
see how it is

3133
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:53,360
praying mantis and notice here it shred

3134
02:00:49,840 --> 02:00:55,279
it off it didn't cut tears

3135
02:00:53,359 --> 02:00:57,519
so our thought was well maybe this is

3136
02:00:55,279 --> 02:00:59,599
part of what's making it so difficult to

3137
02:00:57,520 --> 02:01:01,679
cut maybe it's some kind of fiber

3138
02:00:59,599 --> 02:01:04,319
network that's laid through the bone

3139
02:01:01,679 --> 02:01:05,760
that keeps it resistant to cut it we

3140
02:01:04,319 --> 02:01:07,198
don't know

3141
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:08,400
some things we have to find out this is

3142
02:01:07,198 --> 02:01:09,678
all fairly new

3143
02:01:08,399 --> 02:01:11,359
this is about

3144
02:01:09,679 --> 02:01:12,960
these are about four months old and what

3145
02:01:11,359 --> 02:01:15,519
you're going to see later about six

3146
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:17,279
weeks old this is all new stuff hot

3147
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:19,280
cocoa you're some of the first people to

3148
02:01:17,279 --> 02:01:20,238
see this

3149
02:01:19,279 --> 02:01:21,920
okay

3150
02:01:20,238 --> 02:01:24,238
what we did after the first scanning

3151
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:26,239
electron microscope though that was

3152
02:01:24,238 --> 02:01:29,519
better it's a little more than half and

3153
02:01:26,238 --> 02:01:31,359
it just doesn't fit the same frame

3154
02:01:29,520 --> 02:01:33,760
now this is the inside surface of the

3155
02:01:31,359 --> 02:01:35,759
human female skull

3156
02:01:33,760 --> 02:01:38,560
notice that this is

3157
02:01:35,760 --> 02:01:41,119
an increstation made up of silicon sand

3158
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:43,840
and dust and grit that is just collected

3159
02:01:41,118 --> 02:01:45,679
into about a sixteenth of an inch layer

3160
02:01:43,840 --> 02:01:48,480
on the inside of the skull this is

3161
02:01:45,679 --> 02:01:50,079
normal for 900 years in a high desert

3162
02:01:48,479 --> 02:01:52,638
environment

3163
02:01:50,079 --> 02:01:54,319
next level this is the end outside of

3164
02:01:52,639 --> 02:01:56,400
the human feet and female skull the

3165
02:01:54,319 --> 02:01:58,479
shininess again due to the shellac

3166
02:01:56,399 --> 02:02:00,638
that's prone

3167
02:01:58,479 --> 02:02:03,279
and see these dimples this is definitely

3168
02:02:00,639 --> 02:02:05,760
on the surface of skull again perfectly

3169
02:02:03,279 --> 02:02:07,759
normal this is what you would expect

3170
02:02:05,760 --> 02:02:09,679
those dimples would be under

3171
02:02:07,760 --> 02:02:10,960
the encrustation you can see it now this

3172
02:02:09,679 --> 02:02:13,039
is the inside

3173
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:14,880
surface of the star child and you do see

3174
02:02:13,039 --> 02:02:16,238
the nipples they're very shallow but you

3175
02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:19,920
do see them

3176
02:02:16,238 --> 02:02:22,238
and what do you notice no infrastructure

3177
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:24,480
even though it's buried for the same 900

3178
02:02:22,238 --> 02:02:26,638
years you expect whatever you see but

3179
02:02:24,479 --> 02:02:28,000
for some reason you don't see

3180
02:02:26,639 --> 02:02:32,760
this is the outer surface of these

3181
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:32,760
storage rounds you see no dimples at all

3182
02:02:36,479 --> 02:02:40,319
here you see a comparison of the two see

3183
02:02:38,719 --> 02:02:42,560
the human female inside with the

3184
02:02:40,319 --> 02:02:44,319
infestation at what would expect let me

3185
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:47,360
see here

3186
02:02:44,319 --> 02:02:49,759
next slide you see the outer surface of

3187
02:02:47,359 --> 02:02:51,679
the human with the dimpling that is

3188
02:02:49,760 --> 02:02:55,280
normal and you see on the outer surface

3189
02:02:51,679 --> 02:02:55,279
of the star child with no doubt

3190
02:02:55,599 --> 02:02:59,440
anybody can see

3191
02:02:57,359 --> 02:03:01,439
there is a significant difference

3192
02:02:59,439 --> 02:03:02,799
between these two

3193
02:03:01,439 --> 02:03:04,719
it should be

3194
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:07,199
you know it doesn't matter how deformed

3195
02:03:04,719 --> 02:03:08,719
you are if you're human

3196
02:03:07,198 --> 02:03:10,079
being

3197
02:03:08,719 --> 02:03:13,599
think

3198
02:03:10,079 --> 02:03:14,399
whatever's left should be human

3199
02:03:13,599 --> 02:03:18,159
okay

3200
02:03:14,399 --> 02:03:20,479
now what after that was done

3201
02:03:18,158 --> 02:03:22,638
a guy that we contacted who's a

3202
02:03:20,479 --> 02:03:24,799
specialist in this said

3203
02:03:22,639 --> 02:03:26,319
we're going to now take the bone and

3204
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:28,719
instead of cut it we're going to take

3205
02:03:26,319 --> 02:03:30,479
the cut piece and we're going to snap

3206
02:03:28,719 --> 02:03:32,239
we're going to break them both the human

3207
02:03:30,479 --> 02:03:34,399
and the starchild and get what are

3208
02:03:32,238 --> 02:03:36,000
called fractured edges and then we're

3209
02:03:34,399 --> 02:03:38,238
going to take them and polish them down

3210
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:39,279
with lapidary tools with the jeweler

3211
02:03:38,238 --> 02:03:41,598
tools

3212
02:03:39,279 --> 02:03:42,719
when they're very slowly and very

3213
02:03:41,599 --> 02:03:44,159
carefully

3214
02:03:42,719 --> 02:03:46,239
take it down

3215
02:03:44,158 --> 02:03:48,319
flatten it out and make sure that no

3216
02:03:46,238 --> 02:03:51,598
crud gets in the cancellous holes

3217
02:03:48,319 --> 02:03:54,399
because they were looking to see what

3218
02:03:51,599 --> 02:03:56,560
causes the toughness

3219
02:03:54,399 --> 02:03:58,960
and because it looked like some of the

3220
02:03:56,560 --> 02:04:03,039
layers of the cortical bone seemed to

3221
02:03:58,960 --> 02:04:05,359
have a chemical chemically or enamel

3222
02:04:03,039 --> 02:04:08,560
and so the thought was well maybe we can

3223
02:04:05,359 --> 02:04:11,198
find some sign in the starch album of

3224
02:04:08,560 --> 02:04:12,719
enamel rather than of layering rather

3225
02:04:11,198 --> 02:04:15,198
than what humans have which is sort of

3226
02:04:12,719 --> 02:04:17,039
like concrete so this is the human

3227
02:04:15,198 --> 02:04:19,919
polished

3228
02:04:17,039 --> 02:04:22,479
one side the outside the upper the

3229
02:04:19,920 --> 02:04:24,239
outside of the head there and you see

3230
02:04:22,479 --> 02:04:27,439
polished

3231
02:04:24,238 --> 02:04:29,839
how clean the bone is do you know why

3232
02:04:27,439 --> 02:04:31,839
when you die when you go you carry

3233
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:34,239
within your body the bacteria that are

3234
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:35,840
going to consume you down enough

3235
02:04:34,238 --> 02:04:37,919
over time

3236
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:39,599
mother nature cleans her plate if she

3237
02:04:37,920 --> 02:04:41,520
didn't we'd walk out of here and it

3238
02:04:39,599 --> 02:04:42,880
would be thousand foot high piles of

3239
02:04:41,520 --> 02:04:44,560
bones out there

3240
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:46,400
mother nature cleans her plate how does

3241
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:48,400
she do it she puts in you when you're

3242
02:04:46,399 --> 02:04:50,799
born the bacteria that are going to eat

3243
02:04:48,399 --> 02:04:52,799
you up when you die

3244
02:04:50,800 --> 02:04:55,679
and there are bacteria in you that eat

3245
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:57,119
your marrow out

3246
02:04:55,679 --> 02:04:59,520
and that's why

3247
02:04:57,118 --> 02:05:01,839
normal cancellous bone looks like this

3248
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:03,760
like it's been licked clean

3249
02:05:01,840 --> 02:05:06,800
because it has

3250
02:05:03,760 --> 02:05:08,159
and also normal human bone looks like

3251
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:10,960
alabaster

3252
02:05:08,158 --> 02:05:12,799
it's beautiful it's polished and shined

3253
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:14,719
like this

3254
02:05:12,800 --> 02:05:16,719
so how it looks next level

3255
02:05:14,719 --> 02:05:18,960
this is just the other side

3256
02:05:16,719 --> 02:05:20,960
and this is the inner layer and that is

3257
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:23,279
the layer of infrastructure that you saw

3258
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:25,039
flat on a while ago and you see a little

3259
02:05:23,279 --> 02:05:26,880
bit of like layering here but you see

3260
02:05:25,039 --> 02:05:28,639
it's very irregular and

3261
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:30,719
it goes down kind of like in sheets kind

3262
02:05:28,639 --> 02:05:34,719
of like again or concrete but again you

3263
02:05:30,719 --> 02:05:34,719
see how clear the cancellous holes

3264
02:05:35,118 --> 02:05:39,279
they see this star child you see

3265
02:05:36,639 --> 02:05:41,440
difference it's kind of milky it's got

3266
02:05:39,279 --> 02:05:44,399
thicker manding here

3267
02:05:41,439 --> 02:05:45,919
and that's what read out like enamel so

3268
02:05:44,399 --> 02:05:47,198
that could have something to do with the

3269
02:05:45,920 --> 02:05:49,118
toughness

3270
02:05:47,198 --> 02:05:50,559
but you see the cancellous holes into

3271
02:05:49,118 --> 02:05:53,519
that milkiness you know what the

3272
02:05:50,560 --> 02:05:54,880
milkiness is from guess what collagen

3273
02:05:53,520 --> 02:05:56,560
found out

3274
02:05:54,880 --> 02:06:00,400
collagen remember i told you that that

3275
02:05:56,560 --> 02:06:04,400
smell the first cup was so stinky bad of

3276
02:06:00,399 --> 02:06:06,559
a bone collagen guess what

3277
02:06:04,399 --> 02:06:09,039
this piece of bone

3278
02:06:06,560 --> 02:06:11,119
one half is thicker than it should be

3279
02:06:09,039 --> 02:06:12,880
carries the full load

3280
02:06:11,118 --> 02:06:14,559
the full load

3281
02:06:12,880 --> 02:06:17,760
of collagen

3282
02:06:14,560 --> 02:06:19,520
like a compressed computer file

3283
02:06:17,760 --> 02:06:22,079
we don't know how that much collagen

3284
02:06:19,520 --> 02:06:23,760
alive for that matter how much collagen

3285
02:06:22,078 --> 02:06:25,439
is there but it's clear to see that it

3286
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:27,920
is with no shine there's no alabaster

3287
02:06:25,439 --> 02:06:30,879
look it's a creamy milky that's caused

3288
02:06:27,920 --> 02:06:32,480
by the added collagen which we don't

3289
02:06:30,880 --> 02:06:34,719
understand

3290
02:06:32,479 --> 02:06:37,919
but most importantly you notice anything

3291
02:06:34,719 --> 02:06:40,880
at all kind of weird about this

3292
02:06:37,920 --> 02:06:40,880
look dead center

3293
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:46,560
this little speck here

3294
02:06:44,479 --> 02:06:48,959
what does that look to your eyes

3295
02:06:46,560 --> 02:06:50,159
you see any grayish there yeah

3296
02:06:48,960 --> 02:06:52,399
next slide

3297
02:06:50,158 --> 02:06:54,000
we missed the first time you didn't miss

3298
02:06:52,399 --> 02:06:57,319
this

3299
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:57,319
look at this

3300
02:06:59,118 --> 02:07:05,439
how did the bacteria not eat that away

3301
02:07:02,880 --> 02:07:05,440
next slide

3302
02:07:05,760 --> 02:07:08,719
close up on this

3303
02:07:09,439 --> 02:07:13,439
this

3304
02:07:10,880 --> 02:07:16,400
what do you think that is

3305
02:07:13,439 --> 02:07:18,319
that could be one of two things

3306
02:07:16,399 --> 02:07:20,879
desiccated marrow

3307
02:07:18,319 --> 02:07:21,679
which is the most likely thing

3308
02:07:20,880 --> 02:07:24,719
or

3309
02:07:21,679 --> 02:07:27,599
some kind of inorganic mineral that got

3310
02:07:24,719 --> 02:07:28,880
left behind somehow that the bacteria

3311
02:07:27,599 --> 02:07:32,319
couldn't could meet and couldn't

3312
02:07:28,880 --> 02:07:34,719
dissolve except no such thing as none

3313
02:07:32,319 --> 02:07:36,399
no such thing as known to be in bone

3314
02:07:34,719 --> 02:07:38,399
marrow

3315
02:07:36,399 --> 02:07:41,519
so either way you cut it

3316
02:07:38,399 --> 02:07:44,638
this is extremely weird

3317
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:47,679
extremely unacceptable

3318
02:07:44,639 --> 02:07:50,639
extremely potentially historic

3319
02:07:47,679 --> 02:07:53,279
because if this is desiccated marrow

3320
02:07:50,639 --> 02:07:55,359
guess what that's organic

3321
02:07:53,279 --> 02:07:58,158
guess what else

3322
02:07:55,359 --> 02:08:00,639
the geneticists had it

3323
02:07:58,158 --> 02:08:03,759
had it in hand

3324
02:08:00,639 --> 02:08:05,520
and couldn't find nuclear dna with human

3325
02:08:03,760 --> 02:08:08,639
primers

3326
02:08:05,520 --> 02:08:11,199
and what does that tell you it's not

3327
02:08:08,639 --> 02:08:13,118
human dna

3328
02:08:11,198 --> 02:08:15,519
that's why they were getting the

3329
02:08:13,118 --> 02:08:18,319
mitochondrial dna but not getting the

3330
02:08:15,520 --> 02:08:20,079
nuclear dna because the primers were

3331
02:08:18,319 --> 02:08:23,118
going after human

3332
02:08:20,078 --> 02:08:25,840
nuclear dna and they weren't matching up

3333
02:08:23,118 --> 02:08:27,439
now if it's inorganic which it could be

3334
02:08:25,840 --> 02:08:29,119
if it's inorganic

3335
02:08:27,439 --> 02:08:31,118
we still have to find out what it's

3336
02:08:29,118 --> 02:08:33,759
doing there what it's made of

3337
02:08:31,118 --> 02:08:33,759
what's it doing

3338
02:08:34,158 --> 02:08:39,759
folks this is very potentially the

3339
02:08:36,479 --> 02:08:43,118
historic thing you're looking at here

3340
02:08:39,760 --> 02:08:45,280
because even if it's not alien connected

3341
02:08:43,118 --> 02:08:47,519
it's the weirdest human thing that

3342
02:08:45,279 --> 02:08:50,479
anybody's ever seen more so than the

3343
02:08:47,520 --> 02:08:52,880
elephant man

3344
02:08:50,479 --> 02:08:54,559
this is a big deal

3345
02:08:52,880 --> 02:08:56,239
just beginning to bubble up to the

3346
02:08:54,560 --> 02:08:58,159
surface of consciousness around the

3347
02:08:56,238 --> 02:09:01,039
world

3348
02:08:58,158 --> 02:09:03,198
the cutting edge next level

3349
02:09:01,039 --> 02:09:05,679
here we see a back lip and this was

3350
02:09:03,198 --> 02:09:07,839
flipped the bonus that was flipped where

3351
02:09:05,679 --> 02:09:11,199
open did the slide setting just made a

3352
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:13,679
mistake this is the top of the

3353
02:09:11,198 --> 02:09:16,799
top side inside the pawn

3354
02:09:13,679 --> 02:09:18,960
but anyhow the point is there you go

3355
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:20,880
look at how much there is next slide

3356
02:09:18,960 --> 02:09:24,000
getting back right

3357
02:09:20,880 --> 02:09:24,000
next slide close up

3358
02:09:24,479 --> 02:09:29,039
it's just astonishing i mean everybody

3359
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:30,480
that we've had eight major big time

3360
02:09:29,039 --> 02:09:33,760
scientists

3361
02:09:30,479 --> 02:09:36,559
in england from the royal holloway look

3362
02:09:33,760 --> 02:09:38,000
at this including mycologists and they

3363
02:09:36,560 --> 02:09:41,119
all say

3364
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:44,238
gee this we have no idea business but

3365
02:09:41,118 --> 02:09:45,839
you have to find out next time

3366
02:09:44,238 --> 02:09:47,598
these are the tests that we need just

3367
02:09:45,840 --> 02:09:50,319
some of the tests the most the major

3368
02:09:47,599 --> 02:09:52,319
tests we need a third dna analysis which

3369
02:09:50,319 --> 02:09:54,639
is now underway simply exceeding the

3370
02:09:52,319 --> 02:09:56,158
nuclear dna and we assume we're going to

3371
02:09:54,639 --> 02:09:58,560
get enough money to pay for it we

3372
02:09:56,158 --> 02:10:00,319
haven't yet but we're going to confess

3373
02:09:58,560 --> 02:10:02,560
the detailed dental analysis of the

3374
02:10:00,319 --> 02:10:03,840
animal service in the chemistry quality

3375
02:10:02,560 --> 02:10:05,920
talk tests

3376
02:10:03,840 --> 02:10:08,560
as i said earlier tests for the bacteria

3377
02:10:05,920 --> 02:10:10,319
in the fungi a detailed analysis of the

3378
02:10:08,560 --> 02:10:12,079
fibers in the residue fibers in the

3379
02:10:10,319 --> 02:10:16,559
redstone what are they what are they

3380
02:10:12,078 --> 02:10:18,238
made of to know that microtomography 3d

3381
02:10:16,560 --> 02:10:20,239
data on the internal structure what's

3382
02:10:18,238 --> 02:10:22,238
making it so hard

3383
02:10:20,238 --> 02:10:23,839
it did inductively couple plasma

3384
02:10:22,238 --> 02:10:26,000
spectrometry and laser arrangement

3385
02:10:23,840 --> 02:10:27,679
spectroscopy for trace elements are

3386
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:29,599
there trace elements in here that don't

3387
02:10:27,679 --> 02:10:31,279
belong that trace elements are things we

3388
02:10:29,599 --> 02:10:33,279
don't have normally on earth the things

3389
02:10:31,279 --> 02:10:35,039
we've never heard of are combinations

3390
02:10:33,279 --> 02:10:37,118
and shouldn't be

3391
02:10:35,039 --> 02:10:38,800
test all that light elements stabilize

3392
02:10:37,118 --> 02:10:42,000
itself analysis strontium will have

3393
02:10:38,800 --> 02:10:44,159
isotope ratios isotope ratios and

3394
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:46,000
analysis what they tell you is where the

3395
02:10:44,158 --> 02:10:46,960
thing lived what its environment was

3396
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:49,520
like

3397
02:10:46,960 --> 02:10:51,118
what it left behind its own

3398
02:10:49,520 --> 02:10:52,639
what what its

3399
02:10:51,118 --> 02:10:54,319
environment was

3400
02:10:52,639 --> 02:10:55,920
it's amazing what they can do with these

3401
02:10:54,319 --> 02:10:57,279
things they're very sophisticated

3402
02:10:55,920 --> 02:10:59,840
they're very expensive but before they

3403
02:10:57,279 --> 02:11:03,759
get they're just amazing x-ray power

3404
02:10:59,840 --> 02:11:05,360
powered diffraction crystal bio-mineral

3405
02:11:03,760 --> 02:11:07,199
to tell us about that

3406
02:11:05,359 --> 02:11:08,960
more scanning electron microscope

3407
02:11:07,198 --> 02:11:11,839
examinations on multiple fracture

3408
02:11:08,960 --> 02:11:14,560
surfaces hope to see more of the fibers

3409
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:17,360
to see more of the red stuff and try to

3410
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:20,639
see what it is transmitted like

3411
02:11:17,359 --> 02:11:23,839
microscopy for structural features again

3412
02:11:20,639 --> 02:11:27,599
looking for hardness electron probe and

3413
02:11:23,840 --> 02:11:29,279
or ion probe inclusions

3414
02:11:27,599 --> 02:11:31,360
just stuff they they want to know i

3415
02:11:29,279 --> 02:11:33,840
don't even understand mostly analyzing

3416
02:11:31,359 --> 02:11:36,238
crustaceans inside those skulls and

3417
02:11:33,840 --> 02:11:38,480
visit the recovery area in mexico take

3418
02:11:36,238 --> 02:11:39,919
soil samples to make sure that matches

3419
02:11:38,479 --> 02:11:42,238
up to make sure that the saline

3420
02:11:39,920 --> 02:11:45,118
resonation came from where the skull

3421
02:11:42,238 --> 02:11:46,238
supposedly came we assumed that they did

3422
02:11:45,118 --> 02:11:48,238
and

3423
02:11:46,238 --> 02:11:50,319
we absolutely have to prove it the clay

3424
02:11:48,238 --> 02:11:52,399
model reconstruction invasion features

3425
02:11:50,319 --> 02:11:54,880
that's something we just kind of like

3426
02:11:52,399 --> 02:11:56,238
we can use that but we're going to use

3427
02:11:54,880 --> 02:11:57,920
whatever we wanted to get to do the

3428
02:11:56,238 --> 02:11:59,598
testing first because that's more

3429
02:11:57,920 --> 02:12:00,800
important

3430
02:11:59,599 --> 02:12:02,800
but

3431
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:05,360
what we have to do what we've been told

3432
02:12:02,800 --> 02:12:06,880
by the scientists now is that we are

3433
02:12:05,359 --> 02:12:10,078
working on

3434
02:12:06,880 --> 02:12:12,480
who hears me without being mad

3435
02:12:10,078 --> 02:12:14,799
okay that we are working on

3436
02:12:12,479 --> 02:12:17,198
something that is so important that it

3437
02:12:14,800 --> 02:12:19,679
has to be done at a certain level

3438
02:12:17,198 --> 02:12:22,158
of sophistication now next slide

3439
02:12:19,679 --> 02:12:24,158
and because of that this is

3440
02:12:22,158 --> 02:12:26,719
this is what has to be done we need

3441
02:12:24,158 --> 02:12:29,118
between 50 and 100 000 probably more

3442
02:12:26,719 --> 02:12:31,439
like a hundred thousand dollars

3443
02:12:29,118 --> 02:12:33,598
and belinda by the way

3444
02:12:31,439 --> 02:12:36,158
mackenzie the lady put this together

3445
02:12:33,599 --> 02:12:38,239
cognizance and all that she put up 50

3446
02:12:36,158 --> 02:12:39,759
000 pounds which is basically a hundred

3447
02:12:38,238 --> 02:12:40,799
thousand dollars and we've gone through

3448
02:12:39,760 --> 02:12:43,119
that now

3449
02:12:40,800 --> 02:12:45,039
in the past two years doing all the

3450
02:12:43,118 --> 02:12:45,759
stuff that you've seen with dna and all

3451
02:12:45,039 --> 02:12:48,078
that

3452
02:12:45,760 --> 02:12:49,199
and so we need now to double that over

3453
02:12:48,078 --> 02:12:50,960
again

3454
02:12:49,198 --> 02:12:53,279
so we've got to find somebody with deep

3455
02:12:50,960 --> 02:12:55,760
pockets who's willing to it's not a

3456
02:12:53,279 --> 02:12:58,639
business deal this is a scientific

3457
02:12:55,760 --> 02:13:00,960
endeavor where we're trying to move the

3458
02:12:58,639 --> 02:13:03,199
line of history forward

3459
02:13:00,960 --> 02:13:04,800
we're not in this to make anybody a

3460
02:13:03,198 --> 02:13:06,559
bundle of money they're doing this to

3461
02:13:04,800 --> 02:13:08,800
answer the same kind of questions as if

3462
02:13:06,560 --> 02:13:11,280
we had found lucy or the lake turkana

3463
02:13:08,800 --> 02:13:12,800
boy or anything like that and you can go

3464
02:13:11,279 --> 02:13:14,800
to your college or your university

3465
02:13:12,800 --> 02:13:16,320
whatever and get a million dollar plan

3466
02:13:14,800 --> 02:13:18,239
or two million dollar grant or whatever

3467
02:13:16,319 --> 02:13:20,078
you need to work two three years and

3468
02:13:18,238 --> 02:13:22,399
find all the answers we don't have that

3469
02:13:20,078 --> 02:13:24,719
luxury we do this by the skin of our

3470
02:13:22,399 --> 02:13:26,000
teeth we do it on a budget but we get it

3471
02:13:24,719 --> 02:13:28,480
done

3472
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:30,800
this is what we need

3473
02:13:28,479 --> 02:13:32,879
we have been told that because it's so

3474
02:13:30,800 --> 02:13:34,960
important when we stand up in front of

3475
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:36,159
the world to announce whatever it is

3476
02:13:34,960 --> 02:13:37,760
that we have

3477
02:13:36,158 --> 02:13:39,759
and we're facing that bank of

3478
02:13:37,760 --> 02:13:40,960
microphones as you always see at a press

3479
02:13:39,760 --> 02:13:42,480
conference

3480
02:13:40,960 --> 02:13:44,560
we have got to be able to stand there

3481
02:13:42,479 --> 02:13:46,559
and say we've covered every base because

3482
02:13:44,560 --> 02:13:47,679
you know and i know that the critics are

3483
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:49,920
going to say

3484
02:13:47,679 --> 02:13:51,840
have you done this test have you done

3485
02:13:49,920 --> 02:13:54,239
that test and you've done this test have

3486
02:13:51,840 --> 02:13:55,279
you done that test and if i have to say

3487
02:13:54,238 --> 02:13:56,638
no

3488
02:13:55,279 --> 02:13:58,479
to any of them

3489
02:13:56,639 --> 02:14:00,319
they're going to say well what are you

3490
02:13:58,479 --> 02:14:02,000
trying to hide

3491
02:14:00,319 --> 02:14:04,639
why didn't you

3492
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:06,479
how can we believe you did this and this

3493
02:14:04,639 --> 02:14:07,599
is what you say it is if you didn't do

3494
02:14:06,479 --> 02:14:09,598
these things

3495
02:14:07,599 --> 02:14:14,078
so now we're kind of boxed into where we

3496
02:14:09,599 --> 02:14:16,159
have to do all of it to cover the bases

3497
02:14:14,078 --> 02:14:18,319
but if we can do that

3498
02:14:16,158 --> 02:14:21,679
and make our case

3499
02:14:18,319 --> 02:14:23,679
we've got enough sample enough bone to

3500
02:14:21,679 --> 02:14:25,920
where anybody else out there who wants

3501
02:14:23,679 --> 02:14:27,359
to criticize what we did can take the

3502
02:14:25,920 --> 02:14:29,199
sample and repeat the test with

3503
02:14:27,359 --> 02:14:30,960
themselves

3504
02:14:29,198 --> 02:14:33,279
that's the beauty of the starchild

3505
02:14:30,960 --> 02:14:35,359
there's so much of it

3506
02:14:33,279 --> 02:14:36,639
and it takes so little to do most of

3507
02:14:35,359 --> 02:14:38,960
this stuff

3508
02:14:36,639 --> 02:14:41,279
pieces the size of your fingernails is

3509
02:14:38,960 --> 02:14:44,560
all it takes

3510
02:14:41,279 --> 02:14:46,559
it's amazing it's a wonderful thing so

3511

3512
02:14:46,560 --> 02:14:50,639
what i'm asking you for is help to get

3513
02:14:49,118 --> 02:14:52,880
this done

3514
02:14:50,639 --> 02:14:55,679
i don't say anybody here is able to do

3515
02:14:52,880 --> 02:14:57,920

02:15:20,800 --> 02:15:24,800

the enigmatic and complicated world of

another reason for the numerous splits

the unconscious mind remains a mystery

because we are simply not conscious of

it

3563
02:17:58,879 --> 02:18:03,279
we must imagine what it is like inside

this huge domain on the other side of

excluding any possibilities that have

frame paradigm as in the case of science

and logic

3584
02:18:50,398 --> 02:18:55,760
perhaps we need to abandon any previous

3585
02:18:52,799 --> 02:19:00,159
notions or ideas about this phenomenon

3586

what are the ufos

are they emanating from ourselves

3589
02:19:10,398 --> 02:19:15,199
are they here only because we have the

3590
02:19:12,478 --> 02:19:17,199
capacity to perceive them

3591
02:19:15,200 --> 02:19:19,040
perhaps they are ancient archetypes that

02:19:17,200 --> 02:19:20,479
we have forgotten within the sands of

standing on the border between animal
