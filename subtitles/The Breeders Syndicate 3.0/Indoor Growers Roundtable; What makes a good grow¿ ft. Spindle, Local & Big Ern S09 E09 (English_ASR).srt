00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:15,160
this is my journey into finding my truth

00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,560
warned it's not always pretty with the

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,960
invasion of corporate culture into

11
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:28,518
cannabis it's getting even more muddy

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,359
which is why I've made it my mission to

13
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:32,558
have a permanent record before all the

14
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,160
history is lost and buried under a pile

15
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:37,399

16
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:39,039

all the smok and mirrors in doing so we

20

those who oppose and my personal mission

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,399

34
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:24,280
like the outdoor growing episode we're

35
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:26,879
hoping to start a little like recurring

36
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,719
indoor growing series and today we're

37
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,959
bringing on as Matt mentioned some of

38
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:33,239
our homies and we're going to talk

39
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:35,759
through some for this episode some

40
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:38,118
pretty basic basic uh indoor growing

41
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,478
topics and then uh at the end we'll

42
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:41,599
we'll kind of conclude with like a more

43
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:43,519
open kind of philosophical question

44
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:46,399
about you know what people think makes

45
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:48,718
for a good growth um but to kick things

46
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,680
off and to warm everyone up I thought we

47
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:53,319
would just go around and talk about how

48
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,600
long have you been growing and what have

49
00:01:53,319 --> 00:02:00,959
you been growing recently or now uh

50
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:05,798
maybe we start with spindle Michael

51
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:08,038
so I grew my very first plant in

52
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:12,319
1995 I think it

53
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:14,479
was um and I just had started some seeds

54
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:18,359
I worked at a golf course at the time

55
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:21,439
and there was an area off of the 13th

56
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:24,400
hole that kind of had some trees and

57
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:27,318
brush that they didn't clean up and I

58
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,280
just put some five gallon buckets out

59
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:30,799
there with some seeds and grew my first

60
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,680
plants that

61
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:39,959
way um and it actually came out pretty

62
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:43,120
decent um I think probably by 96 I

63
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,120
started my first

64
00:02:43,878 --> 00:02:48,719
indoor that I could really call growing

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,318
you know otherwise it was just a couple

66
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:55,000
plants I'd water a few times during the

67
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,560
summer well I'm going to ask you each

68
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,800
I'm going to ask each of you more about

69
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:03,199
like the actual Journey um but for now

70
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,200

number

145
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:33,960
six um from pack there's no reason to be

146
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:35,879
putting asteris on that goddamn death

147
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:38,918
that drives me nuts dude that's Death

148
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:42,279
Star it's funny give us some tell us

149
00:06:38,918 --> 00:06:44,439
about the asterisk one of you um I don't

150
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:46,638
know I don't get it so I don't know I

151
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:49,680
don't know if

152
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:53,918
it's act I don't know what it is it's

153
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:56,519
just dank you know like it was it I I

154
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:58,478
mean it's just very it's just a cut

155
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:01,159
that's very hard to trace provenance on

156
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:02,359
like from the dire it came but like for

157
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,360
the people who have experienced death

158
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,280
star before and had it from like death

159
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,360
star crew it's Death Star it's

160
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:10,079
definitely definitely Death Star if not

161
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,840
it's it's like the most perfect Death

162
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:16,639
Star reproduction ever you know either

163
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:19,638
way I'll say as well that that asterisk

164
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,960
tells you so much about how much these

165
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:25,680
guys care about what they know or don't

166
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:28,478
know and it's yeah I think it's really

167
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,120
sweet I guess I can also add that within

168
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:32,120
like the last year it seems like

169
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,399
everyone and their [ __ ] mom's popping

170
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:37,759
out with the Death Star so I don't know

171
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:40,399
it's just like what what the hell

172
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,280
Grandma's Death Star it made it out of

173
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:43,598
it made it out of circles right like it

174
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:44,878
used to be a cut that was only in

175
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:47,079
certain circles you could only get it

176
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,039
feed certain circles but it's one of the

177
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:50,918
few that like the real cut made it out

178
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:52,719
of those circles into places where

179
00:07:50,918 --> 00:07:54,758
people were selling clones on the Clone

180
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,159
market and because of that it's

181
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:59,400
accessible and it's one of the few that

182
00:07:57,158 --> 00:08:01,319
like I think is a really dank line that

183
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:03,719
made it into the Clone market like the

184
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:06,840
actual cut and in this case it's a good

185
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,840
thing or probably would be

186
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:14,680
gone yeah yeah um in in hearing from you

187
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:17,120
all I did actually want to draw on one

188
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,439
thing I think the earn was getting into

189
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,598
um so we'll do another I want to do

190
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:24,000
another round here in this warmup which

191
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:26,199
is what did it feel like that very first

192
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,680
time you actually flowered something

193
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:31,120
that very first time CU recently right I

194
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:34,519
got this feel and it's totally unrelated

195
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,158
like loc has been setting up um new like

196
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:39,038
fish tanks for

197
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:41,439
himself and it kind of gave me that

198
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:43,120
sense of like it reminded me of that Joy

199
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,560
when I first set up like my first like

200
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,679
growing

201
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:49,000
space um and I kind of wanted to yeah I

202
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:50,879
kind of wanted to hear from each of you

203
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,480
like what that moment was like when you

204
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:55,600
were first like actually growing you

205
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,560
know whenever you think that was um can

206
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,320
start with Michael

207
00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:04,039
again uh uh to be honest thousand it was

208
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:07,480
uh about 100%

209
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:11,439
fear just being super scared of getting

210
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:15,079
caught yeah um having to go in the

211
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,800
middle of the night to uh cut the plant

212
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:19,519
down and just hoping I don't get pulled

213
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:23,559
over on the way home with

214
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:25,720
it that's for real yeah like I'd like to

215
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:27,479
be like oh it was so awesome it was

216
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:31,519
awesome once it was dried and I was back

217
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:35,639
at home you know with with uh the plants

218
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:38,879
but the actual uh the process doing the

219
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:40,838
pro the process was super scary yeah I

220
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:44,439
bet you taking it home would have been

221
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:46,360
freaky that time as well but yeah it it

222
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:49,160
was nerve-wracking but you know once it

223
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:51,600
was in the closet and I could actually

224
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:54,159
look at it in light because I was always

225
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,399
going at night to water and stuff and

226
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:59,319
seeing like the nice pinks and purples

227
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,799
on it like I was I was pretty pretty

228
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:03,920
[ __ ] stoked you know and I was proud

229
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:06,120
of myself you

230
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:07,838
know it's nice being able to do

231
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,959
something for yourself especially when

232
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:13,000
you're young you know I think that's

233
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:15,359
gonna make this this whole conversation

234
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,159
pretty interesting right is like there's

235
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,039
several different generations of Growers

236
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:23,199
here from from Modern Times uh that have

237
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:25,159
only grown indoor to like my generation

238
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,959
and then all the way back to Michaels

239
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:28,639
because he was growing well before me

240
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:31,559
you know all the way back he's not that

241
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:34,838
old man like he's so much older bro he

242
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:36,599
was growing in the old days bro well

243
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:38,720
what what's a real kick in the balls is

244
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,399
these guys like local and Panda that

245
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,200
have been growing for like such a short

246
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:47,839
amount of time and they just hit home

247
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:50,360
run after home run yeah like see their

248
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,720
pictures and it's just like oh what the

249
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,720
[ __ ] you know what it reminds me of is

250
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,278
like in skateboarding like back in the

251
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,800
day when when I would be skateboarding

252
00:10:56,278 --> 00:10:59,720
and doing tricks like we'd be busting

253
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:01,319
like 360 flips thinking we were just so

254
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,759
good you played like the Tony Hawk game

255
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,800
and see all this crazy [ __ ] you could do

256
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:08,000
in the game and now I go on Instagram

257
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:10,639
and watch kids doing the Tony Hawk moves

258
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,240
real in real life and I couldn't even

259
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:14,480
comprehend the gravity physics of any of

260
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,879
it it reminds me a lot of that with

261
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,039
these guys like I didn't have a quick

262
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:20,720
start I had a brown thumb I had a lot of

263
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:22,000
failing to do but like er even just

264
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,480
since he's been in our group I've

265
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,440
watched him progress just like and like

266
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,680
jump me like a lot and how and how his

267
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,320
product turns out routinely and that's

268
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:35,479
that's something else man it's something

269
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:37,000
else to watch yep yeah awesome yeah yeah

270
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,240
for the record I should say that for

271
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,600
myself I've been growing only for about

272
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:45,919
four years as well so I'm in between ER

273
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:48,639
and local in terms of Growing Experience

274
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:52,559
or at least time I could

275
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:54,519
say um er yeah what was that initial

276
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:58,000
moment like for you whenever you think

277
00:11:54,519 --> 00:12:02,278
that was yeah I mean I can remember it

278
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,240
like full on like you know um ordering I

279
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:07,720
you know I started indoors so like I

280
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:10,320
ordered like some shitty like mors Hydro

281
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,639
kit and like got like a 4x4 tint with

282
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,680
like a light and everything I'm like

283
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:15,720

284
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:18,759
just stoked you know what I mean like

285
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:22,360
super excited about it um I had like a

286
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:24,919
whole 4x4 ENT for one clone to start

287
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,399
because I just like had no other seeds

288
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:29,159
or anything and I was just so like and I

289
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:31,839
would just like sit down there with a

290
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:33,799
chair and with my tent open and just

291
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,440
like smoke a joint and just like watch

292
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:37,399

293
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,240
like what I don't know what I was doing

294
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:41,360
but I was just so into it you know what

295
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,480
I mean I was just like man like I've

296
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,278
wanted to do this for so long and like

297
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:50,920
just like for whatever reasons I haven't

298
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:54,679
been able to and now I'm able to and I'm

299
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:56,479
just like it's just so cool to me um I

300
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:59,278
still definitely have that feeling like

301
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,240
when I like like I have the like you

302
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,720
know whatever some some plant that I'm

303
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,839
super stoked about and I'm getting ready

304
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,240
to flip it I'm just like dude I'm so

305
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,880
[ __ ] stoked to just see what's going

306
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,959
to come out you know what I mean um so

307
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:11,958
it's still really fun to

308
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:21,120
me hell yeah

309
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:24,680
local um so my first time like actually

310
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:29,879
getting set up growing I mean I was like

311
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:31,919
maybe 18 or something like that um and

312
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:34,879
was obviously kind of broke so like I

313
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:37,838
bought piece by piece um throughout like

314
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:39,679
the the first growth cycle um but like

315
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,399
it was still fun to watch it because

316
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:44,559
like it was you know it was growing but

317
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:48,039
I had like a shitty uh vipar Spectra or

318
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:50,958
something like that um and a 2x4 t0 and

319
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:55,519
kind of just uh went with it nothing

320
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:56,719
great but uh started learning each round

321
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,759
after that

322
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,759
so I guess that says something

323
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:08,319
thing was it like a a particularly scary

324
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:12,320
or you know exciting moment for you um

325
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:15,160
that was in a really like uh weird you

326
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,959
know uh place in my life where I just

327
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:22,039
didn't care about stuff so not

328
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:24,719
really um yeah but yeah that's really

329
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:24,719
that's an interesting

330
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:31,000
contrast yeah it is I mean yeah it's the

331
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:34,320
different Generations though you

332
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,440
know yeah yeah I mean you don't have to

333
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,240
tell us but I mean it's a context for

334
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:42,399
this because you weren't necessarily

335
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,198
like I don't know like it it wasn't a

336
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,480
passion when you started is that

337
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:51,159
accurate or like why why were why were

338
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:54,920
you so kind of like I don't know uh

339
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:56,799
epoe um I guess it was more so that I

340
00:14:54,919 --> 00:15:00,360
was interested in growing things like

341
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:02,838
just plants in general um

342
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:04,839
and when you're broke you don't want to

343
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:07,120
[ __ ] buy weed bro like that's the

344
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:09,279
last thing you want to spend money on

345
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,839
especially when eights are 45 bucks a

346
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:16,639
piece it's like [ __ ] that dude yeah all

347
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:19,279
right that makes sense that makes

348
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:22,000
sense um I wonder if Matt actually wants

349
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:24,480
to tell us about his first kind of

350
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,600
moments um you know like I've talked

351
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:30,560
about it before but my first uh moment

352
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,720
after after I was on my own and decided

353
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,958
I was going to grow by myself um I

354
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,519
thought I was going to be smart and

355
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:39,000
avoid paying all this high dollar for

356
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,078
lights right because I figured I would

357
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,120
outsmart everyone so I went to um

358
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:46,799
Walmart and got uh some hallogen grow

359
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,318
lights that they called them hallogen

360
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:52,639
grow lights and they were just basically

361
00:15:48,318 --> 00:15:54,919
hogen heat lamps and I tried growing a

362
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,879
Seedling from Bad Seed with this

363
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:59,198
hallogen seed lamp and it was the most

364
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:00,919
painful thing

365
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:03,318
when I when I showed my friend who was

366
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:04,599
another grower at the time that that was

367
00:16:03,318 --> 00:16:06,159
way more advanced than me and I showed

368
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,560
him and I was all proud of this and I

369
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:09,159
was like is it supposed to be like this

370
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:11,078
and it was like a Seedling like you know

371
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:13,159
a foot tall with like just little cot

372
00:16:11,078 --> 00:16:16,958
leens on it he's like dude put that out

373
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:19,600
of its misery now and I remember feel so

374
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:22,000
heartbroken what you can save it it's

375
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,720
alive I'm not killing it he's like bro

376
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,919
kill that please and yeah so mine was

377
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,040
not a good experience mine was a very

378
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:30,479
disheartening experience it was one of

379
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:32,399
those times where I had to realize just

380
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,639
cuz you think you're like smart at [ __ ]

381
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:38,240
like you can't just run head first into

382
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:40,959
something that you know nothing about

383
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,159
like going from my dad's [ __ ] when I was

384
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:45,679
a kid to that was just night and day I

385
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:47,958
had no place that you I could outsmart

386
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:51,078
anyone so that was a big learning curve

387
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:55,359
you know yeah I spent a good month

388
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:57,198
wasting time on that bean pull of the

389
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:01,240
seedling

390
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:03,120
yeah yeah cuz I mean it's really nice to

391
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,318
hear from you all about about yeah how

392
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,798
you started because I think as we've

393
00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:09,078
already seen like it's very different

394
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:11,000
for different people um in different

395
00:17:09,078 --> 00:17:14,639
contexts

396
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,279
um how we also kind of came

397
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,679
to how' I put it how we got to This

398
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:21,519
indoor growing episode actually was I

399
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:25,079
was actually trying to figure out a

400
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:26,519
hydro episode with spindle here and

401
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:28,279
unfortunately we couldn't get we

402
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:30,079
couldn't we didn't manage to convince B

403
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:31,599
to come on and so we kind of adapted

404
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:34,199
this to a more General like indel

405
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:35,879
growing episode um and in that time I

406
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,558
was starting to think more and more

407
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:41,000
about less about the tech you know less

408
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:43,480
just like isolated conversations about

409
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,359
tech and and and and gear and stuff and

410
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,360
more about oh I actually wonder what

411
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:50,678
people's Journeys you know individually

412
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:54,079
were like um Michael I think you you

413
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:55,840
started to get to this in your intro um

414
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:58,759
I'd like to know

415
00:17:55,839 --> 00:18:00,879
like how did you get to the system or

416
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:03,240
setup that you're using now you know how

417
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,679
long did that take how you know uh from

418
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,720
a very broad you know perspective um

419
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:09,640
yeah I'd like to hear from each of you

420
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,600
about this like how how long did it take

421
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,960
for you to develop your system to where

422
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:14,879
it is and what were some of the major

423
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,519
lessons along the

424
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,799
way I think in in the beginning it was

425
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:24,359
really hard because I would buy like

426
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:27,319
High Times or uh cannabis Canada

427
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:29,399
Cannabis culture magazines and I'd see

428
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:32,639
the Articles and I'd see the like the

429
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:35,720
metal HED lights and stuff like that but

430
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:38,840
uh there was nowhere in Eugene that I

431
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:40,360
could find that stuff for sale so me and

432
00:18:38,839 --> 00:18:42,240
my buddies would have to drive all the

433
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:44,599
way to Portland just to find a store

434
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:48,480
that actually sold the lighting

435
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:50,599
itself you know like uh I wish I wish

436
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,880
those tents would have came out I don't

437
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:54,359
know when people

438
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,880
started uh buying the grow tents or they

439
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:58,399
started being made but uh man I wish

440
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,559
those would have been around you you

441
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,640
know when I was younger CU those things

442
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:06,759
are just super

443
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:11,320
convenient um as far as the system my

444
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:15,759
first closet grow was in just uh

445
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:18,119
soil you know um I kept doing you know

446
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:21,480
after that first successful one I kept

447
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:23,918
doing research and I'd see articles and

448
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:27,319
uh one of my buddies approached me with

449
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:29,440
uh setting up his garage to do like a

450
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:31,678
nutrient fil

451
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,360
technique and we just bought a bunch of

452
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,880
gutters from Home Depot and we'd let the

453
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:41,079
water pass through and the plants sat in

454
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,240
the gutters uh raised up on like hydron

455
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:44,519
uh little

456
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,038
baskets you know and we had a good run

457
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:50,000
in the winter and then the summer the

458
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:52,079
run just completely turned to [ __ ]

459
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,960
because at the time I didn't understand

460
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:56,558
but it was the heat of the water like

461
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,360
once the the garage started heating up

462
00:19:56,558 --> 00:19:59,839
the water temperature started heating up

463
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:02,558
up we started getting bacteria

464
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:04,759
everywhere that's the dep of it dude

465
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:07,038
yeah and we didn't have anyone to ask

466
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:10,798
yeah no there was there was no YouTube

467
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:12,480
to look up videos on how to do it um so

468
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:14,798
really it took me a good five or six

469
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:18,120
years to even figure out why that run

470
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:21,400
didn't work yeah you know so I had tried

471
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:24,479
the nutrient film technique uh I tried

472
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:28,840
eban Flo once I moved to California that

473
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:32,558
one seemed real simple a lot of a lot of

474
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:36,839
work um and then I

475
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:39,000
saw somebody on the old forums uh you

476
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:40,519
know what I think it was Ivan I don't

477
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,279
remember what he went by it was uh

478
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:47,798
something Jack Mayer Jack mayhoffer

479
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:50,558
yeah yeah I saw him do like a a post

480
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:53,079
with he was using cocoa I think but it

481
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:55,038
was drained to waste yeah yeah and uh

482
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:56,558
when I saw the drained to waste it just

483
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:59,400
all clicked to me because I was like oh

484
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:03,279
my God that is so so much

485
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:05,559
easier so much more precise and I can

486
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:08,399
just use uh you know a little condens

487
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:09,960
scent pump to get rid of all the runoff

488
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,400
you know and there's not going to be any

489
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:16,558
mess and uh so once I saw those posts

490
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,400
and I wanted to try it myself it I knew

491
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:21,720
I before doing it I knew it was going to

492
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:24,759
be the easiest way for me you know and

493
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:27,679
now that I'm older i' you know I'd love

494
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:29,440
to be an organic Gardener but I simply

495
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,919
don't have the

496
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,278
time you know with working as much as I

497
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,080
do and the amount of work it takes and I

498
00:21:34,278 --> 00:21:37,720
don't want to have any failed runs I'm

499
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:40,678
getting older I want to make sure every

500
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:43,000
run that I do I get to see the potential

501
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:45,640
of the plants maybe it's not the you

502
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,798
know 100% greatest organic knock it out

503
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:52,799
of the park but it's always good with

504
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:55,079
the system that I run yeah you know it's

505
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:59,839
easy to dial

506
00:21:55,079 --> 00:22:01,278
in I agree yeah yep yeah so you've kept

507
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:04,599
this current system for how long would

508
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:04,599
you say at least like you know

509
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:10,359
Loosely uh drained waste I've been doing

510
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:17,080
for 10 years

511
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:19,119
wow could you okay I'm pretty I'm a

512
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:21,519
little bit ignorant about nutrient film

513
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:25,479
like could you give us a like a very

514
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:29,319
like you know High L okay so imagine um

515
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:32,798
have you ever seen an arrow cloner yeah

516
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:35,839
okay so the plant basically is suspended

517
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:39,319
above where the water passes

518
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:41,839
through and The Roots just hang down and

519
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:45,038
we use you can use uh PVC pipes or

520
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:48,359
gutters or whatever and a constant flow

521
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:51,200
of water with nutrients in it is always

522
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:54,678
bathing the roots but it never stands

523
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:57,440
still so the water's always moving all

524
00:22:54,679 --> 00:23:02,400
the time it's a little different than um

525
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:05,000
like let's say uh what is it oh God the

526
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,559
one where the water deep water culture

527
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,519
yeah recirculate deep water culture it's

528
00:23:07,558 --> 00:23:14,519
different than that where in in that

529
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:17,240
system the water sits pretty uh stable

530
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:19,960
in one spot and then you air rate that

531
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:23,200
water yeah this one the water's always

532
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:25,960
moving it's always passing through yeah

533
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,200
which is also why when it gets heated

534
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:30,919
and a little bit warmer all the water

535
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:34,720
stays warm and it gets really super

536
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:37,200
aerobic yep crazy yep it's definitely

537
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,880
it's it's super difficult you'd have to

538
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,798
you'd have to spend the money and really

539
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:45,240
be on your game to have like a large

540
00:23:41,798 --> 00:23:47,079
scale nutrient film technique down yeah

541
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,960
some dudes had it down but it yeah

542
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:52,599
exactly it took chillers and all kinds

543
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:55,519
of stuff right a lot of expenses

544
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:58,038
and one problem overnight your plants

545
00:23:55,519 --> 00:24:00,400
would be dead like if a pump went out or

546
00:23:58,038 --> 00:24:02,359
something or your Chiller went out you

547
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,880
could be pretty much finished in 24

548
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:07,719
hours yeah I like I grow in rock Hool

549
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:10,200
now for the drained waste because I can

550
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:12,679
get away with a lot if something breaks

551
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:16,080
and I don't see it for 12 or 14 hours

552
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:18,960
the plants are still fine yeah you know

553
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:21,720
I've I've gone more than 24 hours

554
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:25,480
without watering in wol before and still

555
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:28,798
been able to pick up and just go oh yeah

556
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:30,640
you know so it's it's very flexible

557
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:33,079
I did have a general question for you

558
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,480
about you know the very broad field of

559
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:36,319
hydro would you say that over the last

560
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,558
few

561
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:42,000
years one technique has kind of emerged

562
00:24:39,558 --> 00:24:46,440
as the most popular or favorite and is

563
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:48,919
it this one is what biger would call The

564
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,880
Meta oh uh drained

565
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:53,559
waste absolutely yeah like if you're

566
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:57,960
doing anything on

567
00:24:53,558 --> 00:25:00,839
scale um which I'm not but if you were

568
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:03,720
like like uh one of the big facilities

569
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:05,439
I'm pretty sure 90 95% of them are

570
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,600
running drained to

571
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,558
waste yeah you know yeah yeah yeah

572
00:25:08,599 --> 00:25:13,158
that's interesting so over time people

573
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:15,398
have converged like towards this this

574
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:17,640
approach yeah that's cool yeah I'd say

575
00:25:15,398 --> 00:25:20,918
for uh the deep water culture that seems

576
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:22,399
like mainly a a small homow yeah

577
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:26,120
situation where someone wants to grow

578
00:25:22,398 --> 00:25:28,599
two or three huge plants I rarely see

579
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:31,759
anybody stick with dwc for like a whole

580
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:34,278
career of growing it's usually like a uh

581
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:36,240
a path someone takes for a while you

582
00:25:34,278 --> 00:25:37,960
know but there are people who have it's

583
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,038
just so rare to see someone be like a

584
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:44,200
hardcore rdwc dude you know see it seems

585
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:45,599
like a lot of extra work it's a lot man

586
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,319
that's what I was gonna say that's

587
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:50,439
that's I I did that for a little bit is

588
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:52,519
it's a lot it's a lot of work you go in

589
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:56,240
you tell us about yeah tell us about

590
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:58,158
what you learned yeah so yeah I mean I

591
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,079
started with soil just like like Happy

592
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:03,840
Frog or whatever you know like from the

593
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:06,319
hydro shop and got some like the general

594
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:09,359
Hydro One Part nutrient to start it's

595
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:11,519
like a flora Nova and like a wait sorry

596
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:15,359
can I just ask you here were you

597

watching Mr [ __ ] Mr kanuck oh absolutely

598
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:20,918
I watch Mr kanuck his [ __ ] editing is

599
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:25,200
next level I mean like as far as like

600
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:27,840
cool looking weed Mr kanuck he so he's

601

00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:33,398
nice

603
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:33,398
cameras Shout Out Mr Kut

[Laughter]

605
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:45,240
bro so I'm not I'm not gonna trash this

606
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:48,678
dude anyways but yeah yeah yeah so um I

607
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:50,159
yes I was watching stuff like that and

608
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:53,120
was

609
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,960
um I went to the hydroponic store talk

610
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:57,879
to this guy he sells me a bunch of [ __ ]

611
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:01,319
that I don't need basically and I go

612
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:05,039
home and just you know grow some shitty

613
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:07,519
plants for a little bit you know yeah um

614
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:09,759
and then I got really at some point I

615
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:11,000
don't know why but I got really obsessed

616
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:14,359
with

617
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:18,440
like the fact with like soil that like I

618
00:27:14,359 --> 00:27:22,359
couldn't control like like if there was

619
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:24,640
some kind of nutrient excess or you know

620
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:27,000
or whatever it was I just couldn't

621
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,000
control it quickly enough you know what

622
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,640
I mean so would like I got obsessed with

623
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,558
this feeling of like needing to be able

624
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,679
to like really monitor each of those

625
00:27:33,558 --> 00:27:39,079
parameters with like pH and stuff which

626
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:42,640
is what led me into dwc yeah so I went

627
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:45,000
to dwc and um you know I'm not growing

628
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:49,759
at scale either but I am doing like a

629
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:52,119
Perpetual kind of deal and um I had this

630
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:53,679
one run where like a lot I'm going to

631
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:57,558
Echo a lot of the same stuff spindle

632
00:27:53,679 --> 00:28:00,440
said um I had this one I had this one

633
00:27:57,558 --> 00:28:03,558
run where I was growing autos at this

634
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:05,399
point in uh dwc which like woo dude

635
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:10,759
crush me you know what I'm saying right

636
00:28:05,398 --> 00:28:12,759
and um they uh they were looking great

637
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:15,158
one day I mean like great D like the

638
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:18,558
best plants I've ever grown and then the

639
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:20,480
next day they're like drooping in brown

640
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:23,000
and I was like what is going on you know

641
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,159
and I'm like trying to save these plants

642
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,960
and I couldn't you know like they died

643
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:31,480
like like three plants died and uh that

644
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,640
was like my first real failure where I

645
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:36,038
was like I couldn't didn't get anything

646
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:38,320
from the grow you know what I mean um

647
00:28:36,038 --> 00:28:39,960
and was like midflower you know and I

648
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:42,519
put a lot of time into it so I was like

649
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,159
man that's sucks so I started reading

650
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:46,599
into it and stuff checking my water

651
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,799
temperature really frequently I ran into

652
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:51,359
the same thing water temperature starts

653
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:55,240
getting up to like 72 something like

654
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:57,519
that you need to be like 65 so I'm like

655
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:59,599
I'm looking at like water chillers and

656
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:02,000
I'm like man I'm going to have I'm

657
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:03,798
running like a 4x4 and a 2x4 and I'm

658
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,359
going to buy a water chiller for each

659
00:29:03,798 --> 00:29:08,119
tent like are you kidding me that's $700

660
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:10,798
in water and I was like no I'm not doing

661
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:12,959
that so so that was the end of my deep

662
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:16,079
water culture career I did like a couple

663
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,640
runs in it and it really taught me a ton

664
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:21,398
about just like managing pH and managing

665
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:24,320
PPM and stuff like that but it was just

666
00:29:21,398 --> 00:29:26,918
too expensive for what I was going and I

667
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:29,960
also wanted to be able to hunt like you

668
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:31,320
know a good population size and that was

669
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,319
tough for me to do in deep deep

670
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:35,960
articulture as

671
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:38,240
well and you know you ALS there's a lot

672
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:40,159
of things you also if it's recirculating

673
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,159
then you you know there's you have like

674
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:46,080
all the plants are Fe feeding from the

675
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:47,679
same Reservoir so then like you aren't

676
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:49,759
it's I mean that's not accurate you know

677
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,559
you're not controlling like what each is

678
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:56,000
getting and stuff so it's just a lot of

679
00:29:51,558 --> 00:29:58,960
things um so then I ended up um coming

680
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,319
back into oil and tried to do the

681
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:04,558
organic kind of deal for a little bit

682
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:06,519
which realistically was me using organic

683
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:09,879
nutrients and doing drain to

684
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:11,640
waste um you know and so I wouldn't

685
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,919
necessarily even say like I'm not going

686
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,759
to sit here and tell you I'm an organic

687
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:19,519
you know I you know what I mean that I

688
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:22,079
have any real good uh base for that um

689
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:24,720
but that led me up into where just one

690
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:27,439
drained to waste cocoa with can of

691
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:31,038
nutrients and I went down to just

692
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:33,240
Baseline Cana a&amp; grew plants for a few

693
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:35,319
runs with that and then now I'm adding

694
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,399
stuff in to just like see how it affects

695
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:41,319
stuff um because I was adding like

696
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:43,678
silica and all this all these different

697
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:45,439
like additives and just not really

698
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:49,399
having like an understanding of like why

699
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,798
I was doing it you know so oh yeah let's

700
00:30:49,398 --> 00:30:55,439
come back to silica lighter because I

701
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:56,798
think it's one of those ones um so your

702
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,880
current approach earn how long have you

703
00:30:56,798 --> 00:31:00,720
been

704
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:03,200
doing that um you say it's pretty stable

705
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:07,839
now yeah I mean basically I've been

706
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:10,759
doing the same stuff uh for I don't know

707
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:13,839
I've ran through I'm on my second bottle

708
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:15,759
of Cana now so I don't know how long

709
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:17,038
that think you know I mean not that long

710
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:19,000
I mean I've only been growing for two

711
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:21,839
years so you know who

712
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,880
knows but I I just feel like I've I've

713
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:26,599
done I did a bunch of approaches like

714
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:30,039
really quickly because I just wanted to

715
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:32,319
see it all you know what I mean um yeah

716
00:31:30,038 --> 00:31:35,679
and now have settled on the drained ways

717
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:39,720
kind of thing and yeah yeah remind me to

718
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:41,320
come back to like uh additives later uh

719
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:46,440
I think we'll we'll have a nutrients

720
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:49,839
kind of recap later but yeah okay um

721
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:53,320
local tell us about your you know

722
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:56,918
current system how you got there yeah so

723
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:58,439
right now I'm running um Coco trained to

724
00:31:56,919 --> 00:32:01,759
was

725
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:05,000
um using uh Cana

726
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:06,720
amb um I've been rocking I'll just say

727
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,880
one thing before we get any fur because

728
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,440
I know three of us use Cana we are not

729
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:14,080
sponsored Affiliated we're not marketing

730
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:17,960
for Cana just Happ and step you know we

731
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:20,960
like it sorry local um you're all good

732
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:24,558
dude um so I've been rocking that for

733
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:28,319
about um well not Cana for two years

734
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:30,480
three well three years now [ __ ] uh um

735
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:33,439
but I've been doing uh cocoa drain to

736
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:37,038
waste for three years

737
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:40,120
um and I kind of got into that because I

738
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:43,278
was you know doing organic uh air quote

739
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:48,638
organic grows indor and wanted a little

740
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:54,558
more control more um you know uh space

741
00:32:48,638 --> 00:32:54,558
to pop seeds um so Coco is my best

742
00:32:56,038 --> 00:33:01,038
option

743
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:03,000
yep y any like in terms of like what you

744
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:05,079
experienced like did you go have to go

745
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,200
through any like I don't know big

746
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:13,278
failures or anything like that um my

747
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:15,120
first one um which was overfeeding some

748
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:17,919
plants not all plants responded

749
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:20,719
negatively uh because I was um my first

750
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:24,720
run of Coco was using Jack

751
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,839
321 um and it it was a little high Inn

752
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,679
for some

753
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:30,678
varieties um

754
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:32,919
um so you know some things weren't the

755
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:35,639
best other things were pretty good but

756
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:39,320
then I switched over to something that

757
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:45,479
was um you know a little less

758
00:33:39,319 --> 00:33:47,960
uh highend nitrogen um or at least had

759
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:50,038
you know calcium heavily associated with

760
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,079
nitrogen I don't know I I don't think

761
00:33:50,038 --> 00:33:55,960
it's a

762
00:33:51,079 --> 00:34:01,278
good source for every variety per se for

763
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:04,639
calcium but yeah when when you use Jacks

764
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:08,639
do they still have like have a is it a

765
00:34:04,638 --> 00:34:10,960
bright blue color still um I remember

766
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,919
one solution being blue I don't remember

767
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,240
which one but it was like blue and then

768
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:17,719
kind of like a brownish one yeah because

769
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:20,638
I always when back in the day the first

770
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:22,319
time I ever tried Jag I remember being

771
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,599
like the super bright blue and I was

772
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:27,240
like why do they add dye to their

773
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:31,079
nutrients like that's so weird like a

774
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:34,519
can't want die you know yeah I'm not

775
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:36,560
sure maybe it's just like the raw for I

776
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:39,199
don't know the form that it comes in I

777
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:42,440
don't know like it's weird yeah but I

778
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:42,439
don't know no

779
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:48,918
clue um while yall were talking I did

780
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:51,878
kind of have some thoughts around some

781
00:34:48,918 --> 00:34:54,598
of the trade-offs between like the

782
00:34:51,878 --> 00:34:57,480
various Styles and for me one of the

783
00:34:54,599 --> 00:35:00,000
things that seems to be

784
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:02,280
common between you know quotequote

785
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:07,039
organic and quotequote

786
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:09,519
hydro is there's some degree of

787
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:11,920
finessing and troubleshooting before you

788
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:14,358
arrive at like a stable

789
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,400
approach would you all agree with that

790
00:35:14,358 --> 00:35:18,239
like it feels to me like for both of

791
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,119
them once you've kind of dialed it in

792
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:21,598
enough you can kind of take it for

793
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:24,039
granted at that point and kind of run

794
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,519
with it and the interesting thing for me

795
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:27,920
as someone who you is still like you

796
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:30,519
know peep based po

797
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,240
is that um you know one of the

798
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:34,800
trade-offs there is that I don't have to

799
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:37,479
do as much kind of fine tuning I'm kind

800
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,440
of buffered and like kept safe you know

801
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:42,358
in certain ways from things but I may

802
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,599
not at the same time achieve like say

803
00:35:42,358 --> 00:35:46,400
quite the same degree of like stability

804
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:48,200
as like a hydr grow or you know

805
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,039
something like that yeah what are your

806
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:53,399
thoughts on some of these things I

807
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:55,639
imagine I imagine some of you have

808
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,880
facted these things in like what the

809
00:35:55,639 --> 00:36:00,920
risks are you know setup

810
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,599
costs uh stability you know those kinds

811
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,480
of

812
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:07,680
trade-offs kind of open to the floor

813
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:11,480
just kind of riffing a bit you know um

814
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:14,639
oh go for it no go ahead loo please um

815
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:16,960
yeah so I was just gonna say um you know

816
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:21,879
one of the big uh drivers for me

817
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:25,240
switching to Coco is um I wanted to have

818
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:28,400
you know the growth of a hydrop plant

819
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:31,559
but not have to invest in an entire you

820
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,800
know Hydro type setup so Coco you know I

821
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:37,239
can handw waterer it and get really

822
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:41,318
really good results and you know really

823
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:43,318
fast growth in a tiny container so I

824
00:36:41,318 --> 00:36:47,920
thought it was a really cheap approach

825
00:36:43,318 --> 00:36:47,920
to having a semi-productive

826
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:58,760
system yeah totally you know sometimes I

827
00:36:55,559 --> 00:37:00,960
think uh one of the things with like you

828
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:03,880
can grow organic in Pete right like

829
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,880
that's more of a soil

830
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:13,720
mix thousand yeah yeah I think um what's

831
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:16,519
nice about growing that way is you have

832
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:20,318
uh like a higher

833
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:24,639
floor you know you yes you it's it's

834
00:37:20,318 --> 00:37:28,599
easy it's not a lot of work to come out

835
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:31,318
with um a really like a good product

836
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:34,559
yeah you know like you'd have to really

837
00:37:31,318 --> 00:37:37,519
[ __ ] something up to grow garbage that

838
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:40,559
way you know whereas like if you take a

839
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:42,480
hydro system um a couple mistakes or a

840
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:45,599
couple misunderstandings about certain

841
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:49,639
things you can grow some really shitty

842
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:51,160
weed you know fragile yeah yeah I think

843
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:53,920
that's one of the benefits of doing it

844
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:57,598
the way that you do it um I also think

845
00:37:53,920 --> 00:38:00,240
it's a lot harder to hit this like a

846
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:02,640
really high ceiling with Organic I think

847
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:04,838
you need to really really be good and be

848
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:07,078
on your game have an understanding of

849
00:38:04,838 --> 00:38:08,799
what you're feeding and when and when

850
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:11,880
those nutrients are

851
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:16,839
available that I think is a lot easier

852
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:19,400
to hit um in Hydro you know I like that

853
00:38:16,838 --> 00:38:22,759
you know and I consider what local does

854
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:24,280
hydro as well even if it's not a system

855
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,119
you know because he's controlling what

856
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:29,440
the plants are feeding and what's

857
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:31,760
available to them all the time you know

858
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,920
um going back to like the Ean flow and

859
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:36,480
the deep water culture what I didn't

860
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:40,200
like about those systems is that number

861
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:43,000
one you have to completely empty um the

862
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:45,960
reservoir like dump it all out and then

863
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,280
change it every week because the plant

864
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:50,800
as it's getting watered especially if

865
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:53,119
the water is recirculating all the time

866
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,599
it's going to pull what it wants out

867
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:58,000
right away so early in the week it's

868
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:59,200
getting everything it want wants whereas

869
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,639
as the week

870
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:04,719
progresses those nutrients are going to

871
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:06,838
be less and less available to the plant

872
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:09,959
because it's already drank them and what

873
00:39:06,838 --> 00:39:11,519
that also does is that alters the pH of

874
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:13,920
what's available to the plants so you're

875
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:16,440
having to stay on top of it whereas the

876
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:20,920
way uh I think all three of us are doing

877
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:23,200
it now we always know the plants pH is

878
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:25,920
the same wherever we want it and it's

879
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:27,480
always getting a constant supply of the

880
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,838
nutrients

881
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:33,119
um that it wants and has available to it

882
00:39:30,838 --> 00:39:35,000
you know um so you're not having to

883
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:37,200
worry about certain things getting low

884
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,358
when we don't have the big systems that

885
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:42,358
are monitoring what's you know coming

886
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:44,838
out of the plant after

887
00:39:42,358 --> 00:39:47,159
water yeah yeah I mean that's kind of

888
00:39:44,838 --> 00:39:50,719
like when I had that kind of experience

889
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:52,920
in dwc where You' get into late flower

890
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:54,838
and the plants would just not really be

891
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:56,639
eating and they' just be drinking more

892
00:39:54,838 --> 00:39:59,318
than they're eating and then all of

893
00:39:56,639 --> 00:40:04,039
sudden you check your Reservoir and your

894
00:39:59,318 --> 00:40:07,119
pH is like went from 6.2 to like 5.5

895
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:10,400
overnight you know what I mean it's like

896
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:12,400
your EC just shot shot up yeah right and

897
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,358
now you're like trying to like do this

898
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,519
math in your head like how the [ __ ] do I

899
00:40:14,358 --> 00:40:18,960
how much water do I add back in to cut

900
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:20,880
this like you know it's just a lot of

901
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,800
variables and there's been a lot of

902
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,240
these times where I'd be in my basement

903
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,480
just [ __ ] dumping water everywhere

904
00:40:25,239 --> 00:40:28,078
you know what I mean just [ __ ]

905
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,559
getting rid of those reservoirs and it's

906
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:32,160
just it's a lot of work man if you're

907
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:36,078
just in your basement like dumping

908
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:37,598
buckets of water it's a lot yeah if

909
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:40,359
you're lucky enough to have a drain in

910
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:42,119
your basement yeah I have a I have a I

911
00:40:40,358 --> 00:40:44,239
have a soap pump down there thank God

912
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:45,358
you know yeah dude that it's a nightmare

913
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:47,719
I keep just thinking about that in

914
00:40:45,358 --> 00:40:49,799
California where there aren't many

915
00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:51,480
basements yeah yeah I mean and you're

916
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,560
talking like sometimes you know if you

917
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:56,318
have say you have four plants with a

918
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:58,239
reservoir that's like damn near 20

919
00:40:56,318 --> 00:41:01,318
gallons of water yeah you know what I

920
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:03,479
mean that's a lot of water a lot of

921
00:41:01,318 --> 00:41:06,279
nutrients a lot of

922
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:07,838
everything yeah yeah yeah and I think

923
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:10,519
it's it's really interesting there all

924
00:41:07,838 --> 00:41:13,039
these different ways of evaluating these

925
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:15,920
different grow approaches like I really

926
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:17,599
like what spindle said about basically I

927
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,358
think he was unpacking what consistency

928
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:21,680
means in a way like having a higher

929
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:24,000
floor but maybe like a lowest ceiling is

930
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:25,799
is like more consistency and that's a

931
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,599
tradeoff right but then you have

932
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:31,079
different kind of tradeoffs like like I

933
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:33,079
was saying with um Hydro or soiless if

934
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:35,640
you have a system for it the trade-off

935
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:37,640
is that the labor is not necessarily

936
00:41:35,639 --> 00:41:39,279
during the run when you have fine-tuned

937
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:41,598
everything but it is the process of

938
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:44,319
actually fine-tuning it all to begin

939
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:46,559
with and getting it stable to begin with

940
00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:49,679
that's where the labor goes for organic

941
00:41:46,559 --> 00:41:53,000
it's it's similar in the sense that like

942
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:55,358
your ability to prepare your soil

943
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,039
troubleshoot it test it all of that is

944
00:41:55,358 --> 00:42:01,759
upfront labor that once you've yeah sure

945
00:41:58,039 --> 00:42:03,679
once you've kind of gone through that um

946
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,359
then your growths are like you know

947
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:09,118
easier but you have to do all that labor

948
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:10,920
up front um and then if you're in like a

949
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:13,838
you know you're hand watering and you're

950
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:15,800
you know potting mix or whatever like me

951
00:42:13,838 --> 00:42:17,400
the labor is constant right it's about

952
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:20,160
hand watering and keeping an eye on

953
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:23,079
things and tailoring stuff to that yeah

954
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:25,440
and the last sorry sorry you go you go

955
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:26,920
in no that's I was just gonna add that

956
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,599
that's kind of the thing that I like

957
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:31,519
about drained a waste is that it just

958
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,318
allows me to not think about the

959
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:35,079
nutrients anymore you know what I mean

960
00:42:33,318 --> 00:42:38,279
to a certain degree I get to a point

961
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:40,240
where I can just mix my stuff I know

962
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,960
what my water is coming out whatever you

963
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:43,799
know I mix it I feed it and then I'm

964
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:46,760
able to just focus on a lot of other

965
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:48,440
things like just good watering practices

966
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,000
and like making sure your environment's

967
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:52,039
like in a good place and like making

968
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,119
sure that your plants are looking good

969
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:55,759
you know just things like that and I

970
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:58,119
think that that's just like much more

971
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:00,520
important than focusing on any certain

972
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:02,280
nutrient line in itself you know to a

973
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:04,358
degree and I definitely want to make

974
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:07,160
that point too because like yeah I've

975
00:43:04,358 --> 00:43:09,920
grown good I what I think is good weed

976
00:43:07,159 --> 00:43:11,879
with General Hydro with Roots organic

977
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:15,838
with like other you know tons of Brands

978
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:18,000
and like it's just more about like uh

979
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:19,719
paying attention to the plant and like I

980
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,599
think like good watering practices and

981
00:43:19,719 --> 00:43:23,000
stuff

982
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:25,519
personally yeah yeah we definitely come

983
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:28,318
back to that about you go Michael sorry

984
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:31,039
thousand want to reiterate that I'm not

985
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:32,880
saying that organic has a low ceiling

986
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:35,800
because I'm saying like a really good

987
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,519
organic Gardener has organic really high

988
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:39,559
feeling

989
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:44,800
um more about

990
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:48,400
like yeah it's it's it's a lot um easier

991
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:50,800
to get to uh somewhat high ceiling in

992
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,880
Hydroponics than it is in organic it

993
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:55,200
takes I in my opinion it takes some real

994
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:57,160
skill to hit that high ceiling but

995
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:58,719
organic Gardener said do their products

996
00:43:57,159 --> 00:44:01,118
absolutely

997
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:03,558
amazing yeah yeah yeah I should yeah

998
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:06,240
definitely not trying to imply that like

999
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:07,640
yeah I when I say like uh higher floor

1000
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:10,159
lower ceiling I do mean that very

1001
00:44:07,639 --> 00:44:11,679
broadly and like that's still me me too

1002
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:14,159
I don't want to offend anybody because

1003
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:16,239
people get super [ __ ] pissed off and

1004
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:18,480
I've SE amazing

1005
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:21,558
organic there's a reason why we have

1006
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:23,358
five people here so they we get if if we

1007
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:26,079
get in trouble they have five targets

1008
00:44:23,358 --> 00:44:28,799
and we spit it out so we didn't gang up

1009
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:30,160
take them out right five times one or

1010
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,720
that too that

1011
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:35,239
too um well I think the last the last

1012
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:38,279
thing I think for me that emerged from

1013
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:40,719
our conversation as well is like the

1014
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:42,680
different forms of like Risk mitigation

1015
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:45,279
so for example like again like Michael

1016
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:48,759
was saying if something goes wrong for

1017
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:51,640
me in like a Peete based potting mix um

1018
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:54,720
there's usually time for me

1019
00:44:51,639 --> 00:44:58,318
to resolve that where is something going

1020
00:44:54,719 --> 00:45:00,719
wrong I imagine in like uh dwc setup

1021
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:04,079
like Ern was saying it happens very very

1022
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:05,719
fast um and your recovery window your

1023
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:09,119
time your window in which to recover is

1024
00:45:05,719 --> 00:45:09,118
like much smaller

1025
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:14,200
right yeah I mean this is cool I think

1026
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:15,920
this is the reason again this is the

1027
00:45:14,199 --> 00:45:17,558
real reason I think why I wanted a bunch

1028
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,920
of us on is because we could actually

1029
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:22,400
talk through some of these like

1030
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,960
nuances whereas you know you get those

1031
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:27,880
like click baity videos that are like oh

1032
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,880
Hydro versus Pete or like organic versus

1033
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:34,358
synthetic outside of like any context

1034
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:38,000
and like bad information I think yeah

1035
00:45:34,358 --> 00:45:40,639
yeah yeah yeah I think like any style if

1036
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,199
you just take the time to learn it and

1037
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:44,679
you know you're going to grow good weed

1038
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:46,598
you know you just have to be willing to

1039
00:45:44,679 --> 00:45:49,440
learn how to grow plants that's

1040
00:45:46,599 --> 00:45:51,039
ultimately the end goal there you know

1041
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,760
it doesn't matter about the nutrient

1042
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:53,838
line you need to learn about like how to

1043
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:57,040
grow

1044
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:58,400
plants or like you just have to mentally

1045
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:01,719
prepare yourself for someone in the

1046
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:04,400
comments to be like so what's the best

1047
00:46:01,719 --> 00:46:06,159
approach right well there's no best

1048
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,559
approach though that's the problem you

1049
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:10,000
know what I mean the best approach is

1050
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:11,880
what works for you you know yeah and

1051
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,519
that's why I'm also like a big thing

1052
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:16,720
about like getting seeds you know like

1053
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:19,480
all everybody like when I came into

1054
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:23,000
growing I saw all these websites selling

1055
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:25,920
clones you know what I mean and I had no

1056
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:28,719
idea what that was I mean you know I'm

1057
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,200
just some random dude that like wanted

1058
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:33,239
to try to grow weed and then I get

1059
00:46:30,199 --> 00:46:37,159
online and I see there's I can buy a cut

1060
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:39,078
of literally you name it you can buy it

1061
00:46:37,159 --> 00:46:42,440
and it's like they're a thousand dollars

1062
00:46:39,079 --> 00:46:44,079
you know I don't know and um yes so I

1063
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:46,000
just really think that people should get

1064
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:48,640
seeds and find plants that grow good in

1065
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,318
their environment and with their setup

1066
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,960
and that's the way that you will find

1067
00:46:50,318 --> 00:46:55,920
good

1068
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:57,679
week yeah yeah I think um we we

1069
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,519
definitely approaching that that broad

1070
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:01,759
topic of like you know what makes for a

1071
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:03,039
good grow but before then I did want to

1072
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:06,800
kind

1073
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:08,800
of I think who who was I talking to

1074
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:12,359
about this must been ear local we were

1075
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:14,720
talking about uncertainty around popular

1076
00:47:12,358 --> 00:47:18,480
tives I thought that'd be an interesting

1077
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:21,159
little uh segue into that so we were

1078
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:25,358
talking about silica yeah right as one

1079
00:47:21,159 --> 00:47:28,199
of the additives that is very popular

1080
00:47:25,358 --> 00:47:30,880
and and commonly prescribed but also

1081
00:47:28,199 --> 00:47:33,318
like not not really

1082
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:35,280
knowing with any certainty like whether

1083
00:47:33,318 --> 00:47:37,079
those things actually make a difference

1084
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,800
kind of curious for like y'all to go

1085
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:40,160
around and think about like I don't know

1086
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,440
have there been additives that you've

1087
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:43,759
used that you're like I don't know if

1088
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,720
this is just Superstition or like I

1089
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:49,440
don't know if this is just like Dogma or

1090
00:47:45,719 --> 00:47:52,598
you know whatever I mean silica is the

1091
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,720
bat one for me that's a big one for me

1092
00:47:52,599 --> 00:47:58,440
um I think the conversation we were

1093
00:47:54,719 --> 00:48:02,159
having was about how I'm I'm always

1094
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:04,358
trying to just figure out better ways to

1095
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:08,078
like when to water my plants and like

1096
00:48:04,358 --> 00:48:09,759
when to like how like I don't know like

1097
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:11,400
I don't really necessarily want to mix

1098
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,400
every nutrient that I'm going to use

1099
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,440
into a resz and just like feed it all in

1100
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:18,639
one go sometimes I'll just break it up a

1101
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:22,039
little bit you know um and I had mixed

1102
00:48:18,639 --> 00:48:23,759
some silica in with my Cana just to see

1103
00:48:22,039 --> 00:48:26,440
like what it would do and it

1104
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:29,359
precipitated like pretty bad

1105
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:31,318
um because silica like drives the P ph

1106
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:34,078
up like insane and like all this stuff

1107
00:48:31,318 --> 00:48:37,199
and then it's like I don't know it just

1108
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:40,680
that's one for me that like um I have

1109
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:44,439
done it with and without side by side on

1110
00:48:40,679 --> 00:48:45,558
the same exact plant and I can't tell a

1111
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,679
difference

1112
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:49,798
personally oh I remember we were talking

1113
00:48:47,679 --> 00:48:51,558
to farad Dan as well and he was saying

1114
00:48:49,798 --> 00:48:54,119
that he did think there was a difference

1115
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:55,680
in um I think he said it was like stem

1116
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:57,920
thickness or something that he could

1117
00:48:55,679 --> 00:49:00,759
tell or

1118
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:02,798
yeah youres I'm GNA kick all your asses

1119
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:05,040
in the silica conversation right about

1120
00:49:02,798 --> 00:49:08,719
now which which kind of silic are you

1121
00:49:05,039 --> 00:49:10,480
using that's important um so I yeah so

1122
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:13,199
I've used like a couple different kinds

1123
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:15,838
but I mean like the dry potassium

1124
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:18,239
silicate okay so that's that's one thing

1125
00:49:15,838 --> 00:49:19,798
that I think like you guys know me I am

1126
00:49:18,239 --> 00:49:21,838
dumb as [ __ ] when it comes to Organics

1127
00:49:19,798 --> 00:49:23,719
and nutrients like it just never been an

1128
00:49:21,838 --> 00:49:27,119
interest to mine but one thing I have

1129
00:49:23,719 --> 00:49:29,199
learned is that ium silicate is

1130
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:31,599
something great in gardens if you're

1131
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:33,399
like reusing your soil especially

1132
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:36,838
because in cannabis it takes so long for

1133
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:38,400
it be consumed so there's unless you're

1134
00:49:36,838 --> 00:49:41,318
reusing your soil and reusing your

1135
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:43,519
medium throwing silica in in potassium

1136
00:49:41,318 --> 00:49:46,159
silic form isn't going to do much but

1137
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:49,239
there is you know stuff like power SI

1138
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:53,078
and again not sponsored here by anyone

1139
00:49:49,239 --> 00:49:54,439
but um Power SI which is a I've and I

1140
00:49:53,079 --> 00:49:56,640
was going to say I've used that one as

1141
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:59,039
well when I was doing the deep water I

1142
00:49:56,639 --> 00:50:01,078
was using there and that's my favorite

1143
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:02,920
thing but I don't use it the way

1144
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:06,240
everybody else does because the way I

1145
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:08,838
found it works best for me was adjusting

1146
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:11,159
nitrogen deficiencies and like calcium

1147
00:50:08,838 --> 00:50:12,920
magnesium deficiencies on the fly

1148
00:50:11,159 --> 00:50:15,558
whenever I used it I would use it in

1149
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:17,440
concert with other nutrients to make it

1150
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:19,280
it would almost be like mainlining it to

1151
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:21,480
the plant like watching watching it

1152
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:23,839
change before my eyes like in within a

1153
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:25,519
few hours I would see major changes in

1154
00:50:23,838 --> 00:50:28,519
how quickly it would uptake other

1155
00:50:25,519 --> 00:50:30,798
nutrients as far as what the the uh

1156
00:50:28,519 --> 00:50:33,119
monosilicic acid which is what power SII

1157
00:50:30,798 --> 00:50:34,559
is was doing itself I mean of course

1158
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:36,160
it's going to increase the stem strength

1159
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:37,920
and structure that's what silica does

1160
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:41,000
and it's a more effective readily

1161
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:43,159
available silica but how it helps carry

1162
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,719
other nutrients is super super

1163
00:50:43,159 --> 00:50:46,440
interesting to watch and that's been my

1164
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:48,679
favorite thing for it for when I screw

1165
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:51,079
up my plants it helps me adjust it on

1166
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:52,838
the Fly and get it back to peel like

1167
00:50:51,079 --> 00:50:54,400
instantly and and you always notice it

1168
00:50:52,838 --> 00:50:58,159
too because your P your plants will

1169
00:50:54,400 --> 00:51:00,960
immediately just go prey straight up

1170
00:50:58,159 --> 00:51:04,118
it's h quite good for it that's a that's

1171
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:07,720
what I use as a ph up oh interesting

1172
00:51:04,119 --> 00:51:11,440
really the power SI no monocytic

1173
00:51:07,719 --> 00:51:14,000
acid power power SI I only use as a f

1174
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:18,159
your feed oh interesting yeah because my

1175
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,760
reservoir is sterile yeah yeah

1176
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:22,598
interesting

1177
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:25,559
yeah I certainly won't I can't say that

1178
00:51:22,599 --> 00:51:27,559
there's no benefit for silica obviously

1179
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:32,000
I just think that like for me personally

1180
00:51:27,559 --> 00:51:35,839
like I've focused more on um like upping

1181
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:38,079
calcium and just good watering practices

1182
00:51:35,838 --> 00:51:40,159
honestly like just knowing like just

1183
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:43,000
like literally that on like I say that

1184
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:45,399
all the time but no [ __ ] just like

1185
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,798
waiting for the pot to be light and then

1186
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:49,519
watering it then and like learning what

1187
00:51:47,798 --> 00:51:52,000
your pots feel like when they're light

1188
00:51:49,519 --> 00:51:54,239
and stuff like that has probably been

1189
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,639
like the biggest thing that has made my

1190
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:58,879
plants like look healthy I mean that is

1191
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:01,400
I mean it's so e like if you get on

1192
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:03,798
Reddit right now and you look at all the

1193
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:06,440
beginner posts about like my plants look

1194
00:52:03,798 --> 00:52:10,039
like [ __ ] I bet 90% of them are just

1195
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:12,880
overwatered oh I'm sure I'm sure

1196
00:52:10,039 --> 00:52:14,880
absolutely or not realizing about pH

1197
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,798
fluctuations and thinking it's like the

1198
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:18,599
wrong kind of nutrients am I using the

1199
00:52:16,798 --> 00:52:20,318
wrong kind of nutrients a lot of times

1200
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:22,680
it's just not even phing their plants

1201
00:52:20,318 --> 00:52:25,519
and just not uptaking the nutrients at

1202
00:52:22,679 --> 00:52:27,558
all I mean we can do a little segue and

1203
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:29,719
talk about like troubleshooting cuz I

1204
00:52:27,559 --> 00:52:33,400
think that as a as a kind of process as

1205
00:52:29,719 --> 00:52:34,480
well cuz I think that sort of to me it's

1206
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:37,000
kind of interesting as someone who's

1207
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,240
still pretty new like if you see

1208
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,079
something going wrong you know where

1209
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:42,000
does your brain first go and what are

1210
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:45,640
the kind of like successive stages like

1211
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:47,679
like Ern said for me initially I always

1212
00:52:45,639 --> 00:52:49,000
did assume it was watering because for

1213
00:52:47,679 --> 00:52:50,759
whatever reason for the first couple of

1214
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,440
years it was that was a hard thing to

1215
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:54,920
figure out or I don't know why like the

1216
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:56,679
dry wet cycle thing was just like I

1217
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:59,760
don't know why it was still confusing to

1218
00:52:56,679 --> 00:53:03,558
me but I'm kind of curious to know

1219
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:07,920
whether y'all have like any kind

1220
00:53:03,559 --> 00:53:10,440
ofh I don't know any kind of sequence um

1221
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:12,079
of of parameters to look through when

1222
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:14,400
you're troubleshooting a

1223
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:16,480
problem maybe start with local Local's

1224
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,880
been real quiet has he passed out yeah I

1225
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,960
don't I don't even know what additives

1226
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:24,519
Local's using and I want to know that

1227
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:26,119
too um yeah so um I guess in terms of

1228
00:53:24,519 --> 00:53:29,920
additives the way I kind of see

1229
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:33,838
additives is um if all your Essentials

1230
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:37,559
are in check then like additives are

1231
00:53:33,838 --> 00:53:40,719
really cool but it's like

1232
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:43,559
sometimes it it might be best to adjust

1233
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:46,358
your main feed and then consider

1234
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:48,599
additives after the fact and I think ER

1235
00:53:46,358 --> 00:53:49,880
was kind of mentioning that in his uh

1236
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:54,240
working with

1237
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:59,200
Cana um you know but I think that's kind

1238
00:53:54,239 --> 00:54:02,759
of the way I see additives is using them

1239
00:53:59,199 --> 00:54:05,639
um have you seen any uh any real

1240
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:08,440
benefits from any particular additive

1241
00:54:05,639 --> 00:54:12,679
local um I guess it depends what you're

1242
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:16,280
trying like to achieve like if it's an

1243
00:54:12,679 --> 00:54:18,279
actual like deficiency maybe like or

1244
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:19,720
maybe you want to add a little more

1245
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:23,440
extra

1246
00:54:19,719 --> 00:54:27,279
like I don't know calcium like I don't

1247
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:29,480
know uh pcal is pretty nice I like that

1248
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:31,680
that's helped me a lot I don't use it

1249
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:33,000
every watering maybe like once every

1250
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:35,919
other week or

1251
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:39,400
something um but can you tell us a b

1252
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:42,920
more about that one yeah

1253
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:47,920
um uh calcium phosphate I think is like

1254
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:52,639
the is the the chemical um nomenclature

1255
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:54,838
if you will um but it's uh has a good

1256
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:55,719
amount of calcium and a good amount of

1257
00:54:54,838 --> 00:54:59,078
uh

1258
00:54:55,719 --> 00:55:02,798
phosphorus um it's it's it's a nice

1259
00:54:59,079 --> 00:55:05,119
additive for like flour um yeah I really

1260
00:55:02,798 --> 00:55:08,318
like it as well I don't like lack

1261
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:11,519
calcium by any means but like it doesn't

1262
00:55:08,318 --> 00:55:15,000
hurt to add a little extra um I also

1263
00:55:11,519 --> 00:55:17,920
find that under LEDs your plants will

1264
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:20,358
definitely benefit from calcium you know

1265
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:22,639
or other additives just CU yeah they're

1266
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:26,639
metabolizing you know maybe a little

1267
00:55:22,639 --> 00:55:28,558
faster or whatever um

1268
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:30,719
but yeah that's kind of my take on

1269
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:33,280
additives have you played with anything

1270
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:36,000
else that's been interesting you know um

1271
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:41,160
no not really

1272
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:44,838
um I really all I use is a Cana AB maybe

1273
00:55:41,159 --> 00:55:48,279
some like some of their PK

1274
00:55:44,838 --> 00:55:50,599
but I really don't ever use it I kind of

1275
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:54,440
just add like a little bit of pecal

1276
00:55:50,599 --> 00:55:57,039
every you know two weeks and then um

1277
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:59,159
sometimes I'll do one of the nectar of

1278
00:55:57,039 --> 00:56:04,039
the Gods bottles but like that's just

1279
00:55:59,159 --> 00:56:07,558
like um sugars really for the bacteria

1280
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:09,880
that I inoculate my Coco with I know it

1281
00:56:07,559 --> 00:56:12,359
sounds kind of intuitive but like it

1282
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:14,920
still it still does something I assume

1283
00:56:12,358 --> 00:56:20,038
right you know you're establishing a

1284
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:22,400
beneficial relationship um my EC isn't

1285
00:56:20,039 --> 00:56:24,480
too extreme you know it's it's nothing

1286
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:28,200
exaggerated you know I mean I still use

1287
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:30,159
m all through my growth I use M when I'm

1288
00:56:28,199 --> 00:56:32,239
transplanting and all that stuff I put

1289
00:56:30,159 --> 00:56:35,000
it directly on you

1290
00:56:32,239 --> 00:56:38,639
know do you guys notice a difference

1291
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:41,079
from not using it to when you do use it

1292
00:56:38,639 --> 00:56:42,838
I do yeah I do kind of like I like to

1293
00:56:41,079 --> 00:56:45,000
use it like uh especially like at

1294
00:56:42,838 --> 00:56:48,159
transplant with my clones I'll inoculate

1295
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:50,639
The Roots then and

1296
00:56:48,159 --> 00:56:53,960
um I don't know man like it could just

1297
00:56:50,639 --> 00:56:56,239
be like it's like evaluating The Roots

1298
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:59,960
is like hard sometimes right if they're

1299
00:56:56,239 --> 00:57:02,358
like all looking pretty healthy so like

1300
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:06,920
but it it does seem like they form just

1301
00:57:02,358 --> 00:57:09,400
like more thicker Roots you know um I

1302
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:11,200
don't know I think it just helped like

1303
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:13,639
my kind of thing that I'm thinking about

1304
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:14,960
is like if there's waste material in the

1305
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:17,078
soil and stuff like that and the

1306
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:18,440
bacteria are just like kind of like have

1307
00:57:17,079 --> 00:57:20,280
like they're able to help with that I

1308
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:23,000
don't know I'm growing in small pots as

1309
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:27,000
well like local so

1310
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:29,719
um yeah anything I can get to help is

1311
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,119
good I I do want to say for the record

1312
00:57:29,719 --> 00:57:33,439
that there are a number of things I use

1313
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:35,838
that I've never systematically verified

1314
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:39,519
as like being beneficial but I still use

1315
00:57:35,838 --> 00:57:42,440
every every run so yeah use like 17

1316
00:57:39,519 --> 00:57:43,960
bottles of advanced nutrients yeah yeah

1317
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:45,920
and you didn't necessarily know what

1318
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:48,280
what they were all doing right yeah no

1319
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:51,599
[ __ ] clue and the two-part formulas

1320
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:53,640
are 10 times better yeah yeah I mean

1321
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:55,400
that was the thing that I I think like

1322
00:57:53,639 --> 00:57:58,078
additives that have like I've really

1323
00:57:55,400 --> 00:58:00,680
noticed Alpha this so what I did was

1324
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:03,599
when I switched to Cana um I switched

1325
00:58:00,679 --> 00:58:06,038
over to Coco and all I grew with was

1326
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:08,079
Cana A and B there were no no other

1327
00:58:06,039 --> 00:58:13,039
additives nothing for the entire from

1328
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:14,920
start to finish um and then I um added

1329
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:19,960
back in the calcium phosphate that

1330
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:23,159
Local's talking about um and I noticed

1331
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:25,199
like the transition like from like when

1332
00:58:23,159 --> 00:58:27,960
they start to stretch when they like

1333
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:31,399
start to slow down on stretching into

1334
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:33,240
flower I was um I don't know they just

1335
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:36,200
look a lot healthier around that time

1336
00:58:33,239 --> 00:58:38,798
period for me um and like the whole

1337
00:58:36,199 --> 00:58:42,598
stretching period using the calcium

1338
00:58:38,798 --> 00:58:45,280
phosph uh the calcium phosphate um seems

1339
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:47,200
the plants just look healthier

1340
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:49,359
comparatively local is there a

1341
00:58:47,199 --> 00:58:50,639
particular brand of calcium phosphate

1342
00:58:49,358 --> 00:58:53,279
that you

1343
00:58:50,639 --> 00:58:55,558
use

1344
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:57,119
um [ __ ]

1345
00:58:55,559 --> 00:58:59,960
not

1346
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:02,798
really um just I guess any that you can

1347
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:04,679
find at your like Garden Center um I'm

1348
00:59:02,798 --> 00:59:06,960
not a I'm not a build-a soil guy but

1349
00:59:04,679 --> 00:59:09,239
build-a soil sells calcium phosphate

1350
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:11,920
really cheap you can get a 25 pound bag

1351
00:59:09,239 --> 00:59:16,118
for like 20 bucks and it's like a

1352
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:18,480
teaspoon per gallon so it lasts forever

1353
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:20,798
and like the thing is is like it has to

1354
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:23,240
be watered in solution if that makes

1355
00:59:20,798 --> 00:59:26,798
sense so like the particulate has to

1356
00:59:23,239 --> 00:59:29,358
be in the solution yeah so you have to

1357
00:59:26,798 --> 00:59:31,960
use like um saponin or some kind of

1358
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:33,440
other surf like something to hold the

1359
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:36,199
calcium in

1360
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:38,960
solution like the actual rock

1361
00:59:36,199 --> 00:59:41,358
particles because it's rock phosphate it

1362
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:45,798
like it's derived from rocks it it

1363
00:59:41,358 --> 00:59:49,239
doesn't dissolve uh no it doesn't sadly

1364
00:59:45,798 --> 00:59:52,038
interes so I use I use the sap the sa

1365
00:59:49,239 --> 00:59:54,479
like sapin in from I get it from Crybaby

1366
00:59:52,039 --> 00:59:58,680
um and just mix it with it and it it's

1367
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:58,679
like a it holds it in suspension pretty

1368
00:59:59,039 --> 01:00:04,200
well nice I also alternatively have top

1369
01:00:02,318 --> 01:00:08,000
dressed with it before and just watered

1370
01:00:04,199 --> 01:00:10,078
it in so I've used it before like at

1371
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,639
transplant like I put it in my root Zone

1372
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:15,680
as well just like throw a little

1373
01:00:11,639 --> 01:00:18,480
teaspoon you know sprinkle some um that

1374
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:20,838
helps them adjust as

1375
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:24,400
well interesting

1376
01:00:20,838 --> 01:00:28,480
okay all right well anything else on any

1377
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:30,599
other like notable or interesting

1378
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:34,440
additives I think they're completely

1379
01:00:30,599 --> 01:00:40,640
unnecessary but that's just power SI and

1380
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:43,639
maybe a fure of calcium or kelp

1381
01:00:40,639 --> 01:00:45,679
like maybe but other than that I think

1382
01:00:43,639 --> 01:00:48,440
the nutrient companies are so on point

1383
01:00:45,679 --> 01:00:50,318
at this point that additives are really

1384
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:52,720
uh they're

1385
01:00:50,318 --> 01:00:55,960
unnecessary you know a lot of them are

1386
01:00:52,719 --> 01:00:58,159
yeah I I love power SI because it helps

1387
01:00:55,960 --> 01:01:02,318
with the stretch so if I

1388
01:00:58,159 --> 01:01:04,318
fure feed uh Power SI every three days

1389
01:01:02,318 --> 01:01:08,318
during the first 20 days of flower my

1390
01:01:04,318 --> 01:01:11,838
plants won't elongate too much and I can

1391
01:01:08,318 --> 01:01:11,838
keep the canopy a little more

1392
01:01:12,039 --> 01:01:17,720
even

1393
01:01:14,039 --> 01:01:20,160
nice okay that's about all I have for

1394
01:01:17,719 --> 01:01:21,639
you there was a moment when Matt left

1395
01:01:20,159 --> 01:01:22,838
and I thought he would you know Matt's

1396
01:01:21,639 --> 01:01:25,719
actually kind of confessed to me in

1397
01:01:22,838 --> 01:01:27,440
private that like growing conversations

1398
01:01:25,719 --> 01:01:28,759
bore him so I thought he was going to do

1399
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:31,280
that like I'm gonna go to the corner

1400
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:34,160
store for some

1401
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:35,960
milk then just not not return but he's

1402
01:01:34,159 --> 01:01:37,798
no I'm still here no what actually

1403
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:41,639
happened is you know I've been using

1404
01:01:37,798 --> 01:01:43,519
this proxy today and it ran out of steam

1405
01:01:41,639 --> 01:01:45,078
already just by starting this episode

1406
01:01:43,519 --> 01:01:48,440
it's already dead of batteries from a

1407
01:01:45,079 --> 01:01:51,680
whole battery so I was pissed I had to

1408
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:54,760
go get the other thing that I used live

1409
01:01:51,679 --> 01:01:56,440
review yeah live review I mean like

1410
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:58,278
really it's already dead I don't smoke

1411
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:02,039
that much I don't think come on

1412
01:01:58,278 --> 01:02:05,798
now I do but come on that

1413
01:02:02,039 --> 01:02:08,319
sucks okay well I did want to move on

1414
01:02:05,798 --> 01:02:10,559
to again I think quite a philosophical

1415
01:02:08,318 --> 01:02:15,000
topic which was troubleshooting I think

1416
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:17,119
ER kind of uh gestured towards it before

1417
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,838
I'm just curious like do you all have

1418
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:22,240
any general thoughts on like your

1419
01:02:18,838 --> 01:02:24,798
troubleshooting process um or advice for

1420
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:26,879
for noobs who are like you know trying

1421
01:02:24,798 --> 01:02:29,880
to figure out what's going on with the

1422
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:29,880
plant

1423
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:36,720
plants I'd say generally the answer if

1424
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:40,838
you're if you're just learning the

1425
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:43,719
answer is generally not going to be more

1426
01:02:40,838 --> 01:02:47,480
fertilizer it's most likely GNA be less

1427
01:02:43,719 --> 01:02:51,159
water Y and less intense

1428
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:53,639
lighting you know um you can't trust

1429
01:02:51,159 --> 01:02:56,679
everything you hear I know the LED

1430
01:02:53,639 --> 01:03:00,278
companies they're constantly pushing you

1431
01:02:56,679 --> 01:03:05,038
know uh these lights at 12 in give you

1432
01:03:00,278 --> 01:03:06,920
1,400 ppfd or whatever that is um you're

1433
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:12,359
really asking for trouble with that [ __ ]

1434
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:14,079
you can get away with six 700 uh par and

1435
01:03:12,358 --> 01:03:16,038
just Watering your plants less and

1436
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:19,318
making sure the environment itself is

1437
01:03:16,039 --> 01:03:20,920
good you know humidity and temperature

1438
01:03:19,318 --> 01:03:22,079
uh they're going to do a lot more for a

1439
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:25,039
beginner

1440
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:27,160
grower than um trying to really blast

1441
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:30,760
your plants you don't have to grow like

1442
01:03:27,159 --> 01:03:32,480
the jungle boys you know like that's you

1443
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:35,119
don't you know those guys they have

1444
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:37,679
perfect facilities you can get away with

1445
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:39,519
just taking it slow and easy and having

1446
01:03:37,679 --> 01:03:42,318
beautiful

1447
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:45,239
plants yeah yeah yeah if I would have if

1448
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:47,838
I could like tell myself like you know

1449
01:03:45,239 --> 01:03:50,278
starting out again like what to do I

1450
01:03:47,838 --> 01:03:53,239
would go straight to like a two-part

1451
01:03:50,278 --> 01:03:55,519
drained away system and I would learn it

1452
01:03:53,239 --> 01:03:58,000
like the back of my hand in and I would

1453
01:03:55,519 --> 01:04:00,719
dial my environment in and I would you

1454
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,400
know it's so it really like like what

1455
01:04:00,719 --> 01:04:05,919
spindle was saying earlier how he was

1456
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:08,559
like well maybe it's not like maybe it's

1457
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:11,318
not the best as like some you know rings

1458
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:13,400
out in mindo with like the best soil in

1459
01:04:11,318 --> 01:04:15,798
the world growing the best weed and you

1460
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:17,838
know all this stuff but it's like maybe

1461
01:04:15,798 --> 01:04:19,880
the ceiling isn't that high but it's

1462
01:04:17,838 --> 01:04:23,960
pretty good I mean it's better than

1463
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:24,720
anything I can get around here um and

1464
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:26,720
that's

1465
01:04:24,719 --> 01:04:28,519
I mean for me that's you know that's the

1466
01:04:26,719 --> 01:04:30,838
goal

1467
01:04:28,519 --> 01:04:32,960
here yeah yeah we're actually getting

1468
01:04:30,838 --> 01:04:34,480
pretty close to like yeah what makes for

1469
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:36,639
a good grow and I'm still like really

1470
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:39,679
excited for that part of the combo but

1471
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:41,159
local thoughts on like troubleshooting

1472
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:43,278
SL you know what advice would you give

1473
01:04:41,159 --> 01:04:46,399
to people

1474
01:04:43,278 --> 01:04:48,519
um I mean how frequently are you

1475
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:51,720
Watering your plants is the

1476
01:04:48,519 --> 01:04:55,440
question um I'll be honest like a

1477
01:04:51,719 --> 01:04:58,118
handful of my problems maybe within the

1478
01:04:55,440 --> 01:05:00,760
last three years if there even

1479
01:04:58,119 --> 01:05:03,160
problems um I guess they are it's just I

1480
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:05,000
acknowledge that me not you know

1481
01:05:03,159 --> 01:05:08,078
watering them one

1482
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:10,159
night um you know gets my plant a little

1483
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:12,119
pissed off

1484
01:05:10,159 --> 01:05:15,719
um

1485
01:05:12,119 --> 01:05:18,000
but God damn it I did that thing where I

1486
01:05:15,719 --> 01:05:20,519
forget what we were just talking about

1487
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:23,760
talking about troubleshooting and like

1488
01:05:20,519 --> 01:05:27,559
general advice with people yeah um I

1489
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:30,278
don't know just you know keep on

1490
01:05:27,559 --> 01:05:33,519
schedule with your watering um like

1491
01:05:30,278 --> 01:05:35,480
spindle said don't overfeed

1492
01:05:33,519 --> 01:05:38,920
um what

1493
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:41,079
else just make sure your environment

1494
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:43,039
isn't too extreme like you don't want it

1495
01:05:41,079 --> 01:05:45,559
to extreme in humidity or you don't want

1496
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:47,278
it to extreme in heat I mean you just

1497
01:05:45,559 --> 01:05:51,359
got to learn how to adjust your

1498
01:05:47,278 --> 01:05:54,278
parameters to get your plant to grow

1499
01:05:51,358 --> 01:05:56,119
ideally I'm not really too I mean I'll

1500
01:05:54,278 --> 01:05:57,599
do it like for the sake of getting my

1501
01:05:56,119 --> 01:06:00,599
plants happy but I'm not going to

1502
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:05,680
monitor and you know have like graphs

1503
01:06:00,599 --> 01:06:08,200
and [ __ ] display my VPD you know um but

1504
01:06:05,679 --> 01:06:11,038
yeah just that kind of

1505
01:06:08,199 --> 01:06:13,239
stuff yeah and I think what you and

1506
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:15,240
spindle both have implied as well is

1507
01:06:13,239 --> 01:06:17,358
sometimes it's not just one parameter in

1508
01:06:15,239 --> 01:06:19,199
isolation that's wrong it's actually

1509
01:06:17,358 --> 01:06:21,679
like an interaction between multiple

1510
01:06:19,199 --> 01:06:24,318
parameters so if you're blasting the

1511
01:06:21,679 --> 01:06:26,480
plant with light and you're not Fe

1512
01:06:24,318 --> 01:06:28,079
enough you know there are two approaches

1513
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:31,960
to that you can up the feed or you can

1514
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:34,880
lower the lights or you can do both um

1515
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:36,480
and they they do all interact right so

1516
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:38,000
this is a complex system and one of the

1517
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:40,838
difficulties with troubleshooting is

1518
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:42,639
that you may see symptoms and assume

1519
01:06:40,838 --> 01:06:44,078
that the symptoms tell you one thing but

1520
01:06:42,639 --> 01:06:46,159
actually these are Downstream

1521
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:49,400
consequences of like something else

1522
01:06:46,159 --> 01:06:52,358
happening further Upstream so to speak

1523
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:55,000
Absolut the other thing I would mention

1524
01:06:52,358 --> 01:06:57,558
in this is also if you're making changes

1525
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:59,719
to not make more than I would say one

1526
01:06:57,559 --> 01:07:01,920
change at a time if ideally if you can

1527
01:06:59,719 --> 01:07:05,078
afford if you can afford not to

1528
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:07,440
gamble um because if you start changing

1529
01:07:05,079 --> 01:07:08,760
multiple variables or parameters at once

1530
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:10,480
you're not really going to know what's

1531
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:12,400
doing what and for me when I was

1532
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:16,358
starting out getting to these like manic

1533
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:17,599
flurries uh trying to fix fix things you

1534
01:07:16,358 --> 01:07:19,558
know I tried to change like two or three

1535
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:22,760
things at a time and then not know what

1536
01:07:19,559 --> 01:07:24,720
was actually working um or not

1537
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:26,559
working yeah

1538
01:07:24,719 --> 01:07:29,480
yeah I think like something that I do

1539
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:31,039
now like in my own practice like for uh

1540
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:32,760
to Tripes shoot the first thing I will

1541
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:35,680
do is like if I see a plant that just

1542
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:38,960
looks bad I'll just water it with just

1543
01:07:35,679 --> 01:07:42,159
nice clean just you know phed water just

1544
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:45,440
like nothing in it and just see how the

1545
01:07:42,159 --> 01:07:47,719
plant responds in that way um I've also

1546
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:50,119
you know before I've like just literally

1547
01:07:47,719 --> 01:07:51,719
watered plants until they will fade I

1548
01:07:50,119 --> 01:07:54,039
just like have taken the nutrients away

1549
01:07:51,719 --> 01:07:56,838
and veg to just see what it does and and

1550
01:07:54,039 --> 01:07:58,720
how long it takes for it to happen um

1551
01:07:56,838 --> 01:08:00,599
and it it doesn't it's not like you're

1552
01:07:58,719 --> 01:08:02,798
if you don't feed your plants one time

1553
01:08:00,599 --> 01:08:04,760
they're not going to die you know what I

1554
01:08:02,798 --> 01:08:08,480
mean like they can make it one time

1555
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:12,000
without it and so um I I just think that

1556
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:14,760
like the propensity for of new Growers

1557
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:17,000
to like overfeed is so it's so easy I

1558
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:19,759
mean even me like I got the nectar for

1559
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:23,079
the gods stuff um to just kind of mess

1560
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:25,439
around with and just going off of like

1561
01:08:23,079 --> 01:08:27,798
what they recommend and had my plants

1562
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:29,198
like super curled up like on nitrogen

1563
01:08:27,798 --> 01:08:30,399
and stuff you know like it just takes

1564
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:33,039
time you got to learn where your

1565
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:35,798
nutrients are and stuff you know I mean

1566
01:08:33,039 --> 01:08:37,719
there's not going to be a substitute uh

1567
01:08:35,798 --> 01:08:39,238
there's not a cure all answer you know

1568
01:08:37,719 --> 01:08:41,640
you got to just kind of go through it

1569
01:08:39,238 --> 01:08:41,639
and learn

1570
01:08:41,838 --> 01:08:48,158
them yeah totally and I think there is

1571
01:08:45,158 --> 01:08:49,559
definitely a culture of more is better

1572
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:54,198
and we're going to we're definitely

1573
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:55,920
going to unpack that um maybe a s just

1574
01:08:54,198 --> 01:08:58,318
to take a break maybe from some of the

1575
01:08:55,920 --> 01:09:01,119
like strategy and tick and philosophy

1576
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:04,480
stuff I didn't want to ask yall what

1577
01:09:01,119 --> 01:09:07,318
your favorite things to run ever have

1578
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:11,519
been just so that we can like yeah have

1579
01:09:07,319 --> 01:09:13,920
a little little shift of tone um maybe

1580
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:15,279
we start with local this time local like

1581
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:18,039
can you tell us what your favorite

1582
01:09:15,279 --> 01:09:20,520
things ever have been to run um my

1583
01:09:18,039 --> 01:09:23,359
favorite thing ever uh that's a pretty

1584
01:09:20,520 --> 01:09:26,880
obvious one I would say as of now uh

1585
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:30,279
it's a sweet PE two two or three yeah

1586
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:33,920
sweet PE y yeah totally um that one I've

1587
01:09:30,279 --> 01:09:36,560
had for like three years now I popped it

1588
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:38,239
from seed I mean it's really tell a bit

1589
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:41,120
more about it like it's lineage and

1590
01:09:38,238 --> 01:09:47,000
stuff yes

1591
01:09:41,119 --> 01:09:50,719
please um so yeah uh Bittersweet uh SD

1592
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:55,399
um one of our homies made that using um

1593
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:58,640
two p91 S1 selections from um packs that

1594
01:09:55,399 --> 01:10:00,439
he got from Matt um and as a result of

1595
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:04,039
those two parents

1596
01:10:00,439 --> 01:10:06,678
Crossing he made the sweet pee um and

1597
01:10:04,039 --> 01:10:07,880
yeah it's a really fun cross I saw some

1598
01:10:06,679 --> 01:10:12,039
really cool

1599
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:16,840
things um really potent nice smells nice

1600
01:10:12,039 --> 01:10:18,840
taste nice bag appe peal I mean like it

1601
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:21,119
kind of checks all the boxes like I know

1602
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:22,440
everybody says that but like man this

1603
01:10:21,119 --> 01:10:24,359
this stuff

1604
01:10:22,439 --> 01:10:27,238
is like

1605
01:10:24,359 --> 01:10:30,920
I kind of wish the p91 got a little more

1606
01:10:27,238 --> 01:10:32,839
hype than it has now um you know just

1607
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:37,039
simply based off of the stuff that I've

1608
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:37,039
seen from the crosses it's it's put

1609
01:10:38,479 --> 01:10:43,439
out

1610
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:46,199
cool uh

1611
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:50,519
Michael you know instead of instead of

1612
01:10:46,198 --> 01:10:52,960
me saying uh particular plan um can I go

1613
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:57,360
off like my favorite run that I've ever

1614
01:10:52,960 --> 01:11:01,640
had yeah hell yeah okay so uh when I

1615
01:10:57,359 --> 01:11:06,238
first got the Bubba cush in

1616
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:08,960
2001 I set up a room uh to do EB and

1617
01:11:06,238 --> 01:11:10,519
flow and I'd never tried it before but I

1618
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:12,239
thought you know I've I've read enough

1619
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:14,560
about this I've got a bathroom right

1620
01:11:12,238 --> 01:11:17,238
next to this bedroom and I'm gonna go

1621
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:19,199
for it um I had very little

1622
01:11:17,238 --> 01:11:22,718
understanding about you know how many

1623
01:11:19,198 --> 01:11:24,119
times to water and things like that well

1624
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:25,920
uh I was growing

1625
01:11:24,119 --> 01:11:29,039
in

1626
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:31,640
hydron and I

1627
01:11:29,039 --> 01:11:34,319
misunderstood the watering schedule for

1628
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:36,719
EB and flows so what I was doing was I

1629
01:11:34,319 --> 01:11:38,000
was just flooding the table one time

1630
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:42,158
every 12

1631
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:45,800
hours and uh the strange thing about

1632
01:11:42,158 --> 01:11:49,719
this is that by underwatering that Bubba

1633
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:53,239
cush I was able to get that thing so big

1634
01:11:49,719 --> 01:11:55,079
that it grew next to the ogs the same

1635
01:11:53,238 --> 01:11:58,039
height

1636
01:11:55,079 --> 01:11:59,600
and I think that extra stress just

1637
01:11:58,039 --> 01:12:03,039
really brought something out of the

1638
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:04,639
Bubba cush um on top of that I I at some

1639
01:12:03,039 --> 01:12:06,399
point I started getting fungus snats in

1640
01:12:04,639 --> 01:12:09,880
one of the tables and I had bought in

1641
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:12,439
this stuff called naturol and uh midf

1642
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:15,119
flour I think I was using probably twice

1643
01:12:12,439 --> 01:12:16,960
as much as I was supposed to be so the

1644
01:12:15,119 --> 01:12:19,559
reservoir when it would pump in would

1645
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:22,960
almost look like a melted chocolate

1646
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:27,400
milkshake and just smelled God awful but

1647
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:31,480
for some reason that batch of Bubba Kush

1648
01:12:27,399 --> 01:12:34,879
came out with just beautiful huge nugs

1649
01:12:31,479 --> 01:12:37,559
it actually out yielded and outsized the

1650
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:41,079
OG Kush that was in the other table and

1651
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:46,000
it had the most beautiful lime flavor to

1652
01:12:41,079 --> 01:12:47,319
it beautiful neon green color and uh I

1653
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,679
would say it was one of my most

1654
01:12:47,319 --> 01:12:53,079
uneducated and probably it potentially

1655
01:12:50,679 --> 01:12:55,319
could have been my worst run ever but

1656
01:12:53,079 --> 01:12:58,600
the Stars aligned and it just turned out

1657
01:12:55,319 --> 01:13:01,119
to be like my most fantastic favorite

1658
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:03,880
run of

1659
01:13:01,119 --> 01:13:06,119
kush so were there like lasting lessons

1660
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:08,279
from that for

1661
01:13:06,119 --> 01:13:10,639
you you know not really this is just

1662
01:13:08,279 --> 01:13:12,479
like a weird oneoff yeah because the OG

1663
01:13:10,639 --> 01:13:15,119
came out pretty shitty on the next side

1664
01:13:12,479 --> 01:13:17,839
of the room so I knew it couldn't handle

1665
01:13:15,119 --> 01:13:20,079
that kind of dryback but I learned with

1666
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:23,079
the Bubba if I really wanted that thing

1667
01:13:20,079 --> 01:13:26,238
to move and move fast and not take three

1668
01:13:23,079 --> 01:13:31,000
months to veg I needed to really put

1669
01:13:26,238 --> 01:13:35,079
some some some dry stress into that plan

1670
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:35,079
and it just made it into something

1671
01:13:35,399 --> 01:13:40,158
magical yeah it definitely is a

1672
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:42,800
fascinating topic like the different

1673
01:13:40,158 --> 01:13:47,079
individual plants and the different uh

1674
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:50,440
Tendencies and needs right 100% anything

1675
01:13:47,079 --> 01:13:53,880
that I put in the table with uh like the

1676
01:13:50,439 --> 01:13:56,919
super short Afghans um like Bubba or

1677
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:59,920
let's say U Matt's berries like the riot

1678
01:13:56,920 --> 01:14:03,920
Berry um it's really hard not to

1679
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:05,600
overwater them next to my other uh more

1680
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:08,359
OG leaning

1681
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:10,639
hybrids you know so you really have to

1682
01:14:08,359 --> 01:14:13,158
pick out what's going to be running on

1683
01:14:10,639 --> 01:14:15,560
that Reservoir if they're all getting

1684
01:14:13,158 --> 01:14:18,158
the same feed at the same

1685
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:20,960
times so definitely yeah that was

1686
01:14:18,158 --> 01:14:25,599
definitely a huge lesson yeah it's a big

1687
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:29,480
learning curve yep going to full Afghans

1688
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:31,520
yep that's cool man thank you uh Erin

1689
01:14:29,479 --> 01:14:35,919
favorite plants or

1690
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:38,239
runs yeah I mean um kind of like the two

1691
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:41,158
plants that I've kept the longest now at

1692
01:14:38,238 --> 01:14:43,959
this point have been the LA Times

1693
01:14:41,158 --> 01:14:47,679
bubblegum uh and then I have a Bard

1694
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:49,920
again from Crybaby that I've kept um

1695
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:51,199
it's born again is the first time that I

1696
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:54,840
ever had

1697
01:14:51,198 --> 01:14:58,519
terpinolene so born again a jel cross

1698
01:14:54,840 --> 01:15:03,079
what born again is um it's the white

1699
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:06,440
Lodge cut of Clockwork Orange to the

1700
01:15:03,079 --> 01:15:10,519
cheese sour lemon

1701
01:15:06,439 --> 01:15:12,479
thae um yeah and it's like a it's kind

1702
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:14,320
of I think it's like a little bit of a

1703
01:15:12,479 --> 01:15:15,718
like in talking to cry BBE it was like

1704
01:15:14,319 --> 01:15:18,319
supposed to be like a little bit of a

1705
01:15:15,719 --> 01:15:20,439
joke because it's like a little Haz like

1706
01:15:18,319 --> 01:15:23,840
uh like the way it grows and stuff you

1707
01:15:20,439 --> 01:15:25,879
know um and anyways it does it's a super

1708
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:28,840
vigorous plant the first time I ran it

1709
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:30,880
it was uh well I flew to New York for

1710
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:32,760
the weekend and came back and it was

1711
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:34,800
like touching my light and like some of

1712
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:38,760
it was like above my light you know just

1713
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:41,199
like very very very vigorous plant um

1714
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:43,760
but yeah first terpinolene for me which

1715
01:15:41,198 --> 01:15:45,799
was like I mean dude like I love

1716
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:47,760
terpinolene now you know so like that's

1717
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:51,520
like a really cool I really like that

1718
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:53,880
smell and stuff you know and then the LA

1719
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:56,199
syate what's up

1720
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:58,560
terpinolene Syndicate oh yeah yeah

1721
01:15:56,198 --> 01:16:01,919
terpinolene is great it see so far it

1722
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:03,880
seems like it makes everything better uh

1723
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:07,600
I don't know but then I the LA Times

1724
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:09,600
bubble gum that I have is um pretty racy

1725
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:11,679
and just like a short finishing plant

1726
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:14,840
and it was like the first plant from

1727
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:18,000
like a legit breeder that I grew like

1728
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:19,800
CSI you know what I mean CSI is like

1729
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,560
yeah he would like there was like runs

1730
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:24,279
where I just ran seeds of stuff that I

1731
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:25,800
didn't care about because I was scared

1732
01:16:24,279 --> 01:16:28,439
I'd kill

1733
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:30,600
them so that was the first run that I

1734
01:16:28,439 --> 01:16:33,599
popped that was like I'm not going to

1735
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:33,600
kill these plants for

1736
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:41,600
sure oh dear yeah yeah I mean has anyone

1737
01:16:39,719 --> 01:16:42,800
here actually ever come close to oh

1738
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:44,719
sorry you may have already mentioned

1739
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:46,560
some of this like what's the worst state

1740
01:16:44,719 --> 01:16:50,659
your plants have ever been

1741
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:51,840
in yeah I've killed a crop yeah

1742
01:16:50,659 --> 01:16:53,800
[Music]

1743
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:56,639
yeah I mean

1744
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:58,920
how bad you want to get bro like I

1745
01:16:56,639 --> 01:17:01,840
remember when I had first learned about

1746
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:04,760
micronized sulfur and spraying wable

1747
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:06,920
sulfur um someone else is giving me like

1748
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:08,880
totally different ideas on how to treat

1749
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:12,279
pm at the time they're like no no no no

1750
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:14,880
no no you need to use Nukem not so need

1751
01:17:12,279 --> 01:17:16,198
to use Nukem and I was like everybody

1752
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:17,880
else is saying to use this I was like

1753
01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:20,479
screw it I'll just mix them and use it

1754
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:23,480
and when you mix oils and sulfur what

1755
01:17:20,479 --> 01:17:26,879
happens is it just melts your God damn

1756
01:17:23,479 --> 01:17:29,759
plants just absolutely totaled my whole

1757
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:31,679
flower run just the second I did it and

1758
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:33,880
I was like oh man but after that I

1759
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:35,440
learned that like I should have already

1760
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:37,840
known that and I was an idiot for doing

1761
01:17:35,439 --> 01:17:39,759
it but I never burned sulfur I never had

1762
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:41,079
to deal with any of it or deal with PM

1763
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:43,119
like that before so it was a new

1764
01:17:41,079 --> 01:17:44,679
experience and uh I learned to stick

1765
01:17:43,119 --> 01:17:47,800
with micronite sufur because it's

1766
01:17:44,679 --> 01:17:49,679
effective enough especially in veg um

1767
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:51,920
not in flower obviously yeah that's

1768
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:57,000
definitely one time of the many I've

1769
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:57,000
watched my plants go down like within

1770
01:17:58,319 --> 01:18:04,279
hours I've never

1771
01:18:01,399 --> 01:18:07,158
used it's a great for PM dude it was a

1772
01:18:04,279 --> 01:18:10,000
game changer going from having to use

1773
01:18:07,158 --> 01:18:12,238
like harsh harsh chemicals the few times

1774
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,920
that that I had had it like in San Diego

1775
01:18:12,238 --> 01:18:17,079
and everybody would just you know they'd

1776
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:18,719
blast to the hard chems and um that

1777
01:18:17,079 --> 01:18:20,800
stuff like you even being around it and

1778
01:18:18,719 --> 01:18:22,079
smelling it you know that that's not

1779
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:23,480
going to do you any good I'm not even

1780
01:18:22,079 --> 01:18:25,319
going to say the brand name any of that

1781
01:18:23,479 --> 01:18:28,439
want to get sued they like yeah that

1782
01:18:25,319 --> 01:18:31,039
shit's probably cancerous and crazy so

1783
01:18:28,439 --> 01:18:32,719
um knowing that there are other options

1784
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:34,319
that are safe and I mean when people

1785
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:36,319
think of sulfur if you've only burned

1786
01:18:34,319 --> 01:18:38,599
sulfur and this was a big reason I

1787
01:18:36,319 --> 01:18:40,000
didn't want to use it in the first place

1788
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:41,960
is because you think oh my God it's G to

1789
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,119
smell like rotten eggs indoor I don't

1790
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:45,920
like this is an indoor indoor where I

1791
01:18:44,119 --> 01:18:47,639
live like maybe I don't want it to smell

1792
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:49,480
like that but it smells like wet beach

1793
01:18:47,639 --> 01:18:50,880
sand when you spray it so it's a really

1794
01:18:49,479 --> 01:18:54,000
pleasant smell to me and the plants

1795
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:56,239
actually like it a lot um quite a b bit

1796
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:59,319
does the does the PM usually come in off

1797
01:18:56,238 --> 01:19:01,678
of The Cutting that you you bring into

1798
01:18:59,319 --> 01:19:03,799
your room um it can come off cuting

1799
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:05,000
depending on where you live PM can be

1800
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:06,440
like if you have a whole bunch of plants

1801
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,679
around you and it's just thriving in

1802
01:19:06,439 --> 01:19:10,839
your area come in on your clothes it's

1803
01:19:08,679 --> 01:19:13,440
why I like to be naked um in everyone's

1804
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:14,960
grow room that I go into I just I don't

1805
01:19:13,439 --> 01:19:16,399
care whose it is I just like to be naked

1806
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:18,359
and they better understand because I'm

1807
01:19:16,399 --> 01:19:20,599
just trying not to pollute Gardens is

1808
01:19:18,359 --> 01:19:20,599
what I'm

1809
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:25,880
doing

1810
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:27,319
but no it's yeah it's like typically

1811
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:28,719
people when they bring in clones or

1812
01:19:27,319 --> 01:19:30,719
trade clones you're going to run it to

1813
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:32,880
PM because it's in a lot of people's

1814
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:35,319
rooms if you're in a room that's never

1815
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:37,199
had it like you don't have your IPM

1816
01:19:35,319 --> 01:19:39,000
running for it you're GNA run into it if

1817
01:19:37,198 --> 01:19:40,519
you're trading clones for sure but a lot

1818
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,520
of times yeah it can come in on clothes

1819
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:44,239
it can come in on your deck anywhere I

1820
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:47,000
think is a good

1821
01:19:44,238 --> 01:19:51,839
Vector so sometimes nudity doesn't work

1822
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:54,760
we try it's a short Vector a very short

1823
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:56,440
bth

1824
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:58,639
um what we even talking I can't remember

1825
01:19:56,439 --> 01:20:00,519
what I even asked I don't know it always

1826
01:19:58,639 --> 01:20:03,199
goes back to the like

1827
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:05,120
how how talking about favorite plants

1828
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:06,519
and stuff right yeah talking about

1829
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:08,800
favorite plants and I think I got

1830
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:11,800
distracted by talking about like how

1831
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:15,000
messed up have your PL like how

1832
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:18,840
devastated you know have have

1833
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:21,039
um I can't even talk right now yeah I

1834
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:23,520
mean I've I've wasted a bunch of plants

1835
01:20:21,039 --> 01:20:25,639
I will say I mean like like I wanted to

1836
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:28,480
learn about like I wanted to try making

1837
01:20:25,639 --> 01:20:31,920
rosin you know like hash and stuff which

1838
01:20:28,479 --> 01:20:34,238
I have done successfully but when I

1839
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:36,920
first tried it I did not you know wasted

1840
01:20:34,238 --> 01:20:39,079
tons of plants you know just not tons

1841
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:40,840
but I wasted plants you know trying to

1842
01:20:39,079 --> 01:20:45,639
do that stuff you know just it's all a

1843
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:47,760
learning process it's just like you you

1844
01:20:45,639 --> 01:20:49,520
unfortunately with Canabis like you read

1845
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:52,360
about stuff and there is a ton of good

1846
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:56,040
information but it's also mixed in with

1847
01:20:52,359 --> 01:20:58,319
like tons of Bro Science from the last

1848
01:20:56,039 --> 01:21:01,560
30 years that you have to sip through

1849
01:20:58,319 --> 01:21:03,079
and decide if it's legit or not you

1850
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:05,560
know

1851
01:21:03,079 --> 01:21:08,158
yeah I mean that might be a good segue

1852
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:09,920
into the kind of what I think is like

1853
01:21:08,158 --> 01:21:12,359
the tail end of this combo but I think

1854
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:13,600
quite a also quite a big Topic in of

1855
01:21:12,359 --> 01:21:17,960
itself which

1856
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:20,960
is you know what do you all think a good

1857
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:23,399
grow you know means like what what is

1858
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:24,920
good you know what are the because like

1859
01:21:23,399 --> 01:21:26,439
like some of you have mentioned already

1860
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:28,960
like there are some myths that float

1861
01:21:26,439 --> 01:21:32,479
around you know it's about yield it's

1862
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:34,198
about this or that um you know it's

1863
01:21:32,479 --> 01:21:36,000
about pumping them with nutrients it's

1864
01:21:34,198 --> 01:21:38,678
about pumping them with light you know

1865
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:40,719
those things what are your thoughts on

1866
01:21:38,679 --> 01:21:43,719
some of these myths you know any pet

1867
01:21:40,719 --> 01:21:45,719
peeves like for me for example I got

1868
01:21:43,719 --> 01:21:48,840
really hung up on the idea that plant

1869
01:21:45,719 --> 01:21:52,000
should be given 1,000 ppfd for example

1870
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:53,800
for flowering like it was a rule and I

1871
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:57,520
insisted on it for a couple of runs and

1872
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:59,279
it was actually just [ __ ] me up um

1873
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:01,440
and I had to take a step back and be

1874
01:21:59,279 --> 01:22:03,238
like why are you doing this like why are

1875
01:22:01,439 --> 01:22:05,198
you just sticking to this weird number

1876
01:22:03,238 --> 01:22:07,799
that you know someone pulled out of a

1877
01:22:05,198 --> 01:22:11,759
hat seemingly

1878
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:14,039
yeah I mean you could pick any any myth

1879
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:17,199
in cannabis you know like to start with

1880
01:22:14,039 --> 01:22:21,039
here um how people germinate seeds you

1881
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:23,559
know is wild um yeah I always found it

1882
01:22:21,039 --> 01:22:25,079
to be best to stay as CLE as possible

1883
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:27,760
but other people have different opinions

1884
01:22:25,079 --> 01:22:29,479
on that you know that's probably one of

1885
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:31,639
my biggest pet peeves though is like I

1886
01:22:29,479 --> 01:22:34,158
like people to be as cly as possible and

1887
01:22:31,639 --> 01:22:37,840
not introduce War bacteria to whe may be

1888
01:22:34,158 --> 01:22:42,238
popping seeds and um yeah yeah that's

1889
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:45,279
probably my only major one I'm not too

1890
01:22:42,238 --> 01:22:48,079
picky anyone else like you know what

1891
01:22:45,279 --> 01:22:49,479
what has anyone kind of like absorbed

1892
01:22:48,079 --> 01:22:51,559
something and then kind of regretted

1893
01:22:49,479 --> 01:22:53,879
that you

1894
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:55,960
know

1895
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:58,079
I mean I did the same kind of stuff like

1896
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:59,719
with lighting as well you know I mean

1897
01:22:58,079 --> 01:23:01,359
there was like

1898
01:22:59,719 --> 01:23:05,439
growing

1899
01:23:01,359 --> 01:23:07,759
um you know it just takes time to like

1900
01:23:05,439 --> 01:23:09,759
like all of it is just like you get this

1901
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:12,360
light that's like the first time you

1902
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:14,039
ever get an LED grow light it's insane

1903
01:23:12,359 --> 01:23:15,719
you know what I mean it's like you have

1904
01:23:14,039 --> 01:23:18,439
the sun in your

1905
01:23:15,719 --> 01:23:20,760
basement like like it is so [ __ ]

1906
01:23:18,439 --> 01:23:22,238
bright you know and it's like um I know

1907
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:24,199
like the first when I first started

1908
01:23:22,238 --> 01:23:27,079
growing um like I had this clone in

1909
01:23:24,198 --> 01:23:30,039
there and like I didn't I had my light

1910
01:23:27,079 --> 01:23:31,880
turned down all the way uh but I didn't

1911
01:23:30,039 --> 01:23:34,719
realize it I thought I had it turned up

1912
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:37,159
to a good level and so for like like a

1913
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:39,359
month this clone just basically sat in

1914
01:23:37,158 --> 01:23:41,879
like stasis like didn't do anything

1915
01:23:39,359 --> 01:23:44,639
really you know and then I'm like what

1916
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:46,440
is [ __ ] going on right now and then I

1917
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:48,440
just like look at my stuff and it's like

1918
01:23:46,439 --> 01:23:50,359
oh you're an idiot you know but like

1919
01:23:48,439 --> 01:23:52,439
it's really easy to just Overlook one

1920
01:23:50,359 --> 01:23:54,519
little thing like that and like then you

1921
01:23:52,439 --> 01:23:57,039
kind of beat yourself up about it but

1922
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:58,679
like you that's the only way you're

1923
01:23:57,039 --> 01:24:01,600
going to learn those things for me you

1924
01:23:58,679 --> 01:24:04,239
know like it's to [ __ ] up I've still

1925
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:07,280
never even seen LED I mean like not in

1926
01:24:04,238 --> 01:24:08,638
my own room LED lights over PL I don't

1927
01:24:07,279 --> 01:24:10,479
even know what that looks like to be

1928
01:24:08,639 --> 01:24:12,960
honest

1929
01:24:10,479 --> 01:24:17,238
yeah you know I think one of one of the

1930
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:18,719
general myths that I've seen that's like

1931
01:24:17,238 --> 01:24:20,959
been going on for the last couple years

1932
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:23,840
is kind of the whole um and it's kind of

1933
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:30,000
a joke now too but the whole Athena

1934
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:33,560
jungle boy feed3 3.5 EC deal um which I

1935
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:36,800
think what a lot of people don't

1936
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:41,800
understand is that if you're not running

1937
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:46,840
LED super hot rooms like between 85 to

1938
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:49,199
90 degrees pushing CO2 and uh super high

1939
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:51,719
humidity so the plants you know not

1940
01:24:49,198 --> 01:24:54,118
drinking a lot of water then in in those

1941
01:24:51,719 --> 01:24:55,719
perfect condition i s they get away with

1942
01:24:54,118 --> 01:25:00,000
those super heavy

1943
01:24:55,719 --> 01:25:02,279
feedings um but for a homeg grower when

1944
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,880
when the room's a little bit cool cooler

1945
01:25:02,279 --> 01:25:07,198
like let's say you run 80 and your

1946
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:10,679
humidity maybe is closer to

1947
01:25:07,198 --> 01:25:13,559
60 um if your plant starts drinking

1948
01:25:10,679 --> 01:25:15,520
super fast that way because having the

1949
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:19,239
humidity lower and the temperature

1950
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:20,639
higher makes the plant drink more um

1951
01:25:19,238 --> 01:25:23,000
you'll burn your

1952
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:25,159
plant you know

1953
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:27,319
so I I think that's that's like one of

1954
01:25:25,158 --> 01:25:29,799
those myths that a lot of people you

1955
01:25:27,319 --> 01:25:31,960
know and myself included I didn't

1956
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:33,760
understand why I was doing it originally

1957
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:36,158
and now that I understand how the plant

1958
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:38,119
uptakes nutrients and things like that I

1959
01:25:36,158 --> 01:25:41,439
realize okay I can push my plant another

1960
01:25:38,118 --> 01:25:43,679
way and feed it much less a lower amount

1961
01:25:41,439 --> 01:25:43,678
per

1962
01:25:44,238 --> 01:25:49,919
feeding and still get the results I want

1963
01:25:47,960 --> 01:25:51,760
yeah well and I also think that just in

1964
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:53,679
general like what just to add on what

1965
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:58,520
spindle was saying is that

1966
01:25:53,679 --> 01:25:59,880
like it like there it being able to feed

1967
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:02,480
3 and a half

1968
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:05,199
VC isn't the goal that you're working

1969
01:26:02,479 --> 01:26:07,158
for you know what I mean like even if

1970
01:26:05,198 --> 01:26:10,158
you do have those perfect conditions and

1971
01:26:07,158 --> 01:26:12,079
you're able to feed at 3 AC that doesn't

1972
01:26:10,158 --> 01:26:15,198
mean that you have good weed I mean

1973
01:26:12,079 --> 01:26:17,679
we've everyone now has smoked jungle

1974
01:26:15,198 --> 01:26:22,399
boys and cookies packs and like knows

1975
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:24,239
what it is I mean it's right like it's

1976
01:26:22,399 --> 01:26:26,719
not like people aren't like going crazy

1977
01:26:24,238 --> 01:26:29,919
over that weed right I mean like I I

1978
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:32,960
don't I don't have any rooms that run

1979
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:35,840
that way I don't have any tents that can

1980
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:37,800
have those opt optimal conditions so I

1981
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:40,480
don't know what their plants necessarily

1982
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:42,199
need you know like maybe in those

1983
01:26:40,479 --> 01:26:45,039
conditions that's what some of their

1984
01:26:42,198 --> 01:26:48,599
strains actually require I just don't

1985
01:26:45,039 --> 01:26:50,519
have that situation so it's just such an

1986
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:53,199
interesting impulse to me though

1987
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:55,480
underlying all of it it's like

1988
01:26:53,198 --> 01:27:01,079
basically the idea is

1989
01:26:55,479 --> 01:27:04,678
that maximalism is good and it doesn't

1990
01:27:01,079 --> 01:27:07,238
there's no real justification for it um

1991
01:27:04,679 --> 01:27:10,039
I don't I I don't think any of us really

1992
01:27:07,238 --> 01:27:13,198
need to be getting four pounds a light

1993
01:27:10,039 --> 01:27:14,519
you know that's not that's not our goal

1994
01:27:13,198 --> 01:27:17,439
but I think they they have very

1995
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:19,400
different goals than we do you know so

1996
01:27:17,439 --> 01:27:23,198
they're able to do things we can't do

1997
01:27:19,399 --> 01:27:25,158
and you know I mean it must work it's to

1998
01:27:23,198 --> 01:27:29,118
some level for some of them I mean they

1999
01:27:25,158 --> 01:27:32,479
can't all be producing terrible weed but

2000
01:27:29,118 --> 01:27:34,599
nobe and maybe what we're getting to is

2001
01:27:32,479 --> 01:27:35,718
that uh like with breeding right like

2002
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:37,600
there's there's always going to be a

2003
01:27:35,719 --> 01:27:39,480
context for your grow and what are you

2004
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:42,440
growing for right and I think that's

2005
01:27:39,479 --> 01:27:44,399
what we're approaching you know um you

2006
01:27:42,439 --> 01:27:46,759
were kind of asking like what the goals

2007
01:27:44,399 --> 01:27:49,158
are of what a good grow would be to each

2008
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:50,480
of us is that was that the question yeah

2009
01:27:49,158 --> 01:27:52,599
I think that's I think that's another

2010
01:27:50,479 --> 01:27:54,439
way of asking it and maybe we can yeah

2011
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:57,400
have a go with that you know for each of

2012
01:27:54,439 --> 01:27:59,319
you what do you aim for you know what

2013
01:27:57,399 --> 01:28:00,158
what what makes like a happy grow or

2014
01:27:59,319 --> 01:28:03,279
happy

2015
01:28:00,158 --> 01:28:07,158
run um yeah local you need to chill out

2016
01:28:03,279 --> 01:28:10,359
with the Oreos and [ __ ] we can hear it

2017
01:28:07,158 --> 01:28:12,879
but lo you go you you're up what what

2018
01:28:10,359 --> 01:28:16,198
makes a happy PL or run for

2019
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:19,480
you I that's I mean that's really hard

2020
01:28:16,198 --> 01:28:20,678
to quantify but as long as my plants

2021
01:28:19,479 --> 01:28:23,238
aren't

2022
01:28:20,679 --> 01:28:27,840
like you know looking extremely

2023
01:28:23,238 --> 01:28:30,879
deficient in one thing and resin content

2024
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:34,679
looks you know what I would expect it to

2025
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:38,560
turn out to be then in a way that is you

2026
01:28:34,679 --> 01:28:40,719
know a marker for a successful run

2027
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:43,800
but there's always things that can

2028
01:28:40,719 --> 01:28:46,399
improve you know but that's that's kind

2029
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:48,920
of like the minimum I see as like a you

2030
01:28:46,399 --> 01:28:50,879
know I'm going to smoke this I I don't

2031
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:54,158
mind it at

2032
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:57,319
all um um but

2033
01:28:54,158 --> 01:28:59,079
yeah yeah I mean I'll qualify that like

2034
01:28:57,319 --> 01:29:01,799
success here is definitely in quote

2035
01:28:59,079 --> 01:29:03,920
marks and the whole idea is that we all

2036
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:07,560
have different senses of that I'm kind

2037
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:09,480
of just curious about unpacking it um

2038
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:12,600
er thoughts

2039
01:29:09,479 --> 01:29:13,678
on what makes for a successful or happy

2040
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:16,400
plant to

2041
01:29:13,679 --> 01:29:18,679
run yeah I mean like

2042
01:29:16,399 --> 01:29:21,319
um I I mean I'm kind of the same as

2043
01:29:18,679 --> 01:29:24,719
local you know it's not like I'm a I

2044
01:29:21,319 --> 01:29:27,158
just want my to look generally healthy

2045
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:29,560
um and like I kind of gauge that off of

2046
01:29:27,158 --> 01:29:32,839
like I take Cuts pretty often off of my

2047
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:35,440
mom's and stuff and like you know I want

2048
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:36,920
them to route you know around the same

2049
01:29:35,439 --> 01:29:38,719
speed stuff like that you know I'm

2050
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:40,639
always just like watching stuff to make

2051
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:45,039
sure that everything seems to be going

2052
01:29:40,639 --> 01:29:47,480
the way that I expect it to go um and

2053
01:29:45,039 --> 01:29:49,800
that's kind of what it like that's kind

2054
01:29:47,479 --> 01:29:51,718
like my goal right now is to just look

2055
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:54,440
through different stuff and find we that

2056
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:57,079
I like you know I mean these guys have

2057
01:29:54,439 --> 01:29:59,678
access to stuff that like I've never

2058
01:29:57,079 --> 01:30:02,118
smoked like named wheat you know what I

2059
01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:03,719
mean like from anyone uh like I just

2060
01:30:02,118 --> 01:30:06,319
don't have access to that kind of stuff

2061
01:30:03,719 --> 01:30:08,760
so it's been like me just kind of

2062
01:30:06,319 --> 01:30:10,238
finding like a place of like stuff that

2063
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:13,639
I like and then kind of trying to go

2064
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:17,959
from there um so for me like a

2065
01:30:13,639 --> 01:30:19,880
successful run is to pop a pack and you

2066
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:22,158
know make it through and like feel like

2067
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:23,800
I saw a good expression of that line and

2068
01:30:22,158 --> 01:30:25,599
like be able to make a decision if I

2069
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:27,000
want to continue growing that direction

2070
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:30,000
or not you

2071
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:33,359
know I really like that and I think for

2072
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:36,520
me one of my kind of

2073
01:30:33,359 --> 01:30:39,559
idealist thoughts on this on the subject

2074
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:42,360
was a good grow means that like you said

2075
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:45,920
ER the plant can express itself as fully

2076
01:30:42,359 --> 01:30:48,960
as possible or like kind of fulfill its

2077
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:51,440
potential to like the maximum degree and

2078
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:53,359
that well and I say idealist because you

2079
01:30:51,439 --> 01:30:54,879
know you don't really know that like the

2080
01:30:53,359 --> 01:30:56,519
only way you can actually know whether

2081
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:58,199
it's fulfilling its potential is if

2082
01:30:56,520 --> 01:31:01,119
you've run it multiple times and

2083
01:30:58,198 --> 01:31:02,799
possibly under different conditions but

2084
01:31:01,118 --> 01:31:06,719
I still think it's like obviously a

2085
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:10,679
noble goal to be like to see each plant

2086
01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:12,840
as having uh a certain degree of

2087
01:31:10,679 --> 01:31:15,639
potential and in your grow just trying

2088
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:17,840
to see whether you can meet that you

2089
01:31:15,639 --> 01:31:22,359
know in some form um I think that's one

2090
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:26,920
of the ways I think about it now um

2091
01:31:22,359 --> 01:31:28,399
yeah Michael thoughts on this I think uh

2092
01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:30,960
at this

2093
01:31:28,399 --> 01:31:33,118
point i' I've have have enough Harvest

2094
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:36,600
under my belt and like

2095
01:31:33,118 --> 01:31:39,039
it's the amount that we Harvest it you

2096
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:41,520
know it used to be like how many pounds

2097
01:31:39,039 --> 01:31:44,840
per light and how much you could get

2098
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:47,520
would be the general winner of what was

2099
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:49,840
a good grow or not um I think at this

2100
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:53,560
point with you know we not being that

2101
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:57,000
valuable except on a mon AR level um

2102
01:31:53,560 --> 01:32:00,560
really I see success as popping a pack

2103
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:02,679
of seeds that I'm actually interested in

2104
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:05,840
and then having you

2105
01:32:02,679 --> 01:32:07,399
know being happy with the end result of

2106
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:12,079
50% of those

2107
01:32:07,399 --> 01:32:15,118
seeds so if I pop a pack and I get seven

2108
01:32:12,079 --> 01:32:18,118
females if four of them come out and I'm

2109
01:32:15,118 --> 01:32:20,399
excited to smoke them or I'm excited to

2110
01:32:18,118 --> 01:32:23,079
share them and show them that's a

2111
01:32:20,399 --> 01:32:25,359
successful grow

2112
01:32:23,079 --> 01:32:28,198
yep y that's another good that's another

2113
01:32:25,359 --> 01:32:31,118
really good angle I think um and that

2114
01:32:28,198 --> 01:32:33,960
has like you said more to do with like

2115
01:32:31,118 --> 01:32:35,519
the probabilities around you know

2116
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:39,198
running out a pack and what the

2117
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:40,600
individuals end up being like yeah yep

2118
01:32:39,198 --> 01:32:44,158
you know it's important where you get

2119
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:46,119
your seeds from you know like you you

2120
01:32:44,158 --> 01:32:47,679
know you're spending money doing this

2121
01:32:46,118 --> 01:32:50,679
you don't need to waste time you only

2122
01:32:47,679 --> 01:32:52,639
have so many harvests in a life make

2123
01:32:50,679 --> 01:32:55,199
sure you're getting something that is

2124
01:32:52,639 --> 01:32:57,800
reputable and that you're happy with and

2125
01:32:55,198 --> 01:33:00,198
if you buy a pack of seeds from someone

2126
01:32:57,800 --> 01:33:03,320
that you know is new to you and their

2127
01:33:00,198 --> 01:33:05,198
junk you don't find anything you'd keep

2128
01:33:03,319 --> 01:33:07,880
don't keep throwing money at those same

2129
01:33:05,198 --> 01:33:10,158
people you know like go with the ones

2130
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:12,480
that are you know giving you something

2131
01:33:10,158 --> 01:33:15,799
to live for something to be happy about

2132
01:33:12,479 --> 01:33:18,439
something to be excited to show your

2133
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:20,360
friends I was thinking about this you

2134
01:33:18,439 --> 01:33:22,118
know in terms of like a difference in

2135
01:33:20,359 --> 01:33:24,479
philosophy uh

2136
01:33:22,118 --> 01:33:26,359
between like different people in the

2137
01:33:24,479 --> 01:33:28,799
community there there there obviously a

2138
01:33:26,359 --> 01:33:30,079
large number of people who who will say

2139
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:33,119
I just want to be happy with what I

2140
01:33:30,079 --> 01:33:35,039
bought I don't care who I bought it from

2141
01:33:33,118 --> 01:33:36,880
but I bought it and I just want to feel

2142
01:33:35,039 --> 01:33:38,840
okay with it and you shouldn't tell me

2143
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:40,359
that like I should care you know where I

2144
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:42,880
got it from and then there are the

2145
01:33:40,359 --> 01:33:45,238
people who I think are more like us who

2146
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:47,079
are in a way like perhaps like never

2147
01:33:45,238 --> 01:33:50,599
really satisfied and always looking for

2148
01:33:47,079 --> 01:33:52,880
bit and B and so you do have to look at

2149
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:55,280
every little parameter that you can

2150
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:59,159
control i. you what the genetics are who

2151
01:33:55,279 --> 01:34:00,479
you bought it from um I think it is

2152
01:33:59,158 --> 01:34:01,879
interesting because it it's a very

2153
01:34:00,479 --> 01:34:04,158
divisive thing it feels like in the

2154
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:05,639
growing Community the people who think

2155
01:34:04,158 --> 01:34:07,759
it doesn't matter where you get stuff

2156
01:34:05,639 --> 01:34:09,880
from you can always find good stuff and

2157
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:12,679
the people who are like I want to keep

2158
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:15,319
looking harder

2159
01:34:12,679 --> 01:34:16,960
um I think it's interesting you know

2160
01:34:15,319 --> 01:34:19,319
that it reminds me of something that we

2161
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:21,158
used to say a lot um you know like

2162
01:34:19,319 --> 01:34:24,479
people used to be real passionate about

2163
01:34:21,158 --> 01:34:26,039
uh cars and I'm gonna buy American you

2164
01:34:24,479 --> 01:34:28,439
know you'd hear those people like I'd

2165
01:34:26,039 --> 01:34:30,560
only buy a Chevy or a Ford you know I'd

2166
01:34:28,439 --> 01:34:32,000
never buy a Japanese car you know

2167
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:34,000
because they want to reinvest in their

2168
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,920
country and their people and then you

2169
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:37,880
have the other you know whatever part of

2170
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:40,039
the population that's like I don't care

2171
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:41,239
I just want you know a good car that's

2172
01:34:40,039 --> 01:34:44,359
cheap and it'll

2173
01:34:41,238 --> 01:34:47,279
run you know so I think each individual

2174
01:34:44,359 --> 01:34:50,079
has to decide what's important to them

2175
01:34:47,279 --> 01:34:52,800
I'm not giving my money to someone that

2176
01:34:50,079 --> 01:34:54,920
I think's a white supremacist or a child

2177
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:55,840
or anything like that you know those

2178
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:58,279
things are

2179
01:34:55,840 --> 01:35:00,520
important you know I'm sure a lot of

2180
01:34:58,279 --> 01:35:03,198
people don't give a [ __ ] and oh yeah

2181
01:35:00,520 --> 01:35:06,280
this guy ripped off Caleb and his whole

2182
01:35:03,198 --> 01:35:08,960
line is uh basically just CSI

2183
01:35:06,279 --> 01:35:11,479
repos but they're a little bit cheaper

2184
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:15,439
you know well hey I'll just get it from

2185
01:35:11,479 --> 01:35:17,279
Caleb because the dude's legit you know

2186
01:35:15,439 --> 01:35:19,158
I don't care I'd rather spend a few

2187
01:35:17,279 --> 01:35:22,158
extra bucks and get it from the guy that

2188
01:35:19,158 --> 01:35:24,559
deserves the recognition than the dude

2189
01:35:22,158 --> 01:35:27,879
that just copies everything Caleb does

2190
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:31,320
you know it's just a different mindset

2191
01:35:27,880 --> 01:35:33,679
dude like um it is it's not important it

2192
01:35:31,319 --> 01:35:36,519
isn't like where I spend my money to me

2193
01:35:33,679 --> 01:35:39,199
matters because I know like that's a

2194
01:35:36,520 --> 01:35:40,760
vote for this person existing that's a

2195
01:35:39,198 --> 01:35:42,839
vote for his family and if he's a good

2196
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:44,719
family man I care about his family but

2197
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:47,600
I'm not I'm not like I'm in this for

2198
01:35:44,719 --> 01:35:49,560
making lifetime friends on top like I

2199
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:51,400
don't just have customer relationships

2200
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:54,039
with any M like people know that that

2201
01:35:51,399 --> 01:35:55,960
know me like we become friends over time

2202
01:35:54,039 --> 01:35:58,198
because I I give a [ __ ] about the people

2203
01:35:55,960 --> 01:36:00,560
I'm interacting with but you know it's

2204
01:35:58,198 --> 01:36:02,079
just it just depends on what you're into

2205
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:04,880
some people are just like I don't care

2206
01:36:02,079 --> 01:36:07,559
who it's from if it's dank it's dank but

2207
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:09,639
a lot of those people also don't like

2208
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:10,840
clearly have not even gotten to the

2209
01:36:09,639 --> 01:36:12,880
point where they even understand what

2210
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:14,279
dank means to them like they haven't

2211
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:15,960
even made it that far in their Journey

2212
01:36:14,279 --> 01:36:17,920
if they're still that mindset in my

2213
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:20,639
opinion you know that's that's where I

2214
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:23,560
see it yeah I I love seeing the people

2215
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:26,520
that I care about succeed that [ __ ]

2216
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:29,159
excites me you'll also find the people

2217
01:36:26,520 --> 01:36:31,080
that want to take advantage of their

2218
01:36:29,158 --> 01:36:33,279
friends that succeed more than anything

2219
01:36:31,079 --> 01:36:35,840
else yeah there's just there's different

2220
01:36:33,279 --> 01:36:39,479
types of people in this world you know

2221
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:41,600
yeah yeah I think that's like oh sorry

2222
01:36:39,479 --> 01:36:43,559
oh you going you going no I was just

2223
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:46,880
gonna say coming into the weed scene

2224
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:49,119
like as like a newer guy you know and

2225
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:50,279
just like meeting people on Discord and

2226
01:36:49,118 --> 01:36:53,198
stuff

2227
01:36:50,279 --> 01:36:57,559
like I didn't have like a clear

2228
01:36:53,198 --> 01:36:59,919
understanding of like what um like how

2229
01:36:57,560 --> 01:37:01,600
you know like how small the scene is so

2230
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:04,000
like it's like these dudes know each

2231
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:06,800
other and stuff you know and like you

2232
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:08,600
like you're definitely voting like

2233
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:10,360
whether you like it or not you're like

2234
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:13,679
making a decision with your money when

2235
01:37:10,359 --> 01:37:16,559
you spend on in in such a small scene

2236
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:18,440
like that kind of money like like really

2237
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:21,280
goes a you know that really goes a long

2238
01:37:18,439 --> 01:37:23,599
way like if like Matt loses one or two

2239
01:37:21,279 --> 01:37:25,599
people it's not like seed sellers are

2240
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:27,079
like you know have millions of customers

2241
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:30,079
you know what I mean like it's very

2242
01:37:27,079 --> 01:37:33,800
small and when you yeah I mean you

2243
01:37:30,079 --> 01:37:38,079
should like the by obviously like I want

2244
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:39,800
to smoke good weed but if the choice is

2245
01:37:38,079 --> 01:37:42,840
smoke good weed and support shitty

2246
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:44,760
people I just will not smoke weed yeah

2247
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:47,039
you know there this also goes two ways

2248
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:49,079
with some of us too like um there's a

2249
01:37:47,039 --> 01:37:50,960
lot of us as as seed makers and this

2250
01:37:49,079 --> 01:37:52,198
really screws people up like when they

2251
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:53,960
email email me and they're like yeah I'm

2252
01:37:52,198 --> 01:37:56,359
going to drop three grand and they

2253
01:37:53,960 --> 01:37:57,679
proceed to like you know like downt me

2254
01:37:56,359 --> 01:37:59,319
and be rude I'll just be like dude I

2255
01:37:57,679 --> 01:38:02,399
don't need your money you sound like an

2256
01:37:59,319 --> 01:38:04,920
[ __ ] like I'm not even into it like

2257
01:38:02,399 --> 01:38:06,638
it's not it's it doesn't matter if it it

2258
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:08,679
would keep the business running longer

2259
01:38:06,639 --> 01:38:11,079
in many cases it just doesn't matter to

2260
01:38:08,679 --> 01:38:14,199
me because bad people don't need to

2261
01:38:11,079 --> 01:38:15,719
touch plants it's just what it is the

2262
01:38:14,198 --> 01:38:17,559
fact of the matter I think it passes

2263
01:38:15,719 --> 01:38:19,639
down I think bad juju flies with this

2264
01:38:17,560 --> 01:38:22,199
[ __ ] and you see it time and time again

2265
01:38:19,639 --> 01:38:24,359
where people support bad people making

2266
01:38:22,198 --> 01:38:25,759
seeds and time and time again bad things

2267
01:38:24,359 --> 01:38:27,598
happen to these people throughout their

2268
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:29,440
lives like this stuff travels and

2269
01:38:27,599 --> 01:38:31,319
Carries On I'm not a very spiritual

2270
01:38:29,439 --> 01:38:33,799
person but some things in life are just

2271
01:38:31,319 --> 01:38:36,079
evident to me yeah plants are living I

2272
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:38,760
mean plants are living beings you know I

2273
01:38:36,079 --> 01:38:42,399
do think about that and I like I think

2274
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:44,480
about like um when I have gotten plants

2275
01:38:42,399 --> 01:38:46,359
from I've like you know gotten packs

2276
01:38:44,479 --> 01:38:48,759
from people and started growing them out

2277
01:38:46,359 --> 01:38:51,279
and like been mid I mean I've been

2278
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:54,039
midflower and found stuff out about the

2279
01:38:51,279 --> 01:38:55,479
people that made them and I just I

2280
01:38:54,039 --> 01:38:57,679
there's nothing in me that wants to

2281
01:38:55,479 --> 01:38:59,319
smoke those plants anymore I've just

2282
01:38:57,679 --> 01:39:02,158
I've thrown them I've thrown whole

2283
01:38:59,319 --> 01:39:05,359
plants out just truthfully I just am

2284
01:39:02,158 --> 01:39:07,559
very much like I got like a a big part

2285
01:39:05,359 --> 01:39:09,319
of this is really cool as the community

2286
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:12,000
and like now that I'm a part of it I

2287
01:39:09,319 --> 01:39:15,719
don't I yeah I just can't support like

2288
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:17,920
shitty people yeah not not only that but

2289
01:39:15,719 --> 01:39:19,920
if people don't you know if not enough

2290
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:22,960
of us vote with their dollar and in the

2291
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:27,760
end of this we're left with you know uh

2292
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:30,599
compound and Seed junkie uh we're allay

2293
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:34,039
the price like that's gonna be a shitty

2294
01:39:30,599 --> 01:39:37,520
World they'll be living in you know yeah

2295
01:39:34,039 --> 01:39:40,158
and I also think that even if even if

2296
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:42,760
one were uh ethically or morally uh

2297
01:39:40,158 --> 01:39:45,118
indifferent to that situation there are

2298
01:39:42,760 --> 01:39:48,560
enough good options on the market that

2299
01:39:45,118 --> 01:39:50,479
you can consider things like ethics and

2300
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:52,280
Community when you make these decisions

2301
01:39:50,479 --> 01:39:54,158
because there like we don't have enough

2302
01:39:52,279 --> 01:39:58,039
sources at the moment I mean you can buy

2303
01:39:54,158 --> 01:39:59,439
a pack from pack or H lome or Matt or

2304
01:39:58,039 --> 01:40:01,519
any of these people that are in the

2305
01:39:59,439 --> 01:40:03,759
server that are legit people doing it

2306
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:06,599
the right way and not you know not

2307
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:08,599
[ __ ] people over and you can find a I

2308
01:40:06,599 --> 01:40:10,760
mean I would say a keeper in every pack

2309
01:40:08,599 --> 01:40:12,719
almost I mean at this point with a lot

2310
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:14,719
of that stuff I mean I've grown through

2311
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:15,920
a lot of their like not not a lot but

2312
01:40:14,719 --> 01:40:17,639
like at this point I've grown through

2313
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:20,079
enough of it that like I've found plants

2314
01:40:17,639 --> 01:40:23,279
that are really good you know and it's

2315
01:40:20,079 --> 01:40:26,319
not like these guys are trying to lie to

2316
01:40:23,279 --> 01:40:28,279
you or anything you know no some in some

2317
01:40:26,319 --> 01:40:30,279
of those cases they people that I had to

2318
01:40:28,279 --> 01:40:32,920
force to sell their seeds like high and

2319
01:40:30,279 --> 01:40:35,439
Lonesome and even pack like these are

2320
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:36,679
guys that like existed and were making

2321
01:40:35,439 --> 01:40:38,359
stuff that I thought was cool and I was

2322
01:40:36,679 --> 01:40:40,199
like guys like I think other people need

2323
01:40:38,359 --> 01:40:43,439
to see this it's really really good you

2324
01:40:40,198 --> 01:40:46,359
know and hen lonon took years and years

2325
01:40:43,439 --> 01:40:48,238
he did not want anything he was around

2326
01:40:46,359 --> 01:40:51,039
before me so he knew like what goes

2327
01:40:48,238 --> 01:40:52,598
along with selling seeds he knew what he

2328
01:40:51,039 --> 01:40:54,359
knew all the headaches that come with it

2329
01:40:52,599 --> 01:40:57,079
so none of that was interesting to him

2330
01:40:54,359 --> 01:40:58,920
he just likes plants you know so yeah

2331
01:40:57,079 --> 01:41:00,479
some of these guys you have to drag in

2332
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:01,960
Kicking and Screaming but sometimes it's

2333
01:41:00,479 --> 01:41:03,919
worth it and I think that he was

2334
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:09,560
definitely one that was worth it so it's

2335
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:12,359
pack I I've popped 72 seeds from CSI and

2336
01:41:09,560 --> 01:41:14,360
I've had two plants I was disappointed

2337
01:41:12,359 --> 01:41:17,319
in out

2338
01:41:14,359 --> 01:41:19,719
of that's insane you know where I was

2339
01:41:17,319 --> 01:41:21,359
like ah this is kind of boofy yeah you

2340
01:41:19,719 --> 01:41:24,079
know and it's also

2341
01:41:21,359 --> 01:41:27,639
one of the most difficult line lines to

2342
01:41:24,079 --> 01:41:31,359
breed with so yeah I'm not surprised you

2343
01:41:27,639 --> 01:41:33,359
know yeah everything else was

2344
01:41:31,359 --> 01:41:36,000
unbelievable and that's EXA what it

2345
01:41:33,359 --> 01:41:37,479
should be yeah and and the special thing

2346
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,920
about that too is that like he's pretty

2347
01:41:37,479 --> 01:41:40,678
open about it and says like you could

2348
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:43,239
expect x amount of Booth from this line

2349
01:41:40,679 --> 01:41:45,319
blah blah blah and being able to to tell

2350
01:41:43,238 --> 01:41:47,879
people with transparency what to expect

2351
01:41:45,319 --> 01:41:50,319
again is a loss art in seats and a lot

2352
01:41:47,880 --> 01:41:52,520
of people don't get that like just but

2353
01:41:50,319 --> 01:41:54,719
just for cas in point any of these hype

2354
01:41:52,520 --> 01:41:57,239
strains with any of these like food

2355
01:41:54,719 --> 01:42:00,319
names are any of those like what they're

2356
01:41:57,238 --> 01:42:01,678
implying in that case what are you doing

2357
01:42:00,319 --> 01:42:03,639
what what are we what are we even naming

2358
01:42:01,679 --> 01:42:07,480
this [ __ ] for yeah why not just call it

2359
01:42:03,639 --> 01:42:09,359
xyz123 I don't know right that shit's so

2360
01:42:07,479 --> 01:42:10,839
annoying that's what you know like when

2361
01:42:09,359 --> 01:42:13,238
you put blueberry on something it's

2362
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:15,520
blueberry yeah when Dynasty says

2363
01:42:13,238 --> 01:42:18,238
something is gonna be strawberry or

2364
01:42:15,520 --> 01:42:20,840
pineapple it's pineapple exactly you

2365
01:42:18,238 --> 01:42:23,399
know if it's cherry vanilla it's cherry

2366
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:26,599
van Jerry vanilla right yeah you know

2367
01:42:23,399 --> 01:42:30,559
like that's that shit's important you

2368
01:42:26,599 --> 01:42:32,319
know Blue Sushi I don't like what the

2369
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:34,039
[ __ ] is that even supposed to be I don't

2370
01:42:32,319 --> 01:42:37,559
get it you

2371
01:42:34,039 --> 01:42:40,238
know yeah I've never had a marijuana

2372
01:42:37,560 --> 01:42:43,880
that tastes like a hamburger either no

2373
01:42:40,238 --> 01:42:43,879
no thank God thank

2374
01:42:44,118 --> 01:42:52,679
God yeah it's not an appealing one

2375
01:42:48,599 --> 01:42:55,639
no um yeah I mean I think that was a

2376
01:42:52,679 --> 01:42:58,920
good good exchange about like how we

2377
01:42:55,639 --> 01:43:00,719
make our you know buying decisions um in

2378
01:42:58,920 --> 01:43:04,560
this space I think it's always going to

2379
01:43:00,719 --> 01:43:06,399
be a really interesting topic um isn't

2380
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:09,960
it weird that it's like all passion or

2381
01:43:06,399 --> 01:43:12,359
no passion with it on those answers what

2382
01:43:09,960 --> 01:43:14,840
divides people it doesn't seem like

2383
01:43:12,359 --> 01:43:16,639
there's a lot of Middle Ground on that

2384
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:18,960
people either tend to be very passionate

2385
01:43:16,639 --> 01:43:18,960
or very

2386
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:24,800
Blas yeah yeah yeah I mean it's that's

2387
01:43:22,198 --> 01:43:26,719
what it seems like to me as well yeah

2388
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:29,920
remember Sean pointed that out it's like

2389
01:43:26,719 --> 01:43:30,920
uh team sports almost yeah definitely

2390
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:33,599
you

2391
01:43:30,920 --> 01:43:35,880
know it's hard to not have communities

2392
01:43:33,599 --> 01:43:37,560
without that to to not that's true

2393
01:43:35,880 --> 01:43:39,800
because communities are all built on

2394
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:41,760
like passionate ideals at least the best

2395
01:43:39,800 --> 01:43:43,599
communities that stay that stay together

2396
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:46,639
and stand firm are built on passionate

2397
01:43:43,599 --> 01:43:49,400
ideals and passionate ideals definitely

2398
01:43:46,639 --> 01:43:51,520
they become strong ideals and that

2399
01:43:49,399 --> 01:43:52,839
definitely leads that team Sports type

2400
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:55,639
thing I've been trying to think of how

2401
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:57,400
to to keep our group from experiencing

2402
01:43:55,639 --> 01:43:59,520
that as best we can because it's hard

2403
01:43:57,399 --> 01:44:02,679
because I'm everybody sees me and I'm I

2404
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:04,639
have my own very very opinionated way of

2405
01:44:02,679 --> 01:44:07,399
dealing with things but at the same time

2406
01:44:04,639 --> 01:44:11,039
like I'm trying to Tender that with the

2407
01:44:07,399 --> 01:44:12,319
idea of it my own personal opinion is

2408
01:44:11,039 --> 01:44:13,880
affecting the way other people think

2409
01:44:12,319 --> 01:44:16,000
maybe that isn't so smart and trying to

2410
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:18,800
figure out how to maneuver that it's

2411
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:21,800
it's interesting but yeah it's always

2412
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:24,000
evolving well and I to I think too like

2413
01:44:21,800 --> 01:44:24,960
I've always appreciated like when I just

2414
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:27,520
coming

2415
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:29,599
here um and having an honest

2416
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:31,719
conversation about like what

2417
01:44:29,599 --> 01:44:34,119
expectations are from what you're

2418
01:44:31,719 --> 01:44:35,639
growing and stuff like that I mean you

2419
01:44:34,118 --> 01:44:37,679
just don't I mean like when I started

2420
01:44:35,639 --> 01:44:40,279
growing that's what I wanted was that

2421
01:44:37,679 --> 01:44:42,199
Community to be able to like talk to the

2422
01:44:40,279 --> 01:44:44,319
dudes that are like like growing these

2423
01:44:42,198 --> 01:44:46,238
plants and working with them and like

2424
01:44:44,319 --> 01:44:48,279
get like an idea of like what are they

2425
01:44:46,238 --> 01:44:49,519
looking for out of this and like what

2426
01:44:48,279 --> 01:44:52,679
you know what I mean just stuff like

2427
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:54,719
that like it's just like it's so much

2428
01:44:52,679 --> 01:44:55,960
work like when you pop a seed like you

2429
01:44:54,719 --> 01:44:58,760
don't realize that you're going to be

2430
01:44:55,960 --> 01:45:00,719
with that plant for like you know you

2431
01:44:58,760 --> 01:45:02,599
might be with that plant for a year or

2432
01:45:00,719 --> 01:45:05,439
more you know I mean like it's a big

2433
01:45:02,599 --> 01:45:07,840
commitment and like I want to like know

2434
01:45:05,439 --> 01:45:09,559
about like what I'm doing and like what

2435
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:11,319
I don't know there's just so much to it

2436
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:13,679
and there's people that do take it

2437
01:45:11,319 --> 01:45:15,679
seriously enough that can tell you that

2438
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:19,118
that I just don't understand why you

2439
01:45:15,679 --> 01:45:21,239
would support people that don't take it

2440
01:45:19,118 --> 01:45:23,880
seriously um

2441
01:45:21,238 --> 01:45:25,439
I wanted to kind of like tie this

2442
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:28,599
together with some of what I was saying

2443
01:45:25,439 --> 01:45:30,638
about what makes for a good grow and I

2444
01:45:28,599 --> 01:45:32,880
like sorry tie this conversation about

2445
01:45:30,639 --> 01:45:35,279
buying seeds uh together with that

2446
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:38,520
because for me one of the cool things

2447
01:45:35,279 --> 01:45:40,319
that you get out of buying stuff that is

2448
01:45:38,520 --> 01:45:42,719
reliable and has descriptions that you

2449
01:45:40,319 --> 01:45:46,238
can actually like somewhat

2450
01:45:42,719 --> 01:45:48,439
trust um is that you get to

2451
01:45:46,238 --> 01:45:49,879
see you're going to get to see what

2452
01:45:48,439 --> 01:45:51,799
people actually say you're going to get

2453
01:45:49,880 --> 01:45:54,599
to see so so last night for example I

2454
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:58,079
was actually asking Matt hey I'm growing

2455
01:45:54,599 --> 01:46:00,520
this like T1000 times Underdog Ole I'm

2456
01:45:58,079 --> 01:46:02,519
seeing like some OG leaning things I

2457
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:05,040
think do you think that this is like an

2458
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:06,760
O leaning thing and get getting to see

2459
01:46:05,039 --> 01:46:09,920
that for me is also part of what makes a

2460
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:11,679
good yeah that's awesome like you have

2461
01:46:09,920 --> 01:46:13,960
questions about lineage you have

2462
01:46:11,679 --> 01:46:15,719
questions about expressions and you get

2463
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:19,158
those questions answered in the grow

2464
01:46:15,719 --> 01:46:22,158
that's a good grow to me yeah

2465
01:46:19,158 --> 01:46:24,679
yeah I mean so we're coming up to where

2466
01:46:22,158 --> 01:46:27,479
are we we're like almost at the 2 hour

2467
01:46:24,679 --> 01:46:29,679
mark 15 minutes away or so does anyone

2468
01:46:27,479 --> 01:46:31,959
else have any other kind of like broad

2469
01:46:29,679 --> 01:46:36,480
Reflections

2470
01:46:31,960 --> 01:46:37,439
on uh grow philosophy grow Tech uh kind

2471
01:46:36,479 --> 01:46:39,399
of like what I was saying at the very

2472
01:46:37,439 --> 01:46:41,559
beginning this episode is a bit broader

2473
01:46:39,399 --> 01:46:43,679
it's meant to be about yeah Broad tech

2474
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:45,840
and Broad like philosophy I think for

2475
01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:48,239
subsequent episodes we can probably pick

2476
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:52,000
like topics like uh mid to late

2477
01:46:48,238 --> 01:46:54,799
flowering or IPM or stuff like that but

2478
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:56,560
for this one does anyone else have like

2479
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:59,360
any other Reflections or like talking

2480
01:46:56,560 --> 01:47:00,840
points um I have one and usually I go

2481
01:46:59,359 --> 01:47:04,079
last but this one I want to hear what

2482
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:05,960
these guys have to say um one of the

2483
01:47:04,079 --> 01:47:07,679
main things with indoor growing and and

2484
01:47:05,960 --> 01:47:10,439
it was a long journey like trying to

2485
01:47:07,679 --> 01:47:11,920
chase OG Kush Cuts over um you know that

2486
01:47:10,439 --> 01:47:13,719
was a real popular thing when I was

2487
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:15,679
coming up as OG Kush which cut which

2488
01:47:13,719 --> 01:47:17,760
Kush cut do you have is it one of the

2489
01:47:15,679 --> 01:47:20,920
original legit ones and I remember

2490
01:47:17,760 --> 01:47:23,400
coming across this grow um or not this

2491
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:26,000
broke this weed in a collective in San

2492
01:47:23,399 --> 01:47:28,279
Diego called Point Loma Collective back

2493
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:32,279
Point Loma patience Collective and it

2494
01:47:28,279 --> 01:47:35,759
was called Tokyo OG right and it was the

2495
01:47:32,279 --> 01:47:38,158
danst danst OG Kush cut I thought I

2496
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:39,760
could ever I was chasing this thing and

2497
01:47:38,158 --> 01:47:41,158
I remember they told me it was a lady

2498
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:42,639
would come in and drop it off and the

2499
01:47:41,158 --> 01:47:44,759
lady was the grower and the breeder of

2500
01:47:42,639 --> 01:47:46,079
this cut and so I remember being in

2501
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:47,560
there and hanging out and waiting for

2502
01:47:46,079 --> 01:47:49,840
her to come do her drop and trying to

2503
01:47:47,560 --> 01:47:52,560
catch her like just to talk to her hey

2504
01:47:49,840 --> 01:47:53,960
dude you know it's talk and I missed her

2505
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:56,280
the one time she came in when I was

2506
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:57,960
there and I was so bummed and later on

2507
01:47:56,279 --> 01:48:00,319
we became friends in life and that's

2508
01:47:57,960 --> 01:48:03,679
when I realized it wasn't that it was

2509
01:48:00,319 --> 01:48:07,039
just a special special OG it was special

2510
01:48:03,679 --> 01:48:09,319
it was a great OG Kush cut it was how

2511
01:48:07,039 --> 01:48:12,238
well she familiarized herself with that

2512
01:48:09,319 --> 01:48:14,599
single cut and truly truly what I felt

2513
01:48:12,238 --> 01:48:17,079
mastered it to bring out its best peaked

2514
01:48:14,599 --> 01:48:20,000
expressions and it was so good she

2515
01:48:17,079 --> 01:48:23,439
outgrew every [ __ ] OG griller in San

2516
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:24,760
Diego and everybody faked having her cut

2517
01:48:23,439 --> 01:48:26,359
but it was always obvious when it was

2518
01:48:24,760 --> 01:48:28,440
her grow and she never passed her cut

2519
01:48:26,359 --> 01:48:31,559
out um it was always obvious when it was

2520
01:48:28,439 --> 01:48:33,598
her grow because it was so expertly done

2521
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:36,239
and you always knew when it was big so

2522
01:48:33,599 --> 01:48:40,079
yeah shout out to her and it was also uh

2523
01:48:36,238 --> 01:48:41,559
a big Learning lesson for me yeah so

2524
01:48:40,079 --> 01:48:42,880
what's the sorry Matt what's the prompt

2525
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:45,360
for people like what are you asking us

2526
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:46,239
to think about here well like the fact

2527
01:48:45,359 --> 01:48:47,759
that you know like there's a lot of

2528
01:48:46,238 --> 01:48:49,638
Clone chasing we do all this clone

2529
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:51,039
chasing people trying to find this clone

2530
01:48:49,639 --> 01:48:52,760
and a lot of times it's not about that

2531
01:48:51,039 --> 01:48:54,920
it's how well you can grow a single

2532
01:48:52,760 --> 01:48:56,719
clone yeah and that was kind of what I I

2533
01:48:54,920 --> 01:48:59,359
learned and experienced through that

2534
01:48:56,719 --> 01:49:01,158
whole whole section you know and I don't

2535
01:48:59,359 --> 01:49:03,679
know if clone chasing is as popular as

2536
01:49:01,158 --> 01:49:05,960
it is now or was then as it is now with

2537
01:49:03,679 --> 01:49:07,359
this generation but that was a huge

2538
01:49:05,960 --> 01:49:08,960
learning experience for me and I don't

2539
01:49:07,359 --> 01:49:10,559
know if anybody else has had similar

2540
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:13,520
experiences you know I think that's

2541
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:16,000
really a lost art at this point because

2542
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:19,560
if you think about it Matt you know 20

2543
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:21,679
plus years ago you'd be lucky to be able

2544
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:24,280
to get one Elite like let's say you got

2545
01:49:21,679 --> 01:49:25,679
an elite clone yeah that's probably all

2546
01:49:24,279 --> 01:49:28,439
you're going to be growing for the next

2547
01:49:25,679 --> 01:49:29,599
10 to 15 years yeah it's true you know

2548
01:49:28,439 --> 01:49:32,879
what I mean you're gonna learn that

2549
01:49:29,599 --> 01:49:34,880
plant inside and out you know like if

2550
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:38,319
you got an OG you're gonna you're gonna

2551
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:41,239
learn how to grow OG exactly you know

2552
01:49:38,319 --> 01:49:44,599
whereas now there's so much available to

2553
01:49:41,238 --> 01:49:46,479
all of us like um good point there's

2554
01:49:44,599 --> 01:49:49,199
very few plants that I want to grow more

2555
01:49:46,479 --> 01:49:50,919
than two years you know if I do it's for

2556
01:49:49,198 --> 01:49:52,319
Nostalgia more than than anything else

2557
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:54,800
because I'm worried no one else will

2558
01:49:52,319 --> 01:49:57,238
keep it and it'll be gone forever yeah

2559
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:59,639
yeah you know point and uh there was a

2560
01:49:57,238 --> 01:50:03,238
time when I first started going to

2561
01:49:59,639 --> 01:50:06,679
dispensaries here in the valley and uh

2562
01:50:03,238 --> 01:50:10,118
you'd go in and there'd be you know 20

2563
01:50:06,679 --> 01:50:13,319
different jars of OG right oh yeah like

2564
01:50:10,118 --> 01:50:15,719
every name you could think of and to me

2565
01:50:13,319 --> 01:50:18,399
you know I didn't realize at that point

2566
01:50:15,719 --> 01:50:21,000
that uh Ken had been selling

2567
01:50:18,399 --> 01:50:23,759
s1s so I would through all those jars

2568
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:25,439
and I'd be like they're all OG yeah you

2569
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:26,599
can just tell some Growers know what

2570
01:50:25,439 --> 01:50:29,479
they're doing a little better than

2571
01:50:26,599 --> 01:50:31,520
others you know like this guy whereas

2572
01:50:29,479 --> 01:50:33,118
now when I think back now I'm thinking

2573
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:36,040
huh I wonder if maybe there were

2574
01:50:33,118 --> 01:50:38,519
different that many different OG Cuts or

2575
01:50:36,039 --> 01:50:40,920
if there were just a few handful of cuts

2576
01:50:38,520 --> 01:50:43,960
maybe five or six and then these people

2577
01:50:40,920 --> 01:50:46,319
grew really well or really poorly

2578
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:48,439
exactly it's hard to know like I still

2579
01:50:46,319 --> 01:50:52,559
I'm I'm not a 100 perc sure like when I

2580
01:50:48,439 --> 01:50:55,198
hear sfv the examples I've seen they

2581
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:58,079
look identical to the original OG that I

2582
01:50:55,198 --> 01:51:02,479
saw when I moved here yeah you know and

2583
01:50:58,078 --> 01:51:04,198
there was no sfv OG back then no so you

2584
01:51:02,479 --> 01:51:07,000
know I'm still confused about that too

2585
01:51:04,198 --> 01:51:09,359
but I think your Point's very well taken

2586
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:11,960
like when someone knows how to grow

2587
01:51:09,359 --> 01:51:14,158
something it's going and they make that

2588
01:51:11,960 --> 01:51:16,880
their love or their passion it's going

2589
01:51:14,158 --> 01:51:18,799
to be unbelievable I bet if I was able

2590
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:22,118
to smoke uh high and lonesome's

2591
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:24,560
Appalachia it' probably you know the

2592
01:51:22,118 --> 01:51:28,399
farthest thing from skunk number one oh

2593
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:29,960
yeah it's next level dude you know so

2594
01:51:28,399 --> 01:51:30,719
yeah I I definitely see where you are

2595
01:51:29,960 --> 01:51:33,920
with

2596
01:51:30,719 --> 01:51:36,239
that I think it reminds me Matt we

2597
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:37,960
should one of the other one of the kind

2598
01:51:36,238 --> 01:51:41,559
of topics that we could cover in a

2599
01:51:37,960 --> 01:51:44,158
future episode is like preservation

2600
01:51:41,560 --> 01:51:46,079
propagation you know like all that stuff

2601
01:51:44,158 --> 01:51:47,719
I remember like Chimera also had some

2602
01:51:46,078 --> 01:51:49,519
stuff to say about that maybe it would

2603
01:51:47,719 --> 01:51:51,359
be funny if we could maybe include him

2604
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:55,400
in one of the

2605
01:51:51,359 --> 01:51:58,759
um absolutely but yeah uh anyone else

2606
01:51:55,399 --> 01:51:58,759
local any any last

2607
01:52:00,479 --> 01:52:06,799
thoughts um no I didn't sorry I had to

2608
01:52:04,319 --> 01:52:11,920
press the unmute button you got electric

2609
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:14,599
boogalo yeah right um so I don't know I

2610
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:17,520
think running a clone like if you're set

2611
01:52:14,599 --> 01:52:19,039
on a cut I think every time you rerun it

2612
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:22,560
you're going to learn something about

2613
01:52:19,039 --> 01:52:24,639
how it does Express and I I think like

2614
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:27,119
obviously in that you're going to learn

2615
01:52:24,639 --> 01:52:30,560
what you can tweak to make the ride a

2616
01:52:27,118 --> 01:52:33,399
little smoother the next time um and I

2617
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:36,840
do think that that is like you

2618
01:52:33,399 --> 01:52:38,399
know um something really important

2619
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:41,000
especially when you're kind of learning

2620
01:52:38,399 --> 01:52:42,719
a cut you know to learn what you can do

2621
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:46,520
to maximize its

2622
01:52:42,719 --> 01:52:48,118
potential um and it's like ogs and stuff

2623
01:52:46,520 --> 01:52:50,639
like godamn I wouldn't even know where

2624
01:52:48,118 --> 01:52:53,399
to start like any OG High hybrid I've

2625
01:52:50,639 --> 01:52:56,000
had has just looked like ass under my

2626
01:52:53,399 --> 01:52:58,399
conditions um but that's cuz I grow in

2627
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:03,279
pure cocoa and that's like not the way

2628
01:52:58,399 --> 01:53:07,039
to grow OG Kush at all no system yeah

2629
01:53:03,279 --> 01:53:09,198
exactly so it's just like there I did

2630
01:53:07,039 --> 01:53:11,158
want to I did want to highlight here you

2631
01:53:09,198 --> 01:53:12,638
know you talk about rerunning a plant

2632
01:53:11,158 --> 01:53:14,839
and and getting to learn it better which

2633
01:53:12,639 --> 01:53:16,480
is obviously true but in rerunning a

2634
01:53:14,840 --> 01:53:20,119
plant you actually learn more about your

2635
01:53:16,479 --> 01:53:22,238
situp as well that yeah it's like used

2636
01:53:20,118 --> 01:53:25,279
to say Don't just grow your plant grow

2637
01:53:22,238 --> 01:53:27,198
with your plants so it's not just you

2638
01:53:25,279 --> 01:53:28,559
you learning the plant it's also your

2639
01:53:27,198 --> 01:53:31,359
plant learning your environment and

2640
01:53:28,560 --> 01:53:35,440
adapting as well yeah

2641
01:53:31,359 --> 01:53:38,118
yeah yeah very good point LEL ER any

2642
01:53:35,439 --> 01:53:39,759
lost yeah and that just to what Matt was

2643
01:53:38,118 --> 01:53:41,598
saying with the learning its environment

2644
01:53:39,760 --> 01:53:42,840
and that kind of stuff like I mean

2645
01:53:41,599 --> 01:53:44,760
that's the biggest point that I would

2646
01:53:42,840 --> 01:53:46,679
make would be honestly I mean don't

2647
01:53:44,760 --> 01:53:50,400
worry about getting clones you know what

2648
01:53:46,679 --> 01:53:53,440
I mean don't don't be so

2649
01:53:50,399 --> 01:53:56,359
stressed about getting cuts from people

2650
01:53:53,439 --> 01:53:58,879
because I think that like these dudes do

2651
01:53:56,359 --> 01:54:00,559
have work that you can find stuff that

2652
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:04,000
is on that

2653
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:06,199
level absolutely out of a c pack and I

2654
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:08,359
think that you're more than likely to

2655
01:54:06,198 --> 01:54:10,919
find something that grows better in your

2656
01:54:08,359 --> 01:54:13,238
environment that way as well you know um

2657
01:54:10,920 --> 01:54:15,840
like you get to do the selection from

2658
01:54:13,238 --> 01:54:18,678
the very beginning and I just would say

2659
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:21,599
like I just for me clones don't seem

2660
01:54:18,679 --> 01:54:24,199
like something that I'm super it's not

2661
01:54:21,599 --> 01:54:25,920
something that I'm want really just to

2662
01:54:24,198 --> 01:54:27,479
make it clear I guess we're talking

2663
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:30,000
about like clones in two different ways

2664
01:54:27,479 --> 01:54:33,158
there's like clones with uppercase c i

2665
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Elite clones that people look like

2666
01:54:33,158 --> 01:54:37,000
that's what I'm keeping clones of your

2667
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:39,078
own stuff that you're just rerunning

2668
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:41,399
right and I see yeah and I definitely

2669
01:54:39,078 --> 01:54:44,000
like I think that it's very valuable to

2670
01:54:41,399 --> 01:54:47,039
like run your stuff multiple times and

2671
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:49,960
learn it because like all these guys

2672
01:54:47,039 --> 01:54:51,880
will tell you that like that they like

2673
01:54:49,960 --> 01:54:53,198
the Clones settle in and like do

2674
01:54:51,880 --> 01:54:55,679
different things and stuff you know what

2675
01:54:53,198 --> 01:54:57,638
I mean so like it is worth spending that

2676
01:54:55,679 --> 01:54:59,599
time I'm just saying maybe just spend

2677
01:54:57,639 --> 01:55:02,118
time with something that you find cool

2678
01:54:59,599 --> 01:55:04,880
you know exactly exactly what someone

2679
01:55:02,118 --> 01:55:07,559
else finds quote unquote Elite like when

2680
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:09,760
you really find out who the guys were

2681
01:55:07,560 --> 01:55:11,119
choosing these old Elite clones the way

2682
01:55:09,760 --> 01:55:13,480
they were running their plants and you

2683
01:55:11,118 --> 01:55:16,598
see their pictures on the forums you

2684
01:55:13,479 --> 01:55:18,359
will appreciate the word elite a lot

2685
01:55:16,599 --> 01:55:20,239
differently I think and and people

2686
01:55:18,359 --> 01:55:22,519
realize man I'm way better grow in that

2687
01:55:20,238 --> 01:55:25,319
dude I'm going way better [ __ ] than them

2688
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:28,040
I'm in a way better situation uh maybe

2689
01:55:25,319 --> 01:55:30,639
what I'm choosing is more Elite to me

2690
01:55:28,039 --> 01:55:32,760
and that's that's a legit thing to say I

2691
01:55:30,639 --> 01:55:34,719
mean that that can happen a lot it's

2692
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:36,639
it's every everything is subjective when

2693
01:55:34,719 --> 01:55:39,158
it comes to what is quote unquote Elite

2694
01:55:36,639 --> 01:55:41,760
in cannabis and that's that's a big big

2695
01:55:39,158 --> 01:55:43,638
Learning lesson I want to say as well

2696
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:46,679
that oh sorry Michael I'll just quickly

2697
01:55:43,639 --> 01:55:50,239
say like there are lots of hierarchies

2698
01:55:46,679 --> 01:55:52,719
in this in this community and people

2699
01:55:50,238 --> 01:55:55,399
wanting to preserve those hierarchies

2700
01:55:52,719 --> 01:55:57,960
whether they're hierarchies of clones

2701
01:55:55,399 --> 01:56:01,000
hierarchies of breeders people are

2702
01:55:57,960 --> 01:56:03,078
fighting to preserve these weird ladders

2703
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:04,920
and often they are just mythical like

2704
01:56:03,078 --> 01:56:06,960
they're just made

2705
01:56:04,920 --> 01:56:08,760
up smoking

2706
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:12,158
mirrors sorry Michael what were you

2707
01:56:08,760 --> 01:56:14,719
gonna say I you know I I think there's

2708
01:56:12,158 --> 01:56:16,479
there's benefits to both because uh you

2709
01:56:14,719 --> 01:56:19,158
should definitely look through seeds and

2710
01:56:16,479 --> 01:56:20,718
find what you like but at the same time

2711
01:56:19,158 --> 01:56:23,000
if people talk about something that you

2712
01:56:20,719 --> 01:56:26,960
missed out on for long

2713
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:29,158
enough you know it'd be nice to try them

2714
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:31,359
you know like uh when I hear about day

2715
01:56:29,158 --> 01:56:33,679
recer and stuff like that I wasn't

2716
01:56:31,359 --> 01:56:36,598
around for that that never made it into

2717
01:56:33,679 --> 01:56:38,639
I'd never heard of it before so that's

2718
01:56:36,599 --> 01:56:41,039
something I'd want to try you know I'm

2719
01:56:38,639 --> 01:56:42,199
not saying it'd be like the elite cut

2720
01:56:41,039 --> 01:56:44,840
that I'm going to grow the rest of my

2721
01:56:42,198 --> 01:56:47,439
life I don't think there is such a thing

2722
01:56:44,840 --> 01:56:49,800
but getting to experience those things I

2723
01:56:47,439 --> 01:56:52,759
think it means a lot to you know people

2724
01:56:49,800 --> 01:56:57,320
that missed it you know I I've heard

2725
01:56:52,760 --> 01:57:00,320
about chmd and chm91 for 20 some years

2726
01:56:57,319 --> 01:57:03,158
now I want to see him like the real to

2727
01:57:00,319 --> 01:57:06,198
know the real thing is in front of me

2728
01:57:03,158 --> 01:57:08,559
you know not just uh something made up

2729
01:57:06,198 --> 01:57:11,039
you know and that's why I try to tell

2730
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:13,119
these kids so often not kids people that

2731
01:57:11,039 --> 01:57:14,960
are that are coming into the scene now

2732
01:57:13,118 --> 01:57:18,279
that like the way that you get those

2733
01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:21,039
clones you it's so hard to buy them and

2734
01:57:18,279 --> 01:57:22,359
get legitimate copies by buying them it

2735
01:57:21,039 --> 01:57:24,519
really I don't even think they're for

2736
01:57:22,359 --> 01:57:26,479
sale they're not and that's the problem

2737
01:57:24,520 --> 01:57:28,320
like if they do it's usually through a

2738
01:57:26,479 --> 01:57:29,678
back door and like you're not going to

2739
01:57:28,319 --> 01:57:30,759
get good provenance on it you're not

2740
01:57:29,679 --> 01:57:32,440
going to be able to ask someone hey did

2741
01:57:30,760 --> 01:57:33,400
you get it legit from this dude you know

2742
01:57:32,439 --> 01:57:34,598
like that's never going to happen so

2743
01:57:33,399 --> 01:57:36,719
you're never going to be able to really

2744
01:57:34,599 --> 01:57:40,679
reassure yourself taking the buying

2745
01:57:36,719 --> 01:57:42,760
route um so just be a good person and

2746
01:57:40,679 --> 01:57:44,639
make friends in the community learn [ __ ]

2747
01:57:42,760 --> 01:57:46,679
and that's how we all fell into it and

2748
01:57:44,639 --> 01:57:48,520
like everybody in our group knows like

2749
01:57:46,679 --> 01:57:50,000
[ __ ] I I put all my clones out there and

2750
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:52,000
said [ __ ] it take what you want crew

2751
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:54,599
don't give a [ __ ] like that's how it

2752
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:57,198
works but it takes a lot of trust in

2753
01:57:54,599 --> 01:57:59,480
building time sharing time with people

2754
01:57:57,198 --> 01:58:00,799
it's not about buying [ __ ] and and those

2755
01:57:59,479 --> 01:58:03,799
things are there those things are there

2756
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:06,360
to get and to be had and to try and just

2757
01:58:03,800 --> 01:58:09,279
knowing the right people and just being

had bought two packs of Chile Verde yeah

2767
01:58:32,679 --> 01:58:39,239
and uh I didn't want to pop them so I

2768
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:41,719
went and I got uh from purple City

2769
01:58:39,238 --> 01:58:44,678
genetics I got a clone of the Chile

2770
01:58:41,719 --> 01:58:48,158
Verde yeah right and I grew it out and

2771
01:58:44,679 --> 01:58:50,000
uh I sent uh is it HBK yes yeah I sent

2772

him pictures you know I was like this is

2773
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:55,039
really nice stuff and he was like oh you

2774
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:57,360
know that's not actually my cut of Chile

2775
01:58:55,039 --> 01:58:58,399
Verde that's just one they picked out

2776
01:58:57,359 --> 01:59:00,679
yeah and I was I was kind of

2777
01:58:58,399 --> 01:59:03,519
disappointed I was like huh okay then I

2778
01:59:00,679 --> 01:59:05,960
popped a pack of Chile ver I found

2779
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:08,560
something so much better than that Elite

2780
01:59:05,960 --> 01:59:11,158
that they were selling all over

2781
01:59:08,560 --> 01:59:13,560
California in that first pack where I

2782
01:59:11,158 --> 01:59:15,359
was like oh my God this is why he calls

2783
01:59:13,560 --> 01:59:17,239
it what he calls it did you find it

2784
01:59:15,359 --> 01:59:20,439
Chile ver if you know oh it was

2785
01:59:17,238 --> 01:59:23,439
beautiful his original cut dude when he

2786
01:59:20,439 --> 01:59:25,399
so good it it smelled like like carneada

2787
01:59:23,439 --> 01:59:27,678
the jili ver it it smelled exactly like

2788
01:59:25,399 --> 01:59:29,759
it and I was mind blown and every every

2789
01:59:27,679 --> 01:59:31,078
chili ver day that I smelled since is

2790
01:59:29,760 --> 01:59:33,039
someone else's selection and it's

2791
01:59:31,078 --> 01:59:35,639
nowhere near as good as his was the

2792
01:59:33,039 --> 01:59:38,078
purple City one was really sweet yeah

2793
01:59:35,639 --> 01:59:39,639
yeah yeah really not at all you know and

2794
01:59:38,078 --> 01:59:42,039
then the one I found in the seed pack

2795
01:59:39,639 --> 01:59:44,840
was just like so unique I was like holy

2796
01:59:42,039 --> 01:59:47,479
[ __ ] yeah they unique [ __ ] in

2797
01:59:44,840 --> 01:59:49,360
there okay I remember so the point I was

2798
01:59:47,479 --> 01:59:53,039
trying to make I think uh with respect

2799
01:59:49,359 --> 01:59:56,839
to what Matt was saying about how

2800
01:59:53,039 --> 01:59:58,880
you become connected and actually uh

2801
01:59:56,840 --> 02:00:01,000
create relationships with people I think

2802
01:59:58,880 --> 02:00:03,480
there's a confusion in the in the

2803
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:05,599
industry or Community where people don't

2804
02:00:03,479 --> 02:00:08,359
know if they're meant to be acting like

2805
02:00:05,599 --> 02:00:10,760
customers or like community members and

2806
02:00:08,359 --> 02:00:13,639
it's not even their fault because no

2807
02:00:10,760 --> 02:00:16,159
lots of discords or communities they are

2808
02:00:13,639 --> 02:00:18,199
like treated like customers and they

2809
02:00:16,158 --> 02:00:20,799
they become used to that and so they

2810
02:00:18,198 --> 02:00:23,519
they they have entitlements as a

2811
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:26,119
customer would feel like they might have

2812
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:28,000
um whereas once they come into a real

2813
02:00:26,118 --> 02:00:28,719
you know quote unquote real Community

2814
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:31,479
like

2815
02:00:28,719 --> 02:00:34,078
ours it's totally different you can't

2816
02:00:31,479 --> 02:00:36,519
act like that you can't just assume that

2817
02:00:34,078 --> 02:00:38,279
these are all transactional exchanges

2818
02:00:36,520 --> 02:00:41,599
and that you can just expect certain

2819
02:00:38,279 --> 02:00:43,840
things no yeah and that's why I kind of

2820
02:00:41,599 --> 02:00:45,800
say the thing about the clones and is

2821
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:50,119
just because like coming from where I'm

2822
02:00:45,800 --> 02:00:52,119
at like being an unconnected new grower

2823
02:00:50,118 --> 02:00:54,759
the best way that I could get access to

2824
02:00:52,118 --> 02:00:58,279
good wheat was to find good seeds you

2825
02:00:54,760 --> 02:01:00,000
know I mean yeah buying I I'm so

2826
02:00:58,279 --> 02:01:01,519
thankful that I didn't get into buying

2827
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:03,279
stuff and like because you just hear

2828
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:05,159
nightmares of people ruining their

2829
02:01:03,279 --> 02:01:07,399
entire grows from getting some weird

2830
02:01:05,158 --> 02:01:11,799
pest or something you know I mean and

2831
02:01:07,399 --> 02:01:11,799
that can happen you know I mean

2832
02:01:12,760 --> 02:01:17,320
Lots wait till you get a pest and you

2833
02:01:15,118 --> 02:01:20,039
torn down your room three times and you

2834
02:01:17,319 --> 02:01:22,880
keep getting it back at yeah right the

2835
02:01:20,039 --> 02:01:25,960
gift that keeps on giving bro yeah

2836
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:29,159
that's a demon right there yeah

2837
02:01:25,960 --> 02:01:31,078
yeah that's for real like the Santa Cruz

2838
02:01:29,158 --> 02:01:34,158
super M

2839
02:01:31,078 --> 02:01:36,319
yeah [ __ ] seen that thing a few times

2840
02:01:34,158 --> 02:01:39,479
bro it's like a bed bug can live in the

2841
02:01:36,319 --> 02:01:42,559
sheets for years yeah

2842
02:01:39,479 --> 02:01:44,638
right yeah me and CSI joked about the

2843
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:46,840
the spider mics that like would drink

2844
02:01:44,639 --> 02:01:49,520
floramite and like laugh at you as they

2845
02:01:46,840 --> 02:01:51,239
like chug it yeah we've seen it all dude

2846
02:01:49,520 --> 02:01:53,280
like to the point of where like it was

2847
02:01:51,238 --> 02:01:54,919
completely obsolete to even use any of

2848
02:01:53,279 --> 02:01:58,000
those harsh TS anymore because they were

2849
02:01:54,920 --> 02:02:00,319
just so like they didn't work anymore

2850
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:02,880
you had to find legit means of using

2851
02:02:00,319 --> 02:02:05,759
like real predators and stuff to kill

2852
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:10,560
