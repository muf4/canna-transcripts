1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,270
that's gonna be a fascinating book my

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:08,149
friend the sequel right so you got away

3
00:00:04,269 --> 00:00:11,149
- yeah it's like the second album it's

4
00:00:08,148 --> 00:00:13,939
like yeah great work but [ __ ] [ __ ]

5
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:17,500
that's happening now is even yeah more

6
00:00:13,939 --> 00:00:19,910
exciting so exceptional exceptional

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:25,429
there's a lot going on now which is kind

8
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:29,960
of interesting it's like this crazy flip

9
00:00:25,428 --> 00:00:32,329
between all the people who are trying to

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,370
run their small operations like we

11
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:36,230
always did in California we had we lost

12
00:00:34,369 --> 00:00:40,878
all our farms in California a few years

13
00:00:36,229 --> 00:00:44,569
ago and due to all kinds of reasons

14
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:47,808
mostly legal and zoning and all this

15
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:51,679
[ __ ] and yeah when these larger

16
00:00:47,808 --> 00:00:54,049
operations are going there seems to be a

17
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:58,579
big split in the community but for me

18
00:00:54,049 --> 00:01:00,259
I'd I'd rather work with some of those

19
00:00:58,579 --> 00:01:03,799
guys who want to do bigger operations

20
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:06,798
and then keep them real yeah I'd rather

21
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:07,819
be in it than out of it and for me

22
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,799
everybody should be able to grow

23
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:11,179
whatever the hell they like to put the

24
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:12,710
pressure on those big guys there should

25
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:13,939
be product everywhere I never want to be

26
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:17,118
able to grow whatever the hell they want

27
00:01:13,938 --> 00:01:19,879
in my opinion so you know that's that's

28
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:21,530
the only way if everyone's freaking out

29
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:24,709
about these big rows coming on the only

30
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:27,560
way is to have 70% of the production

31
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:29,978
come from small growers exactly the

32
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,939
pressure back on those people absolutely

33
00:01:29,978 --> 00:01:33,879
you have the people that have been

34
00:01:31,938 --> 00:01:37,368
making the community run the whole time

35
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:38,780
get together do a Voltron grow you know

36
00:01:37,368 --> 00:01:41,269
I mean that's that's the only way to

37
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:43,218
fight corporations is to become to

38
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:45,859
become the opposition and not

39
00:01:43,218 --> 00:01:47,658
necessarily be a be cutthroat like them

40
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:48,828
but you just do it right yourself with

41
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:50,899
the guys who have been pushing it all

42
00:01:48,828 --> 00:01:52,938
along yeah and you you're allowed to do

43
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:54,829
it and you should be allowed to do it

44
00:01:52,938 --> 00:01:56,118
but there's also that thing is you know

45
00:01:54,828 --> 00:01:58,129
you can brew you around there but who

46
00:01:56,118 --> 00:02:00,828
does right so there's a place for the

47
00:01:58,129 --> 00:02:02,449
for the other side too but it's up to

48
00:02:00,828 --> 00:02:04,218
the smaller growers to keep the bigger

49
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:07,100
growers accountable for what quality is

50
00:02:04,218 --> 00:02:08,689
absolutely they're like dinosaurs it

51
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:11,419
takes them a long time to turn around

52
00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:13,729
and move and get genetics and you know

53
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:15,169
so do

54
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:17,679
Vantage is always with the little guy as

55
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:21,979
long as they're organized you know yeah

56
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:25,580
that's kind of where I'm from you know

57
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:27,199
and even though I'm running a couple of

58
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:30,799
big green houses doesn't mean I don't

59
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:31,459
feel that and that's still where my

60
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:36,080
heart is

61
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:37,640
I bet I'd also be nuts not to take that

62
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,290
opportunity to run those big green

63
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:41,659
houses just for the ability to grow our

64
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:43,098
seeds from you guys camera all those

65
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:45,348
other guys you know and then helping

66
00:02:43,098 --> 00:02:48,318
that breeding process and then pass

67
00:02:45,348 --> 00:02:50,030
those cuts back yeah I don't know if I

68
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:52,429
told you but I'm gonna be bringing a

69
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:54,829
bunch of rare African strains that

70
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:57,290
haven't been haven't been grown like

71
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:59,060
outside of Africa a lot of people you

72
00:02:57,289 --> 00:03:00,378
know have the Malawi's and the same

73
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,848
strains of Malawi that have been passed

74
00:03:00,378 --> 00:03:03,530
around but I have a lot of different

75
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,909
stuff I'm bringing out there I've been

76
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:07,068
sitting on for a long time because I

77
00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:08,870
have zero outdoor space and I want them

78
00:03:07,068 --> 00:03:10,219
to be able to grow where they're

79
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:12,289
happiest that's that's the most

80
00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:15,109
important thing and you do such great

81
00:03:12,289 --> 00:03:17,389
cultivation out there and and I think

82
00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:20,299
that's a place for them so their years

83
00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:23,479
to grow when you want you know well I

84
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:26,239
mean there's you know the R&amp;D space that

85
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:28,818
we have with camera and my friend Gordon

86
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:32,419
Danna elephant head farm you know it's

87
00:03:28,818 --> 00:03:34,039
he's all into it he's the guy who helped

88
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:37,939
write some of the laws that the better

89
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:40,519
side of the laws in Arizona he's the

90
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:43,848
best guy you'll ever meet in any three

91
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:45,259
anywhere in the world and he wants to

92
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:47,659
grow a bunch of seeds he wants us to

93
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:49,310
make a bunch of seeds and he's been

94
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:51,709
throwing colloidal silver around for 40

95
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:54,560
years he's like he's made crosses of

96
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:56,269
Swasey Zand pure tires and pure Hayes's

97
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,030
that we made back in the late 90s and

98
00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:00,079
he's like eight generations in he still

99
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,669
doesn't know what he's doing but the

100
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:03,230
stuffs great it's like that's amazing

101
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:05,840
it's like one of those people you know

102
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:08,030
so he he's a really good person in

103
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,098
Arizona that we can do research in it's

104
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:12,829
also where we can make seeds to that's

105
00:04:10,098 --> 00:04:14,179
so amazing yeah that's where the heart

106
00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:16,280
is and that's where we'll put that stuff

107
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:18,889
that's beautiful that's where it needs

108
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:20,448
to go man I mean I could I think they're

109
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:22,370
right here but I could it just wouldn't

110
00:04:20,449 --> 00:04:23,629
be happy there there'd be no point in it

111
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:26,000
I couldn't see it at its best

112
00:04:23,629 --> 00:04:27,409
expressions and it would get lost and it

113
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
would be selfish and

114
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:31,210
overall I think it would be selfish for

115
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,889
me to grow it in try to grow it indoors

116
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:35,089
and not be happy I'd be selfish to the

117
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:37,219
whole wheat world so let's get that out

118
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:39,500
there I think it's off yeah now that

119
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:42,440
would be amazing and it's also I mean

120
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:46,250
all these genetics it's it's I mean I'm

121
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:49,300
helping on four or five operations here

122
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:51,769
and there and every single one needs

123
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,360
they have different clearances right

124
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:55,819
like how special is the genetics do I

125
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,830
want to put them there you know I mean

126
00:04:55,819 --> 00:05:00,019
and the ones I get all the special ones

127
00:04:57,829 --> 00:05:02,029
are the real dance earth the real guys

128
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:03,409
you know absolutely because they don't

129
00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:05,119
even want the the corpora guys don't

130
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:08,720
even want that other stuff no absolutely

131
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,189
juice you know so it's really kind of

132
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,580
important to put the right stuff in the

133
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:15,319
right place and that's kind of where our

134
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:18,469
angle still is you know like keeping it

135
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:19,639
real so yeah I see sure bin skis in here

136
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:22,700
that's awesome

137
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:24,110
he's probably the only guy I got if I'm

138
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:26,149
being honest he's the only guy I have a

139
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:27,530
ton of respect from that is involved

140
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:29,209
with the cookie guys he's the only one

141
00:05:27,529 --> 00:05:30,769
doing real work out of those guys and I

142
00:05:29,209 --> 00:05:32,479
have a lot of respect for that dude so

143
00:05:30,769 --> 00:05:40,519
that's really cool bigger I mean a jig

144
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:49,430
or two I think so you know I have a

145
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:50,899
magical yet thing that both it's an

146
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:54,610
amazing opportunity I mean I've got that

147
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:56,839
cookie clone really really early on yeah

148
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:59,330
it's like yeah you put this in your

149
00:05:56,839 --> 00:06:05,689
green eise's and you'll have no problem

150
00:05:59,329 --> 00:06:08,300
you know right yeah and it's it's very

151
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:10,430
easy to grow and I think that's what's

152
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,800
been a major appeal to it even the shirt

153
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:14,480
the gelato all that stuff's really easy

154
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,000
to grow but exceptional and the resin

155
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,200
production is next-level yeah yeah

156
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,949
nonsense

157
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:24,949
there's no pistols to rot in my MIDI

158
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:26,990
that's like exactly solid known as long

159
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:29,779
as long as you you're able to like you

160
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:31,160
see the inside of the flowers you know

161
00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:32,899
that's that's the only thing like boots

162
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,229
on that monsoon season here it's like I

163
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:37,668
have to be yeah not have anything hiding

164
00:06:36,228 --> 00:06:40,189
inside any flower that I don't know

165
00:06:37,668 --> 00:06:41,299
what's in it you know so during monsoon

166
00:06:40,189 --> 00:06:42,889
it's the case of

167
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,560
I'm only gonna grow stuff I can look

168
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:48,589
inside absolutely about patients don't

169
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:51,519
get a surprise yeah the cookies no geez

170
00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:54,169
are off the menu for 12 weeks and then

171
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:58,099
full force again so we're doing a bunch

172
00:06:54,170 --> 00:07:01,069
of Nigerians a bunch of Hayes's bunch of

173
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:05,660
easier cycle we have like 13 weeks of

174
00:07:01,069 --> 00:07:07,430
solid sativa runs that'll be amazing all

175
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:10,100
selection you know all our own selection

176
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:12,199
systems that'll be [ __ ] amazing

177
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,700
so back in back in Amsterdam what was

178
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,779
what were some of the first strange you

179
00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:16,699
were crying when you were when you're

180
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:23,029
out there and and just getting into

181
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:26,839
growing I used to grow and do other

182
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:29,539
stuff cannabis early nineties but the

183
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:34,219
cannabis college in 97 we mostly worked

184
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:38,180
with all the skunk man's F ones which we

185
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:41,570
later developed first serious weed stuff

186
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:46,730
was there some Adams THC psycho Martha

187
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:48,740
Toni stuff we had a show gross everybody

188
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:52,700
had a little section you know 50 plants

189
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:54,530
in the garden and a big steak next to it

190
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:58,810
which which Heath company came from and

191
00:07:54,529 --> 00:08:01,389
we plant 30 seeds of each variety and

192
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:03,439
people would go for a tour and then

193
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:05,000
they'd go across the street to buy the

194
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:08,990
seeds because they'd see a grown from

195
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,990
seed I won the most inch more

196
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:15,710
interesting ones were we cross all the

197
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:20,689
scum and stuff with with all the

198
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:25,849
different Ingram eyes widows Oh like a

199
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:27,259
super widow line I bet there were there

200
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:29,750
was some pretty interesting stuff like

201
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:33,350
that original pays with that white widow

202
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:36,470
came I like 50% resin wait no yield by

203
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:39,680
50% resin way I bet you know the really

204
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:41,899
nice Terps and so that was for me

205
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,089
interesting at the time and then all the

206
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:46,429
FFTs and stuff as well from Dave stuff

207
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:48,350
was good herb has a question for you

208
00:08:46,429 --> 00:08:50,529
what is the best strain you've ever

209
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:54,730
grown that's a hard question I'm sure

210
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:54,730
anything pops the forefront

211
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:01,820
depends where I was maybe it's you're

212
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:04,130
partial to I like I like an hour five

213
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:06,920
days skunks I mean we developed our

214
00:09:04,129 --> 00:09:10,149
online of it you had the super Silver

215
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:10,149
Haze we have the Jack Herer

216
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:18,980
sings a legend there in every now and

217
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:20,659
again a cut came out paying cut so my

218
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:22,550
dream was always anybody who had beef

219
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:24,799
I'm gonna get you know a couple of

220
00:09:22,549 --> 00:09:27,109
hundred of their seeds three-way seeds

221
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:28,909
and then just rework them and cross them

222
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:31,190
together like Ingham eyes white widow

223
00:09:28,909 --> 00:09:33,639
Scots white widow will be like across

224
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:38,450
them together I'm healing some beef a

225
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:39,980
silver thing right yeah you know so I

226
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:42,770
kind of like that but that's always been

227
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:45,320
my go-to that three-way really yeah I

228
00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:46,789
remember delta nine labs did some stuff

229
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,170
with their fruit of the gods if I

230
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:50,569
remember correctly there was another

231
00:09:48,169 --> 00:09:52,370
stunt or light haze and I found some

232
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:54,170
they're like I ran a shitload of those

233
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:56,269
but there were two or three females in

234
00:09:54,169 --> 00:09:58,370
there that were [ __ ] exceptional that

235
00:09:56,269 --> 00:09:59,960
stood out among the rest and that

236
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:02,629
combination just seems to bring winners

237
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:04,910
yeah you never you never forget those

238
00:10:02,629 --> 00:10:06,350
though yes there's something about him

239
00:10:04,909 --> 00:10:08,360
it still bugs me to this day

240
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:12,200
because I mean Eddie got robbed at

241
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:25,370
gunpoint and they took like 55 gallons

242
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:27,110
worth of seeds yes so now you know bunch

243
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:30,889
of other guys collecting a whole bunch

244
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:33,019
of new yeah I still have some of the old

245
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:35,000
Northern Lights Brown caves but they're

246
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:39,860
the German Airy germination rates kind

247
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,870
of [ __ ] but I'll bring them yeah yeah if

248
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:43,009
we pull it all together and put it all

249
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:45,710
on the table and we're all sitting

250
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:48,730
around the table we can start looking at

251
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:50,839
it and having a giggle you know like

252
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:53,420
create these different lines and stuff

253
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:55,130
so yeah pretty cool I think you know

254
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:57,649
something's going to come out of this oh

255
00:10:55,129 --> 00:10:59,240
yeah I can't wait I really can't wait to

256
00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:02,208
go to the facility and hang out with you

257
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,769
guys for a few days and get to see it

258
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:07,789
all and play around and learn from each

259
00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:09,230
other yeah any time any time and there's

260
00:11:07,789 --> 00:11:13,329
a couple of states to pick from that

261
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:16,149
stuff that's so crazy

262
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:18,379
cool I'll go go fly my drone again

263
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:19,639
thanks for coming on short it's an

264
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:22,100
absolute honor and an honor

265
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:24,669
yeah great shouting would you alright

266
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,670
talk to you soon

267
00:11:26,528 --> 00:11:31,759
so thanks to short for coming on any

268
00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:34,039
time he comes on does exceptional that

269
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:35,899
was the first time and in fact guys a

270
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:38,120
repository of knowledge absolute

271
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:40,220
repository of knowledge and the amount

272
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,659
of hands-on work that he experiences

273
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:47,319
with all these different strains is a

274
00:11:43,659 --> 00:11:49,909
fork next level my theory on that

275
00:11:47,318 --> 00:11:52,939
hermaphroditism in strains today I think

276
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:54,559
it's more to do with a mass amount of

277
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,889
new growers not quite knowing what

278
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:59,568
they're getting into not quite knowing

279
00:11:56,889 --> 00:12:02,419
how to feed plants going with bottle

280
00:11:59,568 --> 00:12:04,039
schedules and all that [ __ ] I'd love to

281
00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:06,909
bring sure bond is he still in here I

282
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:10,490
would [ __ ] love to bring sure bond

283
00:12:06,909 --> 00:12:11,958
yeah but I think it has more to do with

284
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:14,980
new growers not knowing how to feed

285
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:16,939
plants feeding them like tomatoes and

286
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,680
just really not knowing what direction

287
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:21,279
they're going and also being the

288
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:24,439
majority of the people who are growing

289
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:26,179
you don't hear a lot of older growers

290
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,899
bitching about firms because we just

291
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:28,879
deal with it

292
00:12:26,899 --> 00:12:30,500
you know that we realize that's part of

293
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:33,289
growing you know something's not happy

294
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,669
in our environment we either acclimate

295
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:38,088
it because it's really special and we

296
00:12:34,669 --> 00:12:40,278
know that or we just move on and toss it

297
00:12:38,089 --> 00:12:42,019
and it's just whatever you know hook if

298
00:12:40,278 --> 00:12:43,068
you see a herd of happen it's usually

299
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:45,560
because of something to do with the

300
00:12:43,068 --> 00:12:47,599
environment or how it's being fed any of

301
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:50,599
that expression almost everything can be

302
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,220
acclimated to not herb whereas like

303
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,959
autoflowering traits and stuff like that

304
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:57,170
that's a that for me that's a sure toss

305
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:59,388
you know but yeah I mean I've seen I've

306
00:12:57,169 --> 00:13:01,610
seen some companies get just scalped

307
00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:04,938
over the years scalped and raked of the

308
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:07,089
Hearn thing and it's usually the ones

309
00:13:04,938 --> 00:13:07,088
who
