leading was 3 000 a month don't worry

47
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:29,519
I'm goings uh slightly less because we

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,919
bought so it's 2300 roughly a little bit

49
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,959
more but not much

50
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,878
um it's a lot smaller in this place as

51
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,580
far as the house but the property's big

52
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:41,818
so kind of stoked on that

53
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:44,160

55
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:50,818
be covering

56
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:52,560
The Forum era post 2006 which really was

57
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:56,280
I mean I chose that because that's when

58
00:02:52,560 --> 00:03:01,199
I come in so mostly the tail end of

59
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:03,000
overgrow uh cannabis World little bit uh

60
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:04,679
I don't remember when Planet ganja

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,280
dipped out

62
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,379
some grass City troll it up

63
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,180
um

64
00:03:10,378 --> 00:03:14,179
pot pimp trichome Kings

65
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,840
farter

66
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:21,839
stuff like that there's a CD post stuff

67
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:23,878
that uh I see mag of course

68
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,158
there's a big point to it too and and

69
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:27,539
it's that a lot of people like that

70
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:29,579
weren't around during the forums it's

71
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:32,280
really easy to tell who they are and the

72
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,959
ones that pretend like they were it's

73
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,939
also really easy to tell that they were

74
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,219
because or that they weren't because

75
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:39,780
they only reference the ones that are

76
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:43,259
still up and only quote the forms that

77
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,479
are still up which is a very very

78
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:46,798
I can't I can't mention that one so Rob

79
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:49,439
since it's private I don't want to

80
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,299
mention it trying to follow rules on

81
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,519
that one but um

82
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:54,900
yeah I mean if people try to post stuff

83
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,360
all the time but you're only seeing a

84
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,879
brief glimpse of what happened back then

85
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,280
some of the most salacious [ __ ]

86
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:04,979
horrible [ __ ] went down on on sites like

87
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,900
C Depot where a lot of people started

88
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:08,280
popping up a lot of people that are

89
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,920
selling seeds started pucking up on seed

90
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,019
Depot and I'm sure they are super stoked

91
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:14,518
that you can't find that [ __ ] but we do

92
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:16,680
have the way back machine and I actually

93
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:18,798
haven't tested that for C Depot so we'll

94
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,799
see

95
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:25,079
yeah uh ganja Planet ganja was on um

96
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:27,839
Wayback machine as well but uh only

97
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:30,060
certain threads were it was really hard

98
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:32,839
to find any consistency in why certain

99
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,839
things were or not

100
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:40,019
oh here we go it was not so

101
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:43,079

104
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:47,779

fantastic yeah so I was just telling

118
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,079
everyone we're going to be going over

119
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:26,100
the Forum era post overgrow so 2006

120
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:28,500
roughly and on and uh I was explaining

121
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,060
how there are a lot of forums still up

122
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,560
that we're around during that time like

123
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:33,839
the farm

124
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,459
um I see mag

125
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,918
troll it up some of the some of the

126
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:40,019
others that came around that time

127
00:05:37,918 --> 00:05:42,120
um but there are a lot that are not up

128
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:44,099
and people that like to pretend that

129
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,720
they're around back then

130
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,400
often reference the ones that are still

131
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,139
up that they can go back and like reread

132
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:50,758
and pretend like hey I was I was there I

133
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:52,918
knew it was going on but they're missing

134
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:54,180
like 90 of the conversations that were

135
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:56,758
going on because those aren't even

136
00:05:54,180 --> 00:06:00,300
accessible any longer one of one of the

137
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:01,319
things I notice about that era uh is

138
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,660
that

139
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:05,579
you know a lot of times we catch people

140
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,979
on stuff

141
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:11,639
um because people go back to [ __ ]

142
00:06:07,978 --> 00:06:13,439
yes and they read uh you know threads

143
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:15,720
and things like that to pick up years

144
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,939
and tidbits and information that like

145
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:22,319
make their their stories sound better

146
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:25,439
yeah but they weren't there to know who

147
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:28,080
was who or like who to take seriously or

148
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:30,360
what was misinformation even then yeah

149
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:32,538
you know and so a lot of times it's a

150
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,538
tell

151
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:37,318
it's a big tell but to someone that

152
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:40,079
never read any of those forums you can

153
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:42,840
come out and confidently start jabbing

154
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:45,899
about a bunch of stuff yeah and sound

155
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:47,758
like you were there yeah um not I'm not

156
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:49,859
gonna say anybody's name but uh someone

157
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,620
made a post the other day that obviously

158
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:56,160
was not around on the forums and said

159
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:59,340
you know X person got cloned from y

160
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:03,539
person got cloned from Z person and it

161
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:06,959
was just super off like the most off it

162
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:09,180
could be I mean we I'm Matt's learning

163
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:11,159
from me I try we try not to name names

164
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:14,639
when it's not but it was pretty funny

165
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,860
the chain of custody yeah that was

166
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,418
asserted

167
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:20,400
you know you you just had you just had

168
00:07:18,418 --> 00:07:22,258
to laugh at a certain point but yeah I

169
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:26,279
will say even back then

170
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:27,780
like uh you know I don't know exactly

171
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:30,538
know how to describe it but I would say

172
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:33,418
that like like overgrow even had some of

173
00:07:30,538 --> 00:07:34,259
the best commentary but also some of the

174
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:36,659
worst

175
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:38,520
like you kind of the forums really

176
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,439
helped figuring out what you were doing

177
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:42,659
if you already went in there with some

178
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:45,180
connection and some ability to discern

179
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,560
yeah you know cannabis world was a

180
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,199
little bit more like where the adults

181
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,839
gathered yeah uh over a girl you could

182
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,000
have like everyone from like some 17

183
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:55,500
year old kid [ __ ] posting you even

184
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,098
though we didn't use that term back then

185
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:01,978
yeah to like Chimera and Sam Skunk Man

186
00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:03,598
and phds and breeding talking [ __ ] in

187
00:08:01,978 --> 00:08:06,060
another in another area

188
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:07,978
yeah so it really was like a

189
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,978
cross-section of weed in America

190
00:08:07,978 --> 00:08:12,538
my main my main thing would be like I

191
00:08:10,978 --> 00:08:16,139
would compare that to like grass City

192
00:08:12,538 --> 00:08:17,879
from my era grass City and um roll it up

193
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:20,160
we always call it a troll it up but

194
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:21,418
those two were like what everybody would

195
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,400
say like that's where everybody

196
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:24,240
everybody had an account on those pretty

197
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:27,179
much because that's where everybody

198
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,098
started during that era and then slowly

199
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:32,339
you'd see people migrate but then those

200
00:08:29,098 --> 00:08:34,500
the ones that hung out in that area kind

201
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:36,479
of never really seemed to go anywhere as

202
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,820
far as their knowledge or making any

203
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,399
Headway with anything really that's how

204
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,560
I saw it yeah I mean and you know it it

205
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:45,778
should be said too that like you know

206
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:47,458
there was different different forums had

207
00:08:45,778 --> 00:08:49,500
different

208
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:51,479
I don't know different ethics maybe is

209
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,700
the best way to put it yeah you know

210
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,339
some some were more lightly moderated

211
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:58,019
and things got left up

212
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:00,120
um you know obviously like hate speech

213
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:01,560
and and various other aspects was was

214
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,139
eliminated

215
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:06,659
um you know or but a lot of times you

216
00:09:04,139 --> 00:09:08,580
know unlike IG or whatever

217
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:11,039
um you know if you didn't like the

218
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,778
threads got let they might get locked if

219
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:15,480
arguments got too heated but they would

220
00:09:12,778 --> 00:09:17,879
typically be left yeah where in today's

221
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:21,600
environment on IG a lot of times people

222
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:23,759
just get rid of it yeah oh yeah they'll

223
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,040
just it's all it's all uh what do you

224
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:27,778
call that curated it's all curated as

225
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:29,099
soon as it starts going off the rails or

226
00:09:27,778 --> 00:09:31,439
as soon as they start seeing information

227
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,120
they don't want out there yeah um

228
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,740
they'll just delete comments or they'll

229
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,919
delete the whole thread or they'll turn

230
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,600
off comments yeah right away

231
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:41,458
um you know and then you know I see mag

232
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,639
you know there was you know there was an

233
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:46,259
In Crowd and an out crowd

234
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:48,720
you know definitely that was the up

235
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:50,879
crowd I I think I had a record

236
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,820
um for being the person most banned from

237
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:55,500
every forum and it it I think that I

238
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,120
mean I even had my own forums back in

239
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,360
the day that people rocked on you know

240
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,220
it got bad I mean it was interesting in

241
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,200
the sense that like in the beginning an

242
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,540
overgrown cannabis world and stuff I was

243
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,399
super excited and I got on there to

244
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,899
share information without with a bunch

245
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,580
of people

246
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:15,179
um and then you know but I was always

247
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:17,040
nervous about doing any kind like you

248
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:18,958
know I lived in Mendo or whatever so I

249
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:21,539
didn't really need to like meet new weed

250
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:24,359
people yeah but I liked learning what

251
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:26,278
other people far away knew yeah but a

252
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,959
lot of people used it in the DMS to

253
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:29,580
trade clones and do all this type of

254
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:31,799
stuff I never really did that I was more

255
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,959
like an in-person kind of kind of guy

256
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:35,579
yeah um and then when obviously When

257
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:38,639
Heaven Stairway got in trouble and they

258
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:40,320
shut all that down yeah I got scared

259
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,819
so

260
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,540
um you know this era that we're going to

261
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:49,680
talk about like 2006 on it really is CSI

262
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:51,240
and Matt's era yeah it really is where

263
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:52,979
you know I might have been lurking a

264
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,299
little bit and poking around here and

265
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,800
there

266
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:57,419
um and even some other friends of ours

267
00:10:55,799 --> 00:11:00,240
that aren't going to join like uh our

268
00:10:57,419 --> 00:11:01,559
buddy high and Lonesome oh yeah yeah you

269
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,539
know there there were some people that

270
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:06,119
were that were extremely active in that

271
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:08,278
area sure and know a lot of the the who

272
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,278
you know who was who was a jackass who

273
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:14,578
who was kind uh who was a problem back

274
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:16,320
then you know where stuff came from

275
00:11:14,578 --> 00:11:18,539
and one of the interesting things about

276
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,778
weed is that it reinvents itself every

277
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:23,759
five or ten years yeah so you get all

278
00:11:21,778 --> 00:11:26,519
these new people coming in and people

279
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:29,278
get to Rebrand themselves yeah now it's

280
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:31,919
happening every six months it seems yeah

281
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:34,500
well it's modern fast turnover yeah

282
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:36,000
modern marketing I mentioned that I

283
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,578
mentioned this before but it was kind of

284
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,919
like what the uh what the old deadheads

285
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:43,439
told me about how dead tour used to be

286
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:45,919
before the Grateful Dead had Touch of

287
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:49,560
Gray a big hit yeah where it was small

288
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:52,199
everybody knew kind of got vetted in you

289
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:53,159
know things didn't change that much and

290
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,820
then

291
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:59,578
um you know oh my God Big Ups to Danimal

292
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:01,920
okay so then and then and then there was

293
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:03,958
a top they had a top ten hit and

294
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:07,078
literally hundreds of thousands of new

295
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:09,000
people showed up yeah and how do you

296
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:10,139
assimilate them into your community that

297
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,860
fast

298
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:15,600
yeah thank you yeah you know it becomes

299
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,039
difficult so a lot of times like

300
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,420
Old-Timers or whatever they feel

301
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:20,278
overwhelmed

302
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:22,319
yeah because like the Norms of their

303
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:24,240
community and what they could expect you

304
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,579
know and instead of being like a

305
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,980
respected Elder somebody's like who the

306
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:32,219
[ __ ] is this guy yeah why do I have to

307
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:34,019
listen to you yeah you know where before

308
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:37,019
when it was smaller like those people

309
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:38,759
might have had respect yeah yeah it's a

310
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:41,039
much it did get very different and I

311
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:43,860
want to say it wasn't quite at cookies

312
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:45,480
where everything took a big swing but it

313
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,159
wasn't much long after cookies came

314
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,778
around that that the Forum the whole

315
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:49,980
idea of forms kind of changed but I

316
00:12:48,778 --> 00:12:52,379
think that also had to do with Instagram

317
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,778
which is also why cookies kind of even

318
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:56,220
got even more blown up I think uh social

319
00:12:54,778 --> 00:12:58,620
media

320
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:01,800
um yeah the kind of the difference

321
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:04,759
between the I would say the forums were

322
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:07,979
mostly writing with some pictures

323
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:10,860
where Instagram flipped it 180 degrees

324
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:13,500
to being almost all pictures with a

325
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:15,539
little bit of writing yeah so you see

326
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,399
some of these old write-ups that people

327
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:20,039
have and their paragraphs and you know

328
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:22,799
they're like a small essay yeah

329
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:25,379
right where people ask me stuff all the

330
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:26,639
time on IG and it's really hard because

331
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:29,458
it's like what are you going to write a

332
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,539
novel in the comments yeah yeah it kind

333
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:31,979
of looks like you're trying to write

334
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:34,620
something that's like this long like

335
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:37,440
what can I yeah it's like a haiku yes

336
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:39,240
how can I get my my thing across in like

337
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,459
you know x amount of syllables or four

338
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,200
sentences yeah yeah you kind of have to

339
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:44,578
especially if you're on Twitter right

340
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,019
and then and then you end up and then

341
00:13:44,578 --> 00:13:48,000
you end up leaving on a lot of nuance

342
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:49,679
and detail we're on the Forum era people

343
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,679
could like write three or four

344
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:54,479
paragraphs each back and forth and some

345
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:56,399
like empty could write really really

346
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:01,079
just

347
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:02,940
bad really bad un illegible stuff for

348
00:14:01,078 --> 00:14:05,519
paragraphs and paragraphs I mean when

349
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:08,579
you write paragraphs you really realize

350
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,919
why we invented punctuation yeah yeah

351
00:14:08,578 --> 00:14:13,159
for sure you know why we invented

352
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:16,319
paragraphs in the first place spacing

353
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:18,299
periods commas all the various aspects

354
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,800
it really helps because yeah you know

355
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:22,019
one one of the things that hurts you

356
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:25,078
online is that

357
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:26,639
um Nuance gets lost yeah it does are you

358
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:28,739
being sarcastic

359
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,000
yeah being funny what's your body

360
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,579
language

361
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,019
you know all those types of things

362
00:14:32,578 --> 00:14:36,179
you know

363
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:37,860
um yeah that was actually a good point

364
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:39,719
um you know in the overgrow era digital

365
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:42,360
cameras

366
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:44,820
um you know didn't exist yeah

367
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,278
I mean I was talking I was actually

368
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,720
talking about that in the in the one

369
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:50,338
that you missed because you were you

370
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,860
know you were otherwise occupied where

371
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:55,139
it was like people documenting their

372
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:57,419
stuff really Advanced a lot more when

373
00:14:55,139 --> 00:15:00,659
digital cameras came out oh yeah and

374
00:14:57,419 --> 00:15:02,819
then exponentially wants uh phones had

375
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:05,278
cameras yeah once phones had cameras

376
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:07,920
it's all bets off the era where you had

377
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:10,198
to get your own stuff developed

378
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:12,419
that's unsadly it's not oh yeah I can

379
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:15,000
only imagine it's not very documented I

380
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:16,319
mean I was at I was at csi's house I

381
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,639
don't know half a year ago or something

382
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,240
like that we were looking through a

383
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:24,899
couple of boxes of his um uh Polaroids

384
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,419
right yeah but they fade yeah that okay

385
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:28,620
that sucks

386
00:15:26,419 --> 00:15:30,719
you know and maybe if he would have kept

387
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,220
them in some kind of like a perfectly

388
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,959
sealed environment with the right

389
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,940
humidity or something like that you know

390
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:39,299
but yeah you're looking at Polaroids

391
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:41,220
from 95 or six or seven or whatever and

392
00:15:39,299 --> 00:15:42,838
a lot of them the colors are bleeding

393
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,100
into each other and it's hard to make

394
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:48,180
it's not

395
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:50,639
it's not you know it's not shark yeah

396
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:52,078
you know yeah that sucks that sucks bad

397
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,000
I would have never guessed that until he

398
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:56,458
told me that yeah I mean you know he's

399
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,078
got a couple shoe boxes full yeah and I

400
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:59,458
was busting his chops to get him [ __ ]

401
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:00,838
scanned I was like you got to get those

402
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,458
scanned at least for history he's like

403
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:05,220
don't do any good

404
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:08,698
I mean I you know I had my I had my my

405
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:10,500
uh my first daughter in 09 you know and

406
00:16:08,698 --> 00:16:12,719
I think and I can look back on my phone

407
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:15,600
I think you know the first real camera

408
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:18,360
on an iPhone came out in 08

409
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,839
oh wow wow I don't remember yeah later

410
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:24,300
wait you know and and that's kind of

411
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:26,040
that that was a revolution in itself oh

412
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:27,240
I'm sure because then you can just pull

413
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:28,980
it out of your pocket and be like

414
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,480
there's my weed plant click

415
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,800
it's always amazing that with all these

416
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,920
cell phones we don't really see many

417
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:36,778
like real documented UFO picks I know

418
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:38,039
I'm it's kind of off tangent but I just

419
00:16:36,778 --> 00:16:41,820
thought about that

420
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:43,679
well I will say as a as as a you know

421
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,600
somebody who's pulled a lot of tarps in

422
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:46,859
their day

423
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,778
that you know a lot of times when you

424
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,940
pull tarp on you you're doing light

425
00:16:48,778 --> 00:16:53,278
depth you're you're pulling tarp at six

426
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:55,440
or seven o'clock at night right yeah and

427
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:57,838
then you go back out there after dark

428
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,600
which in June might be 9 30 or 10

429
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,040
o'clock at night right so pull the tarp

430
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,778
off so everything can breathe because

431
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:05,578
you only want to darken it for as much

432
00:17:03,778 --> 00:17:07,318
as you need to right oh yeah and you

433
00:17:05,578 --> 00:17:09,779
don't want to trap in all that moisture

434
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:11,279
and all that right so you got to go out

435
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:14,039
there and you know Mendo or whatever in

436
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:15,660
the woods and sometimes I would see the

437
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:20,220
most beautiful Skies the most beautiful

438
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:23,040
moons just yeah and your phone could not

439
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:25,439
show you what my eyes could see oh yeah

440
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:28,019
for sure I would take I would take you

441
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,640
know pictures and you know and it would

442
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:31,980
just never and I'd go online and look

443
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,620
how do I take better night photos yeah

444
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:37,259
and it's just not a camera with like a

445
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:40,199
nice lens and you know the ability to

446
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:41,940
like you know it's just not it's just

447
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,080
meant to show dicks and tits that's all

448
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,840
you're supposed to be taking pictures of

449
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:47,339
fellas ladies you know and yeah and so

450
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:49,079
you know there's there's an aspect to

451
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:51,359
that where it's like I can bet like if

452
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:53,159
you can't see like nobody can imagine

453
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:57,000
how beautiful this full Moon is tonight

454
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:58,980
yeah and you can't capture that well

455
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,419
how are you gonna capture like I'm sure

456
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:03,200
there's like this is there's a weird

457
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:03,200
thing in the sky

458
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:08,639
blue you know especially back in 08 or

459
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:11,820
09 how am I going to pull out my two or

460
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,220
two and a half megapixel camera yeah on

461
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:15,359
my phone yeah and I'm gonna like capture

462
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,480
it

463
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:21,359
no you know it took a long time for

464
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,400
phones to even begin to catch up to like

465
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:26,519
what 35 millimeter could do you're

466
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:29,580
busting my skeptical comments not so

467
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:33,418
you know refreshing my skepticism

468
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:35,819
I fully believe that there are aliens

469
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:37,380
I just disbelieve most people that tell

470
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:40,500
try to tell me a bunch of facts about

471
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:42,840
them yeah yeah that's I'm sure there are

472
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:46,380
I just don't know if they've ever been

473
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:48,298
near Earth you know like I I have I that

474
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:50,340
that's where my skepticism comes in when

475
00:18:48,298 --> 00:18:52,500
people start writing getting like very

476
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:54,359
long YouTubes about all kinds of

477
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:57,599
specifics you know yeah

478
00:18:54,359 --> 00:19:00,000
I get weird yeah yeah I mean

479
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:01,439
I'll say this you know and then Caleb

480
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
and then he's officially [ __ ] late

481
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,620
yeah but

482
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,500
um [ __ ] you know when we were talking

483
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:09,058
about the the early the early 2000s or

484
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,400
whatever I you know I did that whole

485
00:19:09,058 --> 00:19:15,178
episode when you weren't here yeah I was

486
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:17,160
hunting so hard for old stuff then stuff

487
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:20,340
from the 80s stuff from the 70s hell

488
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:22,980
even stuff from some of the 90s yeah and

489
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:25,678
it was a royal [ __ ] and nobody cared

490
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:27,480
about it and I and I searched for years

491
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,559
and years and years and you know like we

492
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,679

so yeah we were just talking about

515
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:32,819
um the different the you know what was

516
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:34,979
kind of going around post 2006 it was

517
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:37,678
the end of the overgrow era end of the

518
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:39,120
Cannabis World era and maybe maybe uh

519
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,059
you could talk about some of the things

520
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:44,759
that you saw during those those uh that

521
00:20:42,058 --> 00:20:46,558
integral period between the end of

522
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:48,298
overgrow and the beginning of things

523
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:49,558
like the farm

524
00:20:48,298 --> 00:20:51,359
foreign

525
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:53,160
what kind of what kind of strains were

526
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:56,519
people [ __ ] with around then what was

527
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:58,980
the hot [ __ ] uh are are you talking

528
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:01,740
about like 06 on

529
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:03,538
oh six to like 006 to 08 somewhere in

530
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:05,460
there yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean I think

531
00:21:03,538 --> 00:21:08,400
that's when chemdog really started

532
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:11,460
becoming popular yeah

533
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:14,220
um chemd uh came out I I think I

534
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:17,940
honestly think that that's the year uh

535
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:21,900
you know Mass G uh posted up on icy mag

536
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:24,298
although yeah that threat is gone oh is

537
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:26,519
that thread gone I did my research I

538
00:21:24,298 --> 00:21:27,900
think it's like is that the the creation

539
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:30,779
of sour D1

540
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,620
no no that was the overgrow that was

541
00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:34,678
okay

542
00:21:31,619 --> 00:21:38,759
so yeah that that's well long gone

543
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:41,159
unless somebody has a archives yeah who

544
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:43,500
would have that [ __ ] I don't know

545
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:45,419
so do you remember like around overgrow

546
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,740
what kind of the strains uh what kind of

547
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:48,780
strains were mostly popular around that

548
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:50,279
time like in the in that end of overgrow

549
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:53,579

577
00:23:09,298 --> 00:23:17,460
um real reversal in o6 the intentional

578
00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:19,980
reversal intentional reversal I

579
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:22,200
got one reversal where you know I took a

580
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:26,759
bunch of pollen from that Urkel back in

581
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:28,500
like 304 and uh yeah yeah that was oh

582
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:33,240
304.

583
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:35,038
um and uh pollinated a bunch of stuff on

584
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:37,380
purpose yeah

585
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:40,619
but that that was just that freak thing

586
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:42,600
so yeah now it's counted up it can't it

587
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:45,418
kind of counts it counts it does count

588
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:47,579
it was with intention yeah yeah I mean

589
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:50,520
they're they're I did have some friends

590
00:23:47,579 --> 00:23:52,500
that I mean we didn't use I didn't we

591
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:54,359
didn't know anything about any of the

592
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:57,058
any of the chems you could spray on

593
00:23:54,359 --> 00:24:00,479
Plants but people used to try to torture

594
00:23:57,058 --> 00:24:02,460
their plants to get them to free if it

595
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,380
was if you knew it could harm

596
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:06,298
sometimes you could put it into too

597
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:08,700
small of a pot you could let it get dry

598
00:24:06,298 --> 00:24:10,918
you could beat it up a bit you could try

599
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:13,200
to collect see if it could throw some

600
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:14,580
that was like the that was like our our

601
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,440
way of

602
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:19,439
you know right can you beat it up enough

603
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:21,659
to get some pollen off it remember uh

604
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,759
Soma's Soma's way you just flour them

605
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:26,480
out for like 80 or 90 days and get a

606
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:29,779
couple bananas yeah

607
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,798
rhodolization yeah yeah

608
00:24:29,779 --> 00:24:35,339
and I don't know where you got that term

609
00:24:31,798 --> 00:24:38,940
from for it but yeah I remember yeah

610
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:40,859
yeah he's a special guy actually I did

611
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:44,058
like as when his book came out or

612
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:47,279
whatever I do like the Soma beds

613
00:24:44,058 --> 00:24:48,960
I don't know that they were interesting

614
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:51,500
they were interesting they're just

615
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:55,740
they're just deep indoor beds on Wheels

616
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:57,900
you know is basically what they were

617
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:59,880
um you know with with you know some

618
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,980
drainage in the bottom and some layering

619
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,600
you know maybe they have some rocks and

620
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:06,298
they have some like and then they have a

621
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:09,119
layer of of uh ground cover or something

622
00:25:06,298 --> 00:25:10,740
and then you put soil on top and and

623
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:13,678
they have never seen

624
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:16,019
huh they had the air tubes on them in

625
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,900
all four corners where the air came down

626
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:21,359
to the lower Roots you would put like

627
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:23,640
big pieces of PVC with holes drilled in

628
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:24,899
and you would put those on the side and

629
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,480
those would go all the way in the

630
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:29,159
corners to the bottom yeah so that you

631
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,960
would actually and that would connect to

632
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:33,659
the gravel at the bottom so that you

633
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:37,220
could bring air yep yeah yeah it wasn't

634
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:40,020
the worst idea no no no

635
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:42,778
and especially for well it's not so much

636
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:44,579
you had to go trees you know I mean you

637
00:25:42,778 --> 00:25:46,339
know look now look at look at a bunch of

638
00:25:44,579 --> 00:25:49,740
you could you could actually grow a bed

639
00:25:46,339 --> 00:25:52,319
with it you know homie Style with 25 or

640
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:54,179
30 plants if you wanted yeah right right

641
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:56,519
right you know and then you didn't have

642
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:58,919
to worry about individual ones dying

643
00:25:56,519 --> 00:26:00,778
right right because you just water the

644
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:03,419
bed and everything stays alive

645
00:26:00,778 --> 00:26:07,319
oh yeah I used to use those no drain

646
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:09,778
beds way back in a 2000 or so and no

647
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:12,538
drink beds it's just shallow like six

648
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:14,460
inch deep beds you know

649
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:17,759
how'd that worked out

650
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:19,919
I did pretty good yeah yeah

651
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:22,740
um definitely some interesting stuff

652
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:25,520
that was back in my not so organic days

653
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:29,480
it's not so organic

654
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:33,000
organic not so organic

655
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:34,440
I mean I I used I used to know this used

656
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,140
to be pretty funny where I used to know

657
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:39,798
a lot of guys in Mendo that were organic

658
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:42,900
like April through August

659
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:44,700
and then come August they're like not or

660
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:47,700
September they're not quite seeing their

661
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:49,319
buds get as big as they want right and

662
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:51,360
then they figure like well what's one

663
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:53,278
big tub of pink powder gonna really do

664
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:55,918
to my organic it's it's basically

665
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:59,579
organic yeah yeah a little just a couple

666
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:01,919
a couple doses of the zero 50 30. it's

667
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:03,658
gonna get me where I need to be and it's

668
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,759
gonna make it happy and I've been

669
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:07,559
organic for five months already you know

670
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:09,419
so it'll all flush out at the end and

671
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:12,000
it's definitely still organic

672
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:15,720
uh yeah that stuff was tough

673
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,798
yeah bud blaster three cheers for grow

674
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,798
more yeah

675
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:26,298
Blaster was the was the the Canadian

676
00:27:22,859 --> 00:27:29,399
heady version yeah

677
00:27:26,298 --> 00:27:30,778
it was Canadian it was it was it was it

678
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,880
was one of those you know powdered

679
00:27:30,778 --> 00:27:34,200
whatever it was all this it was all the

680
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,360
same there was a bunch of people that

681
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,278
came out with zero fifty Thirty and

682
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:39,658
tried to make it seem like their zero 50

683
00:27:38,278 --> 00:27:41,700
30 was special

684
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:44,340
all right the one thing I'll say about

685
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:46,980
the the bud Blaster is that

686
00:27:44,339 --> 00:27:50,579
they had uh they had their own special

687
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:52,558
grinder so their powder was super fine

688
00:27:50,579 --> 00:27:55,678
and it actually dissolved

689
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:57,599
yeah some of the cheap stuff you get

690
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,980
there in like a thousand gallon tank or

691
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:00,480
whatever and you're up on a ladder and

692
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:02,759
you're dumping stuff like that in there

693
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,740
and then you get some soft balls at the

694
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:07,619
bottom that you're like wondering how to

695
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:09,900
hit with the stick to break up because

696
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:12,778
it wouldn't actually dissolve yeah you

697
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:14,460
know all right so but that's off topic

698
00:28:12,778 --> 00:28:17,038
you know I suppose you should probably

699
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:19,319
ratchet back around

700
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:21,179
um so we gotta convince we gotta

701
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:25,639
convince Caleb and Matt to talk because

702
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:29,059
this is really their era yeah this is

703
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:31,980
0.6070809 this is not my online presence

the stuff that was happening it's pretty

707
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:43,259
much this is when these two

weird yeah she thinks I'm a freak for

730
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:52,080
not knowing anybody's first names after

731
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,700
all these years I'm like I don't [ __ ]

him what the [ __ ] did I need to know

735
00:29:56,278 --> 00:30:01,019
that for it was very it was very similar

736
00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:02,519
to that on like on dead tour and stuff

737
00:30:01,019 --> 00:30:05,480
like that because everybody you know

738
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:10,740
everybody had a nickname yeah yeah

739
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:11,940
you know everybody had a nickname so

740
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:14,099
um

741
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:17,220
but you know I mean maybe maybe you guys

742
00:30:14,099 --> 00:30:18,959
could talk about like you know uh who

743
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:20,399
who who were some of the big I don't

744
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,960
want to say the word influencer maybe

745
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:23,639
but who are some of the people that were

746
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,940
sort of like driving the conversations

747
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:29,759
who were you excited to hear you know

748
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:31,380
posting on stuff like and then maybe

749
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:33,720
just like how hard it was to get

750
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:36,059
information back then because a lot of

751
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,798
these forums you know you guys were

752
00:30:36,058 --> 00:30:40,019
talking about the chem dog you know

753
00:30:37,798 --> 00:30:42,119
there was an aspect where the reason why

754
00:30:40,019 --> 00:30:45,599
you know somebody like you know skunk VA

755
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:48,298
has his name or chemdog 101 or any of

756
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:50,639
these things is because at some form or

757
00:30:48,298 --> 00:30:52,079
another on icmag or whatever it was the

758
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,360
first time these things started getting

759
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:57,359
argued about and debated

760
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:58,199
Yeah by people outside and a lot of

761
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:00,658
times

762
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,519
what happens too is that these things

763
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:04,919
become references because then you've

764
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:07,019
got this guy comes out and says this

765
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:09,240
thing on I see mag at this year

766
00:31:07,019 --> 00:31:12,000
and then three years later on whatever

767
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:16,079
on roll it up let's say he's saying this

768
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,240
and now on IG he said this and this

769
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:19,918
you know and they always they always

770
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,120
want to be like this is the most current

771
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,899
story this is what you should believe

772
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:26,339
yeah yeah and in some cases those forms

773
00:31:24,898 --> 00:31:28,319
don't exist anymore and they're very

774
00:31:26,339 --> 00:31:31,319
fortunate that they don't and you know

775
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:34,319
one of the one of the ways that uh CSI

776
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:36,359
got his reputation as inspecta is he was

777
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:38,898
really good at at using your own words

778
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:41,519
against you hello

779
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:43,139
well I just but I just mean in the sense

780
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:45,538
of someone would like confidently say

781
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:47,640
this this this this and this and then he

782
00:31:45,538 --> 00:31:51,298
would be like well why did you write

783
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:54,000
in your own words that faster this right

784
00:31:51,298 --> 00:31:56,339
how do you make these two things come

785
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,778
together I've got a bunch of swerve

786
00:31:56,339 --> 00:32:02,220
quotes I can share oh yeah

787
00:31:59,778 --> 00:32:03,359
you know and and that's a lot of things

788
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,880
most people probably don't even know who

789
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:07,319
swerve is but there's been there's been

790
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,880
a bunch of people

791
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:11,278
you know that come that you know

792
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,559
flashing the pants that come and go yeah

793
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:16,079
they come up they have their moment they

794
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:18,359
they they spew a bunch of [ __ ] they make

795
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:20,579
a bunch of money all of a sudden their

796
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:22,619
stories start to implode

797
00:32:20,579 --> 00:32:24,960
right yeah

798
00:32:22,619 --> 00:32:26,699
and you know and in some cases they

799
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,100
Rebrand themselves

800
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,120
and sell it again to the to the new

801
00:32:29,099 --> 00:32:33,298
badge

802
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:35,339
right right you know

803
00:32:33,298 --> 00:32:37,079
um who I looked up to is gonna be a lot

804
00:32:35,339 --> 00:32:38,819
different than maybe who Caleb looked up

805
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:41,038
to because when I first started coming

806
00:32:38,819 --> 00:32:43,740
in it was way different than when Caleb

807
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:45,119
started coming in you know so who like

808
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:47,519
who are you looking up to during those

809
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:49,979
years or who who is who do you think was

810
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:53,158
influencing really well that that had

811
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:56,399
some respect during those years

812
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:59,820
um I mean I liked you know just Just for

813
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:02,519

Ricky uh he was old family red back then

820
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:22,620
I actually a lot of people don't even

821
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:25,319
know but uh I named my old family purple

822
00:33:22,619 --> 00:33:28,079
my first TK hybrid kind of after his old

823
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:30,439
handle old family red you know oh I

824
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:33,480
didn't even know that that's cool

825
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:35,820
yeah I gave him a lot of credit

826
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,259
um you know Chrome that was those were

827
00:33:35,819 --> 00:33:39,720
the years Chrome was starting out with

828
00:33:37,259 --> 00:33:42,720
the white you know yeah he actually was

829
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:44,940
growing some of my my hybrids

830
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,579
um and then he introduced the white when

831
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:49,140
he was growing them so yeah that's when

832
00:33:47,579 --> 00:33:50,038
that started

833
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:53,100
um

834
00:33:50,038 --> 00:33:56,879
I I think I was mostly into Bubba's ogs

835
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:59,759
and chem dogs back then uh yeah but uh

836
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,140
what what were your your main main

837
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:03,898
interest though

838
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:05,399
so when I popped in you know like Shanti

839
00:34:03,898 --> 00:34:07,859
baba

840
00:34:05,398 --> 00:34:09,960
um was still pretty big and and still

841
00:34:07,859 --> 00:34:12,239
had a good name a lot of the stuff I was

842
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:14,398
looking at when I came in was was deaf

843
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:16,138
stuff I really didn't focus a lot on

844
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:18,299
Americans at the time because it just

845
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:20,220
didn't I wasn't hip to it you know I

846
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,659
hadn't right when I came in I wasn't hit

847
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:22,980
to the fact that all those dudes were

848
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:24,898
white labeling and most of the Americans

849
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:26,639
were making their seeds or Spanish or

850
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:28,378
actually back then I don't even know who

851
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:31,858
was making their [ __ ] seeds you

852
00:34:28,378 --> 00:34:34,440
know right but yeah I mean it was very

853
00:34:31,858 --> 00:34:35,940
different I mean uh Greenhouse hadn't

854
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,679
been totally trashed it was still kind

855
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:40,159
of under the radar for new people at the

856
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:44,460
time that that they were doing anything

857
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:46,858
you know untoward DNA was massive during

858
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:48,720
those years uh they were why I started

859
00:34:46,858 --> 00:34:50,098
doing six seeds a pack because their

860
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,358
[ __ ] was six seeds a pack and they were

861
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:53,338
the ones selling the most so I was like

862
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:56,219
okay I guess that's what you do you know

863
00:34:53,338 --> 00:34:58,440
what I mean right um yeah and then sub

864
00:34:56,219 --> 00:35:01,019
cool of course it just started [ __ ]

865
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:04,079
taking off and I was fortunate that I

866
00:35:01,019 --> 00:35:06,119
met Sunny Chiba very early on so I

867
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,338
learned very quickly oh maybe that guy

868
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:11,280
isn't someone I should be looking at for

869
00:35:08,338 --> 00:35:13,380
breeding tips you know right right it

870
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,940
took me a while but I got it but yeah

871
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:16,019
that's it was it was a much different

872
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:18,420
take

873
00:35:16,019 --> 00:35:20,579
yeah it's interesting then because

874
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:22,980
that's kind of when everybody first came

875
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:25,079
out of the Shadows yeah and you could

876
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:26,338
walk out of the Shadows with any stories

877
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:28,859
you wanted

878
00:35:26,338 --> 00:35:31,858
about himself for the strains or

879
00:35:28,858 --> 00:35:34,139
whatever else and a lot of times you

880
00:35:31,858 --> 00:35:36,539
were the only person

881
00:35:34,139 --> 00:35:38,578
um you know from Sam's man on

882
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:40,500
yeah you were the only you were the only

883
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:43,260
person telling the story about those

884
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:47,159
strengths right right I mean do you

885
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:49,500
remember huh the audience was so small

886
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:53,759
finding people who are actually there

887
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:55,619
you know was was very difficult yeah it

888
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,000
was it was a lot smaller than now I just

889
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:59,099
don't you think people that that came

890
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,960
later can grasp how small the community

891
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:03,800
was

892
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,599
and how slow information was

893
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:08,460
now it's pretty rapid fire

894
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:10,980
right you know and a lot of people

895
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:13,019
connect all the time

896
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:16,679
um oh yeah somebody said crunch bubble

897
00:36:13,019 --> 00:36:18,480
you know uh that guy I mean he that guy

898
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:19,799
used to move massive amounts of what was

899
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,838
it Blue Dot

900
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,060
through the third floor in Oakland you

901
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:27,980
know he had all those warehouses of 600

902
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:30,059
watt hps's on hydro tables

903
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:32,460
bumping out a bunch of stuff for third

904
00:36:30,059 --> 00:36:35,279
floor but it was you know what what's

905
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:36,960
funny about that guy is that some of

906
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,820
those pictures were like some of the

907
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,699
first Warehouse scenes that people were

908
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:44,519
willing to like throw up on IG on on the

909
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:47,399
internet yeah most people were growing

910
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:49,500
in closets or bedrooms or greenhouses or

911
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:51,599
in the woods or wherever and all of a

912
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:53,579
sudden you see a 40 lighter

913
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,200
right and for a lot of people that was

914
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:58,440
the first time

915
00:36:55,199 --> 00:37:01,439
right it might look rudimentary now

916
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:03,300
yeah now but yeah but even just then 05

917
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,940
or 06 or something like that you know

918
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:07,740
finding people and I think too that like

919
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:10,440
what most people don't understand maybe

920
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:13,379
is that a lot of the a lot of the

921
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:14,940
Breeders like that got famous later like

922
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:17,880
a couple people on the show or whatever

923
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:21,900
like almost all the Breeders were

924
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:24,980
European or American or Canadian yeah

925
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:27,900
right and the people that were working

926
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:31,400
breeding in America were generally doing

927
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:31,400
it through friendship circles

928
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:37,078
there was a lot of trading and Via DM

929
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:40,680
amongst friends and amongst

930
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:42,359
contemporaries it wasn't like like on

931
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:44,819
you know at least from what I remember

932
00:37:42,358 --> 00:37:47,759
it wasn't like oh I've got a big drop

933
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:49,920
coming next Friday here's the fifth

934
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,079
here's the 15 here's the names I made up

935
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:53,940
for him here's the hybrids here's where

936
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:55,320
you can get them here's how we're gonna

937
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:58,019
sell them all

938
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:59,940
it was like you know you'd trade seeds

939
00:37:58,019 --> 00:38:01,920
when you saw people or people were trade

940
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:04,559
selling them via DM or something like

941
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:07,440
that like but it was different

942
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:09,299
um I remember as far as Americans went

943
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,579
there was not a lot of Americans doing

944
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:13,980
direct sales on websites you would never

945
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:16,320
really see that like it was all done you

946
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:17,940
know DMS or like on weird little option

947
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,320
sites they were floating around but

948
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,880
other than that there wasn't a really

949
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:23,099
good way to Market yourself as an

950
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:25,380
American breederer without mostly giving

951
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:27,539
seeds away to people I mean did you have

952
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:31,140
that experience CSI

953
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:35,219
um I I didn't get involved in any of I

954
00:38:31,139 --> 00:38:37,440
wanted to back in the 06 era I looked

955
00:38:35,219 --> 00:38:39,419
into it but

956
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,858
um you know I was I was still way way

957
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,579
too paranoid to do any of that stuff

958
00:38:40,858 --> 00:38:44,159
yeah

959
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:47,160
I I should have done it you know like

960
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:49,618
you know DNA and sub cool and hell even

961
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:53,338
swerve you know yeah

962
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:55,619
you know uh I mean all those guys you

963
00:38:53,338 --> 00:38:58,078
know made huge names because there

964
00:38:55,619 --> 00:39:00,059
wasn't competition yeah and no

965
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:02,099
competition you didn't really have to

966
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:03,179
have a whole lot of talent to be very

967
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:05,700
successful

968
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:08,639
yeah so what you said Mr Soul handled

969
00:39:05,699 --> 00:39:10,379
all of sssc in the 80s

970
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:12,239
yeah

971
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:14,820
well you know so I mean what's

972
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:16,379
interesting about that is that you know

973
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:20,039
there's been a lot there's been a lot of

974
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:21,900
talk about American sssc right yeah and

975
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:25,440
you know Matt and myself got to

976
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:27,900
interview uh the owner uh who was very

977
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:31,260
cool and you know all that kind of stuff

978
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:33,660
got put to rest yeah hard the party

979
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:35,940
wasn't there wasn't any American help no

980
00:39:33,659 --> 00:39:38,399
but not for maneuver but it goes but it

981
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:40,139
goes to show how you know in our world

982
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,480
you can kind of step out of the shadows

983
00:39:40,139 --> 00:39:45,719
and be like oh I mean there was a lot of

984
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:47,159
people uh that you know they came out of

985
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:49,980
the shadows and they were the first time

986
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:51,539
that people were like you know oh I'm I

987
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:53,639
this is my cut

988
00:39:51,539 --> 00:39:55,199
yeah and then it turns out that they

989
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:58,019
just got the cut early

990
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:59,519
yeah but they got a few years of like oh

991
00:39:58,019 --> 00:40:01,739
if you want to use my cut you got to

992
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:04,079
give me 50 of the proceeds of the seeds

993
00:40:01,739 --> 00:40:06,598
or you got to pay me or you got this or

994
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:09,720
you got a that it's my work it's my my

995
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:10,920
my and then it comes out later that they

996
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:13,259
just got it from these other people

997
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,519
early but they were the first one to go

998
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:17,040
public

999
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:18,838
right you know and a lot of times what

1000
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:20,579
happened is is that the first person to

1001
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:22,199
go public

1002
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:24,300
um you know got credit

1003
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:25,919
yeah

1004
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:27,660
yeah you know

1005
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,240
um you know they got credit and their

1006
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:31,920
story was the story for a minute and

1007
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:34,199
sometimes other people would get upset

1008
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,539
and get online and start you know I mean

1009
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:38,879
I actually think that's kind of what got

1010
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:41,820
uh you know you were talking about uh

1011
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:45,480
cam that's kind of what got cam online

1012
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:46,859
was you know skunk VA gone online a bit

1013
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,599
you know and started talking about

1014
00:40:46,858 --> 00:40:50,759
different things

1015
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:53,960
and then people were like oh my weed's

1016
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,960
famous I should talk about it

1017
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:59,099
that got Joe brand and and Peabody and

1018
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:00,779
other people that hadn't really met up

1019
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:03,240
or like even linked or even realized

1020
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:04,140
what was going on after 15 years to

1021
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:08,098
connect

1022
00:41:04,139 --> 00:41:11,460
right because of stories 707 seed bank

1023
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:15,119
uh Shabbat he's the one who you know got

1024
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:17,220
uh skunk VA on to overgrow and icy mag

1025
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,559
to actually post about that stuff

1026
00:41:17,219 --> 00:41:22,078
otherwise I think there'd be a

1027
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:25,440
completely different chem dog history oh

1028
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:28,200
yeah if he hadn't done that you know do

1029
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,480
we remember what the very very first

1030
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:31,439
claim of the chem dog seats not

1031
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,019
necessarily the first one people

1032
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,760
remember but the very first claims of

1033
00:41:34,019 --> 00:41:37,440
Tim Dog who was the first one to claim

1034
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,880
that strain was it even Greg or were

1035
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,679
there other people popping up as it was

1036
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,140
getting popular going that's mine I read

1037
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:45,719
that [ __ ] I don't remember anybody

1038
00:41:43,139 --> 00:41:47,279
claiming it

1039
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:50,759
um lots of people claiming they had the

1040
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,660
91 or oh yeah yeah sure and it's just

1041
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,220
like well

1042
00:41:51,659 --> 00:41:55,858
I don't know how all these different

1043
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:57,539
cuts could be the right one oh you know

1044
00:41:55,858 --> 00:41:58,980
because it's purple that's how you know

1045
00:41:57,539 --> 00:42:02,279
when it perks

1046
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:05,219
I I saw a few chem dog cats and they

1047
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:08,099
they uh uh some of them look like a mass

1048
00:42:05,219 --> 00:42:10,379
Super Skunk chem dogs yeah

1049
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:13,320
but that that just basically means

1050
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:15,838
somebody bought some weed that was was

1051
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:18,300
called chem dog and it had some seeds in

1052
00:42:15,838 --> 00:42:20,820
it and whatever had pollinated that chem

1053
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:22,680
dog you know chem dog's not a bad

1054
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:23,880
hermaphrodite just by itself I mean not

1055
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:27,419
so nice

1056
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:30,119
you know no and so usually if you find

1057
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:32,400
seeds in your chem dog you know it's

1058
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:35,039
been pollinated by something else

1059
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,480
yeah well there was there was also a

1060
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:38,219
thing too that was that was really

1061
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,740
confusing I think and this isn't

1062
00:42:38,219 --> 00:42:42,959
anything against Greg or chemdog but you

1063
00:42:40,739 --> 00:42:44,939
know it's it's like for people that want

1064
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,338
specific lineages

1065
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:50,039
he was pretty famous for you when you

1066
00:42:47,338 --> 00:42:51,960
buy weed you're buying chem dog weed

1067
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:54,300
from chemdog

1068
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:55,320
it didn't really matter exactly what it

1069
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:58,019
was

1070
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:59,640
it was weed from chemdog and so I think

1071
00:42:58,019 --> 00:43:01,199
that created confusion too because

1072
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:03,118
everyone was like oh it's this one

1073
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:04,858
specific thing

1074
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,838
you know

1075
00:43:04,858 --> 00:43:08,578
um but it really was chemdoc yeah just

1076
00:43:06,838 --> 00:43:10,858
branding I mean back then branding was

1077
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:12,660
branding you know it was it was it was

1078
00:43:10,858 --> 00:43:15,838
early it was an early form of branding

1079
00:43:12,659 --> 00:43:17,699
yeah for sure you know and people

1080
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:20,400
weren't and a lot of these guys were

1081
00:43:17,699 --> 00:43:21,919
young and nobody knew especially then

1082
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,300
when things first started getting famous

1083
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:25,500
I don't think anybody knew that some of

1084
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,500
these strains were going to be so

1085
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:30,059
lastingly famous

1086
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:32,460
so a lot of times they wrote down

1087
00:43:30,059 --> 00:43:34,858
various stories or this or that and they

1088
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:37,019
didn't really expect it to get become

1089
00:43:34,858 --> 00:43:39,059
part of Canon or become part of the the

1090
00:43:37,019 --> 00:43:40,559
fabric of the tail

1091
00:43:39,059 --> 00:43:41,940
and then they have to look back and

1092
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:44,159
defend it

1093
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:45,780
you know

1094
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:47,399
um and you know it's hard for people

1095
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:48,720
sometimes to say you know my memory was

1096
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,619
a little that's what I remembered at the

1097
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:51,419
time

1098
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:52,858
you know after more after more

1099
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,960
information came out and I talked to

1100
00:43:52,858 --> 00:43:57,119
more friends I kind of revised a little

1101
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,440
bit because other people had it's hard

1102
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,119
for people to say that a lot of times

1103
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,039
people would dig in their heels

1104
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:03,660
yeah and then you've got two or three or

1105
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:06,079
four versions of the story and you're

1106
00:44:03,659 --> 00:44:08,699
trying to figure out which one works

1107
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:11,039
which one is the most believable

1108
00:44:08,699 --> 00:44:13,858
right right you know what what's your

1109
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:15,599
favorite wildest story

1110
00:44:13,858 --> 00:44:17,519
um from The Forum errors that you know I

1111
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:19,680
mean you that that you knew was kind of

1112
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:21,539
like that's too [ __ ] stupid to even

1113
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:23,338
be possible do you have any that stick

1114
00:44:21,539 --> 00:44:27,259
out where you're like that was a bold

1115
00:44:23,338 --> 00:44:30,480
[ __ ] claim and really what wonky

1116
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:33,660
what comes to mind when I say that

1117
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,579
um okay so I hate to keep bringing up my

1118
00:44:33,659 --> 00:44:37,739
boy swerve

1119
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:40,560
it doesn't really have a whole lot to do

1120
00:44:37,739 --> 00:44:44,639
with him but the guy he got pretty much

1121
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:47,099
most all of his early OG cuts from in

1122
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:48,779
like 0607.

1123
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:50,099
um this guy

1124
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:55,079
uh

1125
00:44:50,099 --> 00:44:57,000
had an account on icy mag and then he

1126
00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:58,740
made up another account and I think this

1127
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,280
was an 07.

1128
00:44:58,739 --> 00:45:04,679
and uh he made up another account

1129
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:06,900
pretending to be his own Mentor you know

1130
00:45:04,679 --> 00:45:09,480
with all the same spelling errors all

1131
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:11,280
the same you know type Styles all that

1132
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,679
and

1133
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:16,380
he he made a whole thread on it and

1134
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:19,019
acted like you know he was the original

1135
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:21,059
creator of the OG Kush blah blah blah

1136
00:45:19,019 --> 00:45:23,099
and his boy right here his little

1137
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:26,940
student you know he's he's best student

1138
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:28,800
I ever had and we're of our boy and we

1139
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:30,780
we hooked him up we laced him with all

1140
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,180
those those cuts we've held since the

1141
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:36,119
80s

1142
00:45:32,179 --> 00:45:39,659
yeah that there's still that story on on

1143
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:42,420
uh icy Mac it's still oh my God you know

1144
00:45:39,659 --> 00:45:45,299
and I'm I'm up in there with a bunch of

1145
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:46,500
other clowns just laughing away you know

1146
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:49,140
stupid

1147
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:51,719
you know but that that one right there

1148
00:45:49,139 --> 00:45:54,420
was it was pretty much the tops for for

1149
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:57,659
me back in those days I got one for you

1150
00:45:54,420 --> 00:46:00,659
I got one for you uh little old lady

1151
00:45:57,659 --> 00:46:02,879
with Asian fantasy oh that was a really

1152
00:46:00,659 --> 00:46:06,779
good one too I like it was a good one

1153
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:08,400
yeah yeah that one was was it uh there

1154
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:10,260
was a string called Asian Fantasy Made

1155
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,240
famous I think I think it's fair to say

1156
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:14,220
about the can of Bible Jason King pretty

1157
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:16,439
much made that strain very much so yeah

1158
00:46:14,219 --> 00:46:19,199
known it wasn't a well-known strain I

1159
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:22,619
don't think was it no no no

1160
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:24,659
um no and you know he he talked about

1161
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:28,200
the Rarity and how this guy never lets

1162
00:46:24,659 --> 00:46:31,440
it out blah blah blah a few years later

1163
00:46:28,199 --> 00:46:32,879
um a person that we we know who it was

1164
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,940
but I don't think he'll ever admit it

1165
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:39,599
right went on and tried to say that she

1166
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:42,480
was the the wife of the man who held

1167
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,980
Asian fantasy and he has died and she

1168
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,559
wants to get those genetics out there

1169
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:48,780
you know and ended up I think he's

1170
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:51,000
pretty sure it was NYC kid

1171
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:52,920
um kind of big upping himself trying to

1172
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,920
give himself some provenance on a cut he

1173
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:58,200
never had access to well we don't

1174
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,639
honestly we don't know that part of it

1175
00:46:58,199 --> 00:47:00,919
because

1176
00:46:59,639 --> 00:47:05,519
who

1177
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:09,180
have you or anybody ever seen this Asian

1178
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:14,039
fantasy keyword fantasy outside of the

1179
00:47:09,179 --> 00:47:16,799
candle Bible and NYC kid and his crew no

1180
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:19,199
I mean it's kind of a fantastic yeah

1181
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,880
yeah and yeah and in fact African black

1182
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:22,919
magic I mean there's some there's some

1183
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,900
pictures of it or whatever but I mean

1184
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:27,720
Jason King even talked about how homie

1185
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:29,818
wouldn't give it out to anyone and you

1186
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:32,519
know was it was a massive hoarder of it

1187
00:47:29,818 --> 00:47:34,500
you know and so there's an aspect to it

1188
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:36,719
there too where it's like people people

1189
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:38,579
can hoard something so much that it

1190
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:41,039
doesn't become famous

1191
00:47:38,579 --> 00:47:43,800
yeah right you know because nobody ever

1192
00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:45,059
sees it like before before this forum

1193
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,460
time that you were talking about there

1194
00:47:45,059 --> 00:47:49,259
was probably like you know four or five

1195
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:51,720
people or something in California that

1196
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:54,540
had the chem 91. oh yeah and someone

1197
00:47:51,719 --> 00:47:58,199
just said I have Asian fantasy s1s from

1198
00:47:54,539 --> 00:48:00,300
th Gods so he's still doing it Go NYC

1199
00:47:58,199 --> 00:48:02,039
kid you go but yeah I mean it was like

1200
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:04,440
one of those things where like if you

1201
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:06,300
know if if OG Kush if some of the if

1202
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:08,760
some of these famous things don't slip

1203
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:10,740
out and people don't start cropping them

1204
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:12,660
you know there was an aspect where it

1205
00:48:10,739 --> 00:48:15,659
was like for a long time there was only

1206
00:48:12,659 --> 00:48:18,539
four or five garages pumping chem 91.

1207
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:21,239
mm-hmm yeah so like every you know so

1208
00:48:18,539 --> 00:48:22,318
how much weed is that not very much it

1209
00:48:21,239 --> 00:48:24,539
doesn't really give you very much

1210
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:27,059
opportunity to try it doesn't really get

1211
00:48:24,539 --> 00:48:30,358
give you an opportunity for like a fad

1212
00:48:27,059 --> 00:48:32,039
to you know like if OG hadn't snuck out

1213
00:48:30,358 --> 00:48:34,139
if all those guys hadn't been money

1214
00:48:32,039 --> 00:48:36,480
hungry down there in L.A and it had

1215
00:48:34,139 --> 00:48:39,539
snuck out it probably wouldn't have had

1216
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:41,400
that kind of impact yeah because it has

1217
00:48:39,539 --> 00:48:43,800
to be there

1218
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:45,420
you have to be able to get even even if

1219
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:47,420
you have to pay a lot for it you do have

1220
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:50,099
to be able to access it

1221
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:52,740
right so Asian fantasy is one of those

1222
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:55,859
things where like it you know

1223
00:48:52,739 --> 00:48:57,838
um it never got out and then so as a

1224
00:48:55,858 --> 00:48:59,519
result of that it allowed scammers to be

1225
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:01,199
like this is it

1226
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:02,519
right and how could you tell the

1227
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:04,019
difference

1228
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:07,079
hey um

1229
00:49:04,019 --> 00:49:09,420
you know you you still you still buddies

1230
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:11,400
with the with old Jason

1231
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:13,200
Mr King

1232
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:16,139
um I haven't spoken to him in a minute

1233
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:19,338
but we're cool yeah he lives on Maui I

1234
00:49:16,139 --> 00:49:22,858
know uh I wonder if you can uh ask him

1235
00:49:19,338 --> 00:49:26,338
kind of maybe some because I talked to

1236
00:49:22,858 --> 00:49:30,358
him before I like met you met you yeah

1237
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:32,639
you know he he uh he affirmed that you

1238
00:49:30,358 --> 00:49:34,440
know all my information was right and

1239
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:37,318
then he was like where'd you where'd you

1240
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:39,300
find all this stuff out you know

1241
00:49:37,318 --> 00:49:40,858
I mean he might know some some

1242
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:42,780
background details that you know

1243
00:49:40,858 --> 00:49:45,960
definitely didn't make it into the book

1244
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:47,280
about yeah I bet one of the one I've

1245
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:48,780
been actually thinking about reaching

1246
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,240
out and talking to him because one of

1247
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:54,380
the things that's interesting is that he

1248
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:57,598
probably has a [ __ ] ton of pictures

1249
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:59,519
uh of weed from myself and my and some

1250
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:01,440
and friends and then people that I don't

1251
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:03,539
know obviously too but

1252
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:05,639
um that didn't make it in the book yeah

1253
00:50:03,539 --> 00:50:07,380
because you know you might take you know

1254
00:50:05,639 --> 00:50:09,299
dozens or hundreds of pictures or

1255
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:12,000
something and then two make it

1256
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:16,079
yeah you pick a couple

1257
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:17,880
um you know uh and and all that but he

1258
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:19,380
um you know and I think I think the

1259
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:22,039
Asian fantasy that he was talking about

1260
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:22,039
was in Hawaii

1261
00:50:22,699 --> 00:50:27,179
I want to say I remember and I I could

1262
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:28,980
be totally wrong so maybe I shouldn't

1263
00:50:27,179 --> 00:50:31,338
say it but I think I think Bodie knows

1264
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:34,500
the Asian fantasy person maybe

1265
00:50:31,338 --> 00:50:37,559
I might be wrong hmm

1266
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:39,300
oh no I'm gonna ask him so figure it out

1267
00:50:37,559 --> 00:50:42,000
I mean to me it's one of the it's it's

1268
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:45,060
one of those like legendary strains you

1269
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:47,519
know that like just never I mean you

1270
00:50:45,059 --> 00:50:50,519
know I'll mention another one do any of

1271
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:52,079
you guys have any uh any um uh

1272
00:50:50,519 --> 00:50:55,199
experience with Elvis

1273
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:57,420
yes yes but I don't know if it was I

1274
00:50:55,199 --> 00:50:59,159
don't know how real it was it was just a

1275
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:00,720
cut called Elvis because there's some

1276
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:03,179
really famous stuff out there that just

1277
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:05,098
it was never in my crew never in like

1278

hear about them for a long time and it

1280
00:51:06,659 --> 00:51:11,940
got famous in various aspects but it's

1281
00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:14,879
just like you know I also thought I had

1282
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:17,639
Albert Walker too though so there is

1283
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,380
that you know like who knows who knows

1284
00:51:17,639 --> 00:51:21,358
never got it from a good source that

1285
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:24,300
that could say yes this is where I got

1286
00:51:21,358 --> 00:51:26,460
it none of that [ __ ] and last one I had

1287

1288
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:30,420
don't think he backed it up and your

1289
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:34,559
Albert Walker was the orangey one right

1290

1300

named Rebecca yeah and she was from

1302
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:04,318
Asheville area of North Carolina

1303
00:52:00,679 --> 00:52:07,019
and so she you know he used to Rave

1304
00:52:04,318 --> 00:52:08,880
about that cut all the time and so she

1305
00:52:07,019 --> 00:52:09,838
finally got some of her friends to send

1306
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:13,740
it to us

1307
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:15,179
yeah right and dude it was like uh our

1308
00:52:13,739 --> 00:52:17,639
Buddy Holly Lonesome has a terrible

1309
00:52:15,179 --> 00:52:19,259
story uh but

1310
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:21,299
um it was kind of like that in the sense

1311
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:23,160
where I was expecting to get this tiny

1312
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:25,740
little box with some clones

1313
00:52:23,159 --> 00:52:28,139
and we got this box that was like you

1314
00:52:25,739 --> 00:52:30,299
know this big by two feet tall or

1315
00:52:28,139 --> 00:52:32,879
whatever and it was two Mothership

1316
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:35,960
plants in one gallon pots with steaks

1317
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:39,000
and each one was about 18 inches tall

1318
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:40,740
in O3 or something like that and it was

1319
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,659
like so all those pictures in the Cana

1320
00:52:40,739 --> 00:52:44,939
Bible that you see of Mothership

1321
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:47,519
those all came from those two moms that

1322
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:48,780
got mailed to us yeah and then we mom

1323
00:52:47,519 --> 00:52:51,239
those out

1324
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:52,800
and uh you know it got they got grown at

1325
00:52:51,239 --> 00:52:55,139
Eddie laps and they got grown to various

1326
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,519
friends houses and stuff like that so I

1327
00:52:55,139 --> 00:52:58,078
actually had I actually I had the

1328
00:52:56,519 --> 00:52:59,639
mothership for four or five years I

1329
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:00,359
think

1330
00:52:59,639 --> 00:53:04,318
um

1331
00:53:00,358 --> 00:53:06,900
and uh it wasn't I think it was a super

1332
00:53:04,318 --> 00:53:08,159
unique plant uh it wasn't one of them I

1333
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:09,720
didn't have it didn't have the nicest

1334
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:11,460
flavor I didn't really like the flavor

1335
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:13,679
that much but it had a pretty cool high

1336
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:16,139
and it did this weird thing where it

1337
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:17,578
would fall half over but then hold

1338
00:53:16,139 --> 00:53:19,858
itself up

1339
00:53:17,579 --> 00:53:23,039
so like you know how most branches if

1340
00:53:19,858 --> 00:53:25,019
they flop they flop it would like flop

1341
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:26,940
but then it would like raise itself up

1342
00:53:25,019 --> 00:53:27,659
and it would grow sideways through your

1343
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:30,358
garden

1344
00:53:27,659 --> 00:53:31,318
hmm almost kind of a little like train

1345
00:53:30,358 --> 00:53:34,139
wreck

1346
00:53:31,318 --> 00:53:37,139
it would yeah it would catch itself

1347
00:53:34,139 --> 00:53:39,719
and and just like and it had like these

1348
00:53:37,139 --> 00:53:42,358
it was a really odd sativa

1349
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:44,578
um it had thin leaves and it was big

1350
00:53:42,358 --> 00:53:47,338
branchy thing

1351
00:53:44,579 --> 00:53:49,619
um but you know I mean I honestly like

1352
00:53:47,338 --> 00:53:51,480
compared to all the other [ __ ] we've

1353
00:53:49,619 --> 00:53:54,539
been talking about like Bubbas and chems

1354
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:55,679
and you know super scum it was it was a

1355
00:53:54,539 --> 00:53:59,099
little Mitzy

1356
00:53:55,679 --> 00:54:00,539
you know uh in all reality but it was

1357
00:53:59,099 --> 00:54:02,519
one of those things that probably like

1358
00:54:00,539 --> 00:54:04,318
was genetically very different

1359
00:54:02,519 --> 00:54:06,358
than everything else

1360
00:54:04,318 --> 00:54:09,058
so I like I like you know we like those

1361
00:54:06,358 --> 00:54:11,519
weird things yeah real quick to touch

1362
00:54:09,059 --> 00:54:13,380
back on Elvis since you were you were on

1363
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:16,920
THC Farmers stuff for a long time right

1364
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:17,700
Caleb or at least attentive to it

1365
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,680
um

1366
00:54:17,699 --> 00:54:21,239
I was on the outskirts of the devil's

1367
00:54:19,679 --> 00:54:24,179
Harvest crew

1368
00:54:21,239 --> 00:54:25,679
um back in those days too and uh there

1369
00:54:24,179 --> 00:54:28,858
was there were some of those guys that

1370
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:31,919
one circulated through that crew a good

1371
00:54:28,858 --> 00:54:33,420
bit and it it started uh I think E-Rock

1372
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,519
from maybe like

1373
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:36,920
I don't know if I should say a state eh

1374
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:40,980
it's a long time

1375
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:43,559
uh you know uh I think he's he's

1376
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:46,019
circulated Elvis for a while through

1377
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:49,680
there I wouldn't be surprised if a

1378
00:54:46,019 --> 00:54:51,539
doctor maybe had grown it because he uh

1379
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:54,239
he was he was real good buddies with a

1380
00:54:51,539 --> 00:54:57,239
lot of those cats and I mean the whole

1381
00:54:54,239 --> 00:55:00,598
time I was I was online I only I only

1382
00:54:57,239 --> 00:55:02,399
traded Cuts uh through the mail maybe uh

1383
00:55:00,599 --> 00:55:04,500
I only received cuts through the mail

1384
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:08,579
twice I think

1385
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:10,559
um like you know 40 50 plus you know uh

1386
00:55:08,579 --> 00:55:12,480
packages of custom I only received twice

1387
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:14,940
I did all my other business just in

1388
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:18,659
person up and down the West Coast so

1389
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:21,420
that's me I'm very much I'm in person

1390
00:55:18,659 --> 00:55:23,000
do you remember uh Miss Elvis from the

1391
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:25,940
farm

1392
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:29,099
I wasn't very active on the farm at all

1393
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:30,420
very very little it was a person who

1394
00:55:29,099 --> 00:55:32,640
showed like they were the main person

1395
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:33,780
showing the the Elvis cut back then

1396
00:55:32,639 --> 00:55:35,219
there was something called like the pink

1397
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:36,780
Cadillac cut and then there was the

1398
00:55:35,219 --> 00:55:38,459
Elvis cut

1399
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:40,319
um that's that's the only person I ever

1400
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:42,960
got it from but I never

1401
00:55:40,318 --> 00:55:44,400
they disappeared like not even a month

1402
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,720
after giving it to me but they were the

1403
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:48,240
ones that were always documenting it on

1404
00:55:45,719 --> 00:55:51,239
the farm but I never knew if that was if

1405
00:55:48,239 --> 00:55:52,558
it's just someone from that [ __ ] and

1406
00:55:51,239 --> 00:55:55,459
made their way through because they

1407
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:55,460
disappeared so fast

1408
00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:01,260
was it super incensey

1409
00:55:58,739 --> 00:56:02,939
uh no it was exactly like what they

1410
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:07,460
talked about like a vinyl smell

1411
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:07,460
vinyl this artificial vinyl

1412
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:13,559
one of the things that's kind of

1413
00:56:11,818 --> 00:56:15,659
interesting about that era too is it's

1414
00:56:13,559 --> 00:56:18,300
kind of like the last era before like

1415
00:56:15,659 --> 00:56:21,299
the the Clone name dominance thing

1416
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:23,700
started happening where everyone's

1417
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:25,920
growing OG or everyone's growing sour or

1418
00:56:23,699 --> 00:56:28,259
everyone's growing all that kind of

1419
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:30,720
stuff so there was a lot of these odd

1420
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:31,740
strains you know not odd in the sense

1421
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:35,578
that there's anything wrong with them

1422
00:56:31,739 --> 00:56:38,459
just odd odd random strains that were

1423
00:56:35,579 --> 00:56:40,619
easily sold you know and so they they

1424
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:42,480
people liked them and they got traded

1425
00:56:40,619 --> 00:56:44,280
yeah you know people weren't looking

1426
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,838
necessarily for like oh I need to get

1427
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:47,220
this specific cut because I'm going to

1428
00:56:45,838 --> 00:56:49,440
be able to move it and it's going to go

1429
00:56:47,219 --> 00:56:51,299
for X price you know they were more

1430
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:54,300
interested in like the legend or the

1431
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:56,579
history uh or whatever of said cut or

1432
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:58,200
the person behind it and you could get

1433
00:56:56,579 --> 00:57:00,539
on there and start talking about your

1434
00:56:58,199 --> 00:57:02,179
cut and all of a sudden drum up a bunch

1435
00:57:00,539 --> 00:57:04,619
of Interest

1436
00:57:02,179 --> 00:57:05,699
and especially like if we wanted to go

1437
00:57:04,619 --> 00:57:06,838
back

1438
00:57:05,699 --> 00:57:09,598
um you know when we were talking about

1439
00:57:06,838 --> 00:57:12,119
how small it was I mean think about how

1440
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:13,920
revolutionary you know just some some of

1441
00:57:12,119 --> 00:57:16,640
Matt's favorite some of blueberry stuff

1442
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:19,260
got you know and how it looked

1443
00:57:16,639 --> 00:57:21,118
there wasn't that much competition there

1444
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:24,599
wasn't that much stuff outside of Europe

1445
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:26,818
or Shanti or Scentsy or you know uh

1446
00:57:24,599 --> 00:57:28,619
Simon from Sirius or some of that stuff

1447
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:30,358
like there wasn't that many American

1448
00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:34,019
breeders so the few people that were

1449
00:57:30,358 --> 00:57:36,358
doing it like like Mr Soul or or DJ

1450
00:57:34,019 --> 00:57:38,639
Short or whoever that we're willing to

1451
00:57:36,358 --> 00:57:40,558
to show their work I think it kind of

1452
00:57:38,639 --> 00:57:43,400
got like outsized

1453
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:46,500
you know outsized impact

1454
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:49,579
you know like Cindy 99 probably got way

1455
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:49,579
more famous than it should have

1456
00:57:51,559 --> 00:57:55,920
you know just to be just to be just to

1457
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:57,780
be perfectly honest I don't think in

1458
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:00,960
today it would have the same lasting

1459
00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:02,700
impact right no not today no it wouldn't

1460
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:04,858
it wouldn't have it wouldn't have been

1461
00:58:02,699 --> 00:58:07,858
able to break through but it was like so

1462
00:58:04,858 --> 00:58:09,239
I do think because it is is like when

1463
00:58:07,858 --> 00:58:11,519
you try to think of an outdoor plant

1464
00:58:09,239 --> 00:58:14,159
that's fast enough and still considered

1465
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:15,780
sativa to most people I think that it

1466
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:18,239
would be very hard to find a replacement

1467
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:20,460
for c99 that's at fast with those type

1468
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:23,279
of high qualities and I think that also

1469
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:25,199
had a major effect because it was it's a

1470
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:27,599
perfect outdoor plant for blasting fast

1471
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:30,058
you know and it could be grown indoors I

1472
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:31,619
just mean it got like all his work got

1473
00:58:30,059 --> 00:58:33,839
real there wasn't that much competition

1474
00:58:31,619 --> 00:58:36,480
so there wasn't a lot of time to talk

1475
00:58:33,838 --> 00:58:38,519
about you know like not only Cindy 99

1476
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:41,280
but like we're like the genius or the

1477
00:58:38,519 --> 00:58:43,500
Apollos or this or that or whatever or

1478
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:45,720
like you know everybody got plenty of

1479
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:47,639
time to debate the four or five things

1480
00:58:45,719 --> 00:58:49,980
that DJ released

1481
00:58:47,639 --> 00:58:52,379
yeah because there just wasn't that

1482
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:54,119
there wasn't that many different things

1483
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:56,400
you know there wasn't that many now

1484
00:58:54,119 --> 00:58:59,220
there's there's thousands of breeders

1485
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:01,079
and so standing out is very hard then it

1486
00:58:59,219 --> 00:59:02,639
was like you know what was what was

1487
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:04,260
there like you know a dozen big people

1488
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:06,420
doing stuff

1489
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:08,400
yeah it was a lot easier for people to

1490
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:10,200
[ __ ] keep other people down too like

1491
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:12,000
the ones at the top since there wasn't a

1492
00:59:10,199 --> 00:59:13,739
lot of competition and they they held a

1493
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,659
lot of sway they could really cut

1494
00:59:13,739 --> 00:59:17,279
[ __ ] throats real fast and it

1495
00:59:15,659 --> 00:59:20,338
happened a lot too and it was a lot

1496
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:22,619
easier to do that you know I would have

1497
00:59:20,338 --> 00:59:24,539
probably got cut then if I had even

1498
00:59:22,619 --> 00:59:27,180
tried to start back then

1499
00:59:24,539 --> 00:59:28,558
dude I I like I said I was banned off

1500
00:59:27,179 --> 00:59:30,058
every forum and it got to the point

1501
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:32,460
where I was like [ __ ] this let me start

1502
00:59:30,059 --> 00:59:33,780
my own Forum like Mr Nice I I never got

1503
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:35,940
banned from

1504
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:37,920
um I got asked to leave after a picture

1505
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:39,780
contest because the the right Berry

1506
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:41,039
pictures beat out one of Mr nice's and

1507
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:42,480
he thought that was kind of [ __ ] of me

1508
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:44,639
to put it in

1509
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:47,099
um but yeah all the rest of them it was

1510
00:59:44,639 --> 00:59:48,480
really hard because uh a lot of the ones

1511
00:59:47,099 --> 00:59:50,880
a lot of people that were running those

1512
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:52,798
forums also had a seed company

1513
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,480
right and most of those seed banks and

1514
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:56,579
seed companies would eventually start

1515
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:58,460
[ __ ] people and if you were one of

1516
00:59:56,579 --> 01:00:01,380
those people to speak up

1517
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:04,019
you're done you know they don't want you

1518
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:07,200
around yeah I mean I I see mag

1519
01:00:04,019 --> 01:00:09,659
definitely had some of that aspect to it

1520
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:13,798
too yeah there was The In Crowd in the

1521
01:00:09,659 --> 01:00:15,058
outcrowd you know for sure as as far as

1522
01:00:13,798 --> 01:00:17,159
that goes

1523
01:00:15,059 --> 01:00:18,900
I'm I'm just surprised that forum is

1524
01:00:17,159 --> 01:00:21,960
still alive after everything that went

1525
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:23,940
on with it yeah see people somebody

1526
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:27,000
talked about that people talk about 89

1527
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:29,700
Super Skunk there was an 89 Super Skunk

1528
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:32,338
one of one of the things that gets that

1529
01:00:29,699 --> 01:00:33,719
that annoys the hell out of me uh

1530
01:00:32,338 --> 01:00:35,940
honestly and this isn't to call out

1531
01:00:33,719 --> 01:00:38,519
Whoever has 89 Super Skunk but just in

1532
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:41,338
general is like they'll take the first

1533
01:00:38,519 --> 01:00:44,159
year that something was ever released or

1534
01:00:41,338 --> 01:00:47,219
named and be like I have that weed from

1535
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:49,858
a year or two before then yeah that's a

1536
01:00:47,219 --> 01:00:53,459
big problem like so the first time super

1537
01:00:49,858 --> 01:00:56,460
skunk ever got used was in the 1990s

1538
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:57,960
seed bank catalog yeah that's when it

1539
01:00:56,460 --> 01:01:00,838
had a picture and that's when it had a

1540
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:02,220
name that's when Neville released it

1541
01:01:00,838 --> 01:01:03,539
you know

1542
01:01:02,219 --> 01:01:05,879
um and so people are like oh I've got

1543
01:01:03,539 --> 01:01:08,039
the 89 super skunk

1544
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:09,599
well how

1545
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:10,798
you know and then they're like oh you

1546
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,760
know then they got to come up with like

1547
01:01:10,798 --> 01:01:13,920
well you know it was all that

1548
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:15,900
pre-release special [ __ ] because I my my

1549
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:18,420
uncle was buddies with homie who gave it

1550
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:21,240
down on special kick down or they'll be

1551
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:24,180
like you know you know I got that 95 93

1552
01:01:21,239 --> 01:01:27,058
Scentsy star I actually have pictures of

1553
01:01:24,179 --> 01:01:30,239
that 1989 Super Skunk and they look

1554
01:01:27,059 --> 01:01:32,280
awful cookie-ish it's pretty pretty but

1555
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:34,439
yeah you know it it happens all the time

1556
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:36,298
and then you see a lot of these old Cuts

1557
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:38,400
right now the years keep getting earlier

1558
01:01:36,298 --> 01:01:40,440
and earlier yeah

1559
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:42,240
you know I mean one thing and this isn't

1560
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:44,280
you know this isn't to you know

1561
01:01:42,239 --> 01:01:45,659
obviously uh bodies use this or whatever

1562
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:49,200
else right

1563
01:01:45,659 --> 01:01:50,879
but there is no G13 hash plant in the 88

1564
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:54,899
catalogs

1565
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:58,798
no no it came out in the 89 catalog

1566
01:01:54,900 --> 01:02:02,338
for the first year 89 and 90.

1567
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:04,079
you know but it's much better

1568
01:02:02,338 --> 01:02:05,880
it sounds nice

1569
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:07,318
you know and I'm not trying to throw any

1570
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:08,579
shade on it or anything like that

1571
01:02:07,318 --> 01:02:10,500
there's plenty of people that have found

1572
01:02:08,579 --> 01:02:11,880
nice weed and you know buddy made a

1573
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:15,420
bunch of hybrids with it and it came

1574
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:17,400
from ndn guy I think right yeah yeah uh

1575
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:19,619
origin originally or whatever you know

1576
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:21,420
he reproduced it but it's like it got

1577
01:02:19,619 --> 01:02:24,059
released in 89.

1578
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:26,460
right right but everyone calls it the

1579
01:02:24,059 --> 01:02:29,160
great you know the 88

1580
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:30,838
right close enough you know all details

1581
01:02:29,159 --> 01:02:33,000
like those that you know some of that

1582
01:02:30,838 --> 01:02:34,199
first piff some of that first stuff they

1583
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,780
talk about

1584
01:02:34,199 --> 01:02:39,480
um they'll call it the Great 88. yeah

1585
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:41,700
that [ __ ] got released in 89.

1586
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:43,199
so there's a bunch of stuff out there

1587
01:02:41,699 --> 01:02:44,939
where people will be like this cut is

1588
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:47,098
from a year or two before this line ever

1589
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:49,858
got released here's a quick question

1590
01:02:47,099 --> 01:02:52,920
though I mean I have zero experience in

1591
01:02:49,858 --> 01:02:56,519
this uh because I was living in my you

1592
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:59,159
know whole and humble but um

1593
01:02:56,519 --> 01:03:01,259
uh you you were there so

1594
01:02:59,159 --> 01:03:03,719
or maybe maybe you were there years

1595
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:08,099
later what was the possibility of them

1596
01:03:03,719 --> 01:03:12,179
doing uh releases of their seeds

1597
01:03:08,099 --> 01:03:15,960
um at the canvas cups

1598
01:03:12,179 --> 01:03:17,759
um absolutely so that is true it is

1599
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:20,159
possible like for instance the first

1600
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:22,920
Cannabis Cup I went to the was the Jack

1601
01:03:20,159 --> 01:03:25,739
Herrera cup uh and the whole thing was

1602
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:27,780
themed on him right right and it was all

1603
01:03:25,739 --> 01:03:29,578
about like it was the whole like all the

1604
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:31,140
festivities were all about the emperor

1605
01:03:29,579 --> 01:03:35,818
wears no clothes

1606
01:03:31,139 --> 01:03:41,578
and they released Jack Herrera seeds

1607
01:03:35,818 --> 01:03:44,159
um you know from uh uh in 95 94. yeah

1608
01:03:41,579 --> 01:03:47,339
95. they released them but they it was

1609
01:03:44,159 --> 01:03:48,719
you know it was late November

1610
01:03:47,338 --> 01:03:50,639
right

1611
01:03:48,719 --> 01:03:52,798
um but it wasn't in the catalog till the

1612
01:03:50,639 --> 01:03:55,798
following year

1613
01:03:52,798 --> 01:03:58,500
right so it was like literally it was

1614
01:03:55,798 --> 01:04:01,079
literally the first time for instance uh

1615
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:02,519
Jack was dropped was at the camp was at

1616
01:04:01,079 --> 01:04:05,339
the Cannabis Cup

1617
01:04:02,519 --> 01:04:07,500
right in late November so I suppose you

1618
01:04:05,338 --> 01:04:09,960
could have gotten it Jack Herrera at

1619
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:12,838
least six weeks before the year turned

1620
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:14,579
right right you know

1621
01:04:12,838 --> 01:04:17,400
I mean uh

1622
01:04:14,579 --> 01:04:20,339
for example Salmon Creek big bud

1623
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:22,200
um you know uh you know homeboy homeboy

1624
01:04:20,338 --> 01:04:24,900
from Salmon Creek you know he bought

1625
01:04:22,199 --> 01:04:27,419
those seeds at the cup the year it won

1626
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:29,599
the cup and then smuggled 50 of those

1627
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:32,119
seats home in his little belt you know

1628
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:35,400
Hideaway belt thing

1629
01:04:32,119 --> 01:04:38,039
and that's you know his selection from

1630
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:41,160
those uh Scentsy big bud seeds or

1631
01:04:38,039 --> 01:04:42,079
whatever is what made Salmon Creek big

1632
01:04:41,159 --> 01:04:44,519
bud

1633
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:46,798
I mean that's that's definitely possible

1634
01:04:44,519 --> 01:04:50,159
a lot of times

1635
01:04:46,798 --> 01:04:53,219
um a lot of new seed releases would get

1636
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:54,838
dumped in late November then because

1637
01:04:53,219 --> 01:04:57,539
because it was like an industry

1638
01:04:54,838 --> 01:04:59,519
Gathering right right and there was tons

1639
01:04:57,539 --> 01:05:00,420
of and honestly there was tons of custis

1640
01:04:59,519 --> 01:05:03,900
there

1641
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:05,760
I ended up hating going to Amsterdam for

1642
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:07,019
the Cannabis Cup I went three times and

1643
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:09,599
then never again

1644
01:05:07,019 --> 01:05:13,679
uh mostly because it sucked

1645
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:16,079
uh and the reason it sucked was that uh

1646
01:05:13,679 --> 01:05:18,960
Amsterdam is pretty far north

1647
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:20,940
and so it's cold as [ __ ] in late

1648
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,440
November there right so you can go in

1649
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:23,940
summer and it's nice and it's beautiful

1650
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:26,338
and you're on a bicycle and you're

1651
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:30,019
cruising around all stoned or you can go

1652
01:05:26,338 --> 01:05:33,599
when it's sleeting and 29 degrees

1653
01:05:30,019 --> 01:05:36,239
and that's not as nice you know and then

1654
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:38,160
all the best weed would get saved for

1655
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:41,039
celebrities that were coming in

1656
01:05:38,159 --> 01:05:42,960
and who's who so there was worse weed to

1657
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:45,480
get because it was all getting saved for

1658
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:47,639
you know Snoop Dogg or you know Sam

1659
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:50,099
skunk man's friends or you know whoever

1660
01:05:47,639 --> 01:05:53,219
whoever the High Times crew or whatnot

1661
01:05:50,099 --> 01:05:55,318
and then on top of that

1662
01:05:53,219 --> 01:05:57,480
you could buy tickets to go to the

1663
01:05:55,318 --> 01:06:00,599
Cannabis Cup out of High Times

1664
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:02,880
right so you go to Europe on vacation

1665
01:06:00,599 --> 01:06:05,220
and the coffee shops are full with all

1666
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:07,559
these dudes from Jersey and New York

1667
01:06:05,219 --> 01:06:08,899
yeah screaming about wanting to get the

1668
01:06:07,559 --> 01:06:12,480
best bud in the world

1669
01:06:08,900 --> 01:06:14,099
so it's like you you fly 12 hours away

1670
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:16,858
from your house and you're surrounded by

1671
01:06:14,099 --> 01:06:18,180
a bunch of obnoxious East Coasters and

1672
01:06:16,858 --> 01:06:19,980
there's not as good weed and it's

1673
01:06:18,179 --> 01:06:22,019
crowded and it's cold and it's raining

1674
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:24,980
or it's snowing and it's like I much

1675
01:06:22,019 --> 01:06:27,480
prefer going there in summer

1676
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:28,500
you know just because it was nice and

1677
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:30,240
chill

1678
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:33,059
you know but it was like an event that

1679
01:06:30,239 --> 01:06:34,679

1684
01:06:42,179 --> 01:06:45,838

1685
01:06:43,858 --> 01:06:47,699
didn't think it was done but they wanted

1686
01:06:45,838 --> 01:06:50,759
something new and hot that they could

1687
01:06:47,699 --> 01:06:54,118
call Jack Herer mm-hmm

1688

Jack Herer in a coffee shop and found

1691

1694
01:07:06,199 --> 01:07:11,598

1695
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:14,940
Rick did anything like that

1696
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:16,559
story yeah you know he found bag seed in

1697
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:19,519

yeah and really like and you know I

1702
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:35,880
think back then that was even earlier

1703
01:07:34,019 --> 01:07:39,719
like we weren't using the improper term

1704
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:41,039
back cross yet or you know BX uh you

1705
01:07:39,719 --> 01:07:44,399
know they were talking about [ __ ]

1706
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:46,740
wasn't it cubing yeah yeah it was it was

1707
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:49,500
he was cubic you were cubicle you were

1708
01:07:46,739 --> 01:07:53,038
like [ __ ] and they had all those like

1709
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:55,318
long-winded posts on on [ __ ] the

1710
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:57,539
forums about what percentage and how

1711
01:07:55,318 --> 01:08:00,739
much it was increasing with everyone you

1712
01:07:57,539 --> 01:08:03,240
did and laying it all out you know yeah

1713
01:08:00,739 --> 01:08:06,298
there was some really bad breeder Tech

1714
01:08:03,239 --> 01:08:08,239
being shared that seemed Cutting Edge at

1715
01:08:06,298 --> 01:08:10,679
the time

1716
01:08:08,239 --> 01:08:14,219
and people still repeat that [ __ ]

1717
01:08:10,679 --> 01:08:15,779
[ __ ] like like uh Mantra oh you gotta

1718
01:08:14,219 --> 01:08:17,639
bat cross it four times and you can

1719
01:08:15,780 --> 01:08:19,798
that's as good as an S1 that's a clone

1720
01:08:17,640 --> 01:08:21,420
man and I saw and I saw somebody talking

1721
01:08:19,798 --> 01:08:23,519
about I like the super silver haze

1722
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:25,380
better than the Jack Herer

1723
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:27,420
um the whole reason Super Silver Haze

1724
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:29,338
exists is because

1725
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:31,500
um Neville didn't feel like the Jack

1726
01:08:29,338 --> 01:08:34,259
Herer project was ready for prime time

1727
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:35,759
he just released it due to you know Alan

1728
01:08:34,259 --> 01:08:38,880
and Ben dronkers from Scentsy we're

1729
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:40,219
businessmen and so when he left he kept

1730
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:42,838
working on it

1731
01:08:40,219 --> 01:08:46,198
and then a couple years later I think in

1732
01:08:42,838 --> 01:08:48,238
97 or something he they released mango

1733
01:08:46,198 --> 01:08:50,399
and Neville and Super Silver Haze

1734
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:52,079
because he felt like you know they'd

1735
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:54,358
actually gotten somewhere

1736
01:08:52,079 --> 01:08:55,859
right right right but they still did a

1737
01:08:54,359 --> 01:08:57,539
couple and I actually think that was the

1738
01:08:55,859 --> 01:08:59,579
last big release that Neville ever did

1739
01:08:57,539 --> 01:09:03,000
right

1740
01:08:59,579 --> 01:09:06,420
um but I mean I smoked that that super

1741
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:08,039
silver haze cut because two I went in 90

1742
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:11,399
I was basically like every other year

1743
01:09:08,039 --> 01:09:13,798
like I went 97 and 99 too to the cups

1744
01:09:11,399 --> 01:09:15,479
and those last two cups that super

1745
01:09:13,798 --> 01:09:17,819
silver haze was all over the place

1746
01:09:15,479 --> 01:09:20,879
because that was that was in that was

1747
01:09:17,819 --> 01:09:24,239
like the first and third year at one

1748
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:26,759
it was like the hot [ __ ] over there

1749
01:09:24,238 --> 01:09:28,259
right right it really was it was the hot

1750
01:09:26,759 --> 01:09:31,319
[ __ ] I mean it was super there was a

1751
01:09:28,259 --> 01:09:33,899
Fino of it that went like 14 weeks

1752
01:09:31,319 --> 01:09:37,980
uh will the community let res back into

1753
01:09:33,899 --> 01:09:40,019
play uh Rez is doing his own thing you

1754
01:09:37,979 --> 01:09:42,659

1755
01:09:40,020 --> 01:09:45,060
about res and are are a couple of

1756
01:09:42,659 --> 01:09:47,399
buddies remind reminded me of not that

1757
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:49,259
long ago was like before all the

1758
01:09:47,399 --> 01:09:51,179
[ __ ] with the with the law

1759
01:09:49,259 --> 01:09:54,119
enforcement and all that

1760
01:09:51,179 --> 01:09:57,779
um he was a dick online anyway

1761
01:09:54,119 --> 01:10:00,840
right big time he was a big time troll

1762
01:09:57,779 --> 01:10:03,359
jerk generally a pain in the ass to get

1763
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:06,179
along with not a pleasant homie

1764
01:10:03,359 --> 01:10:07,439
yeah despite despite any of the rest of

1765
01:10:06,179 --> 01:10:09,659
the bowl whatever you want to believe

1766
01:10:07,439 --> 01:10:13,500
about you know all the mess that

1767
01:10:09,659 --> 01:10:15,979
happened legally or whatever uh yeah he

1768
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:20,760
was a he was an early troll

1769
01:10:15,979 --> 01:10:24,539
he was a jackass he had a huge ego

1770
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:27,000
I mean he still does he he had a decent

1771
01:10:24,539 --> 01:10:29,219
level of intelligence which would have

1772
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:31,198
been I think much more appreciated if he

1773
01:10:29,219 --> 01:10:33,480
hadn't had so much ego with it yeah a

1774
01:10:31,198 --> 01:10:35,339
little humid you know I mean not you

1775
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:36,658
know a bunch of ego and a bunch of

1776
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:38,819
rudeness

1777
01:10:36,658 --> 01:10:40,319
mm-hmm you know there was some root

1778
01:10:38,819 --> 01:10:42,359
there was some rude people you could put

1779
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:44,519
up with a little bit better but they

1780
01:10:42,359 --> 01:10:47,460
were like borderline geniuses

1781
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:49,199
right right right you know like Tom Hill

1782
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:50,600
could be a real dick if you asked a dumb

1783
01:10:49,198 --> 01:10:53,219

billion times right you're gonna

1790
01:11:04,198 --> 01:11:07,859
question me

1791
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:10,440
you're 23 shut the [ __ ] up you're a

1793
01:11:10,439 --> 01:11:15,658

1794
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:18,000
yeah rude kind of rude you know but it's

1795
01:11:15,658 --> 01:11:20,099
hard it's hard to have patience

1796
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,719
you know and let's face it right a lot

1797
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:23,400
of us are weirdos

1798
01:11:21,719 --> 01:11:26,399
a lot of us don't have the greatest

1799
01:11:23,399 --> 01:11:30,420
interpersonal skills to begin with no

1800
01:11:26,399 --> 01:11:32,219
you know yourself but it really is I

1801
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:34,199
mean speaking for me I probably have a

1802
01:11:32,219 --> 01:11:38,158
little bit more than your average grower

1803
01:11:34,198 --> 01:11:39,899
just a bit yeah you know but a lot but a

1804
01:11:38,158 --> 01:11:42,779
lot of them it's like you know we're

1805
01:11:39,899 --> 01:11:44,819
kind of harsh edges people that live in

1806
01:11:42,779 --> 01:11:46,979
the Hills don't talk to people hang out

1807
01:11:44,819 --> 01:11:48,359
with plants and they're really good with

1808
01:11:46,979 --> 01:11:49,799
plants and they're not so good with

1809
01:11:48,359 --> 01:11:52,500
social interaction

1810
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:55,079
right right so you put those people on

1811
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:57,238
the forums and you put those people like

1812
01:11:55,079 --> 01:11:59,039
you know on IG or whatever and it's like

1813
01:11:57,238 --> 01:12:01,919
it's not the easiest thing

1814
01:11:59,039 --> 01:12:04,140
I did have an adjustment period that uh

1815
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:05,760
I will admit I had an adjustment period

1816
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:08,460
of where

1817
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:10,440
I may have been a little meaner uh in

1818
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:12,500
responses and talking to people a little

1819
01:12:10,439 --> 01:12:16,079
Snappy maybe a little bit of ego

1820
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:19,279
you know it happens but some of us grow

1821
01:12:16,079 --> 01:12:21,899
into beautiful smiling faces like this

1822
01:12:19,279 --> 01:12:25,019
well I'm also still banned from breed

1823
01:12:21,899 --> 01:12:27,420
Bay for uh picking on subcool it's also

1824
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:28,800
it's also the way I look at it is like

1825
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:31,380
you know I mean everybody has the

1826
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,640
natural inclination sometimes but it's

1827
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:34,199
like are you trying to get your point

1828
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:35,280
across are you trying to [ __ ] argue

1829
01:12:34,198 --> 01:12:37,379
on them

1830
01:12:35,279 --> 01:12:39,779
right oh here's this dude who says his

1831
01:12:37,380 --> 01:12:41,760
dad created dog bud I remember that guy

1832
01:12:39,779 --> 01:12:43,439

1833
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:45,360
gonna block him okay there you go I mean

1834
01:12:43,439 --> 01:12:47,460
the thing the thing about the one thing

1835
01:12:45,359 --> 01:12:51,299
we'll say about dog bud and then we'll

1836
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:53,698
move on is that Joe brand and Peabody

1837
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:56,760
were buying and selling weed on dead

1838
01:12:53,698 --> 01:12:59,399
Tour all the time for cash to go see

1839
01:12:56,760 --> 01:13:02,579
Dead shows right and this one weekend

1840
01:12:59,399 --> 01:13:05,639

1841
01:13:02,579 --> 01:13:07,619
Greg some more weed and then 15 years

1842
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:09,360
went by before they even heard anything

1843
01:13:07,619 --> 01:13:11,219

1844
01:13:09,359 --> 01:13:14,339

chem 91 or anything like that until 06

1847
01:13:17,279 --> 01:13:23,639
until the reunion when the forums got

1848
01:13:20,399 --> 01:13:25,738
people back together they had no idea

1849
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:28,500
they were on dead tour right they met

1850
01:13:25,738 --> 01:13:31,079
this you know you know these guys

1851
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:33,539
uh Greg was in it was a teenager from

1852
01:13:31,079 --> 01:13:35,779
the east coast and they sold him some

1853
01:13:33,539 --> 01:13:38,579
weed in Indiana

1854
01:13:35,779 --> 01:13:39,479
right which was just one stop on summer

1855
01:13:38,579 --> 01:13:41,340
tour

1856
01:13:39,479 --> 01:13:43,319
and you're buying pounds and you're

1857
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:45,000
selling eights and quarters and halfs

1858
01:13:43,319 --> 01:13:46,319
and ounces and it ran out and you buy

1859
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,939
some other pounds and you just keep

1860
01:13:46,319 --> 01:13:50,158
doing that and you did that for a while

1861
01:13:47,939 --> 01:13:51,559
and one of these sales turned into

1862
01:13:50,158 --> 01:13:54,960
something

1863
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:59,100
and now you want to hey 15 years ago do

1864
01:13:54,960 --> 01:14:01,020
you remember uh it was summer uh on dead

1865
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:02,820
tour do you remember this one couple

1866
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:04,679
pounds you had that you were hustling

1867
01:14:02,819 --> 01:14:06,779
for like a weekend

1868
01:14:04,679 --> 01:14:08,579
do you have any clear memory of that

1869
01:14:06,779 --> 01:14:11,880
because it's kind of important

1870
01:14:08,579 --> 01:14:15,238
well I think uh I think he might have uh

1871
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:19,679
remembered just because he

1872
01:14:15,238 --> 01:14:21,899
um hit Joe brand up you know gee hit Joe

1873
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:24,899
brand up again and had him mail him some

1874
01:14:21,899 --> 01:14:27,238
more weed I think right two ounces and

1875
01:14:24,899 --> 01:14:29,039
we don't even know if the seeds came

1876
01:14:27,238 --> 01:14:31,379
from the Deer Creek show

1877
01:14:29,039 --> 01:14:33,619
or the seeds came from the weed that Joe

1878
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:36,380
sent him later

1879
01:14:33,619 --> 01:14:39,960
from based on the stories I've kind of

1880
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:43,500
deciphered I I think it it came from the

1881
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:45,658
ones that was sent that one had no seeds

1882
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:48,359
but then again we know geez stories are

1883
01:14:45,658 --> 01:14:50,698
a little up and down I mean you know not

1884
01:14:48,359 --> 01:14:53,880
to I like two of my favorite cuts of all

1885
01:14:50,698 --> 01:14:55,678
time come out of geez little rooms but I

1886
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:57,960
will say that

1887
01:14:55,679 --> 01:15:00,480
um all of us on this thing have tried to

1888
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:02,880
uh have tried to interpret what he meant

1889
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:05,839
by rejuvenating the 91 after it got

1890
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:09,060
tired in 94.

1891
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:10,980
them rejuvenate yeah the the

1892
01:15:09,060 --> 01:15:14,280
Rejuvenation he had to let it go and

1893
01:15:10,979 --> 01:15:17,178
rejuvenate it that's how you fix it from

1894
01:15:14,279 --> 01:15:18,960
scene and that [ __ ] never got explained

1895
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:21,420
you know

1896
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:23,279
um and so I don't you know there's when

1897
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:25,679
it when any time you have a situation

1898
01:15:23,279 --> 01:15:27,840
where you know we can even go back and

1899
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:30,359
take you know like ancient you know

1900
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:34,500
ancient Virginia skunk bud grown for

1901
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:37,439
sssc or Mr Soul you know working for

1902
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:39,359
sssc you know you you create these

1903
01:15:37,439 --> 01:15:42,599
ancient legends and it's like how do you

1904
01:15:39,359 --> 01:15:43,979
disprove them yeah in a lot of cases you

1905
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:46,260
can't prove or disprove because they're

1906
01:15:43,979 --> 01:15:48,718
so old well let's get back to the forums

1907
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:50,699
I got a question yeah yeah

1908
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:52,380
um what was the first place do you

1909
01:15:50,698 --> 01:15:53,759
remember where the first like seed bake

1910
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:55,140
the first seed bank that carried your

1911
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:57,179
[ __ ] when people could actually buy it

1912
01:15:55,140 --> 01:16:00,659
which one was it

1913
01:15:57,179 --> 01:16:03,199
well we don't talk about that okay so

1914
01:16:00,658 --> 01:16:07,460
it's an unmentionable

1915
01:16:03,198 --> 01:16:07,460
I ain't friends with that guy anymore

1916
01:16:07,939 --> 01:16:14,219
my fault that dude a little Loco yeah oh

1917
01:16:12,539 --> 01:16:16,738
okay gotcha

1918
01:16:14,219 --> 01:16:20,100
you got to remember I didn't even uh

1919
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:21,359
start my seed company until 2014. yeah

1920
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:23,420
yeah I remember

1921
01:16:21,359 --> 01:16:26,158
yeah I I

1922
01:16:23,420 --> 01:16:27,779
could say one thing is that my buddy

1923
01:16:26,158 --> 01:16:29,519
that I never mentioned his name but

1924
01:16:27,779 --> 01:16:31,619
Staten Island when we were doing all the

1925
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:33,420
super dog work and we were doing all

1926
01:16:31,619 --> 01:16:37,500
those hybrids that made it into the can

1927
01:16:33,420 --> 01:16:40,199
of Bible he had Big Dreams of realizing

1928
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:42,960
that you could probably make more money

1929
01:16:40,198 --> 01:16:45,178
like off of an eight lighter of seed

1930
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:46,260
than you could off an eight light or a

1931
01:16:45,179 --> 01:16:48,960
flower

1932
01:16:46,260 --> 01:16:50,640
and he saw what was coming I honestly

1933
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:52,560
didn't believe him

1934
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:54,000
you know I didn't think I didn't think

1935
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:56,719
that we you would ever be able in

1936
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,859
America to like package up and sell

1937
01:16:56,719 --> 01:17:01,079
enormous amounts of seed or anything

1938
01:16:58,859 --> 01:17:02,519
like that because at the time we were

1939
01:17:01,079 --> 01:17:04,140
making all this stuff and we were

1940
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:06,179
literally giving it away to good friends

1941
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:07,800
and stuff because we had more than we

1942
01:17:06,179 --> 01:17:09,960
knew what to do with and there wasn't an

1943
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:12,900
outlet for it

1944
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:14,880
um you know the era that that Caleb

1945
01:17:12,899 --> 01:17:16,559
talks about getting involved is is one

1946
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:19,800
of the earlier eras where you could

1947
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:22,140
really actually start to sell it

1948
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:24,360
it wasn't simple in the beginning even

1949
01:17:22,140 --> 01:17:26,400
even if you were an active breeder

1950
01:17:24,359 --> 01:17:28,319
finding out how to get it to the

1951
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:31,738
community wasn't very simple

1952
01:17:28,319 --> 01:17:33,840
no at all you had to trust I mean like

1953
01:17:31,738 --> 01:17:36,899
even even with me I started the um

1954
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:39,659
selling seats directly really early for

1955
01:17:36,899 --> 01:17:41,399
for a US person

1956
01:17:39,658 --> 01:17:43,679
um but when I first started you still

1957
01:17:41,399 --> 01:17:45,238
had to really put your trust in someone

1958
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:46,980
in Europe for the most part if you

1959
01:17:45,238 --> 01:17:48,899
wanted any kind of traction for your

1960
01:17:46,979 --> 01:17:50,819
seeds if you wanted any

1961
01:17:48,899 --> 01:17:52,738
I mean you had to work with seed banks

1962
01:17:50,819 --> 01:17:54,359
for people they'd eventually know who

1963
01:17:52,738 --> 01:17:56,698
you are the seed bank didn't care you

1964
01:17:54,359 --> 01:17:58,259
you probably important and that's where

1965
01:17:56,698 --> 01:18:02,059
everybody looked at it we were about to

1966
01:17:58,260 --> 01:18:02,060
go into CSI after dark

1967
01:18:03,079 --> 01:18:10,738
yeah yeah but yeah I mean uh you know a

1968
01:18:07,859 --> 01:18:13,139
good bit of that was in the 90s

1969
01:18:10,738 --> 01:18:15,718
you know when DJ Short wanted to get his

1970
01:18:13,140 --> 01:18:16,860
blueberry seed out there he had to give

1971
01:18:15,719 --> 01:18:20,460
it away

1972
01:18:16,859 --> 01:18:22,738
to uh two different groups in Europe

1973
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:24,420
yeah burst he had to give it to Tony at

1974
01:18:22,738 --> 01:18:26,158
sag Martha and then he had to give it to

1975
01:18:24,420 --> 01:18:27,600
Dutch Passion I don't know if he

1976
01:18:26,158 --> 01:18:29,639
intentionally gave it away but I think

1977
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:33,020
that's how it ended up working out I

1978
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:35,640
think he did huh didn't didn't he

1979
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:38,460
purposely give them to him and maybe he

1980
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:40,980
purposely did I think he thought that he

1981
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:42,119
would still retain all control and this

1982
01:18:40,979 --> 01:18:44,759
and that that's where he was probably

1983
01:18:42,119 --> 01:18:47,760
mistaken but in order for him to even

1984
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:51,300
like get money for his seeds he had to

1985
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:54,420
send them to an established seed bank

1986
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:56,520
yeah in a different continent

1987
01:18:54,420 --> 01:18:57,300
that's how hard it was to move seeds

1988
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:59,460
then

1989
01:18:57,300 --> 01:19:01,440
yeah but you know when he I think sag

1990
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:03,480
Martha they had his seeds in what like

1991
01:19:01,439 --> 01:19:04,319
you know the mid 90s or something like

1992
01:19:03,479 --> 01:19:05,099
that

1993
01:19:04,319 --> 01:19:07,559
um

1994
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:09,900
uh right around there yeah the internet

1995
01:19:07,560 --> 01:19:11,400
didn't even exist then really

1996
01:19:09,899 --> 01:19:14,698
right right

1997
01:19:11,399 --> 01:19:17,059
I did but not not at any level that you

1998
01:19:14,698 --> 01:19:20,339
were going to be able to use it for that

1999
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:23,600
yeah yeah I think overgrowth started in

2000
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:23,600
either 98 or 99

2001
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:31,260
so like the first forums the first being

2002
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:33,659
able to exchange stuff like how would DJ

2003
01:19:31,260 --> 01:19:36,719
have even set up an internet was going

2004
01:19:33,658 --> 01:19:40,500
to set up a geocities like [ __ ] you

2005
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:42,060
know web page and sell illegal beans

2006
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:44,698
you know

2007
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:48,960
um I mean up until up until they passed

2008
01:19:44,698 --> 01:19:51,539
the the 215 in in late 96 I think it was

2009
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:53,640
it was it was illegal in all 50 states

2010
01:19:51,539 --> 01:19:55,260
there wasn't any there wasn't even a

2011
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:57,000
legitimate reason you could possess any

2012
01:19:55,260 --> 01:19:59,400
of it yeah

2013
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:01,319
and I think he feels burnt he felt

2014
01:19:59,399 --> 01:20:03,479
burned but you know what were you going

2015
01:20:01,319 --> 01:20:05,158
to do when you gave it away to the Dutch

2016
01:20:03,479 --> 01:20:06,718
right if he didn't know that those those

2017
01:20:05,158 --> 01:20:08,219
Dutch guys were going to do whatever the

2018
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:10,980
[ __ ] they wanted with it then he was

2019
01:20:08,219 --> 01:20:12,658
just he had just done his groundwork

2020
01:20:10,979 --> 01:20:16,559
yeah

2021
01:20:12,658 --> 01:20:20,579
well yeah that that's a blueberry is

2022
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:22,739
almost a a a a a full day's topic just

2023
01:20:20,579 --> 01:20:24,300
by itself it is but I just met in the

2024
01:20:22,738 --> 01:20:26,399
sense that like just to use it on the

2025
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:28,079
example of how hard it was to sell seeds

2026
01:20:26,399 --> 01:20:31,019
if you were a small American breeder

2027
01:20:28,079 --> 01:20:33,539
yeah he had to work with the Dutch just

2028
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:35,280
to get it out there there wasn't an

2029
01:20:33,539 --> 01:20:37,500
Avenue what were you gonna do

2030
01:20:35,279 --> 01:20:39,779
I mean you know

2031
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:41,819
um you know even like early even early

2032
01:20:39,779 --> 01:20:43,979
American you know seed sellers or

2033
01:20:41,819 --> 01:20:45,899
whatever used to try to fake that their

2034
01:20:43,979 --> 01:20:48,619
stuff was based out of Europe

2035
01:20:45,899 --> 01:20:48,619
right right

2036
01:20:49,079 --> 01:20:54,719
you know I I mean one of the things that

2037
01:20:51,479 --> 01:20:56,519
IG did and and the middle and and the

2038
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:59,340
sort of the middle era of two middle

2039
01:20:56,520 --> 01:21:01,500
late 215 was things opened up enough

2040
01:20:59,340 --> 01:21:04,319
that people felt free

2041
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:05,819
to be able to like you know you could

2042
01:21:04,319 --> 01:21:08,099
have a swamp boys

2043
01:21:05,819 --> 01:21:09,719
you could have a CSI humble you could

2044
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:10,920
have a you could have just these people

2045
01:21:09,719 --> 01:21:11,880
that were like I'm gonna make my own

2046
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:14,039
Packaging

2047
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:16,679
I'm gonna make my own beans I'm gonna go

2048
01:21:14,039 --> 01:21:19,619
to these like gray area cannabis cups

2049
01:21:16,679 --> 01:21:21,539
swap meets and hustle seeds I'm going to

2050
01:21:19,619 --> 01:21:23,479
start to mail

2051
01:21:21,539 --> 01:21:25,859
um I can say back in

2052
01:21:23,479 --> 01:21:27,299
02030405 I mean my buddy from Staten

2053
01:21:25,859 --> 01:21:28,738
Island would tell me about this stuff

2054
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:30,000
that he wanted to do and I would laugh

2055
01:21:28,738 --> 01:21:32,218
at him

2056
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:34,100
I was like oh you want us to all go to

2057
01:21:32,219 --> 01:21:36,000
jail

2058
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:39,000
that's what it seems like you're talking

2059
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:40,738
about to me you know yeah when I started

2060
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,719
I I was one of the P I think I was one

2061
01:21:40,738 --> 01:21:44,639
of the few people that pretended that my

2062
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:47,640
website was in Amsterdam just to like

2063
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:49,260
try to hide under the shadows you know

2064
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:52,739
just because no one was doing it it's it

2065
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:54,480
[ __ ] was a big red flag I'm just

2066
01:21:52,738 --> 01:21:56,459
waiting for that hit even having the

2067
01:21:54,479 --> 01:22:00,119
infrastructure set up to be successful

2068
01:21:56,460 --> 01:22:02,819
yeah and and that's kind of why there

2069
01:22:00,119 --> 01:22:05,399
was so few breeders back then

2070
01:22:02,819 --> 01:22:06,420
because it was generally done out of

2071
01:22:05,399 --> 01:22:08,039
love

2072
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:10,440
and you were trading amongst other

2073
01:22:08,039 --> 01:22:11,880
people and there wasn't something like

2074
01:22:10,439 --> 01:22:14,339
there is now where somebody can be like

2075
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:16,020
Oh I'm gonna drop my Mac one drop and

2076
01:22:14,340 --> 01:22:18,600
I'm gonna make 200 Grand and you know

2077
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:20,760
I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna hype it

2078
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:22,440
yeah you really couldn't hype it there

2079
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:25,980
wasn't marketing there wasn't an ability

2080
01:22:22,439 --> 01:22:27,299
to reach a big audience right right I

2081
01:22:25,979 --> 01:22:30,299
don't think

2082
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:34,199
you know no it took a while

2083
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:37,980
well and uh in in in the era you know 06

2084
01:22:34,198 --> 01:22:40,559
you know through 08 even 2010 I mean

2085
01:22:37,979 --> 01:22:43,198
most of the marketing most most of the

2086
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:47,580
availability was all based on internet

2087
01:22:43,198 --> 01:22:49,919
forums right yeah you know that was yeah

2088
01:22:47,579 --> 01:22:51,899
and people should also remember that

2089
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:54,420
when overgrown cannabis World got shut

2090
01:22:51,899 --> 01:22:57,859
down they got shut down because of very

2091
01:22:54,420 --> 01:23:00,960
big uh you know seed vendor got raided

2092
01:22:57,859 --> 01:23:03,420
uh Heaven Stairway

2093
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:04,819
that was and that scared a bunch of

2094
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:07,079
people

2095
01:23:04,819 --> 01:23:08,939
and there's still repercussions and

2096
01:23:07,079 --> 01:23:12,359
ripples hidden from that [ __ ] bust

2097
01:23:08,939 --> 01:23:14,399
you know and you know and then you know

2098
01:23:12,359 --> 01:23:15,899
and and you know and people even in

2099
01:23:14,399 --> 01:23:19,559
Canada and stuff like that you know Mark

2100
01:23:15,899 --> 01:23:23,179
Emery you know uh I mean he he went to

2101
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:23,179
[ __ ] he went to jail

2102
01:23:25,039 --> 01:23:31,260
did you have any dealings with Mark

2103
01:23:27,060 --> 01:23:31,260
camera Caleb interactions

2104
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:37,500
no no interactions at all but uh

2105
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:40,560
um you know I was I was getting uh

2106
01:23:37,500 --> 01:23:43,020
cannabis culture or cannabis Canada from

2107
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:45,659
pretty much like the first issue you

2108
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:47,580
know I've always been a historian so I

2109

2111
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:53,219
years I was getting every single

2112
01:23:51,238 --> 01:23:55,619
magazine that was put out on on

2113
01:23:53,219 --> 01:23:59,340
everything so I've always been way more

2114
01:23:55,619 --> 01:24:01,859
of a reader than a talker yeah you know

2115
01:23:59,340 --> 01:24:04,079
it helps put details together sometimes

2116
01:24:01,859 --> 01:24:07,380
yeah it does yeah

2117
01:24:04,079 --> 01:24:10,859
but no no no uh direct you know dealings

2118
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:13,260
I mean uh the stuff I liked from from

2119
01:24:10,859 --> 01:24:16,439
those magazines though and and him were

2120
01:24:13,260 --> 01:24:19,260
like the ABC stuff from back yeah late

2121
01:24:16,439 --> 01:24:21,899
90s and then the purple Indica Purple

2122
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:25,920
Kush stuff that was in those early

2123
01:24:21,899 --> 01:24:27,179
issues as well but uh and then Emery was

2124
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:28,920
working with the same purple Indica

2125
01:24:27,179 --> 01:24:31,619
that's around now or at least a relative

2126
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:34,020
uh it wasn't Emery uh there was an

2127
01:24:31,619 --> 01:24:38,099
article uh based out of Snohomish County

2128
01:24:34,020 --> 01:24:41,040
yeah okay in Washington and it it

2129
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:43,980
basically dated that that stuff back

2130
01:24:41,039 --> 01:24:48,179
into the you know at the very least you

2131
01:24:43,979 --> 01:24:49,859
know early mid 90s yeah cool so

2132
01:24:48,179 --> 01:24:51,119
there was a question we were talking

2133
01:24:49,859 --> 01:24:52,500
about the other night and I was like oh

2134
01:24:51,119 --> 01:24:54,420
I need to ask not so that and I can't

2135
01:24:52,500 --> 01:24:55,800
remember what it was it had something to

2136
01:24:54,420 --> 01:24:57,300
do with uh

2137
01:24:55,800 --> 01:25:00,300
how did Kim do you make it to California

2138
01:24:57,300 --> 01:25:03,119
not so oh yeah how did it make it here

2139
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:06,300
yeah who brought it oh that's a pretty

2140
01:25:03,119 --> 01:25:07,439
simple story so it ties into the forums

2141
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:09,779
so

2142
01:25:07,439 --> 01:25:13,259
people start in 06 people started

2143
01:25:09,779 --> 01:25:15,179
getting excited about uh chemdog

2144
01:25:13,260 --> 01:25:18,420
and the chem dog story because it

2145
01:25:15,179 --> 01:25:19,079
started getting posted uh like

2146
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:23,819
um

2147
01:25:19,079 --> 01:25:25,380
uh Caleb was saying Shabba had got uh

2148
01:25:23,819 --> 01:25:28,979
got

2149
01:25:25,380 --> 01:25:30,420
um skunk V8 to start posting about his

2150
01:25:28,979 --> 01:25:33,658
you know Recollections and different

2151
01:25:30,420 --> 01:25:35,760
stuff like that and and then you know

2152
01:25:33,658 --> 01:25:37,379
that's kind of actually what started to

2153
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:40,619
reunite

2154
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:44,279
um uh people like Peabody and Joe brand

2155
01:25:40,619 --> 01:25:46,859
and uh chem dog all they all started

2156
01:25:44,279 --> 01:25:48,840
chatting I believe they even called like

2157
01:25:46,859 --> 01:25:52,139
the the seeds that ended up being the

2158
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:55,319
one through four the reunion seeds or

2159
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:57,960
yeah the number four they uh named The

2160
01:25:55,319 --> 01:25:59,939
Reunion Fino specific reunion Fino

2161
01:25:57,960 --> 01:26:02,158
that's what it was right because it was

2162
01:25:59,939 --> 01:26:04,319
like they had all they'd all kind of met

2163
01:26:02,158 --> 01:26:05,579
up as this you know like different

2164
01:26:04,319 --> 01:26:07,198
people were like hey dude they're

2165
01:26:05,579 --> 01:26:10,139
talking about your story on the internet

2166
01:26:07,198 --> 01:26:12,719
right and so

2167
01:26:10,139 --> 01:26:14,760
chem dog hadn't actually had the chem 91

2168
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:16,439
in quite a long time

2169
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:18,659
um he had gotten in trouble and lost it

2170
01:26:16,439 --> 01:26:21,779
and he had been working with some of the

2171
01:26:18,658 --> 01:26:23,279
uh chemdog Super Skunk hybrids that he

2172
01:26:21,779 --> 01:26:25,679
had and bag seed and different things

2173
01:26:23,279 --> 01:26:28,259
and when it got famous again he wanted

2174
01:26:25,679 --> 01:26:30,899
it back but nobody had it

2175
01:26:28,260 --> 01:26:34,260
so he got

2176
01:26:30,899 --> 01:26:36,119
um he got skunked he got skunk VA to go

2177
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:37,980
back East with it

2178
01:26:36,119 --> 01:26:39,779
and he was like if you bring it back to

2179
01:26:37,979 --> 01:26:41,158
bring it back to me and I've got this

2180
01:26:39,779 --> 01:26:43,559
different one that you guys don't have

2181
01:26:41,158 --> 01:26:44,939
out there and

2182
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:48,120
um I'll give it to you

2183
01:26:44,939 --> 01:26:49,859
so he went back east and and saw a dude

2184
01:26:48,119 --> 01:26:53,760
and gave him the and gave him the dog

2185
01:26:49,859 --> 01:26:56,339
and then uh Greg gave him the D

2186
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:59,520
and he came back and mommed it up and

2187
01:26:56,340 --> 01:27:01,860
that's how uh me and uh I see Collective

2188
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:06,020
both got it so it was skunkier that did

2189
01:27:01,859 --> 01:27:06,019
it brought it 100 oh cool

2190
01:27:06,079 --> 01:27:11,639
it was him it was it was all it's he's

2191
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:13,139
the reason it's he to me he's the reason

2192
01:27:11,639 --> 01:27:15,719
it's on the West Coast

2193
01:27:13,139 --> 01:27:18,840
very cool uh he put forth the effort he

2194
01:27:15,719 --> 01:27:21,179
went back East to see chemdog uh he gave

2195
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:22,819
he gave the dog to chem dog he got the

2196
01:27:21,179 --> 01:27:25,980
dude

2197
01:27:22,819 --> 01:27:28,679
if I remember too

2198
01:27:25,979 --> 01:27:29,459
um uh I believe that

2199
01:27:28,679 --> 01:27:32,219
um

2200
01:27:29,460 --> 01:27:34,739
chem dog tried to give him back the MSS

2201
01:27:32,219 --> 01:27:36,359
yeah he just said that but it was the

2202
01:27:34,738 --> 01:27:39,119
shorter one that was in the high times

2203
01:27:36,359 --> 01:27:41,279
and it wasn't what uh homie remembered

2204
01:27:39,119 --> 01:27:43,800
it all that makes a lot of sense too

2205
01:27:41,279 --> 01:27:46,679
yeah so then yeah so then he came back

2206
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:49,260
and he grew it up into a mom or whatever

2207
01:27:46,679 --> 01:27:52,079
and then uh I see Collective and myself

2208
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:53,460
got it not that long after that and but

2209
01:27:52,079 --> 01:27:57,960
to me it's like the reason it's on the

2210
01:27:53,460 --> 01:28:00,119
west coast is is skunk VA well on Greg

2211
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:00,960
uh on G's tour

2212
01:28:00,119 --> 01:28:05,698
um

2213
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:09,239
he uh he he dropped it off uh in the you

2214
01:28:05,698 --> 01:28:12,419
know LA area with swerve the chemd in 06

2215
01:28:09,238 --> 01:28:14,459
but this is awesome he

2216
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:17,520
um and swerve traded him a bunch of fake

2217
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:21,658
cuts for it you know no big deal and

2218
01:28:17,520 --> 01:28:24,960
then he also stopped at uh he stopped at

2219
01:28:21,658 --> 01:28:26,939
um you know obsolete's and Central cal

2220
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:29,698
um on his tour and then he stopped at

2221
01:28:26,939 --> 01:28:31,559
Joe Brands and then he headed up into

2222
01:28:29,698 --> 01:28:33,419
Oregon and stopped at some other folks

2223
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:36,179
place and I think he might have given

2224
01:28:33,420 --> 01:28:39,060
them the chemd too but he he stopped at

2225
01:28:36,179 --> 01:28:41,639
a good handful of places giving cuts out

2226
01:28:39,060 --> 01:28:44,219
selling weed at dispensaries all that

2227
01:28:41,639 --> 01:28:47,279
kind of stuff on his you know reunion

2228
01:28:44,219 --> 01:28:51,480
tour of sorts and this was like first

2229
01:28:47,279 --> 01:28:53,658
week of August 06. so it sounds like uh

2230
01:28:51,479 --> 01:28:57,678
skunk VA went over there

2231
01:28:53,658 --> 01:29:01,319
earlier in the year and and got

2232
01:28:57,679 --> 01:29:03,420
the same or similar cut I don't know

2233
01:29:01,319 --> 01:29:06,479
seems like there was a few cuts that got

2234
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:09,239
passed out that year yeah

2235
01:29:06,479 --> 01:29:11,519
yeah I mean it so but that's that's kind

2236
01:29:09,238 --> 01:29:13,319
of that's how that's how the the and

2237
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:15,420
that led to a bunch of stuff that led to

2238
01:29:13,319 --> 01:29:17,158
the one two three four

2239
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:19,699
getting popped and starting to get

2240
01:29:17,158 --> 01:29:19,698
traded around

2241
01:29:20,340 --> 01:29:23,880
um that led to the D that that led to

2242
01:29:22,198 --> 01:29:25,559
the one through the four and the D and

2243
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:27,119
all that starting to get added to the

2244
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:29,159
mix

2245
01:29:27,119 --> 01:29:32,279
um I don't know that the weird thing

2246
01:29:29,158 --> 01:29:35,759
about the the chem stuff is that my

2247
01:29:32,279 --> 01:29:37,019
buddy disliked the CIS quite a bit he

2248
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:39,480
thought it was ugly and he didn't like

2249
01:29:37,020 --> 01:29:40,679
how it got him high so he never brought

2250
01:29:39,479 --> 01:29:43,259
it West

2251
01:29:40,679 --> 01:29:45,779
and so it never really percolated around

2252
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:48,719
our crew

2253
01:29:45,779 --> 01:29:51,179
um you know we way later we saw some of

2254
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:53,279
the s1s

2255
01:29:51,179 --> 01:29:54,539
um but not the actual not the actual

2256
01:29:53,279 --> 01:29:56,158
first one

2257
01:29:54,539 --> 01:29:57,359
you know yeah

2258
01:29:56,158 --> 01:29:59,879
so

2259
01:29:57,359 --> 01:30:03,000
but yeah I mean that's and I you know

2260
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:05,460
I'm pretty sure uh you know he I I never

2261
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:07,079
I never lost it after skunk gave it to

2262
01:30:05,460 --> 01:30:08,880
me

2263
01:30:07,079 --> 01:30:11,340
um yeah I mean that and that's that's

2264
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:12,840
the kind of thing like you know uh CSI

2265
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:14,699
and I talk about it all the time it's

2266
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:16,980
like are there strains where like the

2267
01:30:14,698 --> 01:30:18,899
chain of custody wasn't broken

2268
01:30:16,979 --> 01:30:21,658
mm-hmm

2269
01:30:18,899 --> 01:30:23,759
right right because once you lose the

2270
01:30:21,658 --> 01:30:26,299
chain of custody

2271
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:29,940
um you know it's hard

2272
01:30:26,300 --> 01:30:33,539
it gets hard you know like

2273
01:30:29,939 --> 01:30:35,519
um because who knows you know you try to

2274
01:30:33,539 --> 01:30:36,899
you you lot I lost the sour diesel you

2275
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:38,760
try to get it back it's not the same

2276
01:30:36,899 --> 01:30:40,019
thing you remember you lost this you try

2277
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:41,639
to get it back it's not the same you

2278
01:30:40,020 --> 01:30:44,400
remember

2279
01:30:41,639 --> 01:30:45,840
um you know so on and so forth so

2280
01:30:44,399 --> 01:30:49,679
yeah

2281
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:52,139
kind of like when uh 707 uh Shabad got

2282
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:55,139
his Bubba back from me

2283
01:30:52,139 --> 01:30:57,119
um I I I don't think I did it on purpose

2284
01:30:55,139 --> 01:30:58,859
it was an accident it got mixed up in a

2285
01:30:57,119 --> 01:31:02,219
flat because I was bringing a ton of

2286
01:30:58,859 --> 01:31:05,579
people a bunch of stuff at a party and

2287
01:31:02,219 --> 01:31:08,698
uh then like a year later he's like yeah

2288
01:31:05,579 --> 01:31:11,460
in inspectors Bubba and I was like

2289
01:31:08,698 --> 01:31:14,599
what's this inspector's behind he had

2290
01:31:11,460 --> 01:31:17,520
bomb threat and not oh [ __ ]

2291
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:19,860
I was like oh my bad my bad I'm trying

2292
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:23,219
to give you you know the fake that's one

2293
01:31:19,859 --> 01:31:25,158
well not fake but you know yeah but yeah

2294
01:31:23,219 --> 01:31:28,079
that happens all the time

2295
01:31:25,158 --> 01:31:32,519
I think I'd take uh bomb threat over

2296
01:31:28,079 --> 01:31:34,319
over original maybe you can always get a

2297
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:37,260
new bomb threat if you have that that's

2298
01:31:34,319 --> 01:31:40,019
true that's true it's a good point you

2299
01:31:37,260 --> 01:31:41,460
know it's a question for you since uh

2300
01:31:40,020 --> 01:31:44,639
we've kind of meandered away from the

2301
01:31:41,460 --> 01:31:45,899
Forum stuff but do you CSI do you do any

2302
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:47,039
work with Jesus are you planning any

2303
01:31:45,899 --> 01:31:50,039
work with it

2304
01:31:47,039 --> 01:31:50,039
uh

2305
01:31:50,340 --> 01:31:56,880
maybe maybe if I could find a math Super

2306
01:31:53,100 --> 01:32:00,139
Skunk yeah yeah that was for you too

2307
01:31:56,880 --> 01:32:02,520
really yeah yeah

2308
01:32:00,139 --> 01:32:04,440
I was telling him last night that I

2309
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:06,659
think he should because

2310
01:32:04,439 --> 01:32:09,059
I think it's a it's a rad clone but it

2311
01:32:06,658 --> 01:32:11,099
is it is very finicky and it does make

2312
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:13,739
it a lot harder to to pull off reversals

2313
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:15,920
on unhappy finicky [ __ ] right it would

2314
01:32:13,738 --> 01:32:19,738
it would be really cool kind of

2315
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:23,158
uh attempt to remake like

2316
01:32:19,738 --> 01:32:25,979
um a sour type from you know building

2317
01:32:23,158 --> 01:32:29,099
blocks I mean yeah you know we all have

2318
01:32:25,979 --> 01:32:31,379
the the 91 but you know what building

2319
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:33,600
blocks you know it might not have to be

2320
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:36,900
the exact thing but what could you get

2321
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:39,000
close enough to to make a sour diesel

2322
01:32:36,899 --> 01:32:42,000
out of you know the original building

2323
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:44,760
blocks yeah you know

2324
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:46,679
I don't I think jesel leans closer to a

2325
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:49,280
sour type than it does it can type

2326
01:32:46,679 --> 01:32:49,279
personally

2327
01:32:49,380 --> 01:32:55,679
oh yeah definitely definitely yeah I

2328
01:32:51,779 --> 01:32:56,759
think so that's a cool one yeah yeah all

2329
01:32:55,679 --> 01:32:58,380
right so people want to hear something

2330
01:32:56,760 --> 01:32:59,760
about Irene I don't know what they want

2331
01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:01,859
to hear about Irene I think we've

2332
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:04,380
already told the story of Irene but do

2333
01:33:01,859 --> 01:33:07,859
you have any good Irene Tales

2334
01:33:04,380 --> 01:33:09,300
oh I don't know I mean

2335
01:33:07,859 --> 01:33:11,579
she's cool

2336
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:14,159
I think

2337
01:33:11,579 --> 01:33:16,859
um I I had Irene for a little bit

2338
01:33:14,158 --> 01:33:19,439
um and didn't realize she was she was

2339
01:33:16,859 --> 01:33:22,279
you know as as nice as she was until I

2340
01:33:19,439 --> 01:33:25,619
think I grew her Outdoors uh in maybe

2341
01:33:22,279 --> 01:33:27,119
2008 I'm thinking

2342
01:33:25,619 --> 01:33:28,920
yeah

2343
01:33:27,119 --> 01:33:30,059
I don't want to fudge the fudge the

2344
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:32,399
dates though

2345
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:34,560
um but yeah she came out so nice back

2346
01:33:32,399 --> 01:33:36,899
then you know

2347
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:41,239
good old-fashioned Atlanta

2348
01:33:36,899 --> 01:33:44,879
's finest yeah it is a special one yeah

2349
01:33:41,238 --> 01:33:47,638
I mean it doesn't have a whole whole lot

2350
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:49,619
of a story you know yeah just another

2351
01:33:47,639 --> 01:33:51,420
another bag seed really

2352
01:33:49,619 --> 01:33:53,880
that's where the golf boils down to it's

2353
01:33:51,420 --> 01:33:55,859
just another [ __ ] bad seat I mean

2354
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:57,359
that is one of the most humbling things

2355
01:33:55,859 --> 01:34:00,179
about breeding

2356
01:33:57,359 --> 01:34:02,899
is that a lot of the most famous strains

2357
01:34:00,179 --> 01:34:04,980
are total accidents

2358
01:34:02,899 --> 01:34:07,319
right and then you put a bunch of time

2359
01:34:04,979 --> 01:34:08,819
and work and effort into stuff and then

2360
01:34:07,319 --> 01:34:10,859
you know your air conditioner goes out

2361
01:34:08,819 --> 01:34:12,779
and some [ __ ] Herms and the seed off of

2362
01:34:10,859 --> 01:34:13,619
that is better than anything you tried

2363
01:34:12,779 --> 01:34:16,619
to do

2364
01:34:13,619 --> 01:34:19,738
and I think a lot of times when it comes

2365
01:34:16,619 --> 01:34:22,079
to like these stories the The Accidental

2366
01:34:19,738 --> 01:34:24,599
weed is so good it's what makes people

2367
01:34:22,079 --> 01:34:27,899
want to try to like shoehorn in that

2368
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:31,079
they had some intentional part of making

2369
01:34:27,899 --> 01:34:32,460
it not so much that I was just there or

2370
01:34:31,079 --> 01:34:34,639
we got late they don't want to say well

2371
01:34:32,460 --> 01:34:37,020
I just got lucky in my room

2372
01:34:34,639 --> 01:34:38,639
they want to be like oh well I did this

2373
01:34:37,020 --> 01:34:40,199
and I did this and I did this and then

2374
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:42,539
that happened and yeah now it's all the

2375
01:34:40,198 --> 01:34:44,698
weed that you all love Well everybody's

2376
01:34:42,539 --> 01:34:47,279
got to work their stud isn't that how

2377
01:34:44,698 --> 01:34:50,638
it's done you know but but really it was

2378
01:34:47,279 --> 01:34:52,738
more like you know I was I had my room I

2379
01:34:50,639 --> 01:34:54,960
ended up partying for a few days I

2380
01:34:52,738 --> 01:34:58,379
[ __ ] off I walked in there there was

2381
01:34:54,960 --> 01:35:02,939
some bananas I found some seeds trimming

2382
01:34:58,380 --> 01:35:06,539
that's like 99 of bag seed stories yeah

2383
01:35:02,939 --> 01:35:09,238
that that's kind of why I believe uh uh

2384
01:35:06,539 --> 01:35:12,000
Matt Berger and Josh D story because

2385
01:35:09,238 --> 01:35:15,178
it's not impressive it's not a you know

2386
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:17,340
it's a Herm you know in a little closet

2387
01:35:15,179 --> 01:35:20,340
under the stairs story and it's just

2388
01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:24,119
like who makes that stuff up

2389
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:27,360
that's just oops Yeah I mean you know I

2390
01:35:24,119 --> 01:35:29,819
it it that's very humbling but I I also

2391
01:35:27,359 --> 01:35:31,319
do think that a lot of that 90s weed it

2392
01:35:29,819 --> 01:35:34,319
just goes to show that when you're

2393
01:35:31,319 --> 01:35:36,179
Crossing things that like aren't when

2394
01:35:34,319 --> 01:35:37,799
you're Crossing real fire

2395
01:35:36,179 --> 01:35:40,260
you know

2396
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:42,300
um it's a lot easier to get you know

2397
01:35:40,260 --> 01:35:43,860
like was was Neville an amazing breeder

2398
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:45,659
or did he just get to get the best of

2399
01:35:43,859 --> 01:35:47,219
the best from America and cross it

2400
01:35:45,658 --> 01:35:49,439
together for the first time

2401
01:35:47,219 --> 01:35:50,460
right right you know what I'm saying

2402
01:35:49,439 --> 01:35:52,079
there's a there's an app there's

2403
01:35:50,460 --> 01:35:54,060
arguments to both

2404
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:55,979
you know he was the first person to

2405
01:35:54,060 --> 01:35:58,500
cross NL and skunk

2406
01:35:55,979 --> 01:36:00,559
right you know

2407
01:35:58,500 --> 01:36:05,460
huh yeah

2408
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:08,280
I'm rude no uh no uh I was thinking you

2409
01:36:05,460 --> 01:36:11,399
should get uh Tom on and try to get uh

2410
01:36:08,279 --> 01:36:13,920
uh figure out a little more details

2411
01:36:11,399 --> 01:36:16,138
about pine tar and all that kind of

2412
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:18,658
stuff because love to

2413
01:36:16,139 --> 01:36:21,420
you know I don't think he even knows who

2414
01:36:18,658 --> 01:36:23,819
I am to get him on

2415
01:36:21,420 --> 01:36:26,760
before he's not likely

2416
01:36:23,819 --> 01:36:29,158
I I think he's banned off of IC mag so

2417
01:36:26,760 --> 01:36:31,199
uh yeah I mean let me ask you like a

2418
01:36:29,158 --> 01:36:33,238
real question do you think that he would

2419
01:36:31,198 --> 01:36:36,439
be better for a live or do you think he

2420
01:36:33,238 --> 01:36:40,500
would be better for a a a lightly edited

2421
01:36:36,439 --> 01:36:43,379
uh podcast or something oh probably a a

2422
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:44,939
heavily edited podcast because I mean we

2423
01:36:43,380 --> 01:36:46,560
definitely Matt and I have definitely

2424
01:36:44,939 --> 01:36:50,158
interviewed some like knowledgeable

2425
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:52,760
Old-Timers right then like

2426
01:36:50,158 --> 01:36:55,559
yeah

2427
01:36:52,760 --> 01:36:58,880
Tom's a character I like him but man

2428
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:58,880
he'll yeah

2429
01:36:59,119 --> 01:37:06,179
off topic yeah you know yeah so there's

2430
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:07,380
there is a question everybody is asking

2431
01:37:06,179 --> 01:37:08,279
and it's up to you if you want to talk

2432
01:37:07,380 --> 01:37:09,840
about it I don't even know if you want

2433
01:37:08,279 --> 01:37:12,899
to deal with this one right now or save

2434
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:16,319
it for a full episode Caleb

2435
01:37:12,899 --> 01:37:18,658
backstory on Z what do you think

2436
01:37:16,319 --> 01:37:20,880
oh man

2437
01:37:18,658 --> 01:37:24,119
um I don't want to like

2438
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:25,500
say saying yet because yeah let's say

2439
01:37:24,119 --> 01:37:28,559
you want to save it for a full show of

2440
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:30,300
some sort later well I I still have some

2441
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:32,060
groans to do on that whole thing but

2442
01:37:30,300 --> 01:37:35,219
yeah man

2443
01:37:32,060 --> 01:37:39,420
I I wouldn't be surprised if it's not

2444
01:37:35,219 --> 01:37:41,039
just an S1 of of uh that green Sherbert

2445
01:37:39,420 --> 01:37:43,619
cut yeah

2446
01:37:41,039 --> 01:37:44,899
um there's there's just two too many

2447
01:37:43,619 --> 01:37:49,079
similarities

2448
01:37:44,899 --> 01:37:51,259
and the whole you know uh heterozygous

2449
01:37:49,079 --> 01:37:54,420
homozygous thing between the two of them

2450
01:37:51,260 --> 01:37:58,679
really kind of leans towards it just

2451
01:37:54,420 --> 01:38:00,658
being a that's one of that yeah but I

2452
01:37:58,679 --> 01:38:04,440
don't know um

2453
01:38:00,658 --> 01:38:07,379
uh I yeah I could go on and on on some

2454
01:38:04,439 --> 01:38:08,939
comparisons on you know how some of that

2455
01:38:07,380 --> 01:38:11,699
stuff could uh

2456
01:38:08,939 --> 01:38:14,460
could potentially make sense

2457
01:38:11,698 --> 01:38:15,960
um yeah but I don't know I don't know

2458
01:38:14,460 --> 01:38:18,060
yeah we'll save it for another time but

2459
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:19,920
yeah that's a that's a good answer one

2460
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:22,620
thing one thing that is done

2461
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:25,619
about that is that

2462
01:38:22,619 --> 01:38:27,300
um uh CSI and I and Matt we all talk all

2463
01:38:25,619 --> 01:38:30,960
the time about how when you compare

2464
01:38:27,300 --> 01:38:34,199
stories to what the plants tell you

2465
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:35,340
uh how they breed what their s1s look

2466
01:38:34,198 --> 01:38:36,719
like

2467
01:38:35,340 --> 01:38:39,420
um what what they look like when they

2468
01:38:36,719 --> 01:38:41,760
get crossed to different things and how

2469
01:38:39,420 --> 01:38:43,319
what your eyes tell you lines up with

2470
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:46,079
what the story is

2471
01:38:43,319 --> 01:38:48,840
right right right you know and sometimes

2472
01:38:46,079 --> 01:38:51,179
it it sometimes it adds a lot

2473
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:53,159
in terms of what you see

2474
01:38:51,179 --> 01:38:55,560
um you know like about I have a heart I

2475
01:38:53,158 --> 01:38:58,979
have a really hard time believing that

2476
01:38:55,560 --> 01:39:00,600
the the the CIS the 91 the chemd and the

2477
01:38:58,979 --> 01:39:01,678
one through four all came out of the

2478
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:04,440
same bud

2479
01:39:01,679 --> 01:39:06,359
yeah yeah you know um they're just too

2480
01:39:04,439 --> 01:39:08,519
vastly different to me

2481
01:39:06,359 --> 01:39:09,359
um you know but that's I wasn't there

2482
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:11,100
either

2483
01:39:09,359 --> 01:39:13,559
you know and a lot of this stuff is like

2484
01:39:11,100 --> 01:39:16,500
the most famous stories

2485
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:18,539
they almost because almost all of them

2486
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:20,880
come from accidents and because a lot of

2487
01:39:18,539 --> 01:39:23,100
them come from other people it's like

2488
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:25,139
the people that marketed stuff or

2489
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:27,840
marketed Skittles or marketed cookie or

2490
01:39:25,139 --> 01:39:29,400
whatever like they probably you know

2491
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:31,940
different people get it maybe it doesn't

2492
01:39:29,399 --> 01:39:33,839
get quite as famous

2493
01:39:31,939 --> 01:39:35,099
you know

2494
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:36,659
um you know and they should get great

2495
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:37,739
credit for marketing it to the point

2496
01:39:36,658 --> 01:39:41,238
that they did

2497
01:39:37,738 --> 01:39:41,238
yeah right oh yeah

2498
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:48,119
I've never disputed that um you know I I

2499
01:39:45,300 --> 01:39:51,060
give lots of people accolades for Mar

2500
01:39:48,119 --> 01:39:53,099
successfully marketing and you know

2501
01:39:51,060 --> 01:39:55,320
building you know clones that would

2502
01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:56,699
never have been anything up you know to

2503
01:39:55,319 --> 01:39:59,939
what they are

2504
01:39:56,698 --> 01:40:01,500
uh what I've always you know frowned on

2505
01:39:59,939 --> 01:40:03,719
of course is you know people being

2506
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:07,079
dishonest doing it I think you can do it

2507
01:40:03,719 --> 01:40:09,480
honestly and still be successful sure

2508
01:40:07,079 --> 01:40:12,000
you know having to just make up big old

2509
01:40:09,479 --> 01:40:14,519
big old you know fictitious backstories

2510
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:17,340
or yeah like you're the one responsible

2511
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:19,679
for it that's why instead of you know I

2512
01:40:17,340 --> 01:40:21,659
mean there's cats like you know Josh and

2513
01:40:19,679 --> 01:40:23,340
Matt who are like oh yeah it was a Herm

2514
01:40:21,658 --> 01:40:25,198
accident under the stairs and then

2515
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:26,819
there's other cats you know who are like

2516
01:40:25,198 --> 01:40:28,678
yes we created that from our

2517
01:40:26,819 --> 01:40:32,279
multi-thousand plant grows aren't we

2518
01:40:28,679 --> 01:40:36,060
awesome yes yes we popped we popped 15

2519
01:40:32,279 --> 01:40:38,039
seeds and the 20th was the best so you

2520
01:40:36,060 --> 01:40:41,880
know

2521
01:40:38,039 --> 01:40:45,719
um you know I I think the the truth is

2522
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:47,579
is the the biggest factor for me yeah

2523
01:40:45,719 --> 01:40:49,439
and yeah and there's an aspect where and

2524
01:40:47,579 --> 01:40:52,500
and you know we should say this too is

2525
01:40:49,439 --> 01:40:54,658
that truth is a most people Everyone

2526
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:56,158
likes to say they want the truth but

2527
01:40:54,658 --> 01:40:58,559
like people that really care about it

2528
01:40:56,158 --> 01:41:02,099
it's like a really small percentage yeah

2529
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:03,780
oh most people like truth if it helps

2530
01:41:02,100 --> 01:41:07,020
them burnish their money or their

2531
01:41:03,779 --> 01:41:09,658
reputation or whatever else sure and the

2532
01:41:07,020 --> 01:41:11,340
truth is usually boring you know people

2533
01:41:09,658 --> 01:41:12,198
who are looking for excitement from the

2534
01:41:11,340 --> 01:41:15,000
truth

2535
01:41:12,198 --> 01:41:18,019
they're gonna be like oh well that was

2536
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:20,698
lame yeah something up I don't care

2537
01:41:18,020 --> 01:41:23,400
especially when the answer is 99 of the

2538
01:41:20,698 --> 01:41:25,799
time oh it's a bad seed yeah

2539
01:41:23,399 --> 01:41:27,738
or yeah or you know or it happened in an

2540
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:30,179
accident at my buddy's house

2541
01:41:27,738 --> 01:41:31,859
of this or I was you know like you know

2542
01:41:30,179 --> 01:41:33,779
you were early involved and you know the

2543
01:41:31,859 --> 01:41:34,679
story even just knowing the story is

2544
01:41:33,779 --> 01:41:36,840
cool

2545
01:41:34,679 --> 01:41:38,460
right but then people want to be part

2546
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:41,779
like they want to be this active

2547
01:41:38,460 --> 01:41:43,859
component that was critical to the story

2548
01:41:41,779 --> 01:41:46,920
you know

2549
01:41:43,859 --> 01:41:48,899
right and I I did forget someone earlier

2550
01:41:46,920 --> 01:41:50,880
that was really important when I was was

2551
01:41:48,899 --> 01:41:52,259
you know coming in and it was uh that

2552
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:54,840
was doing reversals before I was and

2553
01:41:52,260 --> 01:41:57,000
that was Rascal I I think I would be

2554
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:58,860
remiss not to mention him because he was

2555
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:00,899
doing good things and had legitimate

2556
01:41:58,859 --> 01:42:02,759
Cuts you know for the most part uh as

2557
01:42:00,899 --> 01:42:04,500
far as I know like he was doing good

2558
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:06,179
[ __ ] work and he was doing it at a

2559
01:42:04,500 --> 01:42:07,979
time when it wasn't popular when people

2560
01:42:06,179 --> 01:42:09,960
were pushing back against feminized

2561
01:42:07,979 --> 01:42:11,339
seeds so I could that guy props too all

2562
01:42:09,960 --> 01:42:13,739
the stuff that that guy made between

2563
01:42:11,340 --> 01:42:16,800
whatever it was 09 and 12 or whatever

2564
01:42:13,738 --> 01:42:18,479
yeah all those hybrids are fire yeah

2565
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:20,760
there was some good [ __ ] in there I mean

2566
01:42:18,479 --> 01:42:22,678
he really maybe not all but like the

2567
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:24,840
vast majority of the stuff he had some

2568
01:42:22,679 --> 01:42:26,579
really nice cuts and he was crossing

2569
01:42:24,840 --> 01:42:28,860
them together and they led to some

2570
01:42:26,579 --> 01:42:31,019
really nice things yeah I mean white

2571
01:42:28,859 --> 01:42:32,639
fire you know a lot of people don't even

2572
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:33,960
know like about the white anymore like

2573
01:42:32,639 --> 01:42:35,520
not a lot of people talk about it but

2574
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:38,100
that was the essence behind the white

2575
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:39,780
fire that was [ __ ] cool right right

2576
01:42:38,100 --> 01:42:44,039
yep

2577
01:42:39,779 --> 01:42:45,899
that uh what that that's one I'd like to

2578
01:42:44,039 --> 01:42:49,560
touch on too in the future

2579
01:42:45,899 --> 01:42:52,379
um oh yeah they they uh you know the the

2580
01:42:49,560 --> 01:42:56,219
swamp boys uh big Ricky in particular he

2581
01:42:52,380 --> 01:42:58,319
uh he's alluded a lot to knowing exactly

2582
01:42:56,219 --> 01:43:01,800
what the hybrid of the white is because

2583
01:42:58,319 --> 01:43:05,279
it's supposedly a TK hybrid

2584
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:07,159
um but you know he he likes riddles and

2585
01:43:05,279 --> 01:43:10,019
secrets so

2586
01:43:07,158 --> 01:43:12,839

2589
01:43:15,359 --> 01:43:19,738
craft

2590
01:43:16,380 --> 01:43:21,840
uh some of his Instagram posts and how

2591
01:43:19,738 --> 01:43:23,218
to make it like you know he because he's

2592
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:25,319
got his own language

2593
01:43:23,219 --> 01:43:27,118
correct when it comes to that you know

2594
01:43:25,319 --> 01:43:30,000
have you seen have you seen stuff like

2595
01:43:27,118 --> 01:43:33,059
the white inside the TKS ones yeah yeah

2596
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:37,260
you have there there was a there was one

2597
01:43:33,060 --> 01:43:39,000
plant in our our first run of them where

2598
01:43:37,260 --> 01:43:41,639
um actually there was there was there

2599
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:43,439
was four plants that uh we pulled out of

2600
01:43:41,639 --> 01:43:46,980
the first run

2601
01:43:43,439 --> 01:43:49,618
um and uh one was a green Girl Scout

2602
01:43:46,979 --> 01:43:51,959
cookie like a green form cut

2603
01:43:49,618 --> 01:43:55,618
um other was a plant that looked just

2604
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:58,618
like the white you know not oh but so

2605
01:43:55,618 --> 01:44:01,198
similar yeah it was obvious and then

2606
01:43:58,618 --> 01:44:04,079
there was the number 50 and the 51 where

2607
01:44:01,198 --> 01:44:06,178
my which were my two actual favorites of

2608
01:44:04,079 --> 01:44:08,579
the whole bunch and

2609
01:44:06,179 --> 01:44:11,579
then you know I I smoked both those

2610
01:44:08,579 --> 01:44:13,859
heavily and the 50 turned out to be my

2611
01:44:11,579 --> 01:44:16,679
absolute favorite of the whole bunch and

2612
01:44:13,859 --> 01:44:18,960
so that's the one I kept and still play

2613
01:44:16,679 --> 01:44:22,380
with from the first and then I did

2614
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:25,500
another 100 plus you know TK S1 pop and

2615
01:44:22,380 --> 01:44:28,139
you know got other selections from there

2616
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:29,698
yeah so Caleb what do you think about

2617
01:44:28,139 --> 01:44:32,579
cookies

2618
01:44:29,698 --> 01:44:34,039
uh that's a question someone asked what

2619
01:44:32,579 --> 01:44:37,079
do you think

2620
01:44:34,039 --> 01:44:38,238
uh I think that goes into the category

2621
01:44:37,079 --> 01:44:43,319
of

2622
01:44:38,238 --> 01:44:46,759
2000 uh what 2010 and on for 2010 2011

2623
01:44:43,319 --> 01:44:50,880
yeah people people ask a bunch of that

2624
01:44:46,760 --> 01:44:53,039
and I think I mean it's a story

2625
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:54,600
you know and it's a story that like

2626
01:44:53,039 --> 01:44:56,399
there's a lot of pieces that aren't

2627
01:44:54,600 --> 01:44:58,800
known that well

2628
01:44:56,399 --> 01:45:00,479
um but it's definitely one that's going

2629
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:02,159
to create a it's you know it's a super

2630
01:45:00,479 --> 01:45:04,579
popular brand there's a lot of money

2631
01:45:02,158 --> 01:45:06,899
involved there's a lot of rep involved

2632
01:45:04,579 --> 01:45:08,519
and uh it's one of those things if you

2633
01:45:06,899 --> 01:45:10,559
don't get it exactly right that it's

face or chatting about stuff they both

2681
01:47:01,139 --> 01:47:06,779
pushed for quite a long time to get you

2682
01:47:04,260 --> 01:47:09,659
to tell stories and talk [ __ ]

would want to hear it let's chat let's

2686
01:47:14,399 --> 01:47:18,179
talk history and you know and there's an

2687
01:47:16,618 --> 01:47:19,500
aspect to it too where it's like a lot

2688
01:47:18,179 --> 01:47:21,480
of this stuff we're talking about with

2689
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:23,399
you guys this is what we've all been

2690
01:47:21,479 --> 01:47:24,419
doing amongst each other privately for

2691
01:47:23,399 --> 01:47:27,059
[ __ ] ever

2692
01:47:24,420 --> 01:47:29,340
yeah so we've all heard each other's

2693
01:47:27,060 --> 01:47:31,860
stupid [ __ ] stories 100 times you

2694
01:47:29,340 --> 01:47:33,779
know and and all that and so this is

2695
01:47:31,859 --> 01:47:36,000
this is really how information gets

2696
01:47:33,779 --> 01:47:37,259
information and cuts gets saved and

2697
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:40,319
shared

2698
01:47:37,260 --> 01:47:42,539
and you know history survives and

2699
01:47:40,319 --> 01:47:44,939
generally the point of all this is to

2700
01:47:42,539 --> 01:47:48,139
get you know versions of History out

2701
01:47:44,939 --> 01:47:48,138
there and gets passed along

2702
01:47:49,340 --> 01:47:54,300
