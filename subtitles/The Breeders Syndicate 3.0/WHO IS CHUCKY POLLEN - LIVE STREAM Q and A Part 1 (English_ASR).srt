00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:23,280
texted me too a few times trying to get

540
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,880
you on the show oh yeah yeah I thought

541
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:27,200
you were trying to joke on my moms I was

542
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,799
about to say we have problems but no no

543
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,159
she really did I'd have her come up here

544
00:20:29,798 --> 00:20:33,519
bro but she's doing [ __ ] she's kind of

545
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,360
but she's kind of an airhead bro my

546
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:37,639
point is my mom's an airhead sometimes

547
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:39,240
and like she bro I was growing one of my

548
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:42,080
first grows ever not to get off on a

549
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:44,240
tangent but I was growing like PC grow

550
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:46,798
like in Little Boxes shoe box grows in

551
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,880
my closet bro when I was like [ __ ] 16

552
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:50,279
[ __ ] around I know I don't like I

553
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,919
don't consider myself a grower because

554
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:54,798
I've like I've started to grow so many

555
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:56,280
[ __ ] times bro and would get to a

556
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:58,918
point where it's like I'm about to

557
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:00,519
flower you know and I I be rent in a

558
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:02,440
house or something and like where I'm at

559
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:04,119
you get caught with weed bro where I was

560
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,320
at growing up you going to [ __ ] jail

561
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:07,798
big time so I'd freak out landlord show

562
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:09,519
up whatever so like I never really

563
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:11,278
consider myself a grower so I just

564
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:13,200
that's why I naturally gravitated

565
00:21:11,278 --> 00:21:14,440
gravitated towards like the hustling

566
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,600
aspect of it just trying to make a

567
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:21,200
dollar or whatever anyways uh back to my

568
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:23,278
story I send the money off my mom drops

569
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,960

599
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,840

600
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,599
seeds to where I was at bro so like in

601
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:38,038
my mind I'm using bag seeds and I'm like

602
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:40,158
dude this is the best bag seed I ever

603
00:22:38,038 --> 00:22:42,200
[ __ ] seen in life and so I hit the

604
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:45,400
dudes back up thinking like man I need

605
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:47,440
more of this [ __ ] bro so another like

606
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:50,600
month or two [ __ ] around another

607
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,640
$600 and I get I get another zip and

608
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:54,399
between these two Zips bro I come out

609
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:58,200
with like 20 seeds but after I pop them

610
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,400
all I end up with 15 seeds bro and

611
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,880
that's

612
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:05,440
sometimes the 15 is what I call them Kim

613
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:09,679
15s whatever the yeah you know each one

614
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:11,880

know Kim 4 Kim one I didn't know about

617
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:18,000

618
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:20,759
feel dumb because like but do they

619
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,480
really matter those other ones that Kim

620
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:26,000
do they matter when you through 15 I

621
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,079
can't speak speak on them because I a

622
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,480
never grown them in particular but like

623
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:33,158

631
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,799
like talking about this [ __ ] to nobody

632
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:51,519
really other than maybe maybe like one

633
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:54,119
person like but anyway so I get the

634
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:55,440
seeds I call them 15 or whatever and I

635
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:57,278
start growing these seeds or whatever

636
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:01,519
and I'm taking Cuts I just learn I was

637
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:03,359
on like 420 CH or I was get like all

638
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:05,918
them I don't know like I'm terrible at

639
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:07,879
dates but like overgrow and all the [ __ ]

640
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,919
started slowly coming out over the years

641
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:13,240
so like yeah I learned about like

642
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:15,559
cloning and like you know propagation

643
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:18,640
and like how to you know how to keep

644
00:24:15,558 --> 00:24:20,678
genetics alive and the importance of

645
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,120
that and I'm reading on there and then

646
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:24,679
I'm seeing these cats on there talking

647
00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:26,199
about like Kim and [ __ ] and it freaked

648
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:29,320

650
00:24:29,319 --> 00:24:33,119
I didn't want to really register and be

651
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:36,720
on there like that but I did like to the

652
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:39,519
self docks yeah yeah and uh so I'm

653

91 and the D and the CIS and like all

655
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,919
this [ __ ] and it's blowing my [ __ ]

656
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,599
mind because I'm like is this the same

657
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,880
[ __ ] that I I got or like what yeah of

658
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:55,359
course right so I'm sitting there

659
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,360
thinking like what the [ __ ] do I got

660
00:24:55,359 --> 00:25:00,879
right and it kind of like sent me on

661
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:04,240
this Quest bro to like you know meet up

662
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,840

663
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,038
different the different cams out and and

664
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:12,398
over the years of course I've traded

665
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:14,038
different [ __ ] you know I mean this is

666
00:25:12,398 --> 00:25:16,639
about the Kim we'll get we'll get into

667
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:18,679
other [ __ ] maybe in another podcast but

668
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,799
you know over the years I traded other

669
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:23,759
[ __ ] so I end up getting the cist the D

670
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:26,639
the 91 you know and like I said I got

671
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:28,919
packs from CSI number one and the four I

672
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,240
ain't [ __ ] popped them yet

673
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:33,840
but so as I'm going through you know the

674
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:37,880
year over these you know 10 15 years I'm

675
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:39,038
like reading this [ __ ] and like kind of

676
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,919
you know just like I said just want to

677
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:43,278
know what's up so uh I get with a few

678
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,200
cats from the

679
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:49,079
Discord not too long ago and of course

680
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:51,960
everything I got legit all the all the

681
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:56,119
cuts I got were were real deal we

682
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:57,880
compared you know notes notes and cuts

683
00:25:56,119 --> 00:26:00,879
and tried each other's samples and [ __ ]

684
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,640
like that but the interesting thing dude

685
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,960
is my 1 through

686
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:08,120
15 they're [ __ ] they're so close to

687
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,960
all you know the different cuts but

688
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:12,359
they're I would argue that they're A

689
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:15,798
step above all these because like that

690
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:18,158
would make sense well even on even on

691
00:26:15,798 --> 00:26:20,918
csi's website bro if you go in there and

692
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:24,360
read about the 91 s1s and [ __ ] like that

693
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:25,720
he says Duke make sure you take a cut

694
00:26:24,359 --> 00:26:29,158
because these are gonna probably be

695
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:33,079
better and can produce better Cuts in

696
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:35,039
the parents there you go so I'm thinking

697
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:37,639
maybe the 91 I'm thinking some of these

698
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:39,000
cats got s1s and or whatever maybe I

699
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,640
don't know because I do got a little bit

700
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,798
of variation in my 15 but they do have

701
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:47,640
that Kim you know that rotten just

702
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:50,158
[ __ ] tomatoey rotten flavor I don't

703
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:52,120
know how to I'm not good at uh

704
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,278
describing sense I I smoke too much

705
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:57,398
toback and [ __ ] like that but yeah who

706
00:26:54,278 --> 00:26:59,599
cares about chps anyways but that's kind

707
00:26:57,398 --> 00:27:00,678
of you know kind of where we're at you

708
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:02,158
know I've been wanting to come out

709
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:04,120
recently because I see a lot of these

710
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,080
guys I'm not gonna mention any names or

711
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:08,199
whatever but people in the game or in

712
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:10,439
the industry that maybe have brought Kim

713
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:13,159
to the Forefront [ __ ] like that they're

714
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:15,320
on here talking about runs [ __ ] white

715
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:18,600
runs no disrespect I saw you did your

716
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:20,319
white runs Matt I'm not ping on you I I

717
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:23,240
get it you gotta play the game to win

718
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:26,079
but but what all I'm saying bro is that

719
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:28,798
I feel like the disrespecting Kim bro my

720
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:31,038
Kim's [ __ ] I see how come to that

721
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:33,079
conclusion it ain't even well it's not

722
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:34,558
even about my Kims bro because I ain't

723
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:36,199
selling my [ __ ] and ain't none of y'all

724
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:38,639
getting no [ __ ] Cuts either so don't

725
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:42,240
be asking me [ __ ] don't be asking him

726
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:45,440
please but at the end of the day these

727
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,079
guys out here [ __ ] smoking M bags

728
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,840
booty hole runs and [ __ ] like that

729
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:52,439
acting like it's the bee's knees bro

730
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:56,558
that it's you remember when when good

731
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:58,840
weed was green bro yeah yeah used to

732
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:03,960
be these guys remember when people

733
00:27:58,839 --> 00:28:06,720
talked about like Sour hazes OG types OG

734
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:09,759
typers typers yeah you can't you can't

735
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:13,839
even find the OG no more no it's really

736
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:16,038
hard well people want that now so my

737
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:17,959
thought is these cats that brought Kim

738
00:28:16,038 --> 00:28:20,679
dog to the Forefront they ain't really

739
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,759
respecting Kim like they should bro and

740
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:25,440
my thing is I want to start a movement

741
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:27,038
where we get Kim back in Forefront bro

742
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,519
these guys out here talking about Kim

743
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:32,319
Auto flowers [ __ ] that you know what I'm

744
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:34,558
saying yeah that's not respect that

745
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:37,079
ain't respect no disrespect but you know

746
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:38,798
what I'm saying like yeah the this

747
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:41,319
generation coming up right now they need

748
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:44,879
to know what the [ __ ] is up with Kim bro

749
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:49,798
it don't matter if it's CIS D

750
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:51,159
914 whatever bro anyways that's I see

751
00:28:49,798 --> 00:28:52,960
people we wanted to bring this up

752
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:55,120

766
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:27,200
sure do [ __ ] know a lot like I said I

767
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:29,000
I joined up with y'all I'm being for

768
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,519
real though I know

769
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,038
yes you are I joined up with y'all

770
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:34,200
because I want to get better at growing

771
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:37,038
like I said I you know that's where I'm

772
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:39,840
here bro and and for the past like

773
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:41,480
probably I don't know 10 years I've been

774
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:43,119
like I said I consider myself a grower

775
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,200
but like really these since I've been

776
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:48,199
out and before I got locked up again I

777
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:51,360
was really going hard at it bro

778
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:54,200
but yeah that's that's basically it on

779
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:55,519
the Kim stuff well you know one of the

780
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,640
one of the most interesting questions I

781
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:58,839
thought since you were talking about

782
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,799
being a third generation Smuggler

783
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:04,599
uh we have a guy called sheets on fire

784
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:06,200
asking uh your first prison smuggle what

785
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:10,759
what was that experience

786
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:12,759

00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,240
personal because like you went to school

963
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,800

around you know pretty easy you know

970
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,119
what I'm saying like anyways back to

971
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:32,119
grows off I didn't really do a lot of

972
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:33,640
that cuz bro that's not really my style

973
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:35,838
like a lot of times I just hustled for

974
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:37,199
what I what I needed and did it the best

975
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:41,039
like the right way I could do for

976
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:45,639
hustling but like my my I will say the

977
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:47,199
one I could share I guess is my stepdad

978
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:50,159
well he was my stepdad my mom's

979
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:52,000
boyfriend for a while this dude I ain't

980
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:53,799
gonna say his name or whatever but he

981
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,280

00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:35,000
kind of seed out of it so now I'm not

1103
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:37,239
only I going to have clones but I'm

1104
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,119
going to have uh you know seeds of stuff

1105
00:42:37,239 --> 00:42:42,000
too so um as far as you know taking

1106
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:43,680
stuff early for sure if you're doing a

1107
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,559
seed run sometimes and when you're

1108
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:48,440
making uh seed for yourself especially

1109
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:51,519
when you ain't selling seed and you only

1110
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:53,200
want so many if you do it early enough

1111
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:55,358
and you don't the bud maybe the bud

1112
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:57,358
isn't what you want it to be or maybe

1113
00:42:55,358 --> 00:43:00,119
whatever you know you can run in

1114
00:42:57,358 --> 00:43:01,838
problems pest maybe even or even you're

1115
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:04,400
outside and you you don't want to run

1116
00:43:01,838 --> 00:43:05,639
into certain weather conditions I mean

1117
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,920
there's a times where you do it but

1118
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:09,639
mainly for me like I've taken [ __ ] when

1119
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,119
I just want to get the seeds I I I check

1120
00:43:09,639 --> 00:43:13,440
to see if I got enough mature seeds that

1121
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:15,440
I want and I'll go ahead and take it and

1122
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,039
just have my clones going or a r or

1123
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,639
whatever but yeah I mean there's times

1124
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:20,440
you could do that for sure I don't know

1125

out is one thing but making a dollar but

1168
00:44:54,679 --> 00:45:01,078
let's jump back to the question yeah go

1169
00:44:57,358 --> 00:45:04,000
Chan says besides blue stuff what

1170
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:06,000
hybrids are you most excit excited about

1171
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,838
looking through and

1172
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,400
why I don't know if that's me or you I

1173
00:45:08,838 --> 00:45:13,558
think it's probably you but I think you

1174
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:16,400
like blue too I think you are a blue

1175
00:45:13,559 --> 00:45:19,319
Champion I got blue bro I actually got a

1176
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:22,079
I got a few jars of blue a couple jars

1177
00:45:19,318 --> 00:45:24,358
of blue on me uh I got the blueberry ex

1178
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:27,119
I got three of them on me I was gonna

1179
00:45:24,358 --> 00:45:29,119
pull out at some point if we had time

1180
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:30,680
nice I should have rolled that in here I

1181
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:33,240
didn't thinking about it didn't think

1182
00:45:30,679 --> 00:45:35,399
about it you that [ __ ] seated though I

1183
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:36,799
did SE it with the males the so it's

1184
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:40,000
like you know I

1185
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:42,000
got but uh but uh for the answer his

1186
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,239
question besides the blue stuff what

1187
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,599
hybrids are you most excited about

1188
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:49,879
looking through and why so I mean for

1189
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:51,640
blue I mean he said besides blue stuff

1190
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:54,039
but blue stuff the blue resent I think

1191
00:45:51,639 --> 00:45:58,358
is probably my next thing or maybe the

1192
00:45:54,039 --> 00:46:01,119
uh was it Blue Sour yeah stuff just

1193
00:45:58,358 --> 00:46:03,519
because like I do like uh I do like that

1194
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:04,960
blue flavor man like the like the but I

1195
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:08,920
want something a little bit more potency

1196
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:11,280
I will say U my particular Expressions I

1197
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:14,800
got I like them the flavor is great on

1198
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:16,040
the ex but I think like I did hit that's

1199
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,400
why I hit them because I figur I would

1200
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:20,159
have to hunt them a little bit and also

1201
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,720
like I did get some really nice color

1202
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:24,639
but not the color I wanted so like yeah

1203
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:27,318
I made enough seed to like hunt through

1204
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:30,358
them you know what I mean but um most

1205
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:32,480
hybrid's most excited for bro I did I

1206
00:46:30,358 --> 00:46:34,679
mean I just cut down my Rank Stranger

1207
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:38,199

1210
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:46,160
the orange hand uh hand cleaner stuff

1211
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,680
that's kind of gritty that mechanics use

1212
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:49,118
it's not real orange smelling but it

1213
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:51,279

1214
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:52,760

the rank Changers got that like

1216
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:58,839
chemically like uh like orange kind of

1217
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:01,200
like hand soapy kind of smell bro not

1218

1231
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:32,118
questions I'm let's do next question

1232
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:34,519
list list a bunch of [ __ ] off but uh if

1233
00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:37,358
you could go back to one line you made

1234
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:39,599
and start a new project from it what

1235
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:43,199
would it be from

1236
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:46,200
Sean I'd probably do the

1237
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:49,279
the strawberry cream stuff again which

1238
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:52,399
isn't which is still Berry

1239
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:54,800

1240
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,160
reside did you like I know you've talked

1241
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,720
about a little bit here and there but

1242
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:00,480
from years of doing doing drugs bro my

1243
00:47:57,719 --> 00:48:03,000
memory is terrible when when what what

1244

1249
00:48:16,679 --> 00:48:21,318
from a lady named golden eyes I think it

1250
00:48:19,159 --> 00:48:25,279
was that you know it's the internet you

1251
00:48:21,318 --> 00:48:27,199
don't really know but um golden eyes uh

1252
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,920
was on the forums back in the day and

1253
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:34,078
she did some strawberry cough

1254
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:35,720
s1s that had males um so yeah that's

1255
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:38,079
where it came from but it did it did

1256
00:48:35,719 --> 00:48:40,039
carry a much stronger uh

1257
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:42,480
strawberry expression than even

1258
00:48:40,039 --> 00:48:44,358
strawberry cough and flavor was there

1259
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:47,639

no but it would probably be a good

1264
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,240
almost a better place to look because it

1265
00:48:57,318 --> 00:49:01,039
would be more pure like I think that the

1266
00:48:59,239 --> 00:49:02,959
golden light stuff was probably a pollen

1267
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:05,358
contamination with all the males in it

1268

cultivar that made you decide to go all

1293
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:09,880
in on breeding I'd imagine the the

1294
00:50:06,838 --> 00:50:15,279
Bonnet stuff but maybe it started before

1295

that oh yeah know it was um Hogs breath

1296

Hogs breath the old San Diego Hogs

1297
00:50:17,079 --> 00:50:22,039

00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:38,400
that but I think one of the first packs

1349
00:52:35,639 --> 00:52:43,118
that I popped bro was from

1350
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:45,639
CSI that made me like want to dive deep

1351
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:49,440
in into just learning more about weed

1352
00:52:45,639 --> 00:52:50,400

1354
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,838
about that from not really a Breeder's

1355
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:56,280
perspective but just wanted to know more

1356
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:59,920
about the plan so I popped uh I think it

1357
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:02,240

location preferences Etc should I put my

1458
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:19,400
grinder on for the best chance in

1459
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:19,400
matching with Matt

1460
00:57:20,798 --> 00:57:26,880
guys you I mean I settings for the

1461
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:30,599
grinder

1462
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:32,358
I don't know like the website you got

1463
00:57:30,599 --> 00:57:33,920
you got Matt the blueberry [ __ ] King

1464
00:57:32,358 --> 00:57:36,318
on here right now you're talking about

1465
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:38,880
[ __ ] grinder bro grinder what is

1466
00:57:36,318 --> 00:57:40,519
grinder anyway that's my bro you don't

1467
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:43,960
want to know bro don't want to know I

1468
00:57:40,519 --> 00:57:45,798
haven't heard of this site this is

1469
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:48,119
maybe

1470
00:57:45,798 --> 00:57:50,880
connections maybe I'm on it I don't know

1471
00:57:48,119 --> 00:57:55,119
maybe I don't know see anyways we got

1472
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:59,640
one from Bittersweet the OG

1473
00:57:55,119 --> 00:58:03,039
King all in timing in regular breeding

1474
00:57:59,639 --> 00:58:06,239
difference in like short flowering and

1475
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:08,599
long flowering on how it affects seed

1476
00:58:06,239 --> 00:58:10,879
production that's a great question it's

1477
00:58:08,599 --> 00:58:12,240
a great question so um you know like

1478
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:15,720
usually like in my brain I put it

1479
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:18,879
between 10 to 14 weeks or actually 8 to

1480
00:58:15,719 --> 00:58:21,159
10 sometimes seven which is rare as [ __ ]

1481
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:25,358
the 7 to 10 and then 10 to 14 and then

1482
00:58:21,159 --> 00:58:26,679
you got 14 to 22 kind of um you like

1483
00:58:25,358 --> 00:58:29,199
Ping to hit usually usually at four

1484
00:58:26,679 --> 00:58:30,879
weeks for the for the Afghani dominant

1485
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:33,000
type which is almost everything we'll

1486
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:35,119
see you know unless people are going to

1487
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:38,159
smoking like Haze hybrids like real Haze

1488
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:39,680
hybrids uh 10 to 14 are some of the more

1489
00:58:38,159 --> 00:58:42,358
hazy hybrids like we're talking about

1490
00:58:39,679 --> 00:58:44,558
like um like even the mango Haze stuff

1491
00:58:42,358 --> 00:58:48,880
the the electric buo mango haze from

1492
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:51,079
High lome stuff like that H seven six

1493
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:54,798
range and then longer than that dude you

1494
00:58:51,079 --> 00:58:56,440
can hit it 10 11 12 cuz that shit'll

1495
00:58:54,798 --> 00:58:59,119
just flower forever once it goes longer

1496
00:58:56,440 --> 00:59:03,000
than that you know I thought this was a

1497
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:05,680
good question from from what I had for

1498
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:08,000
H&amp;L and maybe you can speak on it too

1499
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:10,038
but you know something I didn't realize

1500
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,239
was you know or it's not even the

1501
00:59:10,039 --> 00:59:14,000
question I guess it's more something you

1502
00:59:11,239 --> 00:59:17,399
could speak on but I didn't realize that

1503
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:19,280
if you're growing outside and you get

1504
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:22,440
Maybe by accident or on purpose you get

1505
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:25,680
seated Bud that you know that can cause

1506
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:27,400
like Bud rod and [ __ ] man like oh yeah I

1507
00:59:25,679 --> 00:59:29,199
didn't even like because you know you

1508
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:31,680
think like this is a natural process

1509
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:34,078
like kind of in a maybe not natural but

1510
00:59:31,679 --> 00:59:35,798
you know but yeah I never I never knew

1511
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:37,640
that that that was a thing and I talked

1512
00:59:35,798 --> 00:59:40,159
to H&amp;L about it and he's like sure yeah

1513
00:59:37,639 --> 00:59:41,920
dude like you could get Bud rot or rot

1514
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:43,838
from just the seed in there or like you

1515
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:45,838
said before the [ __ ] seed will grow

1516
00:59:43,838 --> 00:59:48,239
up out of there sometimes or

1517
00:59:45,838 --> 00:59:50,759
whatever looks like alien Bud bro when

1518
00:59:48,239 --> 00:59:53,239
it has a bunch of uh the tap Roots

1519
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:54,920
flying out all over the Bud white yeah

1520
00:59:53,239 --> 00:59:57,000
yeah I've never seen that but that's

1521
00:59:54,920 --> 01:00:00,760
that is wild dude yeah it's weird

1522
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:02,599
looking yeah as far as you know uh Auto

1523
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:04,359
pollen maybe people care about that

1524
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:06,838
we'll speak on some Auto [ __ ] this

1525
01:00:04,358 --> 01:00:11,199
podcast dude your boy you're the auto

1526
01:00:06,838 --> 01:00:13,480
king you know at one time but as far as

1527
01:00:11,199 --> 01:00:14,798
Autos I mean dude some of the male

1528
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:16,280
especially like your more like you were

1529
01:00:14,798 --> 01:00:18,880
saying the more indicate types I guess

1530
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:21,000
you call them or dominant varieties yeah

1531
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:24,079
shorter shorter types or shorter flower

1532
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:27,000
and period Autos if that makes any sense

1533
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:30,400
uh uh there I mean dude males are

1534
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:34,280
dropping anywhere from like day 21 to

1535
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:36,838
like like I'm like serious I've had [ __ ]

1536
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:40,039
yeah like real fast dude we week three

1537
01:00:36,838 --> 01:00:42,558
to week four uh and then you know your

1538
01:00:40,039 --> 01:00:43,960
females they usually can take around

1539
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:46,240
there too like maybe a little bit like

1540
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:47,599
week four for sure but I mean and then

1541
01:00:46,239 --> 01:00:49,159
they're they're just like your normal

1542
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:50,880
plans as far as the time it takes to

1543
01:00:49,159 --> 01:00:52,159
mature for the most part right I mean

1544
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:55,160
they yeah you just let them run as long

1545
01:00:52,159 --> 01:00:58,118
as they need to weeks yeah yeah long to

1546
01:00:55,159 --> 01:00:59,639
and I do what you taught me to do bro uh

1547
01:00:58,119 --> 01:01:02,280
you know you've always told me growing

1548
01:00:59,639 --> 01:01:04,759
up back in the day bro don't check the

1549
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:06,440
top bu check the bottom ones bro because

1550
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:08,640
you know if the bottom ones you if

1551
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:11,559
they're mature the rest of the plants

1552
01:01:08,639 --> 01:01:13,759
probably yep top one's always first and

1553
01:01:11,559 --> 01:01:15,599
there's inner knuckle elbow ones I think

1554
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:17,280
they called primordial seeds yeah those

1555
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:18,960
are always done first so they're tricky

1556
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:21,720
you see those come out you're like oh

1557
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:24,318
nice and brown nice and you know sturdy

1558
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:26,519
and then the rest could be all immature

1559
01:01:24,318 --> 01:01:28,318
yeah something I thought was kind of

1560
01:01:26,519 --> 01:01:29,880
interesting bro and you know what none

1561
01:01:28,318 --> 01:01:32,000
of your audience probably us a [ __ ]

1562
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:35,079
about this but I thought it was cool I

1563
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:38,599
had some Autos bro that I that uh Chuck

1564
01:01:35,079 --> 01:01:41,559
some pollen on right and I Chuck some

1565
01:01:38,599 --> 01:01:44,000
your blueberry onto a blueberry Auto

1566
01:01:41,559 --> 01:01:46,880
right nice and what would you say the

1567
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:50,000
primordial [ __ ] like the the pre I hit

1568
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:52,400
those with the auto pollen right yes

1569
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,880
sounds crazy because guys in the chat G

1570
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:56,559
contamination contamination but I got

1571
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:59,318
the answer for you fu

1572
01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:00,960
all right go here let's hear it when you

1573
01:01:59,318 --> 01:02:02,358
you could do some cool [ __ ] like that

1574
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:06,000
though because you

1575
01:02:02,358 --> 01:02:08,798
take like I said you hit the Autos or

1576
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:11,559
you could do it I did it both with both

1577
01:02:08,798 --> 01:02:13,679
let me let me let me simplify this so if

1578
01:02:11,559 --> 01:02:16,480
you got an auto blueberry you got the

1579
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:18,118
and thex blueberry right you could take

1580
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:20,798
you could do it either way but I took

1581
01:02:18,119 --> 01:02:23,760
the male blueberry ex and hit it to the

1582
01:02:20,798 --> 01:02:25,000
female primordials right yeah so every

1583
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:29,278
one of them which she ended up being

1584
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:33,199
like $50 100 yeah is a hybrid of that

1585
01:02:29,278 --> 01:02:35,559
and then I hit the uh rest of the top of

1586
01:02:33,199 --> 01:02:37,919
the buds with the a male blueberry Auto

1587
01:02:35,559 --> 01:02:39,559
right yeah and it's just as simple as

1588
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,200
like I'm not selling seeds so

1589
01:02:39,559 --> 01:02:43,079
contamination [ __ ] don't matter so much

1590
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:45,439
so what I when I'm popping them at the

1591
01:02:43,079 --> 01:02:47,200
end of the day I'm just popping you know

1592
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:49,920
if they start flowing early as [ __ ] I

1593
01:02:47,199 --> 01:02:52,038
know they the auto yeah that's true

1594
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:53,440
right it's and I'm doubling up on two

1595
01:02:52,039 --> 01:02:55,520
have you ever done anything like that

1596
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:58,000
probably not because I know y'all not

1597
01:02:55,519 --> 01:02:59,239
not with blueberry to to Blueberry Autos

1598
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,719
but it's because that's actually two

1599
01:02:59,239 --> 01:03:03,959
different U traits you're working at the

1600
01:03:01,719 --> 01:03:05,078
same time breeding for blue and breeding

1601
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:07,639
for

1602
01:03:05,079 --> 01:03:09,440
autoflowering it's uh two observable

1603
01:03:07,639 --> 01:03:12,440
traits so it's not it's not super

1604
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:14,278
complex but it's also pretty cool I I I

1605
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:16,079
even think that's a good idea to do and

1606
01:03:14,278 --> 01:03:18,318
you can tell which ones are pure and

1607
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:20,720
which ones aren't just based on how they

1608
01:03:18,318 --> 01:03:22,960
flower you know something I appreciate

1609
01:03:20,719 --> 01:03:26,038
about you dude and working with the RS

1610
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:27,400
and stuff especially man is like you got

1611
01:03:26,039 --> 01:03:29,760
around all the time I see Cats though

1612
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:31,720
cut them down soon as they start seeing

1613
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:34,079
and like for me bro like it's so easy to

1614
01:03:31,719 --> 01:03:36,480
just to separate a male for you know if

1615
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:38,400
you got this space right some got this

1616
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:40,679
space but if you can separate a male and

1617
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:42,480
just do some brushing bro like why not

1618
01:03:40,679 --> 01:03:44,239
dude why not get some seeds out of that

1619
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:46,679
[ __ ] dude you know you know I tried

1620
01:03:44,239 --> 01:03:48,358
keeping the Bonnet mail for uh years and

1621
01:03:46,679 --> 01:03:50,519
I actually gave it away to radio Ridge

1622
01:03:48,358 --> 01:03:53,400
so they can pass it to other breeders

1623
01:03:50,519 --> 01:03:55,838
that want it to work with but um I don't

1624
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:57,639
know that they ever did that's the thing

1625
01:03:55,838 --> 01:03:59,759
bro you keep Cuts Like It's good to keep

1626
01:03:57,639 --> 01:04:02,278
a cut bro as soon as you [ __ ] get

1627
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:04,319
locked up and your homies like got an

1628
01:04:02,278 --> 01:04:06,278
infestation or something bro your shit's

1629
01:04:04,318 --> 01:04:08,278
gone that's good to have a seed of some

1630
01:04:06,278 --> 01:04:10,599
kind maybe you don't get that particular

1631
01:04:08,278 --> 01:04:14,318
expression back the way you want it but

1632
01:04:10,599 --> 01:04:17,119

you too if I remember make sure we get

1663

1664
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:37,798
it's somewhere in there I [ __ ] get

1665
01:05:34,798 --> 01:05:37,798
lost I'm going

1666
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:41,480
through yeah here it is here it is has

1667
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:45,640
Chucky ever grown an auto that Stacks up

1668
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:48,719
to Top Shelf traditional flower see this

1669
01:05:45,639 --> 01:05:50,358
is a tricky question 100% transparency I

1670
01:05:48,719 --> 01:05:53,879
[ __ ] around give yall jokes all the time

1671
01:05:50,358 --> 01:05:57,000
but I say it like this bro if you take a

1672
01:05:53,880 --> 01:06:00,200
pack of RS of like traditional rag pack

1673
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:02,239
right or F whatever like most of the

1674
01:06:00,199 --> 01:06:06,318
time I don't know if you can speak on

1675
01:06:02,239 --> 01:06:07,679
this but when you pop a pack of anything

1676
01:06:06,318 --> 01:06:10,199
really there's always going to be a

1677
01:06:07,679 --> 01:06:12,639
plant in there or two maybe for the most

1678
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:15,480
part unless you're cookie fan you get

1679
01:06:12,639 --> 01:06:18,239
everything's a [ __ ] winner dude every

1680
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:19,838
time every time but in a pack bro you're

1681
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:23,078
gonna find a plan or two in there that's

1682
01:06:19,838 --> 01:06:25,159
not the greatest right yeah I look at

1683
01:06:23,079 --> 01:06:26,640
Autos like this in a pack of Autos if

1684
01:06:25,159 --> 01:06:28,838
you pop the same

1685
01:06:26,639 --> 01:06:30,278
amount sometimes you got pop a few more

1686
01:06:28,838 --> 01:06:32,599
than like you would a normal pack I'll

1687
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:35,798
be for real but you will find the best

1688
01:06:32,599 --> 01:06:38,318
auto in there will be close comparable

1689
01:06:35,798 --> 01:06:39,599
to maybe the worst plant you find in a

1690
01:06:38,318 --> 01:06:41,038
traditional pack do you see what I'm

1691
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:42,720
saying yeah I see what you're saying I

1692
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:46,680
see what you're saying and I also will

1693
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:48,798
say this you know they are definitely

1694
01:06:46,679 --> 01:06:52,318
comparable to like cookie stuff bro like

1695
01:06:48,798 --> 01:06:54,838
or wreck weed you know I've for sure now

1696
01:06:52,318 --> 01:06:57,079
you are you going to get weed that

1697
01:06:54,838 --> 01:06:59,679
you're you're he the most headiest weed

1698
01:06:57,079 --> 01:07:01,318
that like you know some like H&amp;L or

1699
01:06:59,679 --> 01:07:04,278
whatever is going to be like this is it

1700
01:07:01,318 --> 01:07:06,038
bro probably not because that's there's

1701
01:07:04,278 --> 01:07:08,639
not enough work in them they need people

1702
01:07:06,039 --> 01:07:10,640
like H&amp;L and people like that to work

1703
01:07:08,639 --> 01:07:12,879
them further you know just he should

1704
01:07:10,639 --> 01:07:16,558
start an auto company is what he needs

1705
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:21,079
to do next bro yeah he he could speak on

1706
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:22,798
that yeah yeah he uh but but yeah I mean

1707
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:24,318
your worst your best auto is gonna be

1708
01:07:22,798 --> 01:07:27,639
like your worst plant you probably you

1709
01:07:24,318 --> 01:07:29,599
know what I mean but I this like I get

1710
01:07:27,639 --> 01:07:31,480
surprised all the time by them bro when

1711
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:33,720
I when I did [ __ ] with them I I would

1712
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:37,358
get surprised on a regular basis with

1713
01:07:33,719 --> 01:07:39,480
them you know anyway oh [ __ ] we're

1714
01:07:37,358 --> 01:07:41,480
dropping the weed bro anyway dropping

1715
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:44,559
the weed that's party P let's hit some

1716
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:52,278
more of these questions nothing about me

1717
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:57,278
uh if you have the option S1 F1 BX which

1718
01:07:52,278 --> 01:08:00,358
and Y pros and cons why regard or with

1719
01:07:57,278 --> 01:08:02,599
regarding with regards to breeding so

1720
01:08:00,358 --> 01:08:08,480
maybe I could speak on this a speak on

1721
01:08:02,599 --> 01:08:13,400
it preach so BX and s1's is when you

1722
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:16,560
want to lock something in right yes f1's

1723
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:19,399
when you want to move forward mostly yes

1724
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:21,839
correct I mean that's all I got really I

1725
01:08:19,399 --> 01:08:25,000
know learn I mean that's that's yeah um

1726
01:08:21,838 --> 01:08:27,119
I'd say s1's for making the money seeing

1727
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:31,880

01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:53,719
question Chucky what do you think of

1738
01:08:50,798 --> 01:08:55,119
Kentucky going medically legal I mean

1739
01:08:53,719 --> 01:08:56,798
it's like anywhere right like you're

1740
01:08:55,119 --> 01:08:58,920
still looking at years of probably

1741
01:08:56,798 --> 01:09:01,198
waiting around and them [ __ ] you

1742
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:03,600
around for you know whatever I mean I

1743
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:08,639
think it's great dude because like it is

1744
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:09,719
I think it's 21 or 22 illnesses or or U

1745
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:11,640
I'm not good at this kind of

1746
01:09:09,719 --> 01:09:13,359
conversation or you know talking about

1747
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:15,239
medical Pro long as for sure like if you

1748
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:18,120
got cancer terminal illnesses things

1749
01:09:15,238 --> 01:09:19,959
like that uh you know you can be on this

1750
01:09:18,119 --> 01:09:22,079
list I think it's kind of silly though

1751
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:24,880
last time I checked you had to have a

1752
01:09:22,079 --> 01:09:27,000
care you or your care provider has to

1753
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:29,000
drive out State and can bring back up to

1754
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:31,479
eight ounces legally you gota have you

1755
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,560
know all your proof of everything so

1756
01:09:31,479 --> 01:09:36,119
like it's it's like what you know these

1757
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:38,480
people are like dying and [ __ ] and you

1758
01:09:36,119 --> 01:09:41,479
know they need it now and not tomorrow

1759
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:43,119
or in a week or and you're literally

1760
01:09:41,479 --> 01:09:44,959
just driving over from what I understand

1761
01:09:43,119 --> 01:09:46,519
and maybe I'm wrong in this guys but

1762
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:49,359
from what I read that it's literally

1763
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:50,759
you're just driving to I guess a medical

1764
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:52,440
facility and just picking up and it's

1765
01:09:50,759 --> 01:09:55,000
literally driving back so it's like why

1766
01:09:52,439 --> 01:09:58,198
can't we have some medical system to

1767
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:01,399
[ __ ] to it people are buying th seaweed

1768
01:09:58,198 --> 01:10:04,119
or whatever be [ __ ] like bro I mean it's

1769
01:10:01,399 --> 01:10:05,839
a joke bro but I I think it's great but

1770
01:10:04,119 --> 01:10:07,559
for me and what I came from in my

1771
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:10,239
background it didn't really you know I

1772
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:12,199
mean it's not really any affecting like

1773
01:10:10,238 --> 01:10:15,319
what I did or would have affected what I

1774
01:10:12,198 --> 01:10:16,960
did at the time I don't think all right

1775
01:10:15,319 --> 01:10:19,238
Let's do let's do one more question and

1776
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:21,198
we can save the rest for the next one y

1777
01:10:19,238 --> 01:10:23,039
That's cool all right if we bring you

1778
01:10:21,198 --> 01:10:25,599
back I don't know we'll see we'll see

1779
01:10:23,039 --> 01:10:27,760

1926
01:16:12,479 --> 01:16:15,678
that thing is [ __ ] amazing bro if I

1927
01:16:14,279 --> 01:16:17,759
was a breeder I ain't even like

1928
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:21,158
bullshitting if I was a breeder one of

1929
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:23,239
the Expressions I found out of one pack

1930
01:16:21,158 --> 01:16:25,638
like dude I'm hitting this to everything

1931
01:16:23,238 --> 01:16:28,559
bro or hitting stuff to hit whatever

1932
01:16:25,639 --> 01:16:30,520
it's I can't describe it because it I

1933
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:34,639
would the best way I can describe it is

1934
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:36,719
a runchy rancid used coffee ground smell

1935
01:16:34,639 --> 01:16:39,880
that's got a skunk maybe a little skunk

1936
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:41,760
to it little tiny bit of mint and it's

1937
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:43,440
just kind of like this sharpness to it

1938
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:45,000
and maybe that's the you know the sour

1939
01:16:43,439 --> 01:16:46,719
coming through this the skunk all I

1940
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:48,520
don't know bro I you know it's been

1941
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:49,840
years since I've smoked some of the that

1942
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:52,679
kind of [ __ ] so it's like hard to really

1943
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:55,400
wrap my brain around it but and they all

1944
01:16:52,679 --> 01:16:59,119
kind of exhibited exhibited those

1945
01:16:55,399 --> 01:17:01,879
uh flavors out of the Packa pop uh the

1946
01:16:59,119 --> 01:17:04,039
structure is where they varied um and

1947
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:07,279
the ease of grow I would say the one

1948
01:17:04,039 --> 01:17:08,600
that I had is super dense some of the

1949
01:17:07,279 --> 01:17:13,158
you've seen some of the pictures maybe

1950
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:15,079
the beautiful nugs uh beautiful like

1951
01:17:13,158 --> 01:17:17,679
under 100 let me let me put it this way

1952
01:17:15,079 --> 01:17:19,158
I grew it under 100 watt light for about

1953
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:20,719
basically its whole life until about

1954
01:17:19,158 --> 01:17:23,679
last four weeks of its life and I put it

1955
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:26,279
under a big dog big light but great

1956
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:27,760
plants and even the ones after I I I ran

1957
01:17:26,279 --> 01:17:29,840
out of that I got a little bitty bit and

1958
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:32,199
I'm sending some samples off or giving

1959
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:33,600
some samples away uh but I want to crack

1960
01:17:32,198 --> 01:17:36,399
those open and smoke the rest of it

1961
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:39,360
because I like it so much but yeah bet

1962
01:17:36,399 --> 01:17:43,238
the uh and I can't speak on the SSH or

1963
01:17:39,359 --> 01:17:44,599
whatever sssd yeah he Rob's been talking

1964
01:17:43,238 --> 01:17:47,039
about me with that one a little bit but

1965
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:48,360
I I ain't grown that one but uh and then

1966
01:17:47,039 --> 01:17:50,840
the other one what was the other one he

1967
01:17:48,359 --> 01:17:54,559
was talking asking about the uh it was a

1968
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:56,119
SK do oh thead Elite so the mat Elite

1969
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:58,039
you probably not going to find a lot of

1970
01:17:56,119 --> 01:18:01,238
conversation on it in the Discord

1971
01:17:58,039 --> 01:18:03,679
because it was such a limited drop that

1972
01:18:01,238 --> 01:18:07,559
prior to that it was it was like seven

1973
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:10,520
eight years nine it was a long time ago

1974
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:12,520
yeah when when it was all made a limited

1975
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:14,040
drop so there could be very well most

1976
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:16,960
