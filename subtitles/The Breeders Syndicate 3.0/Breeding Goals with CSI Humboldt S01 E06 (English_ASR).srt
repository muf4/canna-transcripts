10
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:46,479
good one so we're gonna be talking today

11
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:48,000
about breeding goals not so you wanna

12
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,398
take it away and

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,320
run with the topic yeah sure so i mean

14
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,920
the last few episodes or whatever we've

15
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,320
been chatting a little bit about like

16
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,559
breeding history and various aspects of

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,878
it we talked a little bit about terms

18
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:03,119
and we thought maybe it would be better

19
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:05,759
to chat about something that's not

20
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,438
talked about too often which is like

21
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,960
what are your goals when you take two

22
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,039
things and you cross them together what

23
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:13,839
are you hoping that each parent might

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,200
give the children of that and then talk

25
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,040
a little bit about like sort of the

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,759
state of where things are and what's

27
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,720
popular and methods and things like that

28
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,118
so

29
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:25,039
um yeah i mean that's kind of where

30
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:27,438
we're gonna bring it obviously this is

31
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,360
the first time we've had three people on

32
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:31,919
it so it's a little different super

33
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:33,920
stoked that uh our buddy was willing to

34
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,960
come on and join us because

35
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:40,000
he is one of the most uh prolific

36
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:43,039
uh breeders that i know of so he's lots

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,680
of he has lots of experience of success

38
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,799
failures all that type of stuff so we're

39
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,799
pretty excited to uh have him on

40
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,880
and uh to be able to chat it up about

41
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,720
this subject so

42
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,078
we're just gonna kind of get started

43
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,078
you know we'll maybe we'll talk about

44
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:00,239
like for instance skittles for a second

45
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:02,478
so you know skittles comes out skittles

46
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,959
starts winning a bunch of awards uh the

47
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:06,319
skittles crew held on to skittles pretty

48
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,279
tight for a bit

49
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:09,439
so

50
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,959
like at emerald cup and some different

51
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:13,120
other events

52
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,800
people buying hybrids of it was

53
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,239
literally the only way that they could

54
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,840
get a hold of it

55
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,439
right and so that's one of the way

56
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,400
that's one of the things that drives

57
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:24,400
breeding and some in some instances

58
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,000
something gets famous

59
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,520
it could be skittles could be cookies

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,719
could be kush could be any number of

61
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,760
different things

62
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:31,519
and then

63
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,199
most people don't have access to that

64
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,120
cut because maybe it's hoarded or maybe

65
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:37,199
the circles are still pretty tight or

66
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,159
whatever and so

67
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:42,159
um the pricing and the desirability for

68
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,280
people to buy seeds of that thing become

69
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:44,400
pretty high

70
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,560
yeah

71
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,560
supply and demand how it always works

72
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,120
yeah it's supply and demand basically

73
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,759
and so that that has driven

74
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,840
actually a lot of breeding um because

75
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,840
you're just you're just offering up

76
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,598
you know hey you can't get the cut

77
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,080
but you know maybe you'll find something

78
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:04,079
in skittles by tk that you'll like

79
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,239
yeah you know and that that drives a lot

80
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,000
of breeding and so that's kind of been

81
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,920
like one of them the modern ways that

82
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,039
people do things is that they're mashing

83
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:13,119
together

84
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,120
a bunch of famous cuts

85
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,959
you know and maybe caleb can jump in on

86
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,959
this too but you know when you're

87
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,759
looking at two different things

88
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,560
right if you're gonna cross skittles by

89
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:24,399
this

90
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,360
what do you want each what are you

91
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,000
hoping that maybe each parent might give

92
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,080
the seeds might give the children

93
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,919
that you are excited about when you cr

94
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,519
when people cross things

95
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:38,079
what are the ideas and what are the

96
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,000
hopes behind what they're looking for to

97
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,200
for each parent to give

98
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,680
right what are the traits they're

99
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,518
looking or they're hopeful that the the

100
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,640
parent might give

101
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,519
right

102
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:51,518
you know and so one of the things that

103
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,400
one of the things that kind of i think

104
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,000
separates uh csi from a lot of other

105
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,480
people is that

106
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,239
a lot of people cross things

107
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:02,959
and never test them and they just

108
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:06,158
release them to the public right yeah

109
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:09,438
right but if you if you go back on uh on

110
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:12,399
csi's page you can go back years and see

111
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:15,280
him running crosses of his own hybrids

112
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,239
for a long time and what that does is

113
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,279
that actually gives you an idea

114
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,279
of

115
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,719
what the parents you're using throw in

116
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,559
their progeny

117
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,400
and how they breathe continually how do

118
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,560
they breed which ones are consistent

119
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:30,799
breeders which ones are a mess and are

120
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,160
all over the place you know there's some

121
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,319
things out there that it might be

122
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,439
amazing clones um that breed like crap

123
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:39,279
you know they

124
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:42,160
they don't transfer the qualities of the

125
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:45,039
mother cut into its children very much

126
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,360
and so breeders naturally when they find

127
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,560
things that work they tend to go back to

128
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,840
them

129
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,000
right right

130
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:53,439
i mean most people

131
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,079
generally want

132
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:58,240
what i consider mythical plants they

133
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:00,879
want plants that are high yield high

134
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,840
potency extremely flavorful just like

135
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:07,519
you were talking about you know

136
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:09,758
they want everything in one plant and

137
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:12,319
not only one plant but they want all the

138
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,479
seeds to be everything and that's not

139
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:17,279
the reality of it you know yeah like

140
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:18,079
with your skittles example i mean

141
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:20,879
if

142
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:23,839
if i'm bringing with skittles my goal

143
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:26,399
is to take the best characteristics of

144
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,000
skittles which would be the flavor and

145
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,038
the smell

146
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,800
and

147
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:31,839
hopefully incorporate that into

148
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,720
something

149
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:35,038
um

150
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,720
with another desirable characteristic

151
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:39,918
from the other parent which would be

152
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,320
maybe like yield or potency you know

153
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:42,319
what again

154
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,319
so what's some of the other lines you've

155
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:47,120
worked with that that you you feel are

156
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:48,959
uh

157
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,639
special for breeding

158
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,638
for your purposes

159
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,840
say what what what's some of the other

160
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,759
lines you've worked with that you feel

161
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:57,519
have special traits and characteristics

162
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,639
that maybe maybe they that read true for

163
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:00,159
it that you really enjoy that you've

164
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,199
found over the years

165
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,120
oh i mean

166
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,400
you know i love that love the urkels the

167
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,519
whole family

168
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:07,519
yeah

169
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:10,000
i love triangle

170
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:12,959
you know og cush in general i think it's

171
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,600
just you know a great building block um

172
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:18,879
and then the chem family um

173
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,039
you know which you know most people know

174
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:23,600
my opinion on that i i think it's just

175
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:27,199
really chem 91 and everything past that

176
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,680
is a chem hybrid or poly hybrid

177
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,400
yeah i agree

178
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,680
i uh you know it's a it's a delicate

179
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,159
subject but

180
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,319
i think that uh you know plants don't

181
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,800
lie and when you've grown a lot of these

182
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,639
chemical plants for a long time and

183
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,680
especially cross them and see what's in

184
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:48,400
them uh it does seem that way you know

185
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,160
uh you know one of the things that uh

186
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,638
that came from me but i don't think

187
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,080
anybody has used it more than than uh

188
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,319
caleb is

189
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:58,959
um the the mendo perps is probably a

190
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:02,560
good example uh because the mendo perps

191
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:05,120
is it's fast it's fairly fast finishing

192
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,879
it's got crazy colors in it it's got

193
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,199
very unique terps

194
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:10,399
uh but it's pretty low potency

195
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,478
uh

196
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:14,399
you know in regard and so

197
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:16,159
you know um

198
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:18,638
one of the one of the you know one of

199
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,479
the things that uh that he he released

200
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,360
that that you know got a named cut was

201
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:26,318
this obama kush where he married uh

202
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,400
mendo p to uh bubba kush

203
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,639
and the bubba added a bunch of frost it

204
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:33,359
added a bunch of structure it added much

205
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,439
more potency and then the mendo p seemed

206
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,319
to add a lot of pretty color

207
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:40,800
and gave the bubba some different unique

208
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,800
smells

209
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,879
that's the really good example of like

210
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:48,638
taking the strengths from one plant and

211
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,639
crossing into something else where those

212
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:54,240
strengths are weaknesses

213
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,680
right right yep you know um

214
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,199
you know and then you know there's

215
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,680
things that there's things that interest

216
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,000
people so what i always recommend people

217
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,478
do when they're breeding uh because

218
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,759
breeding is a lot of work uh it's time

219
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:09,598
consuming and there's a certain amount

220
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:11,919
of failure involved is if you have goals

221
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:13,519
or you're passionate about certain

222
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:15,598
plants you're using

223
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:16,560
then that to me that's the coolest kind

224
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:18,240
of breeding

225
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,800
you know if you're like i want to take

226
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,400
these traits from this plant and i want

227
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,240
to see if i can get these traits and

228
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:25,598
these traits from these two plants into

229
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,560
one plant

230
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:28,319
right

231
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,879
and you know when you're passionate

232
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,120
about something you know as as caleb

233
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,120
just mentioned he just rolled through

234
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,440
you know favorites and he might be able

235
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,719
to explain at length why each one of

236
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,399
those strains um you know why you know

237
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,399
there's probably a combination of traits

238
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,480
that he likes in each one of those and

239
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,958
there's also probably a combination of

240
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,159
not only those traits he likes but they

241
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:56,958
pass those traits on to the kids

242
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:56,958
you know pretty consistently um you know

243
00:08:57,278 --> 00:08:59,919
so i don't know i mean maybe you want to

244
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:02,639
like one of the things you've told me in

245
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:04,799
the past caleb is that of a lot of the

246
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,559
things that you use the chem 91 seems to

247
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:09,519
be one of the most consistent breeders

248
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:11,039
for adding potency to its progeny

249
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,600
right right

250
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:15,039
and you know uh

251
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,240
on on that one

252
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:17,838
i uh

253
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,759
i also think that

254
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,519
you know and i've told you both this you

255
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,679
know plenty of times

256
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:27,919
i have a strong suspicion that i think

257
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:30,479
the chem 91 itself is an s1 from its

258
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:31,679
original source in colorado

259
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,320
um

260
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:35,679
so i think that might have something to

261
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,240
do with the

262
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:39,838
with the you know its propensity to pass

263
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,519
on that strength

264
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,920
because it's it's kind of like a

265
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,039
bottlenecked s1 already

266
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:46,399
you know yeah

267
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:47,519
and uh

268
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,360
you know um

269
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,839
anytime you go you know s1 f2 etc etc

270
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,519
you know things i think are more stable

271
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,920
and easier to pass

272
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,440
forward as long as they're not like a

273
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:00,879
recessive

274
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,160
you know

275
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:04,720
yeah but

276
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:07,278
um it it's very consistent in upping the

277
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,120
potency on whatever you cross it to

278
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:12,240
you know whether it's you know feminize

279
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,839
or regular seeds or whatever

280
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,919
you know what are some of the traits you

281
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,000
like about bubble gum i know that's one

282
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:20,559
you use extensively and and uh your

283
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,839
advice uh i used it for the bubble berry

284
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:26,639
i'm super stoked on it how it breeds

285
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,720
i mean i love the bubble gum cut because

286
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:33,120
it's one of the

287
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:34,240
best plants i've ever grown out outdoors

288
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,159
just

289
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:40,159
almost mold proof you know yeah and it's

290
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:43,039
extremely frosty has a sweet you know

291
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:43,039
bubble gum smell

292
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,399
and it's just a nice

293
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:50,719
all-around plant now yes does it does it

294
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,039
compare with today's you know hypey

295
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,920
stuff and probably not

296
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:55,759
but

297
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:58,000
you know for you know somebody who's

298
00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:00,480
farming outdoors and

299
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,159
you know looking for something uh you

300
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:06,480
know that's you know fairly stable and

301
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:08,319
you know uh mold prone

302
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,680
uh yeah mold through

303
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,600
won't prove

304
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:14,399
i mean you know the those are some of my

305
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,680
favorite characteristics of it yeah for

306
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,360
sure

307
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:19,519
and that's that's one of the things that

308
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,278
we should probably mention too is that

309
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,480
so if you're really if you're passionate

310
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:24,000
about breeding

311
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,800
and you're trying to combine certain

312
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,559
traits i mean amongst us you know we

313
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:31,278
might back and forth

314
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:33,359
a lot of different ideas and get excited

315
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:34,958
about a lot of random stuff

316
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,039
but there's also this thing in the back

317
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:38,639
of your mind in which in order to be a

318
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:40,078
successful breeder

319
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:43,199
people will have to want to buy your

320
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:45,278
stuff and have success with it so a lot

321
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,920
of these practical traits

322
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:49,919
uh like he was just talking about um

323
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:52,159
great outdoor plant highly mold

324
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:54,319
resistant that type of thing

325
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:55,759
those things can be really important

326
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,000
right because

327
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:00,240
you know uh people want like as caleb

328
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,078
was mentioning earlier people want buy a

329
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,480
pack of seeds and that to be the best

330
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:06,000
growing best yielding greatest structure

331
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,639
crazy terps

332
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,679
you know super potent they want all the

333
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:14,320
beans to be that way which is rare

334
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:17,039
but then if even if it had that but it

335
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,560
molded like crazy people would be pissed

336
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:20,719
yeah yeah

337
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:23,359
you know so if if you if there's

338
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,600
problems inherent in a line like

339
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,519
high mold or hermaphroditism or

340
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,519
something else like that you can better

341
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,399
believe that people are gonna focus on

342
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,159
that

343
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,240
rather than this is the most potent

344
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:35,759
flavorful fastest growing thing i've

345
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,000
grown in forever

346
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:39,759
i found four bananas and a couple of the

347
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,958
big of the biggest coal is rotted and

348
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:44,159
now i think it's a [ __ ] cross

349
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,399
you know

350
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,000
it makes it difficult you know uh

351
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,879
because there's a certain amount of

352
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,600
commercial satisfaction that's required

353
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:55,919
right oftentimes it's the environment

354
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,959
that causes the problems

355
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:58,639
yeah

356
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:00,799
that is very true

357
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,959
you know or you know i can't i can't

358
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:04,078
even imagine i'm not a i'm not a public

359
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:06,719
breeder

360
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:08,879
but both matt and caleb are

361
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,040
the amount of you know the amount of uh

362
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,679
responses they get of like hey these

363
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:16,159
seeds didn't pop right or they died a

364
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:18,479
few days after i cracked them or they

365
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,439
turned out like like [ __ ] and i blame

366
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,120
you

367
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,160
you know i mean most of the time

368
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,639
sometimes sometimes it is you know uh of

369
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:28,639
the scene maker but a lot of times it's

370
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,959
it's user error

371
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,240
i've never i've never gotten any

372
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:34,078
comments like that mine everything's

373
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,680
always perfect everything's always

374
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:36,958
perfect

375
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:38,399
you know and

376
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,599
we don't need to we don't need to name

377
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,440
names or anything like that because

378
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,839
that's not the point of it but there was

379
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,519
a super famous line that was released a

380
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,920
number of years ago that was very

381
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,600
expensive and very hyped up and the

382
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:51,599
people that made it didn't even bother

383
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,519
to do a germ test

384
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,680
yeah and a germ test for people that

385
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:59,278
don't know is if you're a breeder you

386
00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:01,599
take 50 or 100 or 200 of your seed

387
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:04,000
and you pop them a few times and paper

388
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,800
towels or dirt or whatever and you make

389
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,639
sure

390
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:09,039
that there's nothing funky

391
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,720
and they germinate well yeah

392
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:12,799
you know there's occasionally crosses

393
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,920
you make that don't germ well forget

394
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:15,198
about that

395
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,719
seeing issues

396
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:18,559
and so there was there was a line that

397
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,320
was released that they didn't even do a

398
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:22,719
germ test on and then people bought

399
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,278
expensive seeds and then

400
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,839
70 of them didn't even pop

401
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:29,759
and it was so consistent that it wasn't

402
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,360
really user error because when you start

403
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:34,240
getting just hundreds and hundreds of

404
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,320
complaints about the same issue yeah um

405
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,919
a germ test is something that takes you

406
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,639
know less than a week to really figure

407
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,599
out

408
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:44,480
yeah what rater takes positive

409
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,159
what do you what do you think causes the

410
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,920
you know poor germination rates like

411
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:50,240
that

412
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:52,000
yeah you know you know the

413
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,879
i mean matt you can speak to it if you

414
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,559
want

415
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:56,958
you know uh what what's it called the

416
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:59,838
the sperm

417
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:01,278
that's in the uh in the shell might not

418
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,760
be developed properly so it wasn't

419
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:05,360
getting proper food it could be minor

420
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:07,439
cracks i mean sure there's all kinds of

421
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,680
[ __ ] reasons but some of it would

422
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,680
probably be what recessive genetics

423
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:13,599
people are calling it out in in the

424
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:15,439
comments because it was obvious what it

425
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,120
was it was candy rain and i'm not trying

426
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,399
to diss anyone but

427
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,440
one of the things

428
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,600
one of the things that i was going to

429
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,639
say is that you you can inbreed in

430
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,800
cannabis

431
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,959
more so than you can in other things a

432
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:29,278
little bit um but

433
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:31,439
when you start inbreeding too much and

434
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:33,679
you're and your hybrids are a mishmash

435
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,440
of the same four or five cuts over and

436
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:37,439
over and over again

437
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,600
you will on occasion start to get

438
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,399
undesirable recessives

439
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,159
or undesirable traits that pop up and

440
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:47,679
one of those traits could be like some

441
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:49,439
mutant funky seeds uh blueberry

442
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:51,679
yeah yeah but you know

443
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,920
caleb can talk about it too but you know

444
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:56,000
because he does a lot of s1s and he's

445
00:15:53,919 --> 00:16:00,559
even done some s2s

446
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,480
but as you start going to s3 s4 s5

447
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:03,599
things start getting significantly more

448
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,600
difficult

449
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,639
the plans start getting way weaker the

450
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,120
germination rates become a lot tougher

451
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,600
so there's a real limit there uh you

452
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,759
know in in how far you can inbreed

453
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,639
before you start to hit problems

454
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,278
um

455
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,680
and i haven't inbred that deep but uh

456
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:24,320
caleb caleb has a little bit more than i

457
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:25,599
have in terms of experimentation so

458
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,079
um

459
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,079
you know uh yeah there's there's issues

460
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:32,078
with inbreeding you can combine

461
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:33,919
undesirable traits and have them become

462
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:34,719
a little bit more dominant

463
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:36,719
even

464
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,360
even in s-2s

465
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,839
uh there's a lot of plants that will not

466
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,079
produce pollen

467
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,920
you know they won't

468
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:48,799
yeah they won't move forward

469
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:50,399
when reversed of course you know yeah

470
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:53,198
yeah

471
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:56,240
and so you know reversals reversals have

472
00:16:53,198 --> 00:17:00,159
become sort of the norm uh it's flipped

473
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:02,480
in this in this 60s 70s 80s 90s and the

474
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:05,199
first decade of the 2000s

475
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:08,400
uh the all breeding for the most part uh

476
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:10,400
was was what we call regular breeding

477
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,600
using males and females

478
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,480
um you know the only feminized breeding

479
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:18,399
that happened was typically accidental

480
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,519
uh you know hermaphrodism or something

481
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,480
along those lines bag seeds uh that type

482
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:24,879
of thing

483
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:28,240
and uh you know and then the revolution

484
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:31,120
happened uh you know 13 12 13 years ago

485
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,519
where the technology on how to reverse

486
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:36,000
cannabis became more well-known

487
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:38,160
and now i would say it's flipped

488
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,038
and the percentage of people that uses

489
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,120
actual males is extremely low

490
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:47,038
and the vast majority of the seed game

491
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:49,119
today is feminized in some way you know

492
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:50,480
um and it's a really it's a really

493
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:54,239
valuable tool

494
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,519
but as both of uh my co-host today can

495
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,359
express

496
00:17:55,519 --> 00:18:00,079
uh you know we were joking before we

497
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:01,519
came on live is that you know when i use

498
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,199
traditional males in a lot of my

499
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:05,918
breeding i never had a single breeding

500
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,960
failure yeah where when you reverse

501
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,640
things

502
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,840
you can have failure

503
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:14,400
you can have not very much pollen you

504
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:17,119
can have sterile pollen you can have the

505
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,679
pollen sacs not open and you have to go

506
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:22,159
through a lot of manual labor to extract

507
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,000
using screens and stuff the pollen from

508
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,640
the pollen sacs

509
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,480
um you know in the old days you have one

510
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,200
male in a room you're guaranteed you're

511
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,480
going to pollinate the entire room

512
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,120
right

513
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,279
in today's world uh you know caleb was

514
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:38,959
just chatting about it he might use 10

515
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:41,839
or 12

516
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,720
uh females that are marked for reversal

517
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:45,359
yeah

518
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,919
in the hopes that a few of them are pre

519
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:50,240
you know dump a lot and some a couple of

520
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,320
them dump some and if you dump a little

521
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,960
and then you've got a few failures

522
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:58,000
um and so it's it's uh it's pretty

523
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,679
difficult because it's not consistent um

524
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,679
you know people have great success

525
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,440
reversing a plant once and they do the

526
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,798
same thing again and for whatever reason

527
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,480
it doesn't work

528
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:08,558
yeah so

529
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,440
the the you know we have a lot of

530
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:14,558
theories as to why uh is the mix too

531
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:17,519
strong or too weak is there a range of

532
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:20,000
of the mix that leads to you know pollen

533
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:22,160
dumping with some strains versus others

534
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,720
but it's mostly like observational

535
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,759
because we all don't have labs to really

536
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,960
analyze why the failure went wrong yeah

537
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:31,679
um

538
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,640
you know and uh you know it also leads

539
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,640
to

540
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,559
you know in some cases uh you know

541
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,880
people get mad at hermaphrodism but

542
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:42,039
there's some plants that don't herm

543
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,960
and therefore they're a [ __ ] to reverse

544
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:47,200
[Music]

545
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,880
like i was telling you guys uh you know

546
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,840
just just a couple days ago i had to

547
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,600
chop down a whole room at four weeks

548
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:55,759
flower because

549
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:58,079
you know i reversed eight you know nice

550
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:59,359
big bushes of old betsy

551
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,199
and

552
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:04,000
none of them produced any pollen

553
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,519
whatsoever and the way i do things i i

554
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,839
don't really have a fallback a lot of

555
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:10,558
the times and so if it fails i just have

556
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:11,359
to chop a whole room down and start over

557
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:12,480
again

558
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:14,079
and

559
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,960
that's just the price of doing business

560
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:18,399
but it old betsy not reversing kind of

561
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,759
made me sad because she's one of my

562
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,519
favorite old girls

563
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:23,279
you know so yeah

564
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:24,480
you know there's some there's some lines

565
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:26,558
uh you know

566
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,960
uh there's a lot of uh there's a lot of

567
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:31,599
people uh that have tried to reverse

568
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:35,279
various diesel and sour cuts

569
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:37,599
uh they're notorious for not giving you

570
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:38,960
commercial viable amounts of pollen to

571
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:42,000
produce a bunch

572
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,000
miserable uh people have been having

573
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,159
really great results with some of

574
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,159
caleb's tk crosses

575
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,960
yeah but you know caleb can speak to

576
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,000
this but i think he failed two or three

577
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,038
times

578
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,960
three times he had success yeah yeah

579
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:58,798
three times and then when he did even

580
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,319
have success it was probably like a

581
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:02,720
fifth of the success that he would

582
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:04,079
normally have on a good reversal

583
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,200
yep

584
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:07,119
um

585
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,120
you know so there's there's a lot of

586
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:11,038
that like there's a there's there's

587
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:12,000
failure a lot of a lot of breeding

588
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:13,519
failure

589
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,079
used to be

590
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:17,759
you breed something and then the progeny

591
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:18,879
the children don't give you what you're

592
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:21,359
hoping for

593
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:25,039
yeah but in feminized breeding there's a

594
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:26,000
lot of actual failure to fertilize

595
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:28,000
right

596
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,279
you know that goes on

597
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,839
even by

598
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:33,839
extremely experienced people that do it

599
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:36,240
all the time and for a living and have

600
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:38,798
real good techniques down and have done

601
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,200
it a bunch and had a lot of success

602
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:42,079
you you know i'd like to add too though

603
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,919
um

604
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:49,359
that when breeding feminized um you tend

605
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:51,919
to have a better idea of

606
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:53,439
and in general kind of more consistent

607
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,480
better results

608
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,440
with your feminized you know progeny

609
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,480
than like a normal a normal breeding

610
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,400
where

611
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,120
you know you can observe certain things

612
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,960
about a male plant you really can't

613
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:08,639
see what it's going to pass forward

614
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,798
whereas with the fems

615
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,360
you you know your girl on the left you

616
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:16,000
know your girl on the right you know it

617
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:18,158
does tend to kind of give you a a little

618
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,200
bit better of a idea of what you're

619
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,080
gonna get

620
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,240
you know on that f1 hybrid you know

621
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:26,158
absolutely yeah

622
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,798
yeah and i mean so like if you were to

623
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,559
talk to breeders say that we've been

624
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:33,839
talking about you know in the last few

625
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:35,918
podcasts in the 80s and touch on the 90s

626
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:38,319
and stuff i think most of them would

627
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:40,400
tell you that the most important the

628
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:41,359
most important plants they had in their

629
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,400
rooms

630
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:46,959
uh were the consistent males

631
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,600
yeah like once you found a consistent

632
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,038
male back then you tended to cross it to

633
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:52,879
everything

634
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:54,720
because you were so stoked i mean a

635
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,960
recent example would be

636
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,360
you know uh matt found a really good

637
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,600
blue bonnet man yeah

638
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:03,279
and he was really happy with it and he

639
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:06,319
was really happy with the with the

640
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:08,240
traits that it passed on to the progeny

641
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:11,918
and because males are so much harder to

642
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,759
find ones that pass the traits you want

643
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,559
they tend to get used over and over

644
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,798
again

645
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:18,960
it's really hard to move on sometimes

646
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:20,558
it gets really hard to move on and so

647
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,400
you know you have you can look at some

648
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:25,119
of these old seed banks like you know

649
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,880
neville stuff or some stuff in the 90s

650
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:28,639
and you know they have a they have a

651
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,679
handful of males

652
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,360
um

653
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,759
really a handful and they use those

654
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:34,959
handful of males with everything

655
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:36,960
right right

656
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,200
because you know

657
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,120
failure you know failure and means that

658
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,038
like you get something that the customer

659
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:46,639
doesn't want and that just ends up being

660
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:46,640
a big ziploc in your fridge

661
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,720
you know you know or you

662
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,480
you test something out you feel like

663
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,159
it's got too many herms and it might

664
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,000
affect your reputation even though you

665
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,600
think it's good weed and you don't want

666
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,759
to deal with all the complaints out

667
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:01,199
there and it ends up being a big ziploc

668
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:02,798
in your fridge

669
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,960
you know maybe it'll be a project you

670
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:06,319
want to use later maybe it won't

671
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,960
and so

672
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:11,678
you know uh one of the big aspects of

673
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,720
this that we want to chat about is that

674
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,200
you know

675
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,400
the term breeder is used

676
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,798
loosely

677
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,600
uh and this isn't to dis anyone but it

678
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:23,918
encompasses basically anybody that wants

679
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:26,319
to cross and make seeds

680
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,200
and you know there's some people

681
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:29,200
um

682
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,159
you know there's not very many of them

683
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,960
uh but both uh caleb and matt are two of

684
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,039
them

685
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,558
that they are actually they actually do

686
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:39,519
what i consider to be traditional

687
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:41,599
breeding in the sense that they take

688
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:43,759
plants that they found from previous

689
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:45,599
breedings and they use them in further

690
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:46,480
work

691
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:48,798
right

692
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,278
there's a lot there's a you know and

693
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:53,119
everybody listening right now

694
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:54,400
you can have the power to affect

695
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:56,319
breeding right

696
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,880
because the breeding game right now is

697
00:24:56,319 --> 00:25:00,399
crossing a lot of hybrids together and

698
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,080
releasing them the public with

699
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,880
absolutely no work

700
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:06,960
so a lot of breeders are crossing famous

701
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,960
things to it to each other they're

702
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,640
giving them a sexy name

703
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,960
and some good packaging and they're

704
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,640
releasing them and they're not actually

705
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,519
popping them themselves

706
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,440
okay

707
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:20,240
and they're not doing any further work

708
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:23,038
which is fine but then what happens is

709
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,278
is that when you take somebody like like

710
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:26,798
you know caleb who runs a bunch of his

711
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:28,480
own work

712
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:31,359
he gets to see

713
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,679
what varieties in my collection

714
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:36,158
breed well and which ones don't

715
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:38,480
which ones throw traits that i like and

716
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,520
which ones are all over the place and

717
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,159
crazy

718
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:46,480
and that knowledge

719
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,480
informs the next steps you want to make

720
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:54,319
you know so for instance um you know uh

721
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:55,200
caleb has a a plant uh they call t1000

722
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:57,759
right

723
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,679
uh which is uh you know it's it's a

724
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:02,079
named cut from uh

725
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,080
from one of his lines i believe it's

726
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:07,038
urkel and tk correct

727
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:09,759
yep triangle kush times purple urkel

728
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:12,158
triangle kush times purple urkel and he

729
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:13,440
found you know it was found in hunts of

730
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,159
that line

731
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,919
and you know i i saw on his instagram

732
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,640
and he's told me and stuff you know he's

733
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,640
reversed that he's taken that cut and

734
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,038
he's used it in further work

735
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,759
that was one of my that was my one of my

736
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:29,519
buddy tiger farm selection uh from you

737
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:30,640
know up there in portland

738
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:32,319
sure

739
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,640
yeah from my work

740
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:36,158
yeah so it you know sometimes sometimes

741
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,000
it's stuff you find in your own work

742
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,600
sometimes it's stuff your buddies find

743
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,759
in your work

744
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:45,038
but you know he caleb liked that one

745
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:47,599
enough that he's now doing further work

746
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:49,839
within his own lines and so

747
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:51,599
the most effective and the cheapest and

748
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:54,558
the most profitable way to grow seeds

749
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:56,158
right now sadly is to make the cross

750
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:59,038
give it a name give it some cool

751
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:01,919
packaging and sell it and never do any

752
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:04,000
further work yourself

753
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,559
that's a pretty profitable path

754
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,880
the other path which is you test and you

755
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:10,720
grow rooms full of your own stuff and

756
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,799
you try to look for traits amongst that

757
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,720
stuff that you want to keep working with

758
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,759
um that's a lot more sustainable

759
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,240
breeding

760
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:20,640
because it gives you the ability to

761
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,120
you know do multi-stage breeding which

762
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,440
is real what real breeding is really um

763
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:27,439
but it's time-consuming and it's costly

764
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,440
and it takes a while

765
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,278
and you've actually done indoor yeah and

766
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,000
you have to have a goal in mind

767
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:34,798
right you know um and in that regard and

768
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,319
so

769
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:37,918
you know i don't know if he's i don't

770
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:39,278
know i don't know if you're are you

771
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:42,240
selling you're probably selling the

772
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:43,278
t-1000 hybrids now aren't you oh yeah oh

773
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,278
yeah

774
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:46,240
you made them a while ago you know yeah

775
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:47,119
and so

776
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,960
you know

777
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:50,798
he's got you know how many breeders out

778
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,480
there are doing two or three or four

779
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:55,278
step processes

780
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,278
yeah not a lot

781
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:59,119
but i mean real breeding you look at dog

782
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:01,679
breeders or you look at fish breeders or

783
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:03,599
you look at corn or anything else and

784
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,399
you know the idea that you just make

785
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:09,439
hybrids and sell them and never

786
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:11,759
try to like advance in any way

787
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,840
is not normal in breeding

788
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:15,519
most breeding has goals

789
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:16,398
yeah some of my favorite projects you

790
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:19,519
know

791
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:21,759
that i'm working on now um are the s2

792
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:24,000
projects where you know i've

793
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:27,119
you know grown out a hundred plus

794
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,278
you know plants of you know at my s1s

795
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:30,398
and made selections from those and now

796
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:33,440
i'm doing

797
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:36,479
s2s um i'm doing back crosses to the

798
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,278
moms i'm making hybrids between

799
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,159
you know

800
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:42,159
s2s of the various you know um

801
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,720
you know s ones like you know taking the

802
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:47,840
circle s1 cross it to the you know

803
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,640
triangle kush or chem dog s1 and you

804
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:51,119
know

805
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,559
kind of making new versions of those

806
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:54,239
same hybrids that i did with the

807
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:56,240
original parent cuts

808
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,720
but you know they're going to be unique

809
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,159
and hopefully a lot more you know stable

810
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,038
and uniform

811
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,360
you know

812
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:05,919
versus the previous generation

813
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:07,759
yeah there's a lot of work you know

814
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,000
going into all that

815
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:11,599
yeah no [ __ ] and so we could you know

816
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,640
maybe one thing we could talk about and

817
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:15,119
these are

818
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,840
these are also observations from caleb

819
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:17,839
but

820
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:18,720
he's running out a bunch of

821
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:22,079
um

822
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,278
you know uh chem 91 s ones

823
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:24,720
and

824
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:27,599
you know we all think

825
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:30,319
that it already is an s1 and what leads

826
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:33,359
us to think that is the lack of

827
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:37,359
variability in the line right

828
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:39,599
it passes potency it passes looks that

829
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:42,158
look very similar to it or there's a

830
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:44,319
small range in there and so you kind of

831
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,399
you kind of get what you get with that

832
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:48,879
right but then he's also done a thing

833
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:51,199
and i got to go up and see it where he's

834
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,520
reversed you know mendo p and he's grown

835
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,880
out a bunch of mendo ps ones

836
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:57,440
and uh

837
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,320
that has so much diversity in it

838
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,000
that

839
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:02,798
you know he's made comments to me in the

840
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,200
past where you could give out seeds

841
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:06,798
s-ones of mendo perps to various

842
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,798
different people and they could make

843
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:11,440
their own selections and the lines would

844
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:13,038
be extremely different from one another

845
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,080
because there's there's so much

846
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:17,839
variation in there um you know

847
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:20,558
you know and then

848
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:23,278
maybe we should make a comment about s1s

849
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:26,398
because there's so many clone only

850
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:28,319
elites and there's not um there's not

851
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:30,558
lines available of many of these things

852
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:33,278
anymore uh most of the stuff that we

853
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:36,558
hold uh in our collections

854
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:39,119
you only have one cutting of that line

855
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:40,879
you don't have any sisters of it and so

856
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:43,359
you don't have any boys of it you don't

857
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,440
have any way to look within the line and

858
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:48,558
so one of the benefits

859
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,880
of doing s1s with that kind of thing is

860
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:52,079
it's really the only way to look within

861
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,320
the genetic

862
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:55,918
without another genetics

863
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,759
you know genes coming in there and

864
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,799
altering it right

865
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:01,359
so

866
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:04,798
um you know so that's why we didn't know

867
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:07,759
how narrow the chem 91's gene pool was

868
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:09,599
until he s won it and grew out a few

869
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:12,319
hundred of them and we saw that it was

870
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:15,038
narrow you don't know how wide mendo

871
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:16,319
purple was until you did that and grew

872
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:19,200
out a bunch of them and you were like oh

873
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:20,398
my god there's different stuff in here

874
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,840
yeah and so

875
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:24,719
s1s

876
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:26,959
s1s give people selfing gives people an

877
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,919
ability to look through a line when they

878
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,679
only have one example one female example

879
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,840
of the line itself

880
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:37,200
right and so it's one of the ways that

881
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:39,678
modern breeders get to save and preserve

882
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,600
old lines like

883
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:45,200
a lot of famous stuff that caleb has run

884
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:49,759
recently like mendo purple or uh snow

885
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:51,519
or trinity or chem 91 or you know urkel

886
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:53,519
or you go down the list

887
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:55,440
and if you don't s1 it

888
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:58,159
it's really hard to see

889
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,919
what's in it by itself you can outcross

890
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,919
it to other things then you can see what

891
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,919
traits that are dominant that pass to

892
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,519
the children and outcrosses

893
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,399
but if you really want to look within a

894
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,880
line

895
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:11,439
um most seed lines today you know most

896
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,760
clone onlys are that they're clone only

897
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,360
that's all you get

898
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:16,798
lot of these cuts

899
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:18,798
well sorry to interrupt a lot of these

900
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:20,398
titles for it

901
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:22,720
you know they're they're all cuts that

902
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:24,719
are you know as you well know

903
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,360
you know mendo purposes over you know

904
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,519
you sprouted that seed over 20 years ago

905
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:32,798
you know and a lot of these cuts are 30

906
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:35,038
40 years old so if we don't you know

907
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:36,960
stash away some s1 seed in that fridge

908
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:39,679
you know before it's too late before

909
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,440
those cuts you know disappear

910
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,519
uh yeah

911
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,840
we'll lose those genetics

912
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,759
on that tangent are you going to do redo

913
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:50,480
the the the old bats here we going to

914
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:52,480
make another attempt at it i want to see

915
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,319
real old bull rider stock pulled out of

916
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,399
those s ones

917
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:58,720
my my problem is is

918
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:01,359
i don't i have i only have

919
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,880
rooms that are three four and six

920
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:03,759
so you know

921
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,559
um

922
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:08,558
it's hard doing some of these

923
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:11,200
i i wish i had like some single light

924
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:12,398
rooms to do these things right yeah you

925
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,840
know

926
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:15,918
because then it wouldn't be so much of

927
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:16,959
an expense to

928
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:19,278
you know

929
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,278
yeah yeah every time every time it fails

930
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:23,200
yeah for sure and that might be that

931
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:25,759
might be something good to talk about is

932
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,159
that it's pretty amazing how much cool

933
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:29,359
stuff we have to work with these days

934
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,519
considering

935
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:34,479
like most most normal breeders from

936
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:37,120
other walks of life would laugh

937
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,480
at the limited selection pool we pull

938
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:40,479
from

939
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,480
how many plants how many plants we get

940
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,679
to run to make the next generation

941
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,640
selections

942
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,640
um

943
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,640
you know prohibition and things like

944
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,960
that have made a lot of breeding happen

945
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:54,320
especially in america inside

946
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:56,798
so inside means you have electricity you

947
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:58,720
have a lot of lights you have cost money

948
00:33:56,798 --> 00:34:01,599
time all this different stuff

949
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,600
and so most breeders have a million

950
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:05,519
ideas in their head

951
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:08,078
the ones that are passionate about it

952
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:10,159
and their ability to realize those ideas

953
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,960
is quite limited

954
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,398
um

955
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,358
you know uh

956
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:18,000
you might have a fridge full of of ideas

957
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:20,480
and passion projects and whatever

958
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,639
but most breeders you know you have to

959
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,918
sell enough stuff while you're doing

960
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,079
your passion

961
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:27,679
to fund the passion part

962
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,560
right right right

963
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,079
so

964
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:31,838
for instance you know when i was doing a

965
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,519
lot of breeding in the late 90s and

966
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:36,239
early 2000s

967
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:39,599
it was a terrible financial decision

968
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:41,118
uh because i wasn't selling any seed i

969
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,960
was just giving it away to friends and

970
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,960
it was just for my personal

971
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,159
and back then cannabis was super

972
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,599
expensive

973
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,358
well at least other people made money

974
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,440
off your [ __ ] yeah well but whatever but

975
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:53,440
that's fine but it's just a matter of

976
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,358
it's just a matter of like most people

977
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,320
back then weren't willing to take a four

978
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:57,838
lighter

979
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,320
when you could get you know when weed

980
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:02,078
was 4 500 a pound or something yeah and

981
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,000
instead of getting six or eight pounds

982
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,960
of sellable cannabis out of that four

983
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,920
lighter

984
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,358
to get

985
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:11,760
thousands of seeds that you you know uh

986
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:13,358
you know didn't even have an outlet for

987
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,640
um you know and that's another thing

988
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:16,799
that we should talk about too for a

989
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:18,719
second is the fact that most seed

990
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,359
breeding in america

991
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:23,838
did not have an american outlet to be

992
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:25,838
able to get it to the public

993
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:27,759
right so there was a lot of private

994
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:29,440
breeding going on and there was a lot of

995
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,200
like you know there was some passion

996
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,838
going on and different things like that

997
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:34,879
but the public's asset access to it was

998
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:37,759
tiny

999
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:40,000
yeah and the 90s and the early 2000s

1000
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,920
which is when i did most of my stuff

1001
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,358
i don't think there was american small

1002
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,480
american seed companies that were

1003
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:46,319
getting it out

1004
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,639
you would you would have to

1005
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,760
make them here send them over to europe

1006
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:51,118
and then they would have to send them

1007
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,720
back to here

1008
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,960
yeah that's absolutely right so there

1009
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:57,199
was companies like there was companies

1010
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,199
that's why like certain americans

1011
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:01,279
partnered with europeans

1012
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:03,199
dude worst decisions i ever made in my

1013
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,880
life over there you know lots of

1014
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:08,319
american breeders think that way you

1015
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:11,039
know uh i mean for instance in the 90s

1016
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,880
um you know uh the blueberry stuff dj

1017
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:15,920
short you know he partnered with sag

1018
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,358
martha first and then dutch passion and

1019
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,680
doesn't sound like he was very pleased

1020
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:22,319
with either one of those things but

1021
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:23,838
um you know it uh it at least allowed if

1022
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,359
you didn't partner with somebody in

1023
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:27,358
europe

1024
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:29,598
nobody had access to your stuff the

1025
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:32,078
forums changed it a little bit

1026
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:34,400
because it at least allowed private dms

1027
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:36,800
and some and some low-level trading and

1028
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,639
stuff but even like yeah even matt back

1029
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,960
in the day i mean you know

1030
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:43,199
you would have a web address that had

1031
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,480
the netherlands yeah you know i'll

1032
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:46,399
comment on that real quick back in the

1033
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,240
day i get this question all the time the

1034
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,680
only reason that i have a nl address it

1035
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:51,919
wasn't because i was going to get more

1036
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:54,319
traffic because of it obviously nobody

1037
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,960
types anything.nl if you live in the us

1038
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:59,119
but back then it was just a

1039
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,119
just one more step to keep people from

1040
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,640
looking at me in the u.s and nowadays

1041
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,880
it's irrelevant so it's funny when

1042
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:06,000
people still americans use nl because

1043
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,280
they think it's some kind of special

1044
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:12,239
thing but but really you know the the ig

1045
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:14,000
era and you know the forum the forums a

1046
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:16,399
little bit and then instagram and then

1047
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,519
loosening laws and stuff it allowed a

1048
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:21,680
lot of very small time private breeders

1049
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:24,079
to be able to uh

1050
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:26,000
to get out there you know um and there

1051
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:29,359
was some people back in the day 20 years

1052
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,920
ago uh when you know when caleb and shaw

1053
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:34,078
and some others and i first met um at

1054
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,760
some harvest parties and such

1055
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,920
you know the people that were internet

1056
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,280
famous back then were like

1057
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,119
vic high

1058
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:44,160
and uh dj

1059
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:47,280
short and you know the uh the you know

1060
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:49,440
the brothers grim and the c99 work

1061
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,880
um and they well they got famous because

1062
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,200
there was there was such a there was

1063
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,039
such a limited pool

1064
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:57,679
right it was like it you know there was

1065
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:59,838
some there was a few canadians um there

1066
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:02,239
was a few americans it got famous on the

1067
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:03,519
forums but there wasn't now it's like

1068
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:06,000
anybody can

1069
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:07,679
you know can breed seeds in their closet

1070
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,679
or a bedroom or something and they can

1071
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:11,358
have an ig handle and they can get their

1072
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:13,118
work out there and they can spread their

1073
00:38:11,358 --> 00:38:15,440
work to friends and they can sew test

1074
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:17,440
grows and people can see pictures

1075
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,960
and so now it's become it's become a lot

1076
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,880
more common

1077
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,679
but 20 years ago

1078
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,519
um

1079
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:25,440
you know uh the vast majority of

1080
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:27,519
breeders i knew in mendo and humboldt

1081
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,920
and stuff were private

1082
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:32,960
unless you met them you had no way

1083
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,800
of getting access to any of it like zero

1084
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,199
you know if you were in north carolina

1085
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,200
or illinois or colorado or something

1086
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:41,039
like that like you weren't gonna meet

1087
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:43,598
the people in the triangle or the people

1088
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:46,559
in santa cruz or the people wherever

1089
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:47,760
um and so i you know the combination of

1090
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:49,838
reversals

1091
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,520
and the combination of you know

1092
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:54,078
instagram and some other forms of

1093
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:56,079
communication really exploded

1094
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,680
the small seed breeder

1095
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,560
yeah

1096
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:01,838
in a way that it never happened before

1097
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:03,599
and i don't know

1098
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:06,239
i don't even know that you know people

1099
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:08,320
would even know who csi or riot would be

1100
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:10,000
without those two innovations

1101
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,320
they still don't know who riot is but

1102
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,519
it's all right

1103
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,680
um

1104
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:18,480
you know we're we're about let's see

1105
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:21,279
for uh 50 minutes in so if you want to

1106
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,719
start doing some questions that are uh

1107
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,400
uh you know

1108
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:25,679
if you want to start answering any caleb

1109
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,119
we could do that or if you want to talk

1110
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:30,239
anymore on the breeding topic we could

1111
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:32,720
do that i'm okay with whatever

1112
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:33,838
all right well i can tell you dude that

1113
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:34,799
uh

1114
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:36,559
uh

1115
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,280
questions for you

1116
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:42,320
predominate the questions this week

1117
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,599
so i'll try to do every week um to be

1118
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,200
honest

1119
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:47,599
you know even even the weeks that you're

1120
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:50,159
not here uh there's a bunch of stuff

1121
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:51,838
that people want to for us to ask

1122
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:53,279
because they know you

1123
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:55,119
uh

1124
00:39:53,280 --> 00:40:00,000
so maybe uh

1125
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:00,000
you know let's see let's talk about um

1126
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,960
here's here's a basic one

1127
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:06,799
what was your very first cut

1128
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,639
and what what what is one of the cuts

1129
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,920
that you could say you hold closest to

1130
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:11,598
your heart amongst your current

1131
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,599
collection

1132
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:16,880
well my very first cut

1133
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:20,079
um was a northern lights from my dad

1134
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,358
and he he gave he gave me that cut

1135
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,480
in

1136
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:25,440
in uh

1137
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,199
in 94. um

1138
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:31,280
and i had that one all the way up until

1139
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:32,639
i think 2002 and then stupidly lost it

1140
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,200
um

1141
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:36,639
but uh the the the closest thing to that

1142
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:38,799
anymore is like

1143
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:41,279
chem number chem dog number four

1144
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,720
you know yeah that stuff is very similar

1145
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,599
to the old norton lights i got from my

1146
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:45,679
dad

1147
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:48,318
um

1148
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:49,919
as far as favorites go i i always talk

1149
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:51,679
about it you know just

1150
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,000
just in case anybody has ever come

1151
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:57,118
across it but you know my dad also gave

1152
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,280
me a around the same era this uriah cut

1153
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,640
and i mean that one is still one of my

1154
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,599
favorites

1155
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:06,000
and i think it might be possible to

1156
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:08,960
recreate something like it with like say

1157
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,280
a pine tar kush a bit of og kush and

1158
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,760
maybe something super super

1159
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,680
just piney lemony blah blah blah even

1160
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,960
more so than og

1161
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:18,480
yeah

1162
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,440
i don't know but uh

1163
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:24,719

1168
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:36,879
early 2000s and i'm pretty sure that cut

1169
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,639
dates back to the 80s um yeah you know

1170
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,559
up there up there in portland and

1171
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:43,440
washington and all that

1172
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:45,838
um but that one's that one's extremely

1173
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,720
unique but then again uh

1174
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:48,400
you know

1175
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:49,679
you know i'm a fan of the purple so

1176
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,920
i absolutely

1177
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:54,159
you know love mendo purple

1178
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,159
um

1179
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,040
and then uh

1180
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:02,318
you know uh you know i've had urkel for

1181
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:04,400
damn near 20 years now and you know she

1182
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:06,239
she's she's a tried and true favorite so

1183
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:09,358
if i lost any of those

1184
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:10,318
three i'd be a little bit upset

1185
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:12,239
yeah

1186
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:14,400
i'll take the next one because it's

1187
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:16,479
super simple uh

1188
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,920
can you please confirm the timeline for

1189
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,079
super skunk

1190
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:23,119
uh i can it's real that one's really

1191
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:25,359
easy um it was released by neville in

1192
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:26,960
the final year that he owned the seed

1193
00:42:25,358 --> 00:42:30,159
bank outright

1194
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:34,159
uh so super skunk was released to the

1195
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:37,358
public in the 1990 the seed bank catalog

1196
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:39,039
uh he took a maple leaf indica uh which

1197
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:42,318
is supposedly called

1198
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:43,440
afghan tea and he crossed that to one of

1199
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:45,838
uh

1200
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,760
sam skunk man's skunk lines

1201
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:48,880
and he said that put the funk back in

1202
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,079
the skunk

1203
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:55,119
um and it became a it had a it had a

1204
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:57,280
great name it had a great look uh became

1205
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:01,280
super popular in the 90s

1206
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:03,440
um so super skunk was uh when people

1207
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,040
talk about oh i had you know mid 80s

1208
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:08,318
super skunk or whatever i'm not saying

1209
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:10,800
that there wasn't skunk aromas out there

1210
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:13,679
but the actual super skunk name

1211
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:15,440
came about in the 1990 uh

1212
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:17,679
seed bank catalog

1213
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,039
uh this one is for caleb it's a pretty

1214
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:20,000
good question

1215
00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:22,239
uh

1216
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,920
do you feel that males have a place in

1217
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:27,039
modern cannabis breeding or are

1218
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:30,639
reversals the future and why

1219
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:32,880
oh i absolutely do um i'm i've never

1220
00:43:30,639 --> 00:43:34,559
been one of those types to rule out

1221
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,559
anything so

1222
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:37,838
i think there's a place for feminized

1223
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:39,838
seeds and

1224
00:43:37,838 --> 00:43:42,000
you know feminized breeding and i think

1225
00:43:39,838 --> 00:43:45,440
there's just a valley as valuable a

1226
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,559
place for regular breeding um

1227
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,318
so

1228
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:49,440
absolutely i mean

1229
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:51,759
you know

1230
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:54,480
i i started out doing just as much

1231
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:57,280
regular work as feminized work

1232
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,400
i just didn't really capitalize on

1233
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:59,839
selling

1234
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:02,079
you know much of the regular work

1235
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:03,440
because it kind of just took an aside

1236
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:04,800
because you got to select out all those

1237
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,318
damn mails

1238
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,680
yeah right yeah

1239
00:44:06,318 --> 00:44:09,920
um

1240
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:11,279
the next question i'm actually not going

1241
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,039
to have caleb answer i'm just going to

1242
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,319
make a joke about it and it's it's

1243
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:16,559
nothing against the it's a great

1244
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:18,719
question but could caleb please talk

1245
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:21,199
about interesting things he learned from

1246
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:23,118
any or every line he self

1247
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:26,960
so you're gonna have to wait for caleb's

1248
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:29,200
ten ten volume uh oats of office on

1249
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:31,760
every line he's self because

1250
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:33,759
uh he's constantly uh selfing things

1251
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,800
over the last 10 years or so and that's

1252
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,880
such a

1253
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:40,160
that's a that's uh we could just talk

1254
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:41,760
for hours um and there's just dozens of

1255
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:44,399
cuts that he's done that to at this

1256
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:47,839
point so it's a little too wide it is a

1257
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,680
good question but boy it really is

1258
00:44:47,838 --> 00:44:50,880
a novel

1259
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:54,480
i will say

1260
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:56,000
i will say i take uh pictures

1261
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,318
um and

1262
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,519
you know they help with mental notes on

1263
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:03,199
more or less every single s1 i grow so

1264
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:05,519
i'm i think i'm headed up to about two

1265
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:06,239
million pictures strong as far as you

1266
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:08,000
know

1267
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:10,399
the the s1

1268
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,880
s1 pictures are going

1269
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:14,240
i'll ask this one again because it got a

1270
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,039
lot of votes

1271
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:19,579
are you gonna try or continue to try to

1272
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:21,599
reverse the irene kush

1273
00:45:19,579 --> 00:45:24,318
[Music]

1274
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:27,519
i don't know i mean yeah when you get

1275
00:45:24,318 --> 00:45:30,800
when you get 20 s1 seeds from half a

1276
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:30,800
half of a light

1277
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,920
that's a little radical

1278
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,960
and and also i don't know if people know

1279
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,000
but

1280
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,639
um

1281
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,960
the the irene you know for half a

1282
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:44,239
thousand watt light produced 20 seeds

1283
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,838
but the

1284
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:50,000
the the triangle kush uh that got the

1285
00:45:47,838 --> 00:45:54,078
side pollination from that in the bed

1286
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,880
next to it produced like 750 seeds

1287
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:57,280
so

1288
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,200
the pollen was viable it just didn't

1289
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,560
pollinate itself

1290
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:02,318
it's very interesting

1291
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:04,799
yeah so and that's an interesting

1292
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:07,599
statement too in that um even when

1293
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,680
people get viable pollen uh there's some

1294
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:12,000
cuts out there's some cuts out there the

1295
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:14,239
mac would be one um there's some others

1296
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,559
that matt could talk about that you have

1297
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:18,719
verifiable pollen and it pollinates

1298
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:21,519
everything around it just fine and it

1299
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:23,679
doesn't pollinate that female plant very

1300
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:26,400
well at all there's no plants that have

1301
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:28,318
very few pistols on them and the pistols

1302
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:31,039
don't seem to be doing a very good job

1303
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:32,159
of transferring that that pollen grain

1304
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:34,400
to

1305
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:36,879
where it needs to go to fertilize the

1306
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,480
egg and create a seed

1307
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,519
so there's some interesting stuff in

1308
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,079
that

1309
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:44,318
uh this is another really good question

1310
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:45,359
for caleb and i think uh it's pretty

1311
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:47,920
valuable

1312
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:50,078
i am interested to hear inspectors speak

1313
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:53,599
on growing large populations in

1314
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:53,599
relatively small spaces

1315
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,200
i mean

1316
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:58,559
ideally i

1317
00:46:57,199 --> 00:47:00,719
like to

1318
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:00,719
do

1319
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:06,000
no more than 36 plants per light when

1320
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:07,599
i'm growing large populations of like

1321
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,519
feminized seeds out

1322
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:11,039
and you know i'll do that in a four to

1323
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:13,599
six k room so

1324
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:15,679
you know i'm doing 100 to 200 plants

1325
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:17,440
generally um

1326
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:19,440
it just it just gives you a better

1327
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,800
better idea of you know what's in that

1328
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,760
genetic pool

1329
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,280
um

1330
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,280
i have

1331
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:28,160
done like single light you know rooms

1332
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:29,839
where i pack in like 80 plants

1333
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:31,838
you know under the one light and i

1334
00:47:29,838 --> 00:47:34,318
flower them out you know at you know

1335
00:47:31,838 --> 00:47:36,480
four or six inches tall whatever

1336
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:37,838
and uh i mean

1337
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:40,800
you know

1338
00:47:37,838 --> 00:47:43,358
for for anybody limited on space i mean

1339
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,800
that's an excellent way to go i mean

1340
00:47:43,358 --> 00:47:46,639
especially if you're doing them in like

1341
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,839
small six inch pots

1342
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:49,679
where you know

1343
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:51,119
you can make selections out of that

1344
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:52,960
larger pool

1345
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:56,240
you know and uh

1346
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:58,720
then you can pull them out and you know

1347
00:47:56,239 --> 00:48:01,118
you know re-veg them and you know

1348
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:03,598
actually have you know have fairly

1349
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:04,559
heavily selected stock to work with

1350
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:06,079
so

1351
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:08,559
you know you don't have to grow your

1352
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:10,400
plants out in a 5 gallon pot or 10

1353
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:12,720
gallon pot or whatever you don't have to

1354
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,838
grow big to know what you want you know

1355
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:16,558
yeah i mean

1356
00:48:13,838 --> 00:48:19,119
if you're looking for potency uh

1357
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:20,720
smell flavor

1358
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:24,000
you know any of the

1359
00:48:20,719 --> 00:48:26,480
the really main criteria you don't need

1360
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,880
just big plants i mean if you're

1361
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:31,280
expecting for structure or hemp

1362
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,079
maybe you need a little more room right

1363
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:34,720
yeah

1364
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:37,039
so i'll add to that i'll add to that as

1365
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:39,279
well uh caleb has a little bit different

1366
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:40,239
style than i do in the in that he grows

1367
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,240
uh

1368
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:44,000
small seed plants like that fairly

1369
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:46,078
tightly packed together and just so

1370
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,119
people know when he's talking about

1371
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:51,680
doing 36 plants a light um that

1372
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:54,000
generally it's it's on like a a you know

1373
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:55,919
one of those uh old tables like a four

1374
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,280
and a half by four and a half kind of

1375
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,440
area

1376
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:02,720
so it's kind of a six it's kind of a six

1377
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,519
wide you know six deep type of scenario

1378
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:05,759
there

1379
00:49:03,519 --> 00:49:09,280
um if you're i used to do it slightly

1380
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:11,280
differently than that um i would i would

1381
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:14,240
grow out a bunch of seed i would take

1382
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,839
cuttings from that seed uh as soon as

1383
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:18,000
multiple cuttings had rooted i would

1384
00:49:15,838 --> 00:49:19,679
ditch the seed itself because i found

1385
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,760
when you were growing regular stuff the

1386
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:23,519
seed energy i didn't want to know what

1387
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,680
it did as a seed i wanted to know what

1388
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:27,599
it did as a clone because sometimes that

1389
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:30,399
can be different and i wanted to see its

1390
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:32,240
growth structure as a clone um

1391
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,240
and what he mentioned is is that when

1392
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:36,159
you grow up things too big and you

1393
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:38,479
flower them and all of a sudden you get

1394
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:40,078
10 or 12 pounds or something and you

1395
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,880
have a lot of booths

1396
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:43,119
or

1397
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,200
average not every not everything is a

1398
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:46,640
home run you know even amongst lines

1399
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:47,838
that produce

1400
00:49:46,639 --> 00:49:50,480
great plants

1401
00:49:47,838 --> 00:49:52,558
there's still a lot of yeah you know and

1402
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:54,400
so then you end up with a lot of ants so

1403
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:57,200
what i would do is somewhat similar to

1404
00:49:54,400 --> 00:50:01,039
him in that i would throw away the seed

1405
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:01,919
plant and then i would pack tables with

1406
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:04,159
you know

1407
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:06,318
four to six inch tall cuts

1408
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:08,639
and i would flower the cut because as

1409
00:50:06,318 --> 00:50:10,558
caleb just mentioned if i got a half

1410
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:13,199
ounce or three quarters of an ounce or

1411
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:15,920
an ounce off a plant and i got to see

1412
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:18,239
what the cola looked like there

1413
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:20,559
that's all i needed you know

1414
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:22,159
yeah you know and and you you would get

1415
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:24,240
enough of the terps you'd get enough of

1416
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:27,039
the smell you could you know if you have

1417
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:29,598
a quarter seven to ten grams to smoke

1418
00:50:27,039 --> 00:50:31,279
that'll give you enough indication

1419
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:33,599
that you need to

1420
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:36,880
um that you can go back and grow some of

1421
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:38,640
those selections uh in a larger in a

1422
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:40,240
larger scenario grow more of them grow

1423
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:42,799
them bigger see there

1424
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:46,159
see there um because that way if you get

1425
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:49,039
a bunch of bunk it's only five to 14

1426
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:50,879
grams of bunk per per plant you know and

1427
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:52,558
you get enough and that's what you need

1428
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:55,680
to start doing in order to really run

1429
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:58,640
through numbers uh in that regard and

1430
00:50:55,679 --> 00:51:00,719
have it only take up so much space

1431
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:02,400
the other issue that happens and you

1432
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:04,959
know i have a different method than

1433
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,880
caleb but it's a universal problem is

1434
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:09,199
when you start growing out large numbers

1435
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:11,358
to test and you don't want to lose

1436
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:13,118
something you end up needing to keep

1437
00:51:11,358 --> 00:51:14,719
backups

1438
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:15,920
of the things you're flowering so you

1439
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:18,558
don't lose them

1440
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:20,079
yeah right there's basically two methods

1441
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:22,480
you can either

1442
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:25,039
keep backups which is time-consuming and

1443
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:26,000
takes up a bunch of space in your veg

1444
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:28,159
or

1445
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,239
you can start pulling if you grow in

1446
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:31,759
pots you could start pulling out small

1447
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:33,118
pots of things that you think are

1448
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,599
amazing when they're only part of the

1449
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:37,280
way through flowering and then revert

1450
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:39,280
that's kind of a european method and

1451
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,400
kind of and start reverting them back to

1452
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,359
veg

1453
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,800
um

1454
00:51:41,358 --> 00:51:44,639
you know

1455
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:47,680
but you know it's you know it's a real

1456
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:49,440
issue um because you know it's happened

1457
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:52,639
to caleb talks to me about it all the

1458
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:56,800
time is that you know uh you know i grew

1459
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:58,719
a room of 240 plants and my two my three

1460
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:00,480
favorites two of the cuttings didn't

1461
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:01,519
make it by the time i realized it was my

1462
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,480
favorite

1463
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:05,759
yeah

1464
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:07,599
you know and so trying to save copies

1465
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:10,160
that you can go back and actually deal

1466
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:11,680
with and the space involved is a real

1467
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:14,078
pain in the ass

1468
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:15,440
for lack of a better way to put it uh

1469
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:17,440
it takes up you know you want to do a

1470
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:20,559
big hunt and you want to keep that thing

1471
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:23,280
around that means you got a big batch

1472
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:26,160
here's a good question and i fully

1473
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:27,680
but huh okay

1474
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:30,000
with not so on

1475
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:31,118
uh taking cuts off of the seed plants

1476
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,719
and growing the

1477
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:34,400
cut the cuttings

1478
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:36,799
versus the seed plants because seed

1479
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:39,680
plants will never give you an accurate

1480
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:41,920
representation of what that clone is

1481
00:52:39,679 --> 00:52:44,318
going to become past the seed stage so

1482
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:46,639
there's really i fully agree there's no

1483
00:52:44,318 --> 00:52:47,838
reason to grow the seed plants

1484
00:52:46,639 --> 00:52:50,558
themselves

1485
00:52:47,838 --> 00:52:53,679
when you're just selecting for future

1486
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:55,519
you know you know clone stock that's

1487
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:57,440
going to give you the best yeah bones

1488
00:52:55,519 --> 00:52:59,440
don't have a tap root you grow a bunch

1489
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:01,440
of seeds they can be taller they can be

1490
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:03,358
lankier they can have some more life

1491
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,679
energy in different ways in them than

1492
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:07,679
the clone and since you only get one

1493
00:53:05,679 --> 00:53:09,919
shot at the seed that's why a lot of

1494
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:12,078
people like back in the day would want

1495
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,920
to grow seed outdoor

1496
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:15,760
because the vigor contained within a

1497
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,358
seed plant would give you could give you

1498
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:20,400
a larger plant

1499
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:23,039
uh a bigger plant than a clone um

1500
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:25,680
there's some famous clones uh my maui

1501
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:27,519
cut does it the blue dream does it uh

1502
00:53:25,679 --> 00:53:30,000
green crack does it there's some famous

1503
00:53:27,519 --> 00:53:32,239
clones that despite being clones will

1504
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,199
give you huge plants outside

1505
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:37,759
yeah but if you went back to the 215 era

1506
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:40,078
five or six years ago a lot of the big

1507
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:42,880
giant gardens you would see on instagram

1508
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:44,318
uh in terms of outdoor we're all seat

1509
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,480
right but

1510
00:53:44,318 --> 00:53:48,239
you got an eight or nine foot tall room

1511
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,679
with you know thousand watt lights or

1512
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:51,358
something and all of a sudden you got

1513
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:53,759
some seed energy and the thing wants to

1514
00:53:51,358 --> 00:53:57,119
be seven feet tall and you're doing

1515
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:58,640
bending and trellising and corralling of

1516
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,519
the plant and it's a huge pain in the

1517
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:01,199
ass

1518
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:02,079
you know

1519
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:03,519
so

1520
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:05,680
you know that's the

1521
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:07,280
you know caleb actually has had a pretty

1522
00:54:05,679 --> 00:54:09,440
good method of

1523
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:12,079
taking clones off of plants when they're

1524
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:14,800
a couple weeks in to bloom

1525
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:17,440
which a lot of people wouldn't do

1526
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:19,039
but in that regard it it the plants kind

1527
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:21,039
of freak out for a while because they're

1528
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:22,558
into flower but that's actually a

1529
00:54:21,039 --> 00:54:25,199
benefit because one of the things you're

1530
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:27,760
trying to do when you're keeping clones

1531
00:54:25,199 --> 00:54:29,679
in a different room for veg is you want

1532
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:31,119
to keep them kind of small

1533
00:54:29,679 --> 00:54:32,399
until you figure out which ones are

1534
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:34,559
worth it

1535
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,960
because you might have 180 clones and

1536
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:38,640
like you only care about six of them

1537
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,000
right yeah you don't you don't know

1538
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:41,598
which six

1539
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,079
so the end and when they're when they're

1540
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:46,640
in flower it takes uh you know a good

1541
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:48,480
month maybe even six weeks or so before

1542
00:54:46,639 --> 00:54:50,838
they start vegging out of it so you buy

1543
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:52,559
yourself some time keeping them in those

1544
00:54:50,838 --> 00:54:54,639
flats

1545
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:56,960
we actually just took uh

1546
00:54:54,639 --> 00:54:57,838
12 flats of clones this week

1547
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,880
of

1548
00:54:57,838 --> 00:55:02,880
tk abc f3 so

1549
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,720
yippee skippy to that

1550
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:06,720
[ __ ] yeah the other thing i should

1551
00:55:04,719 --> 00:55:09,679
mention just because caleb's told me

1552
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:12,639
about it a bunch is that

1553
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:15,919
when you start judging plants on growth

1554
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:17,519
and structure and weight and frost and

1555
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:20,559
all that those are good things to judge

1556
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:22,159
on but a lot of the times uh he finds

1557
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:24,798
out his favorites

1558
00:55:22,159 --> 00:55:27,118
end up being some shitty ass run

1559
00:55:24,798 --> 00:55:29,280
uh that wasn't very impressive didn't

1560
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:32,079
look very good he wasn't very happy with

1561
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:34,480
it never thought much of it and then you

1562
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:36,318
know him and his crew end up testing it

1563
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,480
which is actually the the part that

1564
00:55:36,318 --> 00:55:40,239
matters at the end and they're like oh

1565
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:41,679
man this is special

1566
00:55:40,239 --> 00:55:43,679
but you never would have thought it was

1567
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:45,679
special growing because it just looked

1568
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:48,318
like a it just looked like a run it

1569
00:55:45,679 --> 00:55:49,759
looked like it was odd it had funkiness

1570
00:55:48,318 --> 00:55:51,759
to it it didn't have the greatest bud

1571
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:54,079
structure and then of course that's

1572
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:56,480
going to be like the tastiest

1573
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:59,359
one with the best topping and i'm a huge

1574
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,358
fan of runs

1575
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:05,679
in general you know i would say too

1576
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,680
that we could mention this because

1577
00:56:05,679 --> 00:56:08,558
because you know he laughed about it but

1578
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:10,399
really

1579
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:13,599
if you look at like caleb's work with

1580
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:16,240
freak show or you look at the abc or you

1581
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:18,559
look at uh you know runs and things like

1582
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:21,838
that like what he's really talking about

1583
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:23,920
is like he's a huge fan of outliers

1584
00:56:21,838 --> 00:56:26,000
he's a huge fan of things that are

1585
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:28,559
abnormal things that pop up in a

1586
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,719
population that might be rare things

1587
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:32,559
that you know uh might not be that

1588
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:34,480
common but then it popped up and you're

1589
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:36,000
like oh look at that little thing

1590
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:38,159
you know what direction could i take

1591
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,239
that and strangely

1592
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:41,440
you know we should mention this too is

1593
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:42,399
that

1594
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,240
so

1595
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,920
i'll i'll stretch it out a little bit

1596
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:47,598
but if you go into the store any

1597
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:49,838
vegetable you buy in the store whether

1598
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:50,880
it's a tomato or a zucchini or whatever

1599
00:56:49,838 --> 00:56:53,599
else

1600
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:56,400
that thing has been picked

1601
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:58,318
to grow because it yields well like for

1602
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,240
instance let's take a tomato right the

1603
00:56:58,318 --> 00:57:02,880
most important thing for a tomato for

1604
00:57:00,239 --> 00:57:05,919
tomato growers is weight

1605
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:09,200
color does the skin break does it rot

1606
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:11,039
and transit you know all these stacking

1607
00:57:09,199 --> 00:57:12,558
can you stack it in transit does it

1608
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:14,480
bruise easily

1609
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:17,040
all these factors are huge

1610
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:18,960
taste and flavor and texture are way

1611
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:20,960
down on the list right

1612
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:23,679
so the whole reason why heirloom

1613
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:25,679
tomatoes made a comeback is because

1614
00:57:23,679 --> 00:57:27,199
these things actually taste good

1615
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:28,639
where when people were growing things

1616
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:31,199
for production

1617
00:57:28,639 --> 00:57:32,639
okay um

1618
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:35,118
zucchini

1619
00:57:32,639 --> 00:57:37,759
anything you name it they're grown

1620
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:40,160
because the producer it it grows well

1621
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:41,119
for them right it produces a lot for the

1622
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:44,318
space

1623
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:46,480
cannabis is pretty unique in that

1624
00:57:44,318 --> 00:57:49,199
the stuff that becomes really popular

1625
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:50,798
became really popular because consumers

1626
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:52,798
enjoyed it

1627
00:57:50,798 --> 00:57:55,358
no one would ever in a million years

1628
00:57:52,798 --> 00:57:57,838
pick any kind of og kush

1629
00:57:55,358 --> 00:58:01,598
as a production

1630
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:04,159
viney small buds doesn't hold itself up

1631
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:06,240
a pain in the ass to grow a weak root

1632
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:09,199
system all those things would prevent

1633
00:58:06,239 --> 00:58:10,959
you from ever seeing it in most normal

1634
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:12,798
agriculture because they would eliminate

1635
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:15,358
it because it didn't have the qualities

1636
00:58:12,798 --> 00:58:17,519
needed to be put to scale right

1637
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:18,798
people would want every you'd get blue

1638
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:21,039
dream

1639
00:58:18,798 --> 00:58:23,280
right because it's a fast-growing

1640
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:25,838
vigorous thing that yields a ton doesn't

1641
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:28,000
take that long and so cannabis is a bit

1642
00:58:25,838 --> 00:58:30,639
unique in that even like something like

1643
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,880
sour diesel uh sour diesel is kind of

1644
00:58:30,639 --> 00:58:34,558
tricky to grow well a lot of people find

1645
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:36,798
it finicky if you have too many bud

1646
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:39,680
sites on sour diesel it'll give you a

1647
00:58:36,798 --> 00:58:40,559
lot of feathery almost weed

1648
00:58:39,679 --> 00:58:42,480
right

1649
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:43,839
um you know there's a lot that goes on

1650
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,440
with that so there's a lot of very

1651
00:58:43,838 --> 00:58:47,759
famous strains

1652
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:49,519
that have really really crappy

1653
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,040
production traits

1654
00:58:49,519 --> 00:58:52,798
right hot

1655
00:58:51,039 --> 00:58:54,159
the pup you know all kinds of things you

1656
00:58:52,798 --> 00:58:55,920
know um

1657
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:58,078
you know and so

1658
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:59,838
you know so there's that you know matt

1659
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:02,000
way earlier in the thing was talking

1660
00:58:59,838 --> 00:59:03,838
about root structure which is not a very

1661
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,440
bred for trait

1662
00:59:03,838 --> 00:59:07,679
there's certain plants that you grow in

1663
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:10,559
the same room that some plants drink

1664
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:12,480
like crazy and i'll use og kush as an

1665
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:15,040
example a lot of og kush's have

1666
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:17,838
typically weak root systems

1667
00:59:15,039 --> 00:59:20,000
they don't grow vigorous root systems so

1668
00:59:17,838 --> 00:59:23,358
as a result they can only drink so fast

1669
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,159
so as a result they only grow so fast

1670
00:59:23,358 --> 00:59:25,920
so

1671
00:59:24,159 --> 00:59:28,798
you know that's a consideration too is

1672
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:30,960
that cannabis has been i mean i'll tell

1673
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:33,440
you guys a funny story really quick when

1674
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:36,639
skittles first came out uh

1675
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:39,200
doodles is notorious for growing slow

1676
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:41,039
right uh caleb and i had had a mutual

1677
00:59:39,199 --> 00:59:43,439
friend that made an ig post where he was

1678
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:45,440
like you know in in october he's like

1679
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:47,440
i'm vegging these skittles for my next

1680
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:49,440
year's light depth hopefully they'll be

1681
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:51,200
three hopefully they'll be three feet

1682
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:52,000
tall in six months

1683
00:59:51,199 --> 00:59:52,798
right

1684
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,039
where

1685
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:57,199
skittles might be like winning awards

1686
00:59:55,039 --> 00:59:59,599
for its terps and winning awards for its

1687
00:59:57,199 --> 01:00:01,439
extracts and everything else but try to

1688
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:02,400
get the thing higher than four feet tall

1689
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:05,519
outside

1690
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:06,960
yeah it's a slow growing bushy little

1691
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:09,280
hedge of a plant

1692
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:11,119
and so my point to that is that most of

1693
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:13,280
the famous strains that people like

1694
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:14,798
either for their tur profile or they're

1695
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:16,400
high

1696
01:00:14,798 --> 01:00:18,960
wouldn't make the cut in normal

1697
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:20,400
agriculture because they don't have the

1698
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:22,720
growth traits

1699
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:24,079
yeah and it's really really difficult

1700
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:25,519
because that's what i was that's what

1701
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:28,720
made me think of it when i was joking

1702
01:00:25,519 --> 01:00:31,920
about caleb's love for runts is that a

1703
01:00:28,719 --> 01:00:33,679
lot of times the the freak the mutant

1704
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:35,920
the one that grew short the one that was

1705
01:00:33,679 --> 01:00:38,318
a pain in the ass to grow that one's the

1706
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:39,599
one that tastes amazing

1707
01:00:38,318 --> 01:00:40,798
that's the one that will get people

1708
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:42,720
excited

1709
01:00:40,798 --> 01:00:45,199
right and the one that was like five

1710
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:47,039
feet tall and threw huge colas all over

1711
01:00:45,199 --> 01:00:49,199
it and grew like a champ and barely

1712
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:51,039
required any work that one ends up being

1713
01:00:49,199 --> 01:00:52,719
a little bit more boring

1714
01:00:51,039 --> 01:00:54,400
right and you're like man i wish i could

1715
01:00:52,719 --> 01:00:56,000
merge those two

1716
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,200
i mean you can talk about that for a

1717
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,679
minute caleb

1718
01:00:57,199 --> 01:01:02,078
i i swear the biggest biggest girls at

1719
01:00:59,679 --> 01:01:03,759
least biggest feminized girls i grow

1720
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:07,599
they always seem to have a little

1721
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:09,760
persuasion to hang in the balls

1722
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:11,440
i don't know if you notice that but the

1723
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:13,920
big girls yeah women say that about me

1724
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,920
all the time

1725
01:01:15,519 --> 01:01:20,079
i got a question for both of you that

1726
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:22,798
that i'll follow up with on

1727
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:24,079
after after i ask you guys so kay's

1728
01:01:22,798 --> 01:01:25,199
brothers and me and caleb actually

1729
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:26,880
talked about this yesterday and i think

1730
01:01:25,199 --> 01:01:29,039
me and mia natsu talked about it a few

1731
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:31,519
days ago i know crybaby was a part of

1732
01:01:29,039 --> 01:01:34,639
that hayes brothers vintage california

1733
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:37,199
kush 1980s picture in high times in the

1734
01:01:34,639 --> 01:01:39,440
79 issue they talk of a new hybrid known

1735
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:42,078
as cush cush

1736
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:44,639
uh in norcal a cross between hawaiian

1737
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:47,839
hash plant and thai specifically calling

1738
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:50,318
it kush by 79 they already knew of hindu

1739
01:01:47,838 --> 01:01:52,880
so what the [ __ ] is this kali kush is it

1740
01:01:50,318 --> 01:01:55,279
pure kush the picture does look like the

1741
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:57,440
malibu in the article they straight up

1742
01:01:55,280 --> 01:02:00,720
say afghani skunk weed it's been driving

1743
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:00,720
me crazy for 10 years

1744
01:02:01,199 --> 01:02:04,838
caleb anything

1745
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:06,640
i don't know

1746
01:02:04,838 --> 01:02:09,119
well

1747
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:10,078
i can make a couple general comments

1748
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:14,720
so

1749
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:16,720
kush is a general term right um there's

1750
01:02:14,719 --> 01:02:18,399
a huge mountain range it's the second

1751
01:02:16,719 --> 01:02:20,399
tallest mountain range in the world next

1752
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:22,400
to the himalayas

1753
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:24,240
and it runs through afghanistan and

1754
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:25,838
pakistan down to the ocean and it's

1755
01:02:24,239 --> 01:02:26,719
called the hindu kush

1756
01:02:25,838 --> 01:02:28,400
so

1757
01:02:26,719 --> 01:02:31,759
uh you know we talked in a previous

1758
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:34,559
podcast about how names are relatively

1759
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:36,880
new and back in the day people talked

1760
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:39,599
about people named things

1761
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:40,480
uh per their region of origin

1762
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:41,680
right

1763
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:44,240
oaxacan

1764
01:02:41,679 --> 01:02:45,519
michoacan panamanian

1765
01:02:44,239 --> 01:02:47,679
hawaiian

1766
01:02:45,519 --> 01:02:50,798
you know various various aspects like

1767
01:02:47,679 --> 01:02:51,919
that they rarely had names that weren't

1768
01:02:50,798 --> 01:02:52,719
regional

1769
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:53,599
so

1770
01:02:52,719 --> 01:02:55,118
kush

1771
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:57,599
could literally be

1772
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:58,640
anything collected from the hindu kush

1773
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:00,960
mountains

1774
01:02:58,639 --> 01:03:03,118
and the hindu kush mountains could be as

1775
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:05,760
low as one or two thousand feet above

1776
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:06,960
sea level and as high as five six seven

1777
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,880
eight thousand

1778
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,920
uh above sea level in some of these big

1779
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,119
valleys

1780
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:13,599
so

1781
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:15,039
you know and then secondly to that and

1782
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:17,200
what people what he's probably really

1783
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:18,799
asking is that

1784
01:03:17,199 --> 01:03:22,078
there are

1785
01:03:18,798 --> 01:03:24,798
there are a few plants um that popped up

1786
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:28,240
and became famous uh everybody mostly

1787
01:03:24,798 --> 01:03:30,559
knows the story but if they don't um

1788
01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:33,439
there's a there's a bubba kush line

1789
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:36,559
um and there's a kush line

1790
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:39,519
that has various origin stories but

1791
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:43,200
um is most likely a mix of northern

1792
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:46,159
californian and european genetics that

1793
01:03:43,199 --> 01:03:48,000
popped up in florida came to la

1794
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:50,078
became a craze

1795
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,318
people got extreme amounts of money for

1796
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:53,280
it and then it became very popular and

1797
01:03:52,318 --> 01:03:55,759
so

1798
01:03:53,280 --> 01:04:00,079
what most people today know as cush

1799
01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:01,680
you could classify as tk or ghost or

1800
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:03,359
that's what most people know because

1801
01:04:01,679 --> 01:04:06,480
that's what became popular that's what's

1802
01:04:03,358 --> 01:04:09,199
been traded on forums and traded on ig

1803
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:10,240
and everybody else and bought in clubs

1804
01:04:09,199 --> 01:04:12,639
and so

1805
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:14,318
that's what most people today know know

1806
01:04:12,639 --> 01:04:16,558
of as kush

1807
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:17,519
uh but that's a lot narrower of a gene

1808
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:20,559
pool

1809
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:23,280
than [ __ ] that came from the hindu kush

1810
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:25,480
yeah right so you go all the way back to

1811
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:28,960
hindu you go back all the way back to

1812
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:31,199
1979 and you have matt and i might do a

1813
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:33,599
short about this soon about the hippie

1814
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:35,919

1815
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:39,519
you have some you have some euros or you

1816

1818
01:04:40,639 --> 01:04:43,759
kashmir

1819
01:04:41,838 --> 01:04:46,480

1820
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:48,960
pakistan or afghanistan and they bring

1821
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:51,039
seeds back to their buddy

1822
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:52,318
and they're from kush

1823
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:54,720
um

1824
01:04:52,318 --> 01:04:57,759
what what date was was that article from

1825
01:04:54,719 --> 01:04:59,679
again 79 79 issue they talked of a new

1826
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:01,839
hybrid known as kush

1827
01:04:59,679 --> 01:05:04,399
okay well you know

1828
01:05:01,838 --> 01:05:06,239
remember i was telling you how um

1829
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,519
they were hating on humble

1830
01:05:06,239 --> 01:05:10,000
that back

1831
01:05:07,519 --> 01:05:11,920
back in the 70s i think it was

1832
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,519
i think it was probably that same issue

1833
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:16,000
they they were all bitter you know that

1834
01:05:13,519 --> 01:05:19,679
humboldt's all popular because of their

1835
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:22,239
indicas or their cushes right yeah and

1836
01:05:19,679 --> 01:05:25,358
you know they they were upset that their

1837
01:05:22,239 --> 01:05:27,199
hazes you know were getting downplayed

1838
01:05:25,358 --> 01:05:30,078
well you know like we've talked plenty

1839
01:05:27,199 --> 01:05:32,239
of times back in 78 you know that was

1840
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:34,400
that was roughly the year that pretty

1841
01:05:32,239 --> 01:05:35,358
much it seems like everybody around

1842
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,119
humble

1843
01:05:35,358 --> 01:05:39,519
you know

1844
01:05:37,119 --> 01:05:42,079
trinity all that

1845
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:45,280
had you know we're growing uh purple

1846
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:47,599
kush there was a huge influx you know of

1847
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:49,519
of purple cush seed you know and

1848
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:51,680
obviously just like um not so was

1849
01:05:49,519 --> 01:05:54,159
talking about that's that's just hindu

1850
01:05:51,679 --> 01:05:57,199
kush seed and the purple is of course

1851
01:05:54,159 --> 01:06:00,399
the the purple pheno

1852
01:05:57,199 --> 01:06:02,159
or the purple genotype of that so yeah

1853
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:04,160
i'm i'm almost wondering if they didn't

1854
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:05,199
just get a hold of some of some of that

1855
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:08,078
seed

1856
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:09,838
and incorporate it into their hazes to

1857
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:11,760
kind of you know

1858
01:06:09,838 --> 01:06:14,400
up their market value

1859
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:16,559
yeah it's very possible

1860
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:19,119
and one thing i could add to that is

1861
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:22,400
that in modern breeding today

1862
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:24,480
um that same thing holds true which is a

1863
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:26,880
cut becomes famous

1864
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,920
and everybody breeds that cut into

1865
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:30,400
everything

1866
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:32,240
right right right so in the last 15

1867
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:34,240
years

1868
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:35,439
the amount of people that have used

1869
01:06:34,239 --> 01:06:37,439
cherry pie

1870
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:39,920
girl scout cookies

1871
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:41,280
five or eight different kush cuts

1872
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:43,838
skittles

1873
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:46,400
you sell you name it if it became famous

1874
01:06:43,838 --> 01:06:48,000
and desirable people would blend it into

1875
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,599
everything and so

1876
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,920
one of the things you know you see

1877
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:53,838
people out there that are like pumping

1878
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:55,680
up their various hybrids

1879
01:06:53,838 --> 01:06:57,679
and you know some of the stuff you see

1880
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:59,440
caleb do that people might be like oh

1881
01:06:57,679 --> 01:07:02,078
why the hell is he working with abc that

1882
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:03,519
looks weird oh that's funky freak show

1883
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:05,519
is [ __ ] up too why the [ __ ] you

1884
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:08,639
messing around with that i don't get it

1885
01:07:05,519 --> 01:07:10,000
some of it is like honestly with the

1886
01:07:08,639 --> 01:07:13,358
amount of work that's been done with

1887
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:15,199
cherry pie and cookies and kush

1888
01:07:13,358 --> 01:07:17,440
what new and exciting do you think is

1889
01:07:15,199 --> 01:07:19,838
going to pop out of that that someone

1890
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:22,079
hasn't already done in the last 10 years

1891
01:07:19,838 --> 01:07:24,558
yeah and if you take two hybrids that

1892
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:26,559
are mostly a mishmash of those things

1893
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:28,798
all smashed up together

1894
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:29,599
i'm not dissing crossing cush mints with

1895
01:07:28,798 --> 01:07:32,000
this

1896
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:34,000
but what are you going to find

1897
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,000
that's not something that's already

1898
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,079
somewhat similar to a lot that's out

1899
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:41,280
there it's very hard to find novel in

1900
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:43,359
new energy so people people have been

1901
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:45,359
every ever since the name game came

1902
01:07:43,358 --> 01:07:47,519
around and ever since popularity came

1903
01:07:45,358 --> 01:07:49,519
around like caleb was just mentioning

1904
01:07:47,519 --> 01:07:51,038
people might be crossing these afghans

1905
01:07:49,519 --> 01:07:53,119
to their hazes to increase its

1906
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:54,079
popularity right

1907
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:56,000
um

1908
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:58,400
people have been doing that for the last

1909
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:01,358
forever but it's increased dramatically

1910
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:04,160
in the last 20 years where it's like you

1911
01:08:01,358 --> 01:08:06,400
know uh there was uh

1912
01:08:04,159 --> 01:08:08,838
i mean this is a funny example but

1913
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:12,079
there's no cush in blackberry

1914
01:08:08,838 --> 01:08:12,880
kush right in the sense that

1915
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:14,640
kush

1916
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:17,520
for the most part like the reason why

1917
01:08:14,639 --> 01:08:20,000
people added kush to blackberry kush

1918
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:22,159
was because people wanted to buy kush

1919
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:24,319
you know sour gets added to a lot of

1920
01:08:22,158 --> 01:08:27,119
names or diesel gets added to a lot of

1921
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:30,080
names or names get changed because

1922
01:08:27,119 --> 01:08:31,519
there's a desire to sell

1923
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:34,079
certain things

1924
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:35,839
and then the desire to feed that market

1925
01:08:34,079 --> 01:08:38,158
either makes a lot of breeding happen

1926
01:08:35,838 --> 01:08:41,119
around a few select cuts and you're

1927
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:43,278
trying to get a hybrid that you can call

1928
01:08:41,119 --> 01:08:46,399
you know um there's a famous there's a

1929
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:48,400
there's a good cut up here called doxog

1930
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:50,559
and i would say that it's it's not the

1931
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:52,639
greatest cut it doesn't have very much

1932
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:53,679
og flavor it doesn't have very much in

1933
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,480
the way of

1934
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:57,199
uh

1935
01:08:54,479 --> 01:09:00,000
you know the the the high that i like

1936
01:08:57,198 --> 01:09:02,399
but it looks like a traditional kush

1937
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,238
um and it yields like crazy

1938
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:06,879
and so then people are gonna grow it

1939
01:09:04,238 --> 01:09:09,039
because it produces well and they can

1940
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:10,719
call it kush oh i'm looking for kush oh

1941
01:09:09,039 --> 01:09:13,600
well i have a ton of kush here buy this

1942
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:15,039
dox kush right and that was that rare

1943
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:17,279
dankness

1944
01:09:15,039 --> 01:09:18,719
yeah i think yeah and so

1945
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:20,000
you know and i'm not even trying to diss

1946
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:22,239
them or anything like that that's not

1947
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,838
the point the point is that

1948
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:26,479
is that you know

1949
01:09:23,838 --> 01:09:28,719
these names get added onto things

1950
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:31,119
because as long as it's desirable and

1951
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:32,000
easy to buy for instance

1952
01:09:31,119 --> 01:09:34,158
um

1953
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,560
you know uh caleb has got become pretty

1954
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:37,879
famous with his urkel crosses

1955
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:39,520
in

1956
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:41,520
0-405-0607

1957
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:43,520
i would say that you know eventually

1958
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:46,640
there was probably literally thousands

1959
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:49,359
of growers in mendo and humble that had

1960
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:51,920
lavender urkel grape ape

1961
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:54,000
uh you know you name it half a dozen of

1962
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:54,960
these different cuts to meet the purple

1963
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,198
craze

1964
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:59,439
and then as the purple craze phased into

1965
01:09:57,198 --> 01:10:02,399
the sour craze and the cush craze and

1966
01:09:59,439 --> 01:10:04,238
the cookie craze and the skittles craze

1967
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:07,439
it ends up like there's like six dudes

1968
01:10:04,238 --> 01:10:08,559
that held onto the urkel

1969
01:10:07,439 --> 01:10:10,719
right but

1970
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:12,480
15 years ago how many people did you

1971
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:13,920
know and humble that had some kind of

1972
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:15,119
urkel

1973
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:18,079
right

1974
01:10:15,119 --> 01:10:19,679
a lot everybody because it was everybody

1975
01:10:18,079 --> 01:10:21,600
because it was popular and a lot of

1976
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:24,399
buyers wanted it which means lots of

1977
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:26,239
people that produced had it and as soon

1978
01:10:24,399 --> 01:10:28,399
as the market shifted

1979
01:10:26,238 --> 01:10:31,198
so did the holding of the cut

1980
01:10:28,399 --> 01:10:33,599
and store that before that it was salmon

1981
01:10:31,198 --> 01:10:35,759
creek big bud and train wreck and snow

1982
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:38,000
and stuff like that yeah

1983
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:40,480
sure and so that's the thing right is

1984
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,760
that what happens is and this is sort of

1985
01:10:40,479 --> 01:10:44,000
the thing is that when things are

1986
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:45,600
popular everybody has it and everybody

1987
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,399
wants it and people want it from their

1988
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,960
friend

1989
01:10:46,399 --> 01:10:50,639
and as soon as it becomes unpopular the

1990
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:52,560
percentage of people that are willing to

1991
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:56,480
hold on to old cuts when there's no

1992
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:57,280
financial value to it becomes tiny

1993
01:10:56,479 --> 01:11:00,000
right

1994
01:10:57,279 --> 01:11:01,599
and you know uh then you have a bunch of

1995
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,760
people you know now we have a bunch of

1996
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:06,000
stuff going on in the community where

1997
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:07,920
most people there's legendary strains

1998
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,920
that very few people

1999
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:11,119
relative to today have actually seen or

2000
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:13,840
smoked

2001
01:11:11,119 --> 01:11:16,079
and so fakes proliferate

2002
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:17,600
um because they get passed around and

2003
01:11:16,079 --> 01:11:19,519
maybe the person passing it around

2004
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:22,079
doesn't even realize it's fake

2005
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:23,280
because he never had it in 1998 so he

2006
01:11:22,079 --> 01:11:25,279
doesn't know

2007
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:26,960
right you know and so he's passing it

2008
01:11:25,279 --> 01:11:28,319
around he's like oh i think i have real

2009
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:29,840
snow

2010
01:11:28,319 --> 01:11:31,840
and i'm going to trade you this but he

2011
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:32,960
doesn't have snow i thought that was

2012
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:34,560
real

2013
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:36,399
i thought that was real snow it was

2014
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:38,880
given to me by my buddy who's had it for

2015
01:11:36,399 --> 01:11:40,719
forever and he swears it's real snow

2016
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:42,960
and then you talk to somebody like me or

2017
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:44,000
caleb or whoever who actually grew snow

2018
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:45,840
back then

2019
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:47,600
or you know someone who or kale who's

2020
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:49,119
held it for a long time and they're like

2021
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:50,640
i'm sorry

2022
01:11:49,119 --> 01:11:51,920
but that's not it

2023
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:53,679
yeah

2024
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:56,158
snow is a bad example i've never seen a

2025
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:57,679
fake cut of snow

2026
01:11:56,158 --> 01:11:59,920
but i i mean yeah it might have been a

2027
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:01,600
bad example but like maybe maybe the

2028
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:03,840
trinity would be a better example or

2029
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:05,840
something that is an excellent example

2030
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:07,520
yeah that might be because people would

2031
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:09,039
get mad at me because they would give me

2032
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:11,280
their trinity and they'd be like oh man

2033
01:12:09,039 --> 01:12:12,719
i gave up the farm for this cut

2034
01:12:11,279 --> 01:12:14,800
right and then i'd smoke it and i'd be

2035
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:15,679
like it's not even a hybrid of it it's

2036
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:17,840
not it

2037
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:18,960
like what do you mean i i like i you

2038
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:21,199
don't know what i did to get it and i'm

2039
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:22,319
like dude i'm sorry it's not it

2040
01:12:21,198 --> 01:12:24,479
you know and

2041
01:12:22,319 --> 01:12:26,399
and so there's there's some cuts where

2042
01:12:24,479 --> 01:12:29,279
it's like i mean one of the things i

2043
01:12:26,399 --> 01:12:31,920
have no idea what sour cut i hold

2044
01:12:29,279 --> 01:12:33,759
um but if i lost it i've collected six

2045
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:35,520
or seven or eight different sour cuts in

2046
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:37,360
the last four or five years

2047
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:38,320
and none of them are the or the cut that

2048
01:12:37,359 --> 01:12:41,119
i have

2049
01:12:38,319 --> 01:12:43,039
yeah which means that like if i lost it

2050
01:12:41,119 --> 01:12:45,840
me trying to find it again would be

2051
01:12:43,039 --> 01:12:47,760
would be would be shitty it'd be hard

2052
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:49,520
right and so that's what happens to a

2053
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:51,280
lot of old cuts and then you get

2054
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:53,120
arguments about whether it's real or

2055
01:12:51,279 --> 01:12:56,000
whether it's not real

2056
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:57,279
um and there's a group of collectors uh

2057
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,600
you know there's three of them on this

2058
01:12:57,279 --> 01:13:00,960
call right now but there's not that many

2059
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:02,800
people that are willing to hold on i

2060
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:05,198
have a joke of give me your old and

2061
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:06,480
unpopular yeah

2062
01:13:05,198 --> 01:13:08,559
right because

2063
01:13:06,479 --> 01:13:11,198
you know having a big mom room is a huge

2064
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:12,960
pain in the ass

2065
01:13:11,198 --> 01:13:14,639
it's a lot of money it's a lot of time

2066
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:16,560
it's a lot of cloning it's a lot of

2067
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,440
trying to keep plants healthy and bug

2068
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:20,159
free

2069
01:13:17,439 --> 01:13:23,599
it's a lot of and then you know

2070
01:13:20,158 --> 01:13:25,519
98 of it isn't commercially viable

2071
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:27,679
you're holding on to it for preservation

2072
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:29,280
you're holding on to it for maybe some

2073
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:31,359
future breeding

2074
01:13:29,279 --> 01:13:33,119
you're holding on to it because most of

2075
01:13:31,359 --> 01:13:34,960
the stuff that i hold i hold it because

2076
01:13:33,119 --> 01:13:36,479
i personally like it

2077
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:38,319
that's the determining factor i don't

2078
01:13:36,479 --> 01:13:39,039
care what the public thinks

2079
01:13:38,319 --> 01:13:40,960
but

2080
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:42,399
most people you know it's they don't

2081
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:44,239
have the time they don't have the space

2082
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:45,519
they don't have the will

2083
01:13:44,238 --> 01:13:46,959
or they just want to hold what's

2084
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:49,040
currently popular because that's what

2085
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:50,880
works for them and they think

2086
01:13:49,039 --> 01:13:52,640
this is this is how everything gets lost

2087
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:55,119
right i can always get it back from my

2088
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:56,560
buddy he's got it

2089
01:13:55,119 --> 01:13:57,359
that's this i wanted to chime in real

2090
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:59,199
quick

2091
01:13:57,359 --> 01:14:02,479
before we get way too far from the

2092
01:13:59,198 --> 01:14:04,559
question of the california kush so

2093
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:06,639
um i was actually given

2094
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:08,800
the scene that's way far from it

2095
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:10,640
yeah we i don't we're way far i

2096
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:12,320
apologize to whoever's question it was

2097
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:15,039
we got real far afield there for a

2098
01:14:12,319 --> 01:14:16,319
minute that's what we do um that's what

2099
01:14:15,039 --> 01:14:18,960
you do when you're a [ __ ] nerd you

2100
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:21,119
nerd out well uh yeah no i was given

2101
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:22,880
seeds by a guy that was on the forums

2102
01:14:21,119 --> 01:14:25,519
named walking man a lot of people that

2103
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:27,760
around back in the day knew him

2104
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:29,120
i i sat on these seats for a long time

2105
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:31,199
and they were labeled hayes brothers

2106
01:14:29,119 --> 01:14:32,960
california kush and the reason i sat on

2107
01:14:31,198 --> 01:14:34,238
them is that i was like what the [ __ ] is

2108
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:35,920
it

2109
01:14:34,238 --> 01:14:38,079
california these brothers they're

2110
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:40,239
[ __ ] hazel you know so i sat on him

2111
01:14:38,079 --> 01:14:42,559
for a long time until i came across

2112
01:14:40,238 --> 01:14:44,000
a high times issue that i have and i was

2113
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:45,360
going through it and i see hayes

2114
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,479
brothers california kush and i'm like

2115
01:14:45,359 --> 01:14:48,158
what the

2116
01:14:46,479 --> 01:14:50,399
you know and by this time walking dance

2117
01:14:48,158 --> 01:14:51,679
uh a walking dude's dead you know so i'm

2118
01:14:50,399 --> 01:14:53,599
trying to figure out you know what are

2119
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:55,679
in these things so i did pop them i did

2120
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:58,000
run them and i would say the closest

2121
01:14:55,679 --> 01:15:00,719
thing they look to is what i would

2122
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,760
associate having grown with hindu kush

2123
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:04,719
before

2124
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:07,679
um they're stretchier they're not like

2125
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:09,679
og the buds the buds are dense they're

2126
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:12,480
smaller more golf ball more spread out

2127
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:14,480
it's stretchier that is where the og

2128
01:15:12,479 --> 01:15:16,718
connection probably ends with the

2129
01:15:14,479 --> 01:15:18,319
california kush that i have grown now

2130
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:20,000
are they the original ones from the haze

2131
01:15:18,319 --> 01:15:22,079
brothers who knows that's what they were

2132
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:26,158
labeled but we did fgn those and let

2133
01:15:22,079 --> 01:15:27,359
them out just in case there you go

2134
01:15:26,158 --> 01:15:29,920
you now you need to grow them so you can

2135
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:29,920
answer the question

2136
01:15:33,198 --> 01:15:36,479
oh my gosh

2137
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:39,359

2138
01:15:36,479 --> 01:15:41,198
funny is uh caleb why when are you gonna

2139
01:15:39,359 --> 01:15:43,589

2140
01:15:41,198 --> 01:15:46,000
wait so long to come on

2141
01:15:43,590 --> 01:15:47,199
[Laughter]

2142
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,079

is that that's a lot of work uh it's a

2148
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:02,960
lot of work to make seeds it's a lot of

2149
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:05,600
work to run rooms and have things come

2150

friends and we chat like this all the

2169
01:16:41,119 --> 01:16:46,079
time about things

um you know and uh one of one of the one

2171
01:16:46,079 --> 01:16:48,800
of the aspects that matt and i are

2172
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,719
trying to do

2173
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:52,000
is that some of the most knowledgeable

2174
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:54,399
people

2175
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,479
are not great at self-promotion

2176
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:58,238
um you know and there's a lot of people

2177
01:16:56,479 --> 01:16:59,839
who are really good at self-promotion

2178
01:16:58,238 --> 01:17:00,639
and not that much great at everything

2179
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:03,360
else

2180
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:05,520
uh caleb's kind of the reverse uh he's

2181
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:07,599
really really good at observation and

2182
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:09,840
breeding and he has a long history of

2183
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:11,840
plants and he's definitely a weed nerd

2184
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:14,480
and has a lot of knowledge in there

2185
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:16,159
um but you know public speaking and

2186
01:17:14,479 --> 01:17:18,000
making the time for this kind of thing

2187
01:17:16,158 --> 01:17:19,839
can be relatively hard

2188
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:21,920
uh you know so

2189
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:23,600
um you know we're super appreciative

2190
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:25,440
that he came on and we're hoping that

2191
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:26,880
we'll be able to occasionally get him to

2192
01:17:25,439 --> 01:17:27,678
pop back in

2193
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:30,239
so

2194
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:33,840
i would say you know be thankful he's

2195
01:17:30,238 --> 01:17:35,279
here and let's hope that he liked it and

2196
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:37,119
we'll get some other subjects that

2197
01:17:35,279 --> 01:17:38,399
interest them enough that he'll pop back

2198
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:48,369
on

2199
01:17:38,399 --> 01:17:48,369
[Music]

2200
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,719

2203
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:01,679
in grabbing caleb seeds i've seen a lot

2204
01:18:00,319 --> 01:18:02,960
of comments about that you can find him

2205

2215
01:18:20,158 --> 01:18:23,519
think we're doing movie night tonight

2216
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:25,840
where we [ __ ] sit and watch movies

2217
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:27,840
together or tv shows just dick around

2218
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:30,000
but we also talk about cannabis stuff

2219
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:32,159
extensively i put a lot of my catalogs

2220
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,560
online and a lot of my uh collection of

2221
01:18:32,158 --> 01:18:37,039
historical stuff so pretty much anybody

2222
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:38,640
can access the part of our patreon and

2223
01:18:37,039 --> 01:18:41,359
i'm putting up nudes of caleb in the

2224
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:42,880
same folder

2225
01:18:41,359 --> 01:18:44,559
and then two things real quick just

2226
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:46,880
because i see questions i see multiple

2227
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:51,039
questions about it um

2228
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:53,679
i gave my uh my headband cut to caleb to

2229
01:18:51,039 --> 01:18:54,399
breed with um he's already released a

2230
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:57,520
few

2231
01:18:54,399 --> 01:18:59,519
lines off of it um it's it's not very

2232
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:02,320
well spread out in the community yet and

2233
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:04,880
so since he's so prolific at breeding uh

2234
01:19:02,319 --> 01:19:07,279
and he has such a customer base um my

2235
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:10,480
main goal was to get it out there so

2236
01:19:07,279 --> 01:19:12,238
he's done some chem d he's done some tk

2237
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:13,599
there's you know there's potential more

2238
01:19:12,238 --> 01:19:15,359
work that he's going to do with it as

2239
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:16,560
long as it ends up being worthwhile and

2240
01:19:15,359 --> 01:19:19,119
he likes it

2241
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:21,520
um and so that's that and then someone

2242
01:19:19,119 --> 01:19:24,158
asked them some questions about mexico

2243
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:26,400
uh you know mexico is super close

2244
01:19:24,158 --> 01:19:28,158
uh unfortunately

2245
01:19:26,399 --> 01:19:30,319
the mexican

2246
01:19:28,158 --> 01:19:32,799
the mexican weed is controlled a lot by

2247
01:19:30,319 --> 01:19:35,920
cartels and there's a lot of violence

2248
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:38,000
associated with it so it's not so much

2249
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:39,760
like the 70s anymore where you can kind

2250
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:42,880
of go down there and like hang out with

2251
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:45,360
regular farmers and maybe get seeds it's

2252
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:47,679
a little bit more sketch than that uh

2253
01:19:45,359 --> 01:19:49,920
the violence has been quite extreme for

2254
01:19:47,679 --> 01:19:51,039
the last 10 years

2255
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:53,279
and so

2256
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:55,359
while mexico does have a large and

2257
01:19:53,279 --> 01:19:57,920
diverse population of cannabis down

2258
01:19:55,359 --> 01:20:00,399
there and we hope that uh some more of

2259
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:02,480
it comes our way it's not as simple as

2260
01:20:00,399 --> 01:20:05,679
it was decades ago to go down there

2261
01:20:02,479 --> 01:20:08,959
despite how close it is and poke around

2262
01:20:05,679 --> 01:20:12,079
and get access to it

2263
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:12,079
anything really worth

2264
01:20:12,158 --> 01:20:19,119
getting in mexico anymore just with the

2265
01:20:14,399 --> 01:20:20,960
influx of uh you know european genetics

2266
01:20:19,119 --> 01:20:21,679
i hardly doubt it man cartel would have

2267
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:23,600
been

2268
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:24,960
trying to increase production at some

2269
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:26,960
point you know what i mean like they're

2270
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:29,439
not they're not stupid that's their main

2271
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:31,039
export other than meth so so that might

2272
01:20:29,439 --> 01:20:33,759
so that might be something just real

2273
01:20:31,039 --> 01:20:35,840
quick that we'll end it on is that uh

2274
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:38,159
sadly one of the you know i i talked

2275
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:40,719
about how it's very difficult for

2276
01:20:38,158 --> 01:20:43,759
us to penetrate afghanistan and pakistan

2277
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:45,600
these days that might be a benefit um

2278
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:48,639
because it's keeping their lines a bit

2279
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:51,360
more pure uh some of the european lines

2280
01:20:48,639 --> 01:20:53,039
have infested jamaica

2281
01:20:51,359 --> 01:20:54,719
infested mexico

2282
01:20:53,039 --> 01:20:56,079
uh morocco and some of these other

2283
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:57,840
regions

2284
01:20:56,079 --> 01:21:00,079
even colombia

2285
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:02,960
maybe colombia especially colombia some

2286
01:21:00,079 --> 01:21:04,559
of these regions have been you know have

2287
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:06,639
you know some of these you know morocco

2288
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:08,320
especially because it's close to europe

2289
01:21:06,639 --> 01:21:10,000
you know they used to have a lot of

2290
01:21:08,319 --> 01:21:11,759
traditional cannabis they have a lot of

2291
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:14,158
dna they have a lot of different

2292
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:16,320
european seed banks got super lemon haze

2293
01:21:14,158 --> 01:21:17,839
now yeah stuff like that that they bring

2294
01:21:16,319 --> 01:21:20,960
down there and breed

2295
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:23,440
um so there's a lot of regions of origin

2296
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:26,079
that have been polluted for better for

2297
01:21:23,439 --> 01:21:28,238
worse uh by these other things and

2298
01:21:26,079 --> 01:21:31,519
you're not gonna go to jamaica and find

2299
01:21:28,238 --> 01:21:33,519
some 25-week lamb's bread anymore you're

2300
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:35,360
not gonna it's not as easy to find stuff

2301
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:38,400
in morocco it's not as easy to find

2302
01:21:35,359 --> 01:21:40,079
stuff in mexico um that's part of the

2303
01:21:38,399 --> 01:21:42,479
issue is that the

2304
01:21:40,079 --> 01:21:45,039
you know global trade has good and bad

2305
01:21:42,479 --> 01:21:47,359
parts and in the 60s and 70s a lot of

2306
01:21:45,039 --> 01:21:49,920
these regions were untouched and they
