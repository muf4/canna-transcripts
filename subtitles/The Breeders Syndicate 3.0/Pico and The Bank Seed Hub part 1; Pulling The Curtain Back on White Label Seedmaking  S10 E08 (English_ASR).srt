thousandfold and today we're going to be

22
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:51,599
talking to Patrick Pico and uh he's been

23
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,959
a good friend of mine since I think we

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,079
first met at Emerald cup 2017 in person

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,160
and ever since we've stayed in contact

26
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:02,000
and yeah he's got a fascinating tale

27
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:04,319
through the uh the seed world and a lot

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,400
of experience uh in the seed world

29
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,478
making seeds at scale and more thousand

30
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,920
you want to kick it

31
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:13,200
off yeah I guess first I wanted to ask

32
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,000
everyone how their week has been

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,520

35
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:21,719
which I'm grateful for because otherwise

36
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,560
I'd be feeling like [ __ ] right now and

37
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:26,560
every day since the first so um we did

38
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,200
absolutely nothing yeah I like the

39
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,759
slower Pace these days it's um it's

40
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,159
really gratifying so it's been a great

41
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:36,159
week do they do they celebrate New Year

42
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:38,399
in Kenya where you're from

43
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,399
thousand yeah it's traditional to just

44
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:44,040
like stay up late and watch cartoons and

45
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:44,040
watch the balls

46
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:50,240
drop yeah it sounded like cha like

47
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:53,000
straight up Vietnam where I'm at like

48
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:54,798
yeah our city is very conservative so

49
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,959
fireworks have always been really big

50
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,920
here and like there's never really been

51
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:01,798
any push back on fireworks despite it

52
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,280
being desert and like lots of brush and

53
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,320
things catching on fire every year but

54
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,640
yeah it was they were they were lighting

55
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,878
off boom booms loud I don't want to say

56
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,359
that word boom booms loud enough to uh

57
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:16,239
Shake Windows like a mile around setting

58
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,000
off all the car it was wild so big old

59
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:22,360
Anatolian Shepherd was on my lap the

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,360
whole time but yeah it's usually never

61
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:26,719
fun what happens we to get old I guess I

62
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:29,479
don't know we did have a whole bunch of

63
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,359
fireworks out here um they allow those

64
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:33,639
there

65
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,560
they do yeah wow that does surprise me a

66
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:38,238
little bit it's a bit of a Wisher

67
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,959
climate I guess it's probably not as

68
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,560
risky as it is for you guys but still

69
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,319
you know do they allow like bottle

70
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,479
rockets and like firecrackers or is it

71
00:02:45,318 --> 00:02:50,799
just like the safe ones it's the safe

72
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:52,518
ones I think relatively yeah yeah it's

73
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,680
weird where we're at in California too

74
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:56,599
because like they import like you just

75
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,159
go over the Border over to Nevada and

76
00:02:56,598 --> 00:03:01,280
people bring back like m80s and like big

77
00:02:59,158 --> 00:03:04,639
old monster things and like there's no

78
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,360
way to really rationalize like that that

79
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:08,518
legality because it especially with

80
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,000
online now anybody can get anything

81
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:13,519
anytime anywhere it's really opened up

82
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,318
that market you know yeah I mean like

83
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,239
you guys were talking about earlier

84
00:03:15,318 --> 00:03:18,679
before we said a recording I mostly feel

85
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:21,080
sorry for all the

86
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:24,480
animals they have to put up with it or

87
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,400
or even even veterans with PTSD or yeah

88
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:27,560
dude yeah you know that that was

89
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,158
something I hadn't really considered

90
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,759
until later in life and it's just like

91
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:32,840
especially after the Iraq War and the

92
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:35,158
Afghanistan war and the guys come back

93
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,360
like that stuff isn't a joke to some of

94
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:38,840
them really affects them so yeah people

95
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,439
need to take more consideration to that

96
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,878
if they really do care about the troops

97
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:45,719
and you know all

98
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:48,759
that okay well I thought maybe we could

99
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:50,959
just ask uh Pico Patrick here a little

100
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:52,399
bit about what he's been doing um

101
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,360
obviously that's the whole point of the

102
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,760
the entire conversation but maybe just a

103
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,840
little brief thing on what he's been up

104
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:00,438
to just recently and maybe touch a

105
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:04,438
little bit on the bank seat hub okay

106
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:07,479
yeah so my most recent um job is in

107
00:04:04,438 --> 00:04:08,959
Arizona I left California last year I

108
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:10,158
got laid it off at the end of the season

109
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,239
which I'm sure we'll get into a little

110
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:15,000
bit just prices plummeting unfortunately

111
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,519
we had a great year but it is what it is

112
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,879
um and through luckily some good

113
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,239
networking um I was able to find a job

114
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:23,399
relatively quickly it was something I

115
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:25,159
had kind of passed on earlier because I

116
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:28,839
didn't want to give up I was running an

117
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,199
outdoor operation um and didn't want to

118
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:32,439
kind of give up in the middle of the

119
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:34,639
season and go take a job somewhere so

120
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:36,160
circled back on that and uh and

121
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,280
currently doing that which is in Arizona

122
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,000
it's a 100,000 foot facility we're doing

123
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:43,079
indoor which is a back to indoor for me

124
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,918
I hadn't been in that in a couple years

125
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:48,478
um so it's fun it's extremely

126
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:50,319
challenging and like any other aspect of

127
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:51,719
working with the plant I just learn new

128
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:54,360
things every single day and that really

129
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,000
drives me to just continue on this

130
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,560
journey and keep going so that's been

131
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,759
the most recent

132
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,519
iteration

133
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:04,439
very nice and yeah you like you you've

134
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:06,000
told me and I've read I read your

135
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:07,519
interview in Skunk mag that you've

136
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,199
obviously been working at scale for

137
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:11,918
quite a while right so that's gonna be

138
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,879
quite cool for us to get into later on

139
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:15,959
yeah I we can we can talk about the bank

140
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:17,319
if you want to that was that was a

141
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:20,959
really cool project it's a good thing to

142
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:22,719
segue into so um initially when I got

143
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,399
the job at the bank I was kind of doing

144
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,680
the same thing I was out there looking

145
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:29,159
for work I had gotten a license in

146
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,000
somoma County had Fallout with a partner

147
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,560
had to sell out of the building that we

148
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,199
owned at the time and the license and U

149
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,000
made a partnership with an extract

150
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,720
company to do that that partnership just

151
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,199
just fell fell apart really really

152
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,919
quickly and ended up leaving that

153
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:45,600
position and then was pretty much

154
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:47,359
freelancing for a little while doing

155
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,039
some sales and some other things in in

156
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,680
the industry um and then was looking for

157
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:54,959
work so an an outfit that I had

158
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,478
interviewed with prior um due to some

159
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:58,599
other some good networking and try to

160
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:00,719
get in with um as far as just a grower

161
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,360
any job working in their Nursery ended

162
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,000
up circling back on me and interviewing

163
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,639
me for what they were looking for at the

164
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,160
time which was just someone who could

165
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:12,759
come in make seeds grow seeds at scale

166
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,520
they were doing 32 Acres the first year

167
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:17,080
I was with them and they wanted to plant

168
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:18,758
all of it from seed so there was a

169
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:20,519
series of dep crops that were getting

170
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:23,680
planted and there was AO also a lot of

171
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:26,318
autof flowers and we're talking like you

172
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,560
know one farm would have 170,000 seeds

173
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:32,439
twice a year so massive massive amounts

174
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:35,160
so the first part of the job was making

175
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:36,800
all the seed um which I was tasked with

176
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,800
and in the interview I I told them you

177
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,240
know I haven't done this at scale I had

178
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,240
only done one reversal prior and they

179
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,400
wanted all them um and so it was like I

180
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,280
I was very honest with them and telling

181
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:51,560
them like I'm I know how to do this but

182
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:53,198
I've never done it at scale and I was

183
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,199
lacking a lot of confidence to say the

184
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,598
least um but they basically were very

185
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,960
supportive and told me look if you will

186
00:06:56,598 --> 00:07:00,560
come in and take this job and try it

187
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:03,079
we'll learn together you know and fair

188
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,439
enough luckily um it all worked out

189
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:07,918
really well the reversals were extremely

190
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:11,478
successful and we made three million

191
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:13,439
seeds in the first year so at the rate

192
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:14,878
at the rate of you know growing a couple

193
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,000
hundred thousand a year and making

194
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,840
millions in the first year I had

195
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,560
essentially somewhat worked myself out

196
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:23,439
of that job because we made so many

197
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,240
seeds can I ask you um just can I just

198
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:26,839
interrupt you and ask what did you what

199
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,319
do you feel like you learned from this

200
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:33,399
one oh my God from that job

201
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,240
yeah I mean the entire reversal process

202
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:38,598
I'm very analytical I keep a lot of

203
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,199
notes I I use a lot of data so you know

204
00:07:38,598 --> 00:07:42,199
for what we were doing with STS

205
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,919
reversals just the proper amount

206
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:46,639
tracking it per strain tracking it per

207
00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:47,959
specific varieties and looking at

208
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,400
lineages to see if there were going to

209
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:50,959
be correlations with other strains I

210
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:52,918
wanted to reverse and how successful or

211
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:54,399
nonsuccessful they would be how many

212
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:56,639
plants per seed you're going to get per

213
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:58,519
square foot you know how big the

214
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,918
receiver should be those timelines of

215
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:02,799
Staggering the donors and the receivers

216
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:04,959
what the ideal timeline is depending on

217
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,720
those genetics and their finishing times

218
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:10,000
and um you know there's also there's a

219
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,400
graph as far as for seed maturation how

220
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,240
long you want the seed to actually

221
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:17,318
continue to mature and there's four I

222
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,280
believe there's four car like four um

223
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:21,439
data sets that they're looking for that

224
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:24,799
all hit their Peak at a different time

225
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:27,598
it's like the germination rate um the

226
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,000
storage rate and there's two others

227
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:32,559
one's Vigor and one's one another one so

228
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,240
ideal timelines to where you hit all of

229
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:37,119
those at their Peak before you start to

230
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,000
basically get diminishing returns or if

231
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,479
you overdo the seeds they'll have the

232
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,038
crack shells um which obviously nobody

233
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,600
wants to buy you can still grow them

234
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:46,480
they germinate just fine but nobody

235
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,920
wants to buy those so isn't that wild

236
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,480
like that they still grow like I

237
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:53,079
remember um what line was the first time

238
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,360
I saw that bod did it with it was one of

239
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,920
the G13 hash plant lines uh chem 91 G13

240
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,240
hash plant was the first time I saw it

241
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:00,519
and like he sent me a bunch and they

242
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,320
were kind of cracked like I think they

243
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:04,120
still grow and they they did which blew

244
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,839
my mind you know considering I thought

245
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,360
air was getting in going to dry it out

246
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,160
but it they did uh crack pretty well but

247
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,079
nobody wants to buy them yeah nobody

248
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:13,480
wants to buy them I mean honestly they

249
00:09:12,078 --> 00:09:15,359
they they crack a little bit easier

250
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:18,278
because you there's yeah the water will

251
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,720
penetrate you know into the yeah embryo

252
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:20,838
right away right and then they don't

253
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,879
have to actually break through the shell

254
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,320
to get up above the surface depending

255
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:25,799
upon what substrate you're using if

256
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,320
you're using like you know little Excel

257
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:29,919
plugs or something or rock those things

258
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,320
can be challenging so it can make it

259
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:33,159
easier but yeah nobody wants to buy

260
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,079
those and they look like [ __ ] so there's

261
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:37,559
certain strains that just that happens

262
00:09:35,078 --> 00:09:39,799
and even when you take it to the number

263
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:41,199
of days that you would want to go to for

264
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:44,559
all of the other things that you're

265
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,160
looking for in a great seed um you know

266
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:48,039
some strange just got to take them a

267
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:49,600
week earlier two weeks earlier so that

268
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:53,360
crack doesn't actually happen it doesn't

269
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,240
open so learning things like that um I

270
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,519
was doing crop registration on all this

271
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:00,720
acreage so with that came a lot of other

272
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:03,000
plant diagn nois that was happening

273
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,879
first time I saw beat curly top virus

274
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,200
and last one thank God that was a tough

275
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:11,559
one you know um be able to identify that

276
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,278
in cannabis I've never seen that before

277
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:16,799
it was it's very wild luckily it runs

278
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:19,360
its course Fair fairly quickly like 30

279
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:22,159
35 days and it's out of the plant and it

280
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,399
goes from wherever the bite sight is up

281
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:26,480
the plant is affected everything below

282
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,159
and on any other branch is good it

283
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,800
doesn't affect it so how many times it

284
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:33,600
got bit by the leaf Hoppers that carry

285
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:35,439
it will affect how terrible the plant is

286
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,240
in yield and everything else but I mean

287
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,560
it'll take a plant that's about to be 10

288
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:42,360
feet tall and you know seven feet around

289
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:44,879
and turn it into a tiny little squat

290
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:48,440
Bush that is like two feet by two feet

291
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:50,240
oh no yield impacts are tremendous and

292
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,399
you have it you have it you can't

293
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,399
there's you know what I mean it's going

294
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:55,240
to run its course but you're not going

295
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:57,759
to get good viable butt off those

296
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,039
branches and it hurt that one hurt so

297
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:01,879
that was a great learning experience

298
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,759
experience um just everything at scale I

299
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:05,679
I ended up running the farm Ops on that

300
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:07,278
you know with that outfit the prior or

301
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:08,519
the next year rather because I'd made

302
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:09,958
all the seed and we didn't really need

303
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:12,360
that as much anymore so now it was just

304
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:13,799
about growing the seed and um running

305
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,159
the farm Ops they liked what I did from

306
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:17,719
a plant diagnosis standpoint I took a

307
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:19,278
lot of videos again shared a lot of

308
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,278
information would give reports back on

309
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:23,919
all the crops and where we were at with

310
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:27,399
the acreage and then would try to map

311
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:29,159
out the Harvest plan which was insane

312
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:31,440
because you know if you're running that

313
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:35,199
many acres it's all ready at the same

314
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,120
time yeah and you so and you need a

315
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,360
place big enough to dry it all like

316
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,078
you're talking about another episode

317
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,480
that people really don't take that to

318
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:44,078
consideration especially when they're

319
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,600
new and like that is a major major

320
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:47,559
consideration where do you dry it all

321
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,720
and if you're making seeds how do you

322
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:51,719
store it dry it and when the seeds start

323
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,839
falling out bit by bit like how do you

324
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,560
catch them identify with what plant yeah

325
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,079
there's so much that goes into that well

326
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:59,559
the seeds were made and kept in a

327
00:11:57,078 --> 00:12:02,000
totally different area like I had a I

328
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:04,039
had a 10 acre Nursery that would be all

329
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,399
seed production Nursery operations

330
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:09,559
cloning seed making everything was just

331
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:11,320
in that in that Nursery so that was like

332
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:13,559
independent and then all of the growing

333
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,199
acreage was elsewhere and it was acoss

334
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:17,278
it was across multiple counties so it

335
00:12:15,198 --> 00:12:18,719
was like I was putting a lot of miles on

336
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:21,320
the car and doing a lot of driving which

337
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,120
was also awesome I mean it was it was

338
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,720
like the ideal job the fact that I had a

339
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,039
job just to make seed was the coolest

340
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,360
thing in the world to me and it was like

341
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:29,919
I'll do whatever it takes to keep this

342
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,720
job you know it's a seed Maker's dream

343
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:33,319
to be able to grow it scale pop a bunch

344
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,440
of stuff that you want to see and get

345
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,639
paid to do it like I've never found that

346
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,120
you know and I've been doing this a long

347
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,879
time and that that that is something

348
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,399
special it's not something for those

349
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:43,000
listening that aren't really that Keen

350
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:44,639
on what goes on in the seed business

351
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,278
it's not a common thing to be offered

352
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,919
that kind of job so it is special

353
00:12:46,278 --> 00:12:51,039
definitely yeah I don't know anyone else

354
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:54,679
had it before or since nope nope so I

355
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:57,078
was super lucky um super lucky to be in

356
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:59,120
that position and right place right time

357
00:12:57,078 --> 00:13:00,679
networking has been so important and

358
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,159
everything that I've been able to do I

359
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:03,799
mean just with you you know like even

360
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:06,039
being in this chat right now is because

361
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:09,278
of good networking and keeping

362
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:13,039
relationships um so with so with that

363
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:14,838
with that job with its unique challenges

364
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:18,240
and with what we basically want I had to

365
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:20,240
put any of my ego and any of my prior

366
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,560
work kind of to the side you know I was

367
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,039
working for someone else I had to

368
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:25,719
fulfill what they wanted um what would

369
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:28,240
sell for them wasn't necessarily the

370
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,680
stuff that I was making and so for those

371
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,480
years that I was with them I was really

372
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:34,239
doing a lot of opw which is other

373
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,639
people's work yeah you know which I was

374
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,839
fine with because again I had the my

375
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:40,360
dream job so who

376
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,320
cares I'll go do CR rge and I'm still

377
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,919
doing the work so it was all good for my

378
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:48,560
perspective so with that the challenge

379
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:50,719
that we had um was genetics sourcing

380
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:52,879
genetics always having good genetics and

381
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,360
always having the next thing the way I

382
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:56,759
was doing it the way I was being asked

383
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,560
to do it was using other people's work

384
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:00,079
from the previous season or the previous

385
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:01,439
C that had come in and mixing and

386
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:03,439
matching and doing all that kind of [ __ ]

387
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,480
and it was always catering to a very

388
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,440
fickle Market that wants something new

389
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:10,399
all the time yep so with that there's no

390
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,920
like actual line breeding or learning

391
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,759
you're not really getting heritability

392
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:15,679
of traits and the things that are really

393
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,278
interesting except for the Autoflower

394
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:18,799
work which was probably one of the

395
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:22,720
greatest learning experiences because of

396
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:24,159
oh yeah yeah definitely so with that I

397
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,839
started the bank seed Hub with the

398
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:29,759
partner who was the owner of the company

399
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:31,880
um which the idea of that was so many

400
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:33,360
great breeders who had amazing Brands

401
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:36,198
already had been left out of

402
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,480
legalization for one reason or another

403
00:14:36,198 --> 00:14:38,958
um you know whether it was they were in

404
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,800
a garage and they were never going to

405
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:43,399
get the zoning correct to be able to

406
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:45,639
have their seeds enter the market this

407
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:48,320
is before the 2018 farm bill so there

408
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:51,159
was still a lot of like very very gray

409
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,800
area as far as how anybody would get

410
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:55,120
seeds anywhere on this scale and two

411
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:56,399
facilities that were being opened up

412
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,159
across the country that were totally

413
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:03,240
legal and you know um compliant so to

414
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:05,000
speak so um with that I started the bank

415
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,240
seed Hub and the idea of that was to

416
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,839
basically be a conduit or a bridge to

417
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,039
all these other amazing breeders who are

418
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:14,120
out there to come to this 10 acre

419
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:15,879
facility make your seeds here or give us

420
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,440
the plans tell us what you want us to do

421
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:20,078
I'll make the seeds for you we will sell

422
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,199
them back to you at a certain price if

423
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:23,198
you like if you want to go hit the

424
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:24,919
market with them we'll grow out a

425
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:27,039
shitload of them as many as you possibly

426
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:28,838
want us to grow out so that we can do

427
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:31,599
the crop registration pheno hunts and

428
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:34,079
keep building for the next season and um

429
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,399
basically just offer the resources that

430
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:38,479
we had to all the amazing breeders who

431
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,318
are already out there so that was the

432
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,639
whole idea with the bank seed Hub um it

433
00:15:41,318 --> 00:15:46,240
worked for what it was designed for but

434
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,720
as you guys know many of these breeders

435
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,879
are very hard to kind of get in with um

436
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,360
they're very guarded if I come with an

437
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:53,439
opportunity like that from someone that

438
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,399
they don't know and haven't done

439
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,639
business with before it's going to be

440
00:15:55,399 --> 00:16:00,600
that very skeptically and which it was

441
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,120
had to develop relationships first with

442
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,800
the people that I knew and had

443
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,078
relationships with that I thought would

444
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:08,719
be a good you know jumping off point and

445
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:10,239
from that I knew that in the short term

446
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,519
it would quickly kind of start to

447
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,039
snowball and grow and I think if we had

448
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:16,720
another year or two we would have seen

449
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:20,639
that really starts to become a round

450
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:22,600
table kind of Coalition of breeders um

451
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,959
what I what I envisioned and I called it

452
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:28,680
was the Sunday mass which was the mutual

453
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:31,958
admiration Society of seed makers and we

454
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:33,519
would all someday we would come together

455
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:35,198
and we would be able to form this group

456
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,519
where everybody is gaining in the same

457
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:38,359
amount you know we take away the

458
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:40,600
competitive element a little bit even

459
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:43,839
the playing field and then we could have

460
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:46,079
a very real brick-and mortar or some

461
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,680
type of actual bank where all the brands

462
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:49,679
represented all the Breeders are there

463
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:50,958
it's all 100% legal and compliant we can

464
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:53,159
do business with anyone we want to do

465
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:54,198
business with and you know that that was

466
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:57,480
the whole

467
00:16:54,198 --> 00:17:00,439
idea I just wanted to say that uh we've

468
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:03,159
heard different uh heard of different

469
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:05,000
people's attempts or initiatives to

470
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:08,359
collectivize in different ways like so

471
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,759
we've heard from Little Hill um Matt

472
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:11,558
obviously with the breed of syndic and

473
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:12,959
now you with this and it's interesting

474
00:17:11,558 --> 00:17:15,918
like each of you has a slightly

475
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:19,038
different take on collectivization but

476
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:21,679
it's super cool to see and hear

477
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:24,400
about not common again it's not common

478
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,919
for um breeders to even get along to

479
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,000
accomplish a goal like that so it is

480
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:31,120
something that takes years and years and

481
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,279
years to build with with trust and and

482
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:34,798
yeah you well on your way everybody's

483
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:37,279
got a little like bone to pick with

484
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:41,119
everybody else it seems so yeah and

485
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:43,038
that's myself included yeah right I mean

486
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:45,000
some others with you as well and back

487
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:46,599
and forth and you know it it is what it

488
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,839
is but things change quite a bit when

489
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:50,359
you all are in the same room together

490
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:52,678
when you're all physically talking and

491
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:55,479
have the same mind or the same thing to

492
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:57,000
gain um a lot of that ego gets Stripped

493
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,400
Away and Things become what they should

494
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,960
be about which was about the plant about

495
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,880
about sharing about the community you

496
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,120
know and just about weed that's that's

497
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,360
what it should be about so the last the

498
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:08,918
last thing that we did with the bank

499
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:10,199
seed Hub um in the last year things were

500
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:12,038
pulled back quite a bit we did a lot

501
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,880
more from colone and we're running less

502
00:18:12,038 --> 00:18:17,679
and less of the seed and so I did an

503
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,600
acre hunt and I got like five or six

504
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,038
friends that all had fem seeds to throw

505
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:24,480
in with me and we did an acre that was

506
00:18:22,038 --> 00:18:26,279
just going to be all of us together it

507
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,640
didn't really work out the way I wanted

508
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:29,119
with being able to produce some content

509
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,720
get ready on everybody has different

510
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:32,319
schedules people had moved it was harder

511
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,400
for them to get back to California to

512
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,639
kind of see the work um so I was

513
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,960
documenting it all and trying to share

514
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,759
it as much as possible but that was like

515
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,798
the beginning of the fruition of all the

516
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:43,720
goals to have even half a dozen breeders

517
00:18:41,798 --> 00:18:45,319
that would throw their work in together

518
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,679
and then if I could have gotten them all

519
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:49,439
together to that site you know then

520
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:51,559
we're viewing each other's work and like

521
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,080
making selections together and and

522
00:18:51,558 --> 00:18:54,879
picking out the little nuances what we

523
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:57,199
liked about this Cross or that cross or

524
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,679
you know whatever that was that was

525
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,679
really what I envisioned and we we

526
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:03,480
almost got there at the end um but like

527
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,280
I said California ended up you know

528
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,960
prices of outdoor went down to like sub

529
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:09,678
500 and it was a total [ __ ] show and

530
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,079
when you got to pay excise tax and you

531
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,280
got to pay all these other insane bills

532
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:17,000
I mean the county of Sonoma was like

533
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:19,158
just trying to really Bend us over and

534
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,119
just hit us for these ridiculous fines

535
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:24,080
all the time and just crazy [ __ ]

536
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:25,839
constantly crazy [ __ ] from them so um I

537
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:28,720
unfortunately was let go from that

538
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:31,519
position and had to you know do the new

539
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,919
thing so it was great while it lasted

540
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:36,359
and the idea is still there the dream is

541
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:39,320
still there I hope that I can continue

542
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:41,719
to kind of see that mission through and

543
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:43,158
um exciting that where I'm at in Arizona

544
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,240
they're giving me pretty much cart

545
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:48,240
blanch to do any genetics I want um

546
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,000
we're doing massive seed hunts there so

547
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,640
I just filled the room with

548
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,119
2500 um plants all from seed there's six

549
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,200
different varieties so we got a couple

550
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:57,879
hundred of each one going um that's

551
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:01,200
going to be the first like big pheno

552
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:02,960
hunt project on that site and then I am

553
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,159
doing a reversal in the greenhouse right

554
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:08,759
now which should net quite a few seeds

555
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:11,240
so really exciting projects and then I

556
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:13,480
hope to kind of be able to bring other

557
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:16,159
folks back into that fold and continue

558
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:18,038
the same idea and offer that space like

559
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,400
now I have indoor space which is one of

560
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:20,798
the biggest complaints about the bank

561
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,600
seub was we were doing all outdoor

562
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:24,599
nobody wanted to take pictures and

563
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:26,000
content of their outdoor flower because

564
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:28,279
for whatever reason they think it's bad

565
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,679
or they can't sell seeds with it but um

566
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:32,798
now I have the basically the same idea

567
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:36,240
that I think I can replicate bring it

568
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:38,240
inside and hopefully make a you know a

569
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,880
mutual admiration and a mutually

570
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,038
beneficial group of people that would

571
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,440
want to take place and take part in that

572
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:46,279
and for the company I'm working for it's

573
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,400
all good for them too because they're

574
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:49,720
getting access to all these genetics and

575
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,640
all these different things for their

576
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,640
sales that you know they wouldn't

577
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,679
otherwise have or they'd have to pay for

578
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,720
or whatever

579
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,519
absolutely yeah you let us know if we

580
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,480
can help in any way you know obviously

581
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,279
we have a platform of sorts and have a

582
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,720
certain kind of reach so you you should

583
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:06,839
just hit us up if you can think of

584
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,839
anything that we can help with yeah I

585
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:12,079
definitely like to deliver completed

586
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:14,240
ideas so um it's it's in the works let

587
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:15,839
me continue to work on the mission right

588
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,159
now and make sure that you want it now

589
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:20,678
bro yeah yeah I have to make sure that I

590
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:23,080
can execute and be successful um for

591
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:25,159
everyone else you know before I can

592
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:26,759
before I can really just open up the

593
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:28,919
floodgates but that is the long-term

594
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:30,319
goal so you know if anybody's interested

595
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:33,840
in having those conversations I

596
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:37,038
certainly am very nice I'm sure you're

597
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:38,599
working you know your previous uh gig uh

598
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:41,640
working on that scale probably force you

599
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:44,399
to systematize a lot right oh yeah I

600
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:47,799
always have though I'm operations are a

601
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:52,360
big um just part of my flow with

602
00:21:47,798 --> 00:21:56,158
anything with the plan so I very yes

603
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:58,639
yeah okay well I thought we could kind

604
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:01,320
of go backwards in time a bit

605
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,080
and maybe you could talk to us about

606
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:06,759
what the early period for you was like

607
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:08,240
uh making seeds and growing um you know

608
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:09,919
what Drew you to those things how did

609
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,440
you get into it to begin with and how

610
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:17,240
did you learn about those things well so

611
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:19,720
I'm from Ohio originally and in Ohio the

612
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:22,200
first grow kind of group that I was a

613
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:24,880
part of um they were growing all from

614
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:28,319
seed so there was no clones none of that

615
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,480
was even happening and it was all um DJ

616
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:32,000
Short

617
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:35,200
sensey just a bunch of old school stuff

618
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,200
White Widow blueberry super silver Hayes

619
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,200
um and and with that with that early

620
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,319
sort of introduction like seeds were

621
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,240
were the first thing for me you know so

622
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:47,319
when I ended up returning back to them

623
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,599
around like 2010 or so it was like a it

624
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:49,839
was like a homecoming it was like oh

625
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:51,359
this is the way we were always supposed

626
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:53,720
to do it you know we like kind of lost

627
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:56,479
sight for a while so those early days

628
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:58,720
back in Ohio all from seed everything

629
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,960
was selected inhouse and it was just

630
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,919
because it was a very closed group and

631
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,440
didn't want anybody to know what the

632
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:07,640
hell we were doing didn't have friends

633
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,519
that had clones and probably would have

634
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,080
you know what I mean like was parked the

635
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:12,839
car like two miles away and carrying

636
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:14,038
grow equipment down the street yeah

637
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:15,599
seemed like a better idea than parking

638
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:17,519
your car after green Merchant right so I

639
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:19,119
was like I'll carry this [ __ ] light

640
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:20,679
and these ballots and everything else

641
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:22,599
and try to make it in one trip which was

642
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:23,960
ridiculous um just to not have my

643
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:25,519
license playing in front of that store

644
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,278
so that was kind of the absolutely you

645
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:30,158
know that was kind of the Viewpoint and

646
00:23:27,278 --> 00:23:32,159
um it was very it was very stigmatized

647
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,559
in Ohio in my area even from my close

648
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,400
friends who now are totally cool that it

649
00:23:33,558 --> 00:23:37,839
was it was still like I was kind of off

650
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:41,919
to the side and on my own a little bit

651
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:43,319
um so anyways from there um I ended up

652
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,000
one of the guys who was part of that

653
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:48,359
group who was really just more of a he

654
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,720
was more of a scammer kind of he was

655
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:52,959
more like just in it for the money part

656
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,440
he didn't kind of guy yeah he didn't

657
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,519
even really smoke weed I mean he you

658
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,679
know he did eventually but he's he's

659
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,599
like the reason that people shouldn't

660
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:02,840
smoke weed in my opinion he just got too

661
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:04,319
like out of pocket and was doing stupid

662
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:06,759
[ __ ] and acting a fool you couldn't have

663
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:07,960
him around anybody so but but that was

664
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:09,200
his whole thing was just sort of like

665
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,720
I'm just trying to make money you know

666
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,159
which was fine too because it gave me a

667
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,798
job so um I ended up moving out to the

668
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:17,720
Bay Area to do some trim work for him

669
00:24:15,798 --> 00:24:20,400
and just help out because it was

670
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:24,880
exploding and at the time the OG pounds

671
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:26,240
were 58 57 down in La so it was like

672
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,600
[ __ ] yeah I was getting paid a shitload

673
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,159
just to come and trim just because he

674
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,959
didn't want to have to hire some randos

675
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:33,679
to come trim and needed reliable people

676
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,679
so relocated from Ohio out to California

677
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:39,519
to do that and everything was from clone

678
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:42,600
so from there it's we're growing OG snow

679
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:44,759
cap blue dream blackberry kush um

680
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:47,240
Nightshade you know some other random

681
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:49,919
stuff and eventually that whittel down

682
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:52,000
to like you know maybe 10% anything but

683
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,200
OG you know and everything is OG all

684
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,679
from clone and that was the flow for a

685
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,600
long time you know and everything was

686
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:01,840
going to La and what year was this this

687
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:05,079
or this was um I moved out to California

688
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:08,000
2007 so right around there 2007 through

689
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:11,960
200 12 or so we that's pretty much what

690
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:15,679
we were doing and then what became

691
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:18,360
pretty apparent like you know right away

692
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:20,360
was if we it was always like oh we need

693
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:22,240
the next OG cut you know now we need

694
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:23,959
Skywalker now we need King Loui now we

695
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,038
need this now we need that and it was

696
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:28,240
like well we can just get this from like

697
00:25:26,038 --> 00:25:30,640
we can just go backwards

698
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,120
buy the Seed make selections and have

699
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,200
something totally unique that nobody

700
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:35,519
else has yep and that's and that's where

701
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,278
I was starting to look in other lines

702
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:39,119
because OG was really boring at that

703
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:40,960
point because it was like that's all we

704
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:42,119
[ __ ] grew that's all splitting hairs

705
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,720
between the cuts and a lot of people

706
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:45,038
don't realize like some of them they

707
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:48,120
could be the same cut with just two

708
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:50,119
different names so get real boring 90%

709
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:52,278
90% of them were the same cuts and it

710
00:25:50,119 --> 00:25:53,479
was just little conditional differences

711
00:25:52,278 --> 00:25:56,240
from environment that would really

712
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:58,079
change you know the appearance or what

713
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,480
was expressing in the plant was more so

714
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:00,720
based on the environmental changes based

715
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,839
on these people's Grow rooms and how

716
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,399
they built them um which is kind of an

717
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:05,798
interesting thing like your signature is

718
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:07,959
kind of in your growroom it's kind of an

719
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:09,158
interesting concept yeah but but yeah it

720
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,278
was it was just really boring so I was

721
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:13,760
like [ __ ] I need these flavors like I

722
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:16,839
was in love with the banana flavor I had

723
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:18,558
banana OG I wanted to find that in a

724
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:22,199
seed form I wanted I couldn't get a cut

725
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:23,599
anywhere so I went to seeds and I think

726
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,440
some of the first seeds that I bought

727
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:28,038
when I was in California were off of

728
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,759
seedbay um you know started with some of

729
00:26:28,038 --> 00:26:31,240
that Dutch growing stuff like the o99

730
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:32,640
that we talk about and that's the that's

731
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,079
the pre-roll that I gave you that was

732
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,360
that

733
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:38,879
super um so I still talk about that I

734
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:40,839
still talk about it when people ask

735
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,399
about banana stuff like and I did a lot

736
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:44,879
of banana work myself so I I I've got a

737
00:26:43,398 --> 00:26:47,119
pretty good working knowledge of that

738
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,960
line and how it breeds but that was

739
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:50,599
exceptional and like when people ask me

740
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,759
about banana flavors I'm like well there

741
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:54,798
was one very specific one that was the

742
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:56,919
most extreme banana bread turps that it

743
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:58,558
was just unmistakable like anybody who

744
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:02,080
smelled that would smell that and that

745
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:04,119
was like a seven weer it was like so and

746
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:06,119
the and the oer 99 was made probably

747
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:08,119
years prior and probably not kept in

748
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:10,319
great condition so yeah by the time I

749
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:12,119
even got those seeds it was like they

750
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:13,720
were probably I don't know five years

751
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:16,519
old six years old I don't know when she

752
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:19,558
made them but they were old and two only

753
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:24,398
two germinated so the one was a female

754
00:27:19,558 --> 00:27:27,119
one was a male 2011 that one female was

755
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:29,319
what I called the banana 999 cut that

756
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:32,359
was just the most phenomenal banana

757
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:34,359
seven weaker yielded [ __ ] beautiful

758
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:37,079
plant perfect doesn't have love the odds

759
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:38,959
on that yeah I know I know not only that

760
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:40,480
but then I use the mail because I'm like

761
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,798
well [ __ ] there might be some banana in

762
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,679
this guy too so I use the mail in my

763
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:46,879
earliest breeding work just to try to

764
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:48,640
continue that and um and he put out

765
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,760
amazing work I mean that's still the

766
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,600
backbone of what I grow today and what I

767
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:55,798
breed today and those lines is still

768
00:27:52,599 --> 00:27:58,519
rooted in that o99 cut and the maale

769
00:27:55,798 --> 00:28:01,558
from that pack those are still like the

770
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:04,599
bases and then I had some uh what was

771
00:28:01,558 --> 00:28:06,480
the other um Sweet Tooth number three

772
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:08,678
from I think Deluxe had done a remake or

773
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,159
something I got that because I was just

774
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:11,640
[ __ ] head over heels for the

775
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:14,399
Tangerine Haze that came from the

776
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,919
devil's Harvest crew oh yeah that oh my

777
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:18,239
God that plant was so amazing it was

778
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:21,840
like no nobody the flavor was just

779
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:26,200
unbelievable with the Tangerine nycd G13

780
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:29,319
Haze yep exactly yep and it was like the

781
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:32,840
flavor was so [ __ ] good and the high was

782
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:34,439
extremely up extremely Zippy and up and

783
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:37,240
everybody who smoked it who was looking

784
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:39,159
for like a downer couch locky weed hated

785
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,720
it because it didn't do that but I had a

786
00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:42,720
very specific experience where I was

787
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,960
down in La vending I would always go to

788
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,720
Malibu to first point to go surfing I

789
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,360
had smoked some OG with my buddy he had

790
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,159
come down there with me and we were just

791
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:51,479
like [ __ ] floored you know after a

792
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,278
day of surfing in the ocean you're just

793
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,038
like already kind of drained and then we

794
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:57,440
smoked this OG and it was like I was

795
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:58,359
like oh my God I'm so [ __ ] lethargic

796
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,360
and then I remember smoking the

797
00:28:58,359 --> 00:29:03,798
Tangerine Haze after that and being like

798
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:05,959
whoop right back to like just you know

799
00:29:03,798 --> 00:29:07,440
cognitive Lucid everything was [ __ ]

800
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:10,519
good again and I was like this is the

801
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,600
[ __ ] like this is more powerful than

802
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:15,159
that OG it's just a completely different

803
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:17,519
effect that you're not feeling from like

804
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:19,200
a sober to high state but it's like if I

805
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:20,440
was already high and too low man that

806
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,399
thing brought me right back I'm like

807
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,000
this is [ __ ] amazing so that was that

808
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:26,079
was a magical one but I used the Sweet

809
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,240
Tooth to try to like preserve that

810
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:29,480
flavor as much as possible

811
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,399
so those were the two earliest breeding

812
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:34,159
projects I did really was using the

813
00:29:31,398 --> 00:29:35,719
banana o99 male and I made f2s but I did

814
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,720
all sorts of other work with him and

815
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,798
then trying to preserve the Tangerine

816
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,600
Haze as much as possible by using the

817
00:29:39,798 --> 00:29:43,398
Sweet Tooth F2 the Sweet Tooth number

818
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:45,599
three F2 which I don't know how many

819
00:29:43,398 --> 00:29:47,038
times that's incrossed but um that was

820
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:50,240
pretty much the earliest stuff and the

821
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:53,480
results were fantastic so be it be it

822
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,640
luck be it whatever like we got [ __ ]

823
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:58,240
great plans from every single thing that

824
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:01,038
got touched by the pollen and nobody was

825
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,679
really complaining at that time until I

826
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:05,038
accidentally seated an entire room and

827
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:06,600
then and then I then I got a little push

828
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:08,480
back on that's when they stopped liking

829
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:10,639
seeds as much as when you see the entire

830
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,200
room that's exactly when they stopped

831
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,240
liking seeds so much at that point they

832
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,000
got referred to as art projects and I

833
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,679
was no

834
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,480
longer which is honestly what ended up

835
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:22,440
being the impetus for me leaving that

836
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,240
outfit and starting my own thing was

837
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:26,159
based 100% on that I was like well this

838
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,278
is the ticket like we got to keep doing

839
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,919
this and there like no we got to do none

840
00:30:28,278 --> 00:30:32,359
of that just go back to Growing blue

841
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,640
dream and I was like all right this I

842
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:36,278
have a different Vision I have a

843
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:38,320
different Vision than what I think do so

844
00:30:36,278 --> 00:30:41,000
um that's when I kind of broke off on my

845
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:43,319
own and left you know the safe haven of

846
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,359
a very tight-knit friends group that I

847
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:46,879
had and had moved across the country for

848
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:48,519
and everybody that was working with us

849
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,360
at the time was from Ohio for the most

850
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:54,880
part um so that was sort of the impetus

851
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:58,719
for leaving that group was the souring

852
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:01,320
of popping seeds um for them you know

853
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:04,639
not for me collateral damage man we just

854
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:06,038
ended up with more seeds yeah I mean

855
00:31:04,638 --> 00:31:09,719
should even complain that's that's a

856
00:31:06,038 --> 00:31:12,558
plus right right um I wanted to take a

857
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:14,399
little tangent here uh and want to throw

858
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:16,960
this bone to mat as well which is the

859
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:19,518
fors you mentioned I think in one of in

860
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,519
in that interview in Skunk mag um that

861
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:25,759
the forums play quite a big part in your

862
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:27,759
early stages definitely and and a great

863
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:29,919
great point to to mention or place to

864
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:32,960
mention that so that was really I was on

865
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:35,038
IC mag um the guy that I had initially

866
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,798
learned from whose nickname is cool

867
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:39,079
white by the way which I [ __ ] love

868
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:40,879
because he he burned down a house by not

869
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:42,839
uh putting an anchor in a light and

870
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,760
putting it up in drywall and burn oh my

871
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:46,359
God so when he went to jail all the all

872
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:48,038
the guys in jail called him cool white

873
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:50,439
because of the

874
00:31:48,038 --> 00:31:53,158
lights I like that so anyway he'll

875
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,798
probably love that shout out cool white

876
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:56,240
super ego maniacal guy so he'll

877
00:31:54,798 --> 00:32:01,158
definitely enjoy that but oh yeah here's

878
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:03,720
his name for sure yeah yeah but um so he

879
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:05,000
was on overgrow he was big on overgrow

880
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,240
I'm sure he was an [ __ ] because he

881
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,519
was an [ __ ] in real life so I can

882
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,200
only imagine how bad he was on overgrow

883
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:13,000
but but I was on IC mag mostly because

884
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,480
of the seed Bay linkage and that's just

885
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,839
where I was buying seeds so I was super

886
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,839
paranoid still you know the same

887
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:22,398
mentality had followed me through and

888
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:24,918
was a lurker I would like put my [ __ ]

889
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:26,719
laptop on private mode and maybe go

890
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:29,360
somewhere else that wasn't my regular IP

891
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,639
address go even surf it and look around

892
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:33,678
mag but but yeah watching um some of the

893
00:32:31,638 --> 00:32:36,599
threads on ICM especially the Jack

894
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,798
mayhoffer stuff um which which is I

895
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:40,480
think is Ivan right and and it was like

896
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:43,240
the early cocoa beds that they were

897
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,798
doing I just real quick you're referring

898
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:47,919
to Jungle boys Ian for the people who

899
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:50,398
don't know right yeah Jack mayher Jack

900
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:53,240
mayhoffer so Jack mayhoffer threads were

901
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:55,239
epic as far as just like scale growing

902
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,240
and and what they were doing now I'm

903
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:59,079
sure or what they were doing then they

904
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:01,200
don't do it all now but my my idea and

905
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:04,720
sort of what I was following was fully

906
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:08,000
soil organic growing living soil and so

907
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,839
his idea of these giant beds um in your

908
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,200
room was just like right in tune with

909
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:13,798
what I was trying to do so I used the

910
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,038
tech that he was kind of providing on

911
00:33:13,798 --> 00:33:18,398
icmag and all the other information

912
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:19,839
about nutrition and living soil and all

913
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:22,000
the other stuff that was available on

914
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:24,480
there and really just just ran with it

915
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,558
but it gave me a lot of confidence to

916
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:30,639
kind of know what to try and learn from

917
00:33:26,558 --> 00:33:32,599
other people failures especially um and

918
00:33:30,638 --> 00:33:35,119
uh and that was that was quintessential

919
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:36,439
and then so much strain knowledge and

920
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:39,199
and now I I really I haven't gone on

921
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:41,360
there in so long but um just so much

922
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,440
information and the thing was that all

923
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:44,678
the bullshitters got called out that was

924
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,159
the great thing we don't have that

925
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:50,559
anymore like Instagram is such a step

926
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:53,000
backwards from the the sharing of

927
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:54,359
information because agreed and I don't

928
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,119
think Twitter does it either I'm not on

929
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:57,759
Twitter but I would imagine that doesn't

930
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:59,398
do it either but the power is in the

931
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:01,638
words the words are the knowledge the

932
00:33:59,398 --> 00:34:02,879
pictures support the words but the words

933
00:34:01,638 --> 00:34:04,678
are where it's at on Instagram it's

934
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,799
totally different it's just the facade

935
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:08,240
here's what it looks like the words are

936
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:11,039
almost meaningless you throw a couple

937
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:12,759
emojis up there and then you know C

938
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:15,119
conversations that are also meaningless

939
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:17,119
which is usually just a circle jerk yeah

940
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,879
so Instagram for me is kind of just such

941
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,000
a huge step back it's a necessary

942
00:34:18,878 --> 00:34:22,239
platform I think because it's the only

943
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,760
one that we really have but sure it's

944
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:25,719
just such a step backwards as far as

945
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,919
like sharing information and sharing

946
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:29,118
reality because none of it is steeped in

947
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:31,158
reality

948
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:33,039
whatsoever I think I think that's a

949
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:34,200
common sentiment too among people who've

950
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:36,559
been around and made it through the

951
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:38,158
Forum era and stuff being able to have

952
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:40,759
that in that kind of community and then

953
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,200
going to Instagram it it's just totally

954
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,159
it's a night and day difference and it's

955
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:45,598
actually pretty

956
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:47,159
depressing yeah it is I mean I I just

957
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:50,599
appreciate it it was policed a lot

958
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:52,599
better yeah you know and um I don't know

959
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:54,240
it was just it was just it was generally

960
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:56,559
really solid information you can kind of

961
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:58,358
tell what wasn't and what was but

962
00:34:56,559 --> 00:35:00,000
generally really solid and if you needed

963
00:34:58,358 --> 00:35:02,199
verification of a cut or something you

964
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,440
could get it pretty easily and or people

965
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:05,118
would just call you out and tell you how

966
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,960
fake your [ __ ] is which also can be

967
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:10,519
valuable just to know yeah right so

968
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:12,320
there IC mag was really really awesome I

969
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:14,880
really enjoyed it and the first kind of

970
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,960
the first few people that I met up with

971
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:20,000
and um you know became like in in real

972
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,920
life friends with were from IC mag to um

973
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,960
and that was cool because that sort of

974
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,440
opened up more of the networking gateway

975
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:28,559
to like sharing information getting

976
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:31,119
stuff you know sharing weed sharing

977
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:32,960
concentrates sharing Tech um sharing

978
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,720
opportunities you know that all of those

979
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,559
things really came along with IC mag so

980
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:38,719
I'm super grateful for that forum and

981
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:42,639
all the forums that preceded it as

982
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:45,879
well yeah are you gonna jump on to canak

983
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:48,319
Cabana now that it's all opened up I

984
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,880
will yes unfortunately time is so

985
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,000
restrictive for me right now between the

986
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:54,039
job and the kids that it's just I just

987
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,159
don't have the time yeah I mean I don't

988
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:56,519
have the time to do I don't even have

989
00:35:55,159 --> 00:35:59,879
time to smoke as much as I'd like

990
00:35:56,519 --> 00:36:01,280
honestly hly or a place to do it um I'm

991
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,480
in my kids' room right now I was telling

992
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,400
thousandfold before it's like the only

993
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,440
place I can get away that's like quiet

994
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,280
and not in the garage looking depressing

995
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,838
yeah so I just don't have the time for

996
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,960
it right now I wish I did but I'm so I

997
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:16,039
mean I'm in my own Forum world so to

998
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:18,079
speak in the in what we're doing because

999
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:20,000
the 100,000 square foot is Perpetual

1000
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:23,400
I've got nine different Grow rooms that

1001
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:27,440
are all going at the same time um and

1002
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:31,160
all a week apart so I can see very much

1003
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:33,200
the entire like week one through nine of

1004
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:34,838
what's happening in a room at all times

1005
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:36,960
which is really cool to just track

1006
00:36:34,838 --> 00:36:39,159
progress and and kind of make minute

1007
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,639
changes and see the results of those

1008
00:36:39,159 --> 00:36:44,000
types of things um so I just get so much

1009
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:45,679
value out of that that I don't really go

1010
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,679
to the forums quite as much anymore it

1011
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:50,358
was really a little bit of a crutch a

1012
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:52,838
lot of information and and now it's

1013
00:36:50,358 --> 00:36:54,960
because it's there's so little activity

1014
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:56,358
there um it just wouldn't be as valuable

1015
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,318
for the things I would probably use it

1016
00:36:56,358 --> 00:37:00,279
for today which would be more like

1017
00:36:58,318 --> 00:37:02,199
verification of cuts and you know

1018
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,760
Providence and things like that and we

1019
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:06,000
have our Discord too where we can all

1020
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,200
jam on that which is really nice I mean

1021
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,639
that's been that's been a great thing

1022
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:10,838
honestly the discord's been awesome and

1023
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:12,799
I've and that's been the main type of

1024
00:37:10,838 --> 00:37:15,559
forum thing that I've interacted with in

1025
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,519
the last six years I think I've been on

1026
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:20,159
that thing now with yeah yeah it's been

1027
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:22,400
a long time bro it's been a long ride I

1028
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:23,879
remember messaging messaging Denali the

1029
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,960
night I was in the hospital first kid

1030
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:30,640
and he just turned five so that's wild

1031
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:35,679
wow yeah wait so did you two cross over

1032
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:41,400
on forms or no no we met an emerald cup

1033
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:42,358
2017 yeah so I remember exactly how we

1034
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,079
started

1035
00:37:42,358 --> 00:37:46,880
talking you had said something on a post

1036

1037
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:53,838

1042
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:06,838

00:38:14,318 --> 00:38:18,000
anymore D they're the best man music and

1048
00:38:16,358 --> 00:38:19,159
weed those are the unifiers those are

1049
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,639
the things for me that have always like

1050
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:23,960
brought people and made friends has been

1051
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:25,480
like if there's two ice breakers for me

1052
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,760
it's music and weed and those have

1053
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,760
always been true even to this day yeah

1054
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,119
for

1055
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:33,599
sure sure I still use that quote I think

1056
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:35,160
it's in my profile still to this day I

1057
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:36,760
figured you were cool when I saw that

1058
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:37,759
man I was WR it creeps people out though

1059
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,319
like because they don't get that it's a

1060
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,680
quote from Stone Rose's song it just

1061
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:46,519
sounds like I'm a evil Satanist even

1062
00:38:42,679 --> 00:38:46,519
though I can I can hang with

1063
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,519
it anything else on the

1064
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:54,000
forums uh no I enjoy I wish I would have

1065
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:55,358
done more honestly I was more of a

1066
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,079
lurker I wish I would have interacted

1067
00:38:55,358 --> 00:38:59,799
more with people and

1068
00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:02,920
um I wish they were still as used as

1069
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:04,560
they are today yeah yeah I mean going

1070
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:06,760
back to what you guys are talking about

1071
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:09,119
between say the forums and Instagram or

1072
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:12,040
Twitter the architecture you know

1073
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:14,920
obviously lends itself to different

1074
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:16,838
things so on Instagram and Twitter it's

1075
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:18,119
very hard to sustain a conversation for

1076
00:39:16,838 --> 00:39:20,039
more than a few days right because it

1077
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:23,160
just disappears into the timeline the

1078
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:24,800
abyss of noise and you're so limited on

1079
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:26,239
what you can say it's not like you could

1080
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,200
really express yourself very well kind

1081
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:30,519
of like Twitter you know you're limited

1082
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,960
to a certain amount of character sets

1083
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:33,880
and people don't want to read long

1084
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,440
sentences so you'll find that most

1085
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,358
people just respond to the first few

1086
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,880
things you say or the image and not read

1087
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:41,400
what you wrote so there's a lot of

1088
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,318
miscommunication that goes on yeah and

1089
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:46,680
it feels like also people are encouraged

1090
00:39:43,318 --> 00:39:48,838
to like spit out zingers like you know

1091
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:51,118
witty on liners and stuff rather than

1092
00:39:48,838 --> 00:39:53,920
actually a thoughtful you know

1093
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:56,000
articulation of anything yeah it's just

1094
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,200
about like your reflexive knee-jerk

1095
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,039
reaction

1096
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:01,480
of the time I defin I agree with you I

1097
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:02,800
definitely enjoyed the linear nature of

1098
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:05,159
the forums because I would wake up in

1099
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,359
the morning go back to wherever I left

1100
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:10,480
off catch up on all the you know the

1101
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:12,598
chitchat whatever was going on and um

1102
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:15,000
just follow along with the conversations

1103
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:17,039
so I I enjoyed once it got it got

1104
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,039
ridiculous to a point I remember the

1105
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:22,719
slow nickel Lounge had like 800 Pages or

1106
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:25,119
something and it was like holy [ __ ] I

1107
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:26,838
went to bed and we were at like 528 I

1108
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:28,800
wake up we're at like 600 and something

1109
00:40:26,838 --> 00:40:30,838
I'm like holy [ __ ] I can't even catch up

1110
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,960
so I guess there's a downside to it too

1111
00:40:30,838 --> 00:40:35,279
when it gets that much

1112
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,358
use but yeah I missed the forms man I

1113
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,440
really like that that was a good that

1114
00:40:36,358 --> 00:40:39,960
was a good time San Diego's finest got

1115
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:42,119
so big they had to blow it up into like

1116
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:43,838
a second and third I think now might

1117
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:45,039
just still be on second but yeah that

1118
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:47,159
was one of my

1119
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:48,000
favorites yeah when threads become their

1120
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:51,799
own

1121
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:54,079
forums yeah right and they lock it at a

1122
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:57,359
point

1123
00:40:54,079 --> 00:41:00,839
yep well I thought we could could kind

1124
00:40:57,358 --> 00:41:02,000
of segue to Pico's I mean obviously Pico

1125
00:41:00,838 --> 00:41:04,078

1126
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,880
that you have done yourself uh you

1127
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:09,800

1128
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:14,200

hazes yeah so um so from that initial

1131
00:41:17,719 --> 00:41:21,279
project with the ojra 99 I cross out to

1132
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:24,880
blackberry kush which was a staple for

1133
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:26,839
us at the time and um from those found

1134
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:29,318
some really cool plants I called it

1135
00:41:26,838 --> 00:41:31,960
Gargamel um it was an interesting plant

1136
00:41:29,318 --> 00:41:33,759
nothing like too crazy but it had a very

1137
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:36,318
very good look got great color had good

1138
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,000
flavor it was kind of like pretzel dough

1139
00:41:36,318 --> 00:41:40,599
with like a hint of licorice on the back

1140
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,679
end which I really really liked and then

1141
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:44,880
um I ended up getting a cut from a buddy

1142
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:46,480
that was supposed to be Gorilla Glue 4 I

1143
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,559
checked it on the forums you know I hit

1144
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,960
up uh that that group and I think Marlo

1145
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:52,078
was the dude's name who called me out

1146
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,240
and told me that's [ __ ] that's not

1147
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:56,000
Gorilla Glue 4 and I was like well

1148
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:57,559
whatever it is it's [ __ ] awesome and

1149
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,039
it might be better than gorilla go 4

1150
00:41:57,559 --> 00:42:01,960
because like I never even experienced

1151
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:03,838
anything like this that one we ended up

1152
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:06,679
taking it to Market before I knew it was

1153
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:08,559
not Gill GL for we took it to Market and

1154
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:10,679
you know taking it to like Oakland and

1155
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:13,799
they were like n this this ain't it and

1156
00:42:10,679 --> 00:42:16,639
and their best guess at what it was was

1157
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:18,440
um Grease Monkey which was gly glue 4

1158
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:20,400
and something else I forget what the

1159
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:22,119
cross was on it yeah I think it was a

1160
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,599
exotic D yeah that that one I remember

1161
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:26,440
that one it was exotic yeah yeah it was

1162
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:27,960
exotic genetics and and regrettably we

1163
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,880
ended up taking that name and calling it

1164
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:32,318
gree monkey 2.0 we didn't we couldn't

1165
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,240
confirm it was or wasn't sure the guy

1166
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:35,358
who uh but but if that was what they

1167
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:37,039
wanted to call it and that was one it

1168
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:38,679
was you know we could sell to the club

1169
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:39,800
because it was super dank then I was

1170
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:41,279
fine with it you know so we end up

1171
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:45,519
calling that grease monkey 2.0 for a

1172
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:47,960
minute um I ended up making some s1s of

1173
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:49,280
that which may have been an S1 already

1174
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:51,159
because it was the fake gorilla glutes I

1175
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,559
don't know what the hell it was um but

1176
00:42:51,159 --> 00:42:55,318
the S1 of that that I popped I popped

1177
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:57,200
one seed every time I'd make something I

1178
00:42:55,318 --> 00:42:58,599
just throw one or two you know in in

1179
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:01,118
just to kind of see and get a look under

1180
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:03,880
the hood and this plant popped and it

1181
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:06,119
was like the the first set of true

1182
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:08,680
leaves after Calen was like covered in

1183
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:09,880
tricomes like covered in the the cesal

1184
00:43:08,679 --> 00:43:12,598
type you know the type without the

1185
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:14,800
glandular stock and and it was

1186
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:16,280
glistening and it was like amazing and I

1187
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,480
could smell it right out of there it was

1188
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:20,440
like fresh pine and coriander it was

1189
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,400
unbelievable the plant continued to grow

1190
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:24,240
up in veg and it just kept having these

1191
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,599
tricomes on every single leaf like the

1192
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:28,039
fan Leaf is covered in trikes

1193
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:30,079
I'd never seen that before it was so

1194
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:33,239
fragrant I knew it was going to be like

1195
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:35,000
[ __ ] amazing it was just meant to be

1196
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:38,838
um so that's what ended up becoming boss

1197
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,639
Frost for us boss Frost boss Frost like

1198
00:43:38,838 --> 00:43:43,558
ruled the day for us for a minute we

1199
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:45,078
went to the 2016 High Times cup and that

1200
00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:48,359
was the only thing I've ever entered

1201
00:43:45,079 --> 00:43:51,160
into a cup it hit 6.6 on the turps and

1202
00:43:48,358 --> 00:43:53,679
33 on the total can it blew everything

1203
00:43:51,159 --> 00:43:56,358
else out of the water the the NorCal cup

1204
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:58,318
was um the lab was Steep Hill that did

1205
00:43:56,358 --> 00:44:00,598
the NorCal cup and they were they were

1206
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:02,838
very very rigid um and so they had to

1207
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:04,440
test it multiple times even to to to

1208
00:44:02,838 --> 00:44:06,159
confirm that that's what it had tested

1209
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:09,440
at but that's what they ended up finally

1210
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:11,358
releasing for the test results um so

1211
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:13,280
that thing that I entered didn't Place

1212
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:14,679
didn't do [ __ ] I was very disappointed I

1213
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,040
thought for sure because of just the

1214
00:44:14,679 --> 00:44:18,239
test results and everything else that it

1215
00:44:16,039 --> 00:44:22,039
was going to kill it didn't really

1216
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:24,479
matter um but that crossed into the

1217
00:44:22,039 --> 00:44:28,079
Gargamel ended up being nightcap and

1218
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:30,000
again I just did a small seed run um you

1219
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:32,240
know like one plant couple hundred seeds

1220
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,318
nothing big threw two of them into pots

1221
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:36,799
just to see what was up right away and

1222
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:38,558
one of those two became nightcap I never

1223
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:40,480
even went back to the seeds again night

1224
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:42,319
cap was better than boss Frost somehow

1225
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:45,559
it was like Daner more

1226
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:48,558
earthy heavier you know it boss Frost

1227
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:51,319
was like very um ground coriander really

1228
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:54,640
bright like really bright flavors and

1229
00:44:51,318 --> 00:44:57,358
the night cap was just way way Daner and

1230
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:59,879
um that one we ended up hitting 8.1%

1231
00:44:57,358 --> 00:45:01,598
turs on super high in Alpha pining but

1232
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:04,519
does have a backbone and mirene too it's

1233
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:07,318
like kind of one to or two to one alpha

1234
00:45:04,519 --> 00:45:09,838
Piney deine in that and um was the TP

1235
00:45:07,318 --> 00:45:12,679
Cham for SC labs for a couple years till

1236
00:45:09,838 --> 00:45:15,078
I think um those guys up at the ridge

1237
00:45:12,679 --> 00:45:16,919
ridge Farm Ridge something they um they

1238
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:19,440
ended up usurping me with a couple like

1239
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:20,599
ten of a point you know on that and at

1240
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,400
the time we were putting out in the

1241
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:24,480
living soil we were putting out amazing

1242
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,440
stuff our own genetics I guess my own

1243
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,838
genetics although I had some help

1244
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:31,440
um and everything was killing it in the

1245
00:45:28,838 --> 00:45:33,119
turps from SE Labs like boss Frost I

1246
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,200
never saw it Go below four and a half

1247
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,280
and that was on like the shittiest

1248
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:39,118
shittiest grow and nightcap was always

1249
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:42,200
just killing it too so the cool thing

1250
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:43,400
about nightcap is that um the turpine

1251
00:45:42,199 --> 00:45:45,399
profile this is where I started really

1252
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:48,480
getting into tpine profiles like around

1253
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:49,760
2014 2015 when I started my own outfit

1254
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,920
was doing this living soil and

1255
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:54,960
everything else I opted into lab testing

1256
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:57,039
immediately because I wanted the data

1257
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,318
right so I had to pick the best Labs I

1258
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:01,800
would use Ste pillar SC and I just

1259
00:45:59,318 --> 00:46:03,358
wanted to keep one you know I keep it as

1260
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,880
simple as possible so that I would get

1261
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:07,639
as true a data set as possible um

1262
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:09,358
through all the different things we were

1263
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:11,318
doing in the grow trying out different

1264
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:13,519
things and running different strains and

1265
00:46:11,318 --> 00:46:16,119
whatever so at the time I mean the boss

1266
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:17,599
Frost and The nightcap were super high

1267
00:46:16,119 --> 00:46:18,880
in Alpha pining and were the highest

1268
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,800
things they would ever see it would take

1269
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:23,358
me weeks to get my tur test back because

1270
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:25,280
they kept having to retest it to confirm

1271
00:46:23,358 --> 00:46:27,719
that these numbers were accurate enough

1272
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:30,359
for them to put out and at the time SE

1273
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:32,239
Labs was was um making public all their

1274
00:46:30,358 --> 00:46:33,719
test results if you didn't ask for it to

1275
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:36,318
be private they would make it public and

1276
00:46:33,719 --> 00:46:38,439
you could go and you could scrape all

1277
00:46:36,318 --> 00:46:42,039
the data off of their website and you

1278
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:44,039
could pull tens of thousands of tests so

1279
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:47,079
after that and I had a pretty decent

1280
00:46:44,039 --> 00:46:49,558
relationship um as like a client to Alec

1281
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:51,079
Dixon one of the founders of SE labs and

1282
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:52,559
he would shout us out all the time and

1283
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:54,039
we had a lot of conversations because my

1284
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:55,079
test would take so long to get back I

1285
00:46:54,039 --> 00:46:56,358
would always be calling them like what

1286
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:57,640
the hell's going on

1287
00:46:56,358 --> 00:46:59,639
and we would have a lot of conversations

1288
00:46:57,639 --> 00:47:00,879
and he was just like you know really

1289
00:46:59,639 --> 00:47:02,159
impressed with the amount of turps we

1290
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,119
were getting off all the strains that we

1291
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:06,759
were growing especially these unique

1292
00:47:04,119 --> 00:47:09,240
lines and um and what he shared with me

1293
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:11,440
and we could see from the data was that

1294
00:47:09,239 --> 00:47:14,279
all of the Cannabis that was tested was

1295
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:16,200
falling into these like seven categories

1296
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:18,599
you know now that's what the emerald cup

1297
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:21,118
is using as their groupings for um to

1298
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:22,720
get away from this sativa Indica uh

1299
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:24,800
designation and they're using these you

1300
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:26,838
know I forget what the words are dessert

1301
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:29,920
something whatever the words are kind of

1302
00:47:26,838 --> 00:47:32,880
tacky but the IDE exotic dessert dreams

1303
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:34,440
sweets and Dreams yeah right so the I

1304
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,240
mean they're trying to simplify it and

1305
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:38,599
that's a corporate move I'm sure but oh

1306
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:42,598
yeah regardless of that the idea that we

1307
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:44,240
now had we take this vast super plastic

1308
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:46,880
genome plant that can do so many

1309
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:48,799
different things and we make it finite

1310
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,519
right and we have seven categories now

1311
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,800
that like almost all the weed fits into

1312
00:47:50,519 --> 00:47:55,440
these seven categories that became super

1313
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:58,079
interesting and my idea was that if I

1314
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,240
play Within These categories then I will

1315
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:02,318
be able to breed homogeneous strains

1316
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:04,159
much much quicker because I'm going to

1317
00:48:02,318 --> 00:48:05,759
be replicating this chemotype over and

1318
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:07,078
over and over again and so at least the

1319
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,760
expression of the chemotype is going to

1320
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:12,640
be the same now there was a lot of

1321
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:15,400
misinformation about the um like

1322
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:17,719
integral part of tpin on flavors you

1323
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:20,559
know which I kind of could tell right

1324
00:48:17,719 --> 00:48:22,358
away because of that banana 99 cut I was

1325
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:23,880
searching like okay what's the tpine

1326
00:48:22,358 --> 00:48:25,799
that's giving us this banana flavor

1327
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:28,440
right and it's not a tpine at all it's

1328
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:30,760
not it's it's am Amal

1329
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:32,039
acetate it's an ester you know same

1330
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,640
thing you see in alcohol production when

1331
00:48:32,039 --> 00:48:35,000
you

1332
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:37,039
drink and you get that banana that's a

1333
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,559
molese and I had a background in brewing

1334
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:42,000
beer as well um just for fun but that's

1335
00:48:39,559 --> 00:48:43,519
how I knew about that Esther and so

1336
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,920
other light bulbs starting to go off but

1337
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:46,719
the idea was the same that I follow

1338
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:49,720
Within These tpine categories and do my

1339
00:48:46,719 --> 00:48:51,639
breeding work within those to add or

1340
00:48:49,719 --> 00:48:53,480
take away certain traits that I wanted

1341
00:48:51,639 --> 00:48:55,679
and keeping other ones intact mainly the

1342
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:56,798
flavor and what I knew for the TP

1343
00:48:55,679 --> 00:49:00,399
profiles is that they would have a

1344
00:48:56,798 --> 00:49:01,798
similar effect for me anyway um so I

1345
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,400
would what was interesting about the

1346
00:49:01,798 --> 00:49:07,119
night cap is that it's the same flavor

1347
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:09,240
as all the non trinoline hazes or the

1348
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:11,559
piff yeah piff was something I was

1349
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:13,679
searching after you know as much as I

1350
00:49:11,559 --> 00:49:15,798
possibly could at that time and again

1351
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:17,440
this is like 2015 nobody was circulating

1352
00:49:15,798 --> 00:49:19,000
Cuts you couldn't nobody had the CU

1353
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:21,358
black it was like a total Legend you

1354
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,639
know lost to the times or whatever you

1355
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:24,719
couldn't find the [ __ ] there was some

1356
00:49:22,639 --> 00:49:27,000
work here or there um but I ended up

1357
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:28,639
going to JJ I got a bunch of his stuff

1358
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,920
at one of the emerald cups or one of the

1359
00:49:28,639 --> 00:49:32,199
high time shows and started running

1360
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,798
through all his stuff that was supposed

1361
00:49:32,199 --> 00:49:36,039
to be you know as close to that as

1362
00:49:33,798 --> 00:49:37,838
possible he got a mango cut that was

1363
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:41,119
super insensi from somebody else on an

1364
00:49:37,838 --> 00:49:43,039
IC Forum I forget the dude's name and

1365
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:45,280
made a bunch of stuff I ended up finding

1366
00:49:43,039 --> 00:49:47,358
some really nice very insensi non-

1367
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:49,839
terpinolene Haze expressions from his

1368
00:49:47,358 --> 00:49:51,519
stuff used that bred it down a couple

1369
00:49:49,838 --> 00:49:53,838
generations to get what I wanted out of

1370
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:55,880
it and then I paired that to the night

1371
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:59,039
cap because it had the same tur in

1372
00:49:55,880 --> 00:50:01,519
profile I was able to basically take the

1373
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:03,920
flowering time and reduce it

1374
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:06,039
tremendously increase the bag appeal and

1375
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,519
the actual like density of the Bud from

1376
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:11,159
what the haze that I was growing at the

1377
00:50:07,519 --> 00:50:13,159
time was and um and increase the

1378
00:50:11,159 --> 00:50:16,000
increase the um Tarpin and the

1379
00:50:13,159 --> 00:50:19,000
cannaboids by like a shitload so it was

1380
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:21,239
basically allowing me to have sort of a

1381
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,559
secret weapon in night cap to breed

1382
00:50:21,239 --> 00:50:25,118
hazes and shorten their flowering time

1383
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:26,960
and do everything but it did affect the

1384
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:28,680
high you know the effect was affected

1385
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:32,039
the flavor profile stay the same but the

1386
00:50:28,679 --> 00:50:34,879
effect was a was affected so um nightcap

1387
00:50:32,039 --> 00:50:37,119
was super influential in with my work

1388
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:39,559
and from that line breeding with JJs

1389
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:41,119
into the night cap I made night piff

1390
00:50:39,559 --> 00:50:44,400
which is like a true eight-week

1391
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:46,000
flowering you know Haze type the effect

1392
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,519
is a little stronger but it's still very

1393
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,960
heady it's very up um and it's incense

1394
00:50:48,519 --> 00:50:51,519
as hell when it when it burns in the

1395
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:54,159
room and it it just hit all the trades

1396
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:56,000
that I wanted right away um so that was

1397
00:50:54,159 --> 00:50:57,480
kind of some of the idea of

1398
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,039
well one that was the night cap and like

1399
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:00,679
what the night cap has become now I've

1400
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:02,880
worked that down several Generations

1401
00:51:00,679 --> 00:51:05,558
since then I have a night cap Exotica

1402
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:07,000
line where I added an exotic in um at

1403
00:51:05,559 --> 00:51:09,519
the time that I made it I didn't want to

1404
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,798
sort of piggyback off of the success of

1405
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:12,920
cookies and what they had done but now

1406
00:51:11,798 --> 00:51:13,838
with the cats out of the bag because

1407
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:16,519
other people had already leaked the

1408
00:51:13,838 --> 00:51:18,318
lineage so it is nightcap Gary Payton

1409
00:51:16,519 --> 00:51:20,798
and then from there I bred that into

1410
00:51:18,318 --> 00:51:22,279
another exotic which I will not actually

1411
00:51:20,798 --> 00:51:24,239
well that one was a purple Cass which

1412
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:26,680
nobody can get anyway because that was

1413
00:51:24,239 --> 00:51:28,318
cadero strain um that I was gifted by

1414
00:51:26,679 --> 00:51:31,318
like a family that wouldn't let anybody

1415
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:33,159
else have it so that's the IAP Exotica

1416
00:51:31,318 --> 00:51:36,920
season two I continue to do to do that

1417
00:51:33,159 --> 00:51:37,960
line it's really high pining um it's ex

1418
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,358
the pining the other thing that's

1419
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:42,679
interesting about the pining is that the

1420
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:46,440
effect for me for high pining strains is

1421
00:51:42,679 --> 00:51:48,039
very um it's very lucid I don't get I

1422
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,760
don't get the inner monologue I don't

1423
00:51:48,039 --> 00:51:52,480
get the backseat driver where like I'm

1424
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:54,440
behind myself kind of observing and like

1425
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,519
commenting on myself or what I'm doing

1426
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:59,440
or whatever you know that's why I call

1427
00:51:56,519 --> 00:52:01,440
the dumb mouth the dumb mouth yeah well

1428
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,760
I don't get the dumb mouth from it and

1429
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:05,400
and it's also extremely potent and um

1430
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,319
the reason I call night cab night cab is

1431
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:09,920
because that turpine profile for me with

1432
00:52:07,318 --> 00:52:12,199
the potency with the high THC allows me

1433
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:14,798
to drift off to sleep without any inner

1434
00:52:12,199 --> 00:52:16,279
monologue or like my voice inside going

1435
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:17,759
which is one of the things that gives me

1436
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:20,280
paranoia and stops me from falling

1437
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,680
asleep so for me it was super easy on

1438
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:24,319
the night cap to fall asleep because

1439
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:28,039
that turpine profile it allows a very

1440
00:52:24,318 --> 00:52:29,119
smooth transition from so sober to high

1441
00:52:28,039 --> 00:52:31,480
or you know whatever you want to call

1442
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:33,119
that yeah it's like it's not as

1443
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:35,318
noticeable that you do get the head

1444
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:37,960
effect you get the rush but it's not

1445
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:40,239
like holy [ __ ] I overdid it I'm too high

1446
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:43,280
you know it's it's like I I can maintain

1447
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:45,199
the same train of thought um and so at

1448
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,440
the time this was 2016 I think that that

1449
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:48,399
one popped and we were doing a lot of

1450
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:49,880
work still with medical patients and

1451
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,880
they were giving me the best feedback

1452
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:53,079
that they were able to sleep through the

1453
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:55,480
night didn't have to get up and go to

1454
00:52:53,079 --> 00:52:57,480
the bathroom getting restful sleep which

1455
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:59,760
if you're ailing from anything like

1456
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:01,440
getting restful sleep is like one of the

1457
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,720
two best things you can possibly do

1458
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,760
regardless of anything else that you're

1459
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:07,480
taking or doing so um talking to cancer

1460
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:09,839
patients and talking to people with true

1461
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:12,440
medical need who were impacted by that

1462
00:53:09,838 --> 00:53:15,599
plant was uh and still is like a

1463
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:17,240
highlight for me super amazing so map's

1464
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:18,920
been on its journey I continue to use

1465
00:53:17,239 --> 00:53:21,118
her today I continue to breed her today

1466
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:23,920
and she's a magnificent plant again it

1467
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:27,119
was two seeds so recently on my own

1468
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:28,798
Discord I auctioned off the the half of

1469
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:31,440
the remainder of those seeds that were

1470
00:53:28,798 --> 00:53:34,599
left and um some lucky gentleman picked

1471
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:36,679
them up that's cool yeah that's really

1472
00:53:34,599 --> 00:53:38,920
cool I kept half I need that but you

1473
00:53:36,679 --> 00:53:40,519
know I just with her in the stable it's

1474
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:42,680
like there's almost no need to go back

1475
00:53:40,519 --> 00:53:44,199
in and the and there was quite a bit of

1476
00:53:42,679 --> 00:53:46,199
variance even in the two that I popped

1477
00:53:44,199 --> 00:53:47,639
it was like one was super Squat and the

1478
00:53:46,199 --> 00:53:49,639
one that I kept was really tall and

1479
00:53:47,639 --> 00:53:53,199
lanky and had more of what I was looking

1480
00:53:49,639 --> 00:53:56,039
for um so yeah I'm happy to let some of

1481
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:57,519
those things go and I have so many sees

1482
00:53:56,039 --> 00:53:59,239
now it's like what's the you know if I'm

1483
00:53:57,519 --> 00:54:01,000
not going to get around to it let's let

1484
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:02,159
somebody else grow it out that's about

1485
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,920
where I've gotten with a lot of my

1486
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:06,480
collection too after a while you just

1487
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:10,200
start to realize like man these things

1488
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:11,960
do have a time limit and and I want to

1489
00:54:10,199 --> 00:54:13,159
see them grown out it's it's you know

1490
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:15,280
what I mean like it's either you get

1491
00:54:13,159 --> 00:54:16,920
greedy about it and let him die with you

1492
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:19,400
or you get them out there and be able to

1493
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:20,358
get data points at least very least yeah

1494
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:22,240
I mean it shouldn't really be a

1495
00:54:20,358 --> 00:54:25,639
collection honestly it's a perishable

1496
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:26,679
good it's like right right wa always bug

1497
00:54:25,639 --> 00:54:28,239
the [ __ ] out of me when I see people

1498
00:54:26,679 --> 00:54:30,838
with these M like flexing with their

1499
00:54:28,239 --> 00:54:32,798
massive collection it's like grow them

1500
00:54:30,838 --> 00:54:34,880
what are you doing yeah you know what I

1501
00:54:32,798 --> 00:54:36,400
also learned too on the forums the

1502
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,079
people who had post their massive

1503
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:40,798
collections were always the first to get

1504
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:43,559
shook down and like scammed and it was

1505
00:54:40,798 --> 00:54:46,480
just setting yourself up so bad so bad

1506
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:48,920
to do stuff like that yeah it's very

1507
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:50,440
fomo driven yeah which I'm guilty of it

1508
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:52,440
too I mean I did the same thing like I

1509
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:54,519
had yeah early on I think L that's what

1510
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:56,760
we saw was cool you know like the cooler

1511
00:54:54,519 --> 00:54:58,239
guys were showing off their killer you

1512
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:59,799
know whatever they had their big seed

1513
00:54:58,239 --> 00:55:02,078
collection so of course we'd follow suit

1514
00:54:59,798 --> 00:55:03,798
as younger guys you know yeah well

1515
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:05,240
endorphin the Endorphin experience is

1516
00:55:03,798 --> 00:55:07,039
like in the purchase and then receiving

1517
00:55:05,239 --> 00:55:08,519
the package absolutely and then after

1518
00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:11,239
that it's over so it's like I got to do

1519
00:55:08,519 --> 00:55:12,280
it again I need more seeds yeah yeah I

1520
00:55:11,239 --> 00:55:15,118
have these now I don't need these

1521
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:16,798
anymore and the flex I honestly the

1522
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:18,559
psychology of it is really interesting

1523
00:55:16,798 --> 00:55:20,358
to me because seeds themselves are

1524
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:22,798
obviously not plants and they're not

1525
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:25,798
flower they're not end products they're

1526
00:55:22,798 --> 00:55:27,599
kind of promises of of something else

1527
00:55:25,798 --> 00:55:29,679
and then when you even even the purchase

1528
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:31,200
of a seed is like a promise of a promise

1529
00:55:29,679 --> 00:55:32,919
and it's like these little gambles that

1530
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:35,919
you're kind of getting high on really

1531
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:37,519
yep yeah that's great when we do these

1532
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:39,639
massive hunts now and and I'm talking to

1533
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:41,159
like the crew that's working under me

1534
00:55:39,639 --> 00:55:43,078
that's I I never have used the term

1535
00:55:41,159 --> 00:55:46,000
promise but I'm going to now but I

1536
00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:48,079
always say if if you let one of these

1537
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,280
seeds not if you let it dampen off or

1538
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:50,839
you don't you know what I mean it's

1539
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:52,559
you're not like growing the seed

1540
00:55:50,838 --> 00:55:55,000
properly or doing Justice if you lose

1541
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:57,440
seeds in a germination run it's like

1542
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:00,000
might have just lost Michael Jordan yep

1543
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:02,240
none of his brothers did [ __ ] you know

1544
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,838
what I'm say you can't lose Michael

1545
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:06,358
Jordan man you got to see all those to

1546
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:08,880
their true potential to know and that's

1547
00:56:06,358 --> 00:56:11,038
the fomo for me now is like if I lose a

1548
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:12,358
plant or a plant is I'm like it's not

1549
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:14,400
doing as well as it should I'm not going

1550
00:56:12,358 --> 00:56:15,880
to see its true potential that's like

1551
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,720
where the fomo hits for me now and I'm

1552
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:21,680
just like ah I need they have to be

1553
00:56:18,719 --> 00:56:25,759
perfect yeah for sure you could be

1554
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:27,879
missing that blue that beautiful blue

1555
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:30,200
it's funny because I found I found

1556
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:32,358
really great things in really small runs

1557
00:56:30,199 --> 00:56:35,199
I found really really amazing things in

1558
00:56:32,358 --> 00:56:36,759
massive runs and you know the potential

1559
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:38,679
is there and that's that's the thing I

1560
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:40,960
don't want to lose is the potential I

1561
00:56:38,679 --> 00:56:43,318
was just trolling my buddy here who is

1562
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:45,318
popping some blue ex

1563
00:56:43,318 --> 00:56:48,960
seeds and didn't get them all I was

1564
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:48,960
gonna mention it I was gonna mention

1565
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:53,439

1596
00:57:51,798 --> 00:57:55,798
people in Central Europe we have gir by

1597
00:57:53,838 --> 00:57:58,159
seeds for our people in the southern

1598
00:57:55,798 --> 00:58:00,038
hemisphere of Australia and New Zealand

1599

they're awesome people um they're doing

1603
00:58:06,159 --> 00:58:09,960
a great job of carrying extremely good

1604
00:58:07,798 --> 00:58:12,318
breeders not every seed bank cares about

1605
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:15,199
that even if they say they do I don't

1606

this topic to keep it going um there's

1612
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:33,000

credit than I think a lot of people have

1615
00:58:34,239 --> 00:58:37,358
been giving him in the comments because

1616
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:40,838
without him the show would have been

1617
00:58:37,358 --> 00:58:42,480
dead after the whole uh explosion you

1618
00:58:40,838 --> 00:58:44,480

1619
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:47,838
about it uh I don't want to go into too

1620
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:49,838
much detail but um we talked about it in

1621
00:58:47,838 --> 00:58:52,239
the patreon crowd with everyone as it

1622
00:58:49,838 --> 00:58:56,119
was going down you know there's a reason

1623
00:58:52,239 --> 00:58:57,558
that co-hosts change um it was necessary

1624
00:58:56,119 --> 00:59:01,039
you know we hold each other to high

1625
00:58:57,559 --> 00:59:03,200
standards we absolutely do and sometimes

1626
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:06,280
life gets hard people slip up things

1627
00:59:03,199 --> 00:59:08,838
change morals change uh moral fluidity

1628
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:14,000
as we talk about it none of this [ __ ] is

1629
00:59:08,838 --> 00:59:15,558
easy choices and um just know that like

1630

1631
00:59:15,559 --> 00:59:18,400
each other to really high standards and

1632
00:59:16,838 --> 00:59:21,480
