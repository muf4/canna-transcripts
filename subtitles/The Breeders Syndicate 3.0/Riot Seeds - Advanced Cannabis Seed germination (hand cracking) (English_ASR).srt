1
00:00:00,829 --> 00:00:05,419
now this is one of the hardest parts of

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:09,000
seat cracking and you have an old seed

3
00:00:05,419 --> 00:00:14,070
that is really expensive and really rare

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,440
and you want to give it the best shot at

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:21,420
life I don't recommend this unless

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:23,939
you're really good at hand control and

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,740
you've had a lot of practice as you can

8
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:26,660
see the seed is sitting here between the

9
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:31,108
scissors

10
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:33,090
normally this would not be ideal but if

11
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:36,239
you know what you're doing you can just

12
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:38,969
slightly crack the shell without

13
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:43,828
damaging the embryo the idea here is to

14
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:46,530
get water into the seed shell that's how

15
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:48,808
seedling embryos form when you put them

16
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,609
in to germinate is when the water enters

17
00:00:48,808 --> 00:00:53,058
the shell it begins the process however

18
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:55,530
some seed shells are just too thick for

19
00:00:53,058 --> 00:00:57,628
water to get in and a lot of people

20
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,649
think this is like a dud seed that's not

21
00:00:57,628 --> 00:01:00,750
necessarily the case it may just have a

22
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:02,969
thick shell in the case of that this is

23
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,890
what you need to do so you just gently

24
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:08,460
take it you hold it with your hand you

25
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:10,680
put it at the very top top top part as

26
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:12,000
far as it'll sit in there of the seed

27
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,229
because that's where you have the best

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,239
control over the scissors and gently

29
00:01:15,228 --> 00:01:20,429
you'll hear that sound

30
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:23,039
and that means the seed has been cracked

31
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,450
now there's nothing coming out of the

32
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,890
seed I don't know if I can get this

33
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,719
thing to [ __ ] assume in a little bit

34
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,950
whatever there's nothing nothing coming

35
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:30,780
out of the seed you don't see any juice

36
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,719
or any [ __ ] coming out of seed or

37
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,820
anything just the lightest crap of the

38
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:39,118
shell that's what you're trying to get

39
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:41,908
to here and from there you just put it

40
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,769
back into your wet paper towel treated

41
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:48,868
with three drops of hydrogen peroxide

42
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:53,489
for every 2000 ml of water put that

43
00:01:48,868 --> 00:01:57,149
[ __ ] right there oh my god there we go

44
00:01:53,489 --> 00:02:03,118
right there right there and she's ready

45
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:05,099
to go label her up and put her back

46
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:06,840
in this case this really isn't an

47
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:09,840
expensive seat but it is a seed with

48
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,598
hard shell it was a can of copious BC

49
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,610
roadkill I want to see how how wrote

50
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:19,589
killing this each chunk cross is going

51
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:22,739
to be a lot of resin which is awesome

52
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:24,330
but let's see if the roadkill is the

53
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:25,530
true really kill skunk or not yeah

54
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,849
there's so many claims to that I've

55
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,680
never seen one in my life

56
00:02:26,848 --> 00:02:30,719
well not since I first started smoking

57
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:34,519
anyways during my breeding life never

58
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:38,719
seen one and there we are that's how you

59
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:38,719
do this part of the seat tutorial
