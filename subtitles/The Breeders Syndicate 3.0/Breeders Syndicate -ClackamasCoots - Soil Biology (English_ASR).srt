00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:33,758
anyway what else we got in here

171
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,199
yeah please do stella drop it to me here

172
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,199
on right cedco i never checked the other

173
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,560
ones um

174
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,160
there was a blue baby [ __ ] version one

175
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:45,120
which was the uh it was a stella blue bx

176
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,919
um and then we have the uh

177
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,000
uh blue baby [ __ ] version two and that

178
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:53,839
one it's not it has no stella blue in it

179
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,839
but it is based on that type of thing

180
00:07:54,478 --> 00:08:00,399
genetic drift is a myth yeah i uh um

181
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:02,799
i think acclimation is real

182
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,000
um as far as something drifting

183
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,000
genetically there's such thing as

184
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,160
epigenetics that affects stuff but

185
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,120
nothing is ever gonna drift genetically

186
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,000
ever

187
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,918
ever you can't it just doesn't happen

188
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,720
genetics don't drift like that

189
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:16,318
um

190
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,240
acclimation's a real thing which is why

191
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,720

it was really good too

349
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,519
what form of silicon can be added to

350
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:31,759
soil without jacking up ph and does it

351
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,759
need it

352
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:36,078
i don't know about amending with silica

353
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:38,399
but i like the ortho solicit um doesn't

354
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:42,239
jack the ph too much what about the rks

355
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:44,159
from blue sky guy oh lord look dude

be just a little bit

359
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:56,240
suspicious of that dude when

360

about [ __ ] like i actually put up uh

367
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:15,519
screenshots of what um old timer one

368
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:18,240
said about his skunk line the skunk one

369
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:21,759
line and that's what this [ __ ] keeps

370
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,360
saying is his rks and

371
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:26,399
you know i mean ultima one himself said

372
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,959
that it was not skunky so yeah ever

373
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:32,240
since then he's been

374
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:32,239
riding my dick pretty hard

375
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:39,078
yeah roots let's see it

376
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,839
clackamas break down add still 16 versus

377
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:47,360
some

378
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:50,560
height like aptus or power si

379
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,519
yeah axil versus xl16 versus like power

380
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:52,799
si

381
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,039
um

382
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:56,639
man i want to say i use the axil i

383
00:15:55,039 --> 00:16:00,000
didn't have any results like i did with

384
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,000
power si to be honest

385
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,440
tropic trees why would you tell you

386
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,039
can't when you tagging super ky for we

387
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,800
already we already done been over that

388
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:13,039
little [ __ ]

389
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:14,559
this guy

390
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:16,639
oh and i don't know if he ever says he

391
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:18,719
was pop but just in case

392
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,879
no you ain't never [ __ ] been been

393
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,560
popped so just in case he tries to ever

394
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:24,399
pull that one we already know the answer

395
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:26,239
to that did you hear the ggg interview

396
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,720
[ __ ] no i don't give a [ __ ] what ggg

397
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,079
says [ __ ] flat earther anti-vaxxer

398
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,560
[ __ ]

399
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:32,559
idiots

400
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:38,399
your neighbor's children oh no i've hope

401
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:40,239
you don't have like an idiot like we do

402
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,360
it was a pre-sam kel there's no such

403
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,680
thing as a pre-sound california skunk

404
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,199
i mean when you're depends on what let

405
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:50,319
me rephrase that there's no such thing

406
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:52,159
as a pre-sam california skunk one that

407
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,040
doesn't exist before sam

408
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:57,198
um skunky weed did exist before sam that

409
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:59,198
was just afghani

410
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:00,639
they had nothing to do with skunk one

411
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:05,000
uh yeah

412
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,000
hey yeah clap you want to come on

413
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:08,558
[ __ ] i'll bring him on

414
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,280
yeah dude

415
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,559
there we go see if it works

416
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:19,279
let me get this

417
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:21,678
picture off here

418
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:23,678
or it'll probably mess up

419
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,839
bring super i would never bring super in

420
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,280
here i don't get super quiet exposure

421
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:29,839
how you doing

422
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:30,720
yeah how you doing answer that question

423
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:32,480
and

424
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,519
it comes up all the time

425
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,558
almost

426
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:37,599
every

427
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:39,918
so-called liquid silica product is made

428
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:42,879
from potassium silicate and that's where

429
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:49,038
your ph issues come into play

430
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:51,120
uh problems with raising the ph so uh we

431
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:54,079
we can get it from other sources a

432
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:56,319
couple of the posters here mentioned uh

433
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:58,480
rice halls and that's true there's even

434
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:00,960
a powdered rice whole product that build

435
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,759
a soil carries i can't remember the name

436
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,960
but

437
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:07,038
i've used it and it did well

438
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,240
one person asked a very legitimate

439
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:10,798
question

440
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,759
is it even necessary

441
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,960
and

442
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:15,839
um

443
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,640
it depends like in my worm bins i run a

444
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:19,759
lot of uh rice holes as an aeration

445
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,320
material

446
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:23,919
so on that deconstruct it's releasing

447
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:25,519
the uh

448
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,679
silica oxide

449
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:28,400
i believe that's the form it's in

450
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,600
so

451
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,559
would i add it to my soil no

452
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:34,719
but

453
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:37,279
you know so that question isn't

454
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,319
you need some silicon in your soil

455
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:43,759
and if you use it judiciously

456
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:45,279
and get like the uh egg sale product

457
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:47,119
because that's what all the other ones

458
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:49,519
like the silly one from

459
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:52,639
oh the guy advanced nutrients wet betty

460
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:55,200
or something yeah um

461
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:58,080
even a sillier label but uh

462
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,759
it's made from axil i mean all those

463
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:00,960
products that you see in the grocery

464
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:03,359
store

465
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,919
or what i call the house of perdition

466
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:07,519
um they're all made with eggs so get

467
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,160
exile

468
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:12,319
yeah you know and then cut the chase and

469
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,160
it's in a powder form so you mix on as

470
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:14,960
need basis

471
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,558
uh

472
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,558
and it's good for emulsifying

473
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:21,759
horticultural oils i don't want to get

474
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:23,279
into that mess uh neem or karate oils or

475
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:25,279
whatever but uh

476
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:28,000
yeah and i still use them and they're

477
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:28,798
full of crap the people you know

478
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
yeah

479
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:31,519
you gotta learn the difference between

480
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,119
an extract

481
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:34,400
and oppressing but

482
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:36,479
you know that's like trying to explain

483
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,400
why is it called unsulfured and not

484
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,079
desulfared

485
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,759
molasses and if you can't wrap your

486
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:43,439
brain around that one

487
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:45,919
then i don't want to talk to you about

488
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,320
the differences between an extraction

489
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,160
and using solvents

490
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:53,279
in a pressing that goes back at least

491
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,720
3000 years you know whatever

492
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:55,839
i'll get off myself how do you feel

493
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,839
about

494
00:19:55,839 --> 00:20:00,000
uh how do you feel about um like like

495
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:03,359
power side the the orthosilicic acids

496
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,279
and and monosolicic acids

497
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:07,199
i'm sorry hold on a second let me turn

498
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:09,678
my sound up excuse me

499
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,679
that's all right

500
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:16,158
good question

501
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,240
um how do you feel about orthosilicic

502
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,720
acid and monosalicylic acid stuff that's

503
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,599
not from potassium silicate you know to

504
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,319
be honest with you i'm a real minimalist

505
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:28,319
um if you looked at my recipe

506
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:30,240
uh

507
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:32,839
the biggest criticism is well there's no

508
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,200
there there well it's all in the worm

509
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:37,678
castings you know i don't

510
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,840
look i think everybody should

511
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,679
recycle their kitchen waste if you don't

512
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:43,678
do that you should have to be forced to

513
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,600
listen to some tv show that's really

514
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,880
horrible or something

515
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:49,199
but it's not going to give you a worm

516
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,520
casting it's too much water and as much

517
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,159
as those worms are they can't turn water

518
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:55,839
into castings yeah so you need bulk and

519
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,799
that comes from either

520
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:00,399
aged manure and by that we mean five to

521
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:02,720
six weeks

522
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,679
to allow the

523
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,919
um

524
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,240
verbicides that are given livestock for

525
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,799
like we do dogs you worm them right yeah

526
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,480
well those herbicides kill

527
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:14,240
the good guys in our worm bin so you

528
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,400
need to let that sit for about five to

529
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,480
six weeks and they'll degrade

530
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,720
into a form

531
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,519
into its basic uh

532
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,919
ionic structure if that makes sense

533
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:28,079
yeah so it's no longer a vermicelli it's

534
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:31,360
carbon and hydrogen and oxygen and all

535
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:33,279
those good things um

536
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:35,119
so

537
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:36,798
so we want to use that that gives us

538
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:39,759
bulk

539
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:41,839
and that's how you make good castings is

540
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:45,640
through bulking yeah without the stuff

541
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:45,639
that there's some uh

542
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:52,639
i'll leave it at that yes a good good

543
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:53,599
cat good uh bedding that's been

544
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,720
uh

545
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:59,599
elevated with uh nutrient dense

546
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,558
materials like small amounts of alfalfa

547
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:03,439
meal

548
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:04,720
uh kelp meal i like to run neem and

549
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,400
karanja

550
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,240
this might you might find interesting

551
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:12,480
karanja is actually

552
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:14,960
a legume it's closer to a

553
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,798
alfalfa plant and it is the neem tree

554
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,640
which is a mahogany

555
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:20,639
and the properties in those two

556
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,480
materials couldn't be more different

557
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,159
there's no shared

558
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:29,919
constituent as a direction comes from uh

559
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:32,159
neem and uh pongamia oil

560
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,000
comes from karanja

561
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,400
i'm not familiar with karanja what what

562
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,640
what is that used for well in india as

563
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:42,880
the preferred one for medicines for uh

564
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,799
skin products

565
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,679
and india has some of its own race

566
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:50,000
issues the beliefs that lighter colored

567
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,240
citizens are more intelligent than

568
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,200
darkerness said to be used to lighten

569
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,480
the skin tone i know that it can

570
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,840
uh

571
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,679
but if you look if you went into an

572
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:01,839
indian market

573
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:04,000
and went to the haba section everything

574
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:07,038
would have either neem or quarantine you

575
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,119
know shampoo toothpaste

576
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:10,720
but over here if you get touched with

577
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:12,558
team you're gonna fall over dead or

578
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,558
something or

579
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:15,918
you know you can't go to the rose parade

580
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:17,279
or something i don't know

581
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,840
but um

582
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:19,839
yeah i mean

583
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,000
if you looked at the ayurvedic medical

584
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,079
system you know you have the tcm

585
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,880
traditional chinese india has the

586
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:31,678
ayurvedic and 72

587
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,640
of the uh

588
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,120
bottled

589
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,840
compounds you know

590
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:40,239
elixirs and stuff 72

591
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:41,199
have some part of the neem tree root

592
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,400
bark

593
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,759
leaf

594
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,600
oil

595
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:49,038
um

596
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:51,278
and it's behind the tulsi

597
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:53,119
basil which is a forerunner of all

598
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:56,960
basils like the

599
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:58,879
wolf is to the or canine friends

600
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,240
well this one okay it's the most holy

601
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:05,039
plant in india is the tulsi

602
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,079
and then neem is the second one

603
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:08,640
so

604
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:11,759
anyway there you go at all

605
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,880
look up there sometimes research.ca

606
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:15,440
uh

607
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,520
is nothing to do with gardening nothing

608
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,880
okay it's all about human health

609
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:23,759
diabetes uh

610
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:26,320
viruses uh all kinds of things you can

611
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:27,278
rub the oil on your feet

612
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:29,759
as a

613
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:30,558
cure or a prevention of athlete's foot

614
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,879
if you

615
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:34,480
do a lot of uh running or you know

616
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,120
whatever

617
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:41,278
so yeah it's been around for 5 000 years

618
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:43,278
but suddenly 18 months ago became a

619
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:48,798
you know point of discussion at uh

620
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:48,798
canacon and uh yeah indo expo you know

621
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:52,798
it's just

622
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,400
you know whatever

623
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:56,480
ah all this is appreciated there's

624
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:59,360
people asking all kinds of questions uh

625
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,759
go ahead i mean to dominate there but oh

626
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:02,719
no worries no worries i'm enjoying it um

627
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:05,599
let's see

628
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,400
why my why is my worm casting running

629
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:10,319
hot in sodium and then uh and you think

630
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,798
i can push out sodium with calcium

631
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:12,798
gypsum

632
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:19,679
no because uh gypsum is simply uh

633
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:19,678
um

634
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:25,759
wait a minute

635
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:27,918
oh calcium sulfate and it's calcium in

636
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:30,319
its elemental form whereas the calcium

637
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:31,520
we get is say limestone

638
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:34,399
or

639
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:36,400
oyster shell that's calcium

640
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,440
calcium carbonate

641
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,440
so there's one

642
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:44,879
calcium ion

643
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:46,798
there's one carbon ion and then three

644
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,520
oxygen ions

645
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:51,519
in calcium carbonate but in this

646
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:52,879
in gypsum you're getting calcium by

647
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:56,000
itself

648
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,760
and then you get sulfur oxide which is

649
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,679
water soluble

650
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:03,599
and so what and like let's say

651
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,960
you're using core

652
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:06,798
uh

653
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,720
one thing that has to be

654
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:09,759
you know acknowledged is that it's an

655
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,600
inert

656
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:13,440
medium that's why it's

657
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:14,558
preferred if you're going to use salts

658
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,840
but

659
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:18,480
in a uh

660
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:20,399
organic soil it's a nightmare

661
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,640
so what you want to do the big one

662
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,480
that's missing is sulfur and without

663
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,880
sulfur

664
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,960
sulfur is at the base of almost every

665
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,720
metabolical function on this planet

666
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,038
including the production of terpenes

667
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,679
terpenoids and ketones so it'd be a

668
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:37,440
really good uh red i'm using corn i

669
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,840
can't get any flavor

670
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:44,640
and i don't get any aroma

671
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:46,879
okay put a half a cup of uh gypsum

672
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,799
you know and say a cubic foot and there

673
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,480
you go you're dancing

674
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:53,119
yeah yeah that's something i had to

675
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:55,120
learn on my own too to add add sulfur

676
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:57,678
yeah some kind of sulfur too too because

677
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:59,678
i use core that's all i use right so i

678
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:02,000
like a mix i like to add in a calcium

679
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,919
carbonate like limestone or oyster shell

680
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,319
it doesn't matter the same thing

681
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:08,640
and then a little bit of gypsum so i'm

682
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:10,960
getting my elemental calcium along with

683
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,159
my calcium carbonate and then i'm also

684
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,319
picking up

685
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,159
uh some gypsum

686
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:18,000
so i think that's that's a good balance

687
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,880
if you i don't like using this term but

688
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,398
a liming agent if you will yeah for lack

689
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,559
of a better one

690
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:27,038
okay we have a request here on um the

691
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:28,558
history of the strain the one which is

692
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:32,960
one i've been fascinated with for a long

693
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:35,359
time myself okay uh pretty simple um

694
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,558
in laguna beach in the late 60s and

695
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:40,479
early 70s before

696
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:41,839
the whole lsd the orange sunshine thing

697
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,798
took them apart

698
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:45,119
you know

699
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:46,879
it's one thing to taunt a dog behind the

700
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:49,199
fence with a stick but you don't want to

701
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,240
do that with the federal government yeah

702
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,159
that's especially when you're

703
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,200
understanding containers

704
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:57,679
contains like a patch

705
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,960
okay those are like 48 000 you know i

706
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,038
mean

707
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,720
these guys weren't just a dude

708
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:05,919
we're gonna see the dude and get some

709
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,759
stash tonight you know this is like

710
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,278
you know you gotta bite even then 10

711
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:11,278
kilos to even

712
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:13,679
communicate but anyway

713
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:17,599
so the seeds came a lot of the guys

714
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:20,159
because they're in the bl there was like

715
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:22,158
it had to be 13 right 13 original

716
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,399
founding members that's yeah that was a

717
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:27,679
good one okay yeah and so seven were

718
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:29,359
part of this ragtag motorcycle club

719
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:33,519
that used to hang out this really weird

720
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:35,519
bar not far from disneyland uh

721
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:39,599
they were just you know

722
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:42,480
drinkers and you know like rowdy bikers

723
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:45,678
it was the 60s man so

724
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,839
there was also this group of surfers

725
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,759
in the mid 60s that were traveling

726
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:52,079
around the world as

727
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:53,839
it was easy to do

728
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:56,079
maybe easier than today

729
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:57,439
and when surfing in the surfing spots

730
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:59,599
all had

731
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,120
somebody there with good weeds so they

732
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:02,398
started bringing some good weed back

733
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:03,439
because they knew how to pass their

734
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:05,119
boards

735
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,519
so they could make a hole in the board

736
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:10,079
and stash in a pound or two

737
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:12,639
and so that's then the two got together

738
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:15,639
and then the whole thing so the seed

739
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:19,120
that i had were from kandahar

740
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:20,320
1970 and i know exactly who brought him

741
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:21,599
in

742
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:22,720
the whole

743
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:25,119
story

744
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,600
okay so then i went off to the army got

745
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:29,759
drafted kicking and screaming to send

746
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:32,000
the women and children first

747
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:34,158
um but off to save the world make it

748
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,759
safer democracy

749
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,760
so it came back and uh

750
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,720
in the december of 1976 the first thai

751
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:48,720
sticks came in

752
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:51,038
okay and they came in uh 10 kilo

753
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:54,159
uh bales

754
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:55,679
and they were wrapped in uh

755
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:59,039
i'm sorry

756
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:02,480
yeah 10 kilo you know 22 pounds right

757
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:03,839
yeah okay yeah so uh 20 of those pounds

758
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,200
were

759
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:06,240
sticks

760
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,919
and

761
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,120
since to me it was still two or three

762
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:12,320
years away

763
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:14,319
so they were seedy is all get out

764
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:16,000
and uh there was then two pounds of

765
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:18,319
loose buds that of course had to be

766
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,200
renamed the buddha buds

767
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:24,079
yeah yeah i've heard of that yeah okay

768
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:27,440
so those seeds became the first crop i

769
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:29,678
ever did that summer in 77

770
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,519
and there was no growth stores there was

771
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,440
no new program

772
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:35,119
i don't not even sure

773
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,600
even would know what to do if i had a

774
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:39,359
bottle of maxi or miracle grow or

775
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:41,359
whatever you know

776
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:43,839
yeah but i understood that you had to

777
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:45,678
water plants

778
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:47,519
so

779
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:50,559
and that was before the banking laws you

780
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:52,000
could walk into a car dealer and buy

781
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:54,398
four

782
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,640
celicas if you want and

783
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:58,158
pay cash and it was no big deal yeah

784
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,159
that came later in the reagan

785
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,960
administration you know

786
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,278
yeah

787
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,640
just saying no that crowd

788
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:08,640
so uh

789
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,640
so that was a female and

790
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:13,919
there were 10 plants that were selected

791
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:13,919
out of this mass

792
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:21,759
i'm not a breeder so if i told you you

793
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:23,678
guys be laughing so this was like

794
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:25,599
flying by the seat of my pants just be

795
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,919
reliant about it you know well that's

796
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:29,519
early on though no one was really

797
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,919
well there were no companies and the

798
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:34,319
guys in california were still dinking

799
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:37,200
around with goofy names you know

800
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:39,678
yeah um i had a couple but

801
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,880
i would have named that's another story

802
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,559
um

803
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:46,080
so

804
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:47,440
that one uh the way it got the name was

805
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:49,359
that

806
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,558
they were all against the wall and they

807
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:54,558
went from sativa over to

808
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:58,158
afghani dominant

809
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:58,158
which i had no interest in at all

810
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:03,200
so i just said okay the one over here is

811
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:05,439
mine and so oh so it's like the one huh

812
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,360
no it's like the one over here is mine

813
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,960
okay and then it became a running joke

814
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:10,398
you know he still got the one yes still

815
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,720
got the one

816
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:14,319
and uh

817
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,000
so that's just like you know it has

818
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:18,480
nothing to do with i thought it was like

819
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,038
oh yeah it's like the one no i've had

820
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,240
the one that came from sri lanka and i

821
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:24,158
didn't want to

822
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,319
ever smoke weed again

823
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,440
it was like that far out you know it was

824
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:30,319
like yeah

825
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:32,080
some hindus i mean real hindu not

826
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:33,439
you know he picked it up in new delhi i

827
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:35,678
mean like in the cush valley or

828
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:38,159
something you know from the saudis yeah

829
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:41,120
so that's all the you know no big deal

830
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:43,039
and um but ironic is

831
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:44,639
that i've given that way i've never sold

832
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:48,640
a clone in my life

833
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:52,240
the last time i sold a seed was 77.

834
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:54,080
uh that's early that is early yeah i

835
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,038
take thai seeds you know because i had

836
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:56,398
them

837
00:32:55,038 --> 00:32:58,240
because

838
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:00,398
i learned early on that if i was going

839
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,480
to take the risk of

840
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:05,038
being a

841
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,278
serious consumer of cannabis that you

842
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:10,558
might as well do the good stuff

843
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:12,880
so i would sell like

844
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:15,839
i know you think i'm not but say i would

845
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,679
get fronted like a ton or two of uh

846
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:20,000
colombian

847
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,759
from guys in uh

848
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,720
detroit with way too many vowels in

849
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:26,480
their last name

850
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,360
they'd give you like two months to turn

851
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,599
it

852
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:30,959
yes so our motto was i don't want to own

853
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:32,000
it i just want to finger print it

854
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,440
meaning

855
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,359
you know bump it 25 30 bucks

856
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,960
yep and just keep it you know so then i

857
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:41,599
would turn around and go buy like

858
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:44,880
premium mishma khan

859
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:47,439
or yohaka o'hakan spears were personal

860
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,120
and went to sears and got a deep freezer

861
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,480
so i could freeze it

862
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:51,918
you know so i could buy three or four

863
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:56,159
pounds you know that kind of stuff

864
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:58,880
that's [ __ ] awesome yeah so that was

865
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:00,559
yeah you know

866
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,840
can i just say one thing about skunk

867
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:03,918
number one

868
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:07,038
sure i mean going back to the like

869
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:08,960
original in the mid 80s yeah i don't get

870
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:11,440
it

871
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,440
what do you mean

872
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,878
as far as like why it's called skunk in

873
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,359
the first place i

874
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:20,358
you know it's like

875
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,320
i just don't get the whole

876
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:27,519
thing about it

877
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:30,000
i mean why like it's that desirable

878
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:31,918
oh okay now i understand that one okay

879
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,480
all right i can i can understand that

880
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:36,158
one okay it's like yeah

881
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,240
yeah one of my favorites

882
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,720
somebody will give me a

883
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:43,358
bud to try what do you think

884
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:47,358
now let's say

885
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:47,358
so did you clone this more than twice

886
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:50,079
why

887
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,158
yeah

888
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,919
it's made it through three rounds but

889
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,599
yeah i mean yeah come on

890
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:57,199
uh

891
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,280
one nice thing about growing an old

892
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:01,919
strain

893
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,760
is that you really can test the soil

894
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,000
because you can't test this off though

895
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,599
this time i'm going to do

896
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,199
i don't know skittles or piddles or

897
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,680
whatever it's called right

898
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:13,279
um yeah yeah okay and then over here

899
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:14,960
well i'm going to try this oil but i'm

900
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,839
going to

901
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,679
i know use or whatever the thing is you

902
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:21,279
know whatever the hot button is

903
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:23,679
but with me

904
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,560
i mean i can tell you by day 24

905
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:27,440
uh

906
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:29,679
i'm not gonna finish this i appreciate

907
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,079
you let me try it but you know

908
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:33,519
best wishes uh go back to the drawing

909
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,760
board

910
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:38,719
so

911
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,920
that and so in my opinion which means

912
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:42,319
nothing

913
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,680
is that at least if i test something for

914
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:49,200
you i can give you a an accurate

915
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:52,480
comparison analysis of one

916
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:53,439
uh that i've you know grown like forever

917
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,119
yeah

918
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,880
the main reason people don't like mine

919
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,358
is that if you really want to get the

920
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,838
full you know

921
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:03,039
twilight zone theme comes on right here

922
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:05,519
um

923
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:06,880
you got to do at least 12 if not 14

924
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:08,320
weeks

925
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,240
and here's the best part this is the

926
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,720
part i love the best

927
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:15,679
i've taken it 18 weeks just to see what

928
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:17,199
it would take to get the trikes to turn

929
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:20,078
even cloudy

930
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:22,239
it doesn't ever happen never

931
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,760
so you're never going to get the amber

932
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:24,879
forget that one

933
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,560
all right yeah

934
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,880
let alone cloudy

935
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:30,799
no it never goes cloudy even outdoors

936
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,160
like seven months where you like

937
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,519
southern california where you can take

938
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:38,319
it through november into december

939
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:41,280
yeah it never no it never goes cloudy

940
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,559
it has to be the highland tie that has

941
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,040
to be

942
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:47,119
i would think so maybe if you tried like

943
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:49,599
way less light hours like six hours like

944
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:51,680
oh yeah oh yeah i still didn't do it

945
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:54,559
over the years i've done every

946
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:56,078
i haven't when i was uh ignorant got

947
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:58,480
into that well you know you need this

948
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:01,920
bulb okay

949
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,920
uh yeah right

950
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:07,280
this bulb will make it finish yeah

951
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:09,440
this bulb will make it faster yeah right

952
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,920
yeah magic stuff what's in i can't say

953
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,039
it's proprietary

954
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,159
excuse me

955
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:15,679
you know

956
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:18,559
so

957
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:20,960
but anyway that's

958
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:22,960
that's my you know just a guy that

959
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,639
decided to get into soil real serious

960
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:28,400
and figure out

961
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:30,559
i have post on my uh ig feed

962
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,000
of a soil test that i mixed five years

963
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:34,880
ago

964
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,679
and it has all the npk it has all the

965
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,960
macro and micro nutrients

966
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:40,719
and you know we're a little weak in the

967
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,240
microsoft throw some kelp in there

968
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:44,159
that's why kelp is the perfect one

969
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:47,199
because it's a plant right

970
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:48,639
and it accumulates all 83 elements more

971
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:50,879
importantly in the right value if we

972
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:53,440
don't go nuts

973
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:57,440
that's adding some kelp will take care

974
00:37:53,440 --> 00:38:00,079
of all our micronutrient issues

975
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,760
wow i see i didn't even know that

976
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:05,839
it's the only brown killer makes sense

977
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:08,400
not not blue marine algae not red

978
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:11,599
but a green i mean green red but brown

979
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,680
only brown is the only

980
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:16,079
organism on this planet that creates

981
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:18,078
allergenic acid

982
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:21,760
and i'll gent i'll leave you for

983
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:24,240
research on that but you can see why

984
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:27,119
brown kelp has algenic acid seaweed

985
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:28,879
extract is created by by law under

986
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:31,200
federal

987
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,200
usda regulations has to be created with

988
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:36,159
either sodium

989
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:38,960
uh hydroxide or potassium hydroxide the

990
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:40,078
stuff they use in drano to clean out

991
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,679
your uh

992
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,359
drain so they use that and they burn

993
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:45,279
everything off so what are you left with

994
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:47,119
you're left with powder

995
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,760
you got your elements you might as well

996
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,599
just do salts see what i mean yeah all

997
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,079
the life force is gone

998
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:56,480
yeah but it's convenient

999
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,880
but at a convenience that

1000
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,800
is detrimental to your soil in my

1001
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,280
opinion

1002
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:06,079
i don't want to put a fungicide

1003
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,320
in my soil after i've spent

1004
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:10,880
several months building up the nutrient

1005
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:15,079
yeah and fungal profile in my compost

1006
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,079
before i ever hit a warm bin

1007
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:19,279
um can i ask you

1008
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:21,358
are you self researched and you just you

1009
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,760
just delved into it hardcore and learned

1010
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:26,960
it all on your own are you are you

1011
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,640
oh no no no i'm academically yeah i was

1012
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,039
going to say this is pretty pretty heavy

1013
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:33,199
academic stuff yeah but the real stuff

1014
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:35,679
is that you have to do it

1015
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:38,559
you have to get your hands dirty there's

1016
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:40,239
no bottled solution there's hey it's

1017
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:43,199
it's hard work and if you want to have

1018
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:45,118
scratches in the game

1019
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:48,399
you got to do it

1020
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,400
and be consistent don't

1021
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:54,559
don't be you know my phone because we

1022
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:56,639
released my product today

1023
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:59,599
oh good hey there it's patty the one

1024
00:39:56,639 --> 00:40:02,799
with uh how you doing malted barley

1025
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:05,200
malted or heirloom corn and uh hemp

1026
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,519
seeds and where can people get this oh

1027
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:08,799
build a soil it's called don't laugh i

1028
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:11,679
named it so

1029
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:14,079
i want to sound cool uh gnarly barley

1030
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:16,559
gnarly barley yes 50

1031
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:19,359
barley and it's uh 30

1032
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:20,318
corn that's for the cytokinins

1033
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:22,880
yeah

1034
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:25,039
and then the hemp

1035
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,760
which i could spend a couple days

1036
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:29,679
explaining all the enzymes and compounds

1037
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,280
well you know from

1038
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:33,039
it kind of goes like this if it works

1039
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,280
good on a plant it's probably good for

1040
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:38,079
you and vice versa

1041
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,079
that's interesting

1042
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:47,199
means nothing more than this it means

1043
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,880
that you took a seed

1044
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:51,439
and you germinated it

1045
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,440
and then you arrested at about 116

1046
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,679
fahrenheit what that does

1047
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:58,639
it leaves the uh

1048
00:40:55,679 --> 00:41:00,159
enzymes intact so we call that diastatic

1049
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:01,838
malt

1050
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:04,078
now if we take that

1051
00:41:01,838 --> 00:41:06,239
mold after it's dried and ready to store

1052
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,240
used

1053
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,159
or aroma for ales and what have you

1054
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:16,559
that's great

1055
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:19,679
but it kills all the enzymes so now we

1056
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:22,159
call that non-diastatic malt and if you

1057
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:23,919
use non-diastatic malt in your beer

1058
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:26,960
formula

1059
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,960
then you need to add

1060
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,358
the diastatic mold because you can't

1061
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:32,960
make beer without amylase is the main

1062
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:34,400
player

1063
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,119
uh enzyme

1064
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:39,358
in the barley but that's not what we

1065
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:40,720
benefit from

1066
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:43,039
can i explain this one because this is

1067
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:46,000
really important

1068
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:46,838
so all plants produce chitinase

1069
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,920
and

1070
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:52,078
chitin itself is an acetyl form of

1071
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:55,280
glucosamine

1072
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:57,839
okay all seashells contain

1073
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:00,720
are made up from limestone

1074
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:03,679
or calcium carbonate okay okay but the

1075
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:04,719
crustaceans the the crab the lobster the

1076
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:06,159
shrimp

1077
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:09,759
and i guess that would also include the

1078
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:11,920
one in the south uh crawdads yeah have

1079
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,160
chitin

1080
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,720
and kaiden for example you had surgery

1081
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:19,039
either oral or external they probably

1082
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:23,039
showed you up with kite and string

1083
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:24,318
okay um that goes back to like the 1880s

1084
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:27,440
this has really got an interesting

1085
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:30,000
connection so in 1922 this young man by

1086
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:33,358
the name of albert hoffman graduates

1087
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,318
from cologne university and his paper is

1088
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:38,639
on the molecular structure

1089
00:42:36,318 --> 00:42:40,400
of chitin

1090
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:44,000
and then

1091
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:47,599
21 years later he would introduce

1092
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,440
or find lsd 25 and then 15 years after

1093
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:51,200
that he was commissioned to do the

1094
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,200
research on these

1095
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:54,639
mushrooms out of uh

1096
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:56,480
oaxaca

1097
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:59,679
and he's the one that gave the name to

1098
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:02,559
the two compounds psilocybin and silicon

1099
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:04,000
so in a 15-year period here he does lsd

1100
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:07,279
25

1101
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:10,000
read his book lsd my problem child

1102
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:13,040
there you go write it down

1103
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,760
and then anyway so

1104
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:19,119
the only thing that can deconstruct

1105
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:22,160
microbially that can deconstruct

1106
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:23,838
a polysaccharide uh

1107
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:26,480
is fungi

1108
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:29,039
bacteria in their weak attempt to try to

1109
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,240
deconstruct it create an enzyme called

1110
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:33,119
chitinase

1111
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:35,759
and chitinase deconstructs egg shells in

1112
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:37,680
the soil

1113
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:40,880
so that's kind of cool you don't have a

1114
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:43,358
poison yeah yeah and then equally

1115
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,358
important

1116
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:48,159
animal kingdom and plant kingdom have

1117
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:51,358
immune systems

1118
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:54,399
and in plants you have like har hormonal

1119
00:43:51,358 --> 00:43:57,119
acquired resistance and sars

1120
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:59,200
systemic acquired resistance and some of

1121
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:01,358
them are called pathways the most

1122
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:02,719
important pathway in a plant's defense

1123
00:44:01,358 --> 00:44:05,440
system

1124
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:08,959
uh is um

1125
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,400
the chitinase salicylic acid pathway

1126
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,679
okay and

1127
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,318
every plant

1128
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:16,399
produces uh

1129
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:18,800
salicylic gas

1130
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,720
some plants produce copious amounts like

1131
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:23,200
the aloe vera plant

1132
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:25,199
you probably heard in your career oh you

1133
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:28,078
can use willow shoots

1134
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:29,598
oh yeah okay well that's salicylic acid

1135
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:32,079
okay and so that's why people would use

1136
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:33,119
aloe vera for that's why i know i

1137
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:37,119
started that

1138
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:39,519
look man i'm not climbing a tree

1139
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:41,599
i can go to a mexican market and get a

1140
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:44,159
fresh aloe vera leaf

1141
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,599
and you just cut off the spiny stuff on

1142
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:47,759
the sides

1143
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:49,760
and you stick your stems in there

1144
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,960
inside the gel that sit overnight and

1145
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,480
the next day

1146
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,240
put them in how are we i don't want to

1147
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:57,358
get into that one but how you do your

1148
00:44:54,239 --> 00:45:00,479
cuts yeah in that salicylic acid

1149
00:44:57,358 --> 00:45:03,279
creates a barrier against pathogenic

1150
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:06,719
fungi your molds and all that

1151
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:09,920
i average seriously over 98

1152
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:11,679
success using just that and i don't

1153
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,838
oh that's actually the best one is you

1154
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:15,440
can find true

1155
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:17,440
like the sign on the side of the road

1156
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:19,358
that says honey so it's never been

1157
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,039
touched yeah it's just used straight

1158
00:45:19,358 --> 00:45:22,639
honey

1159
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:23,519
it's straight

1160
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:24,639
yeah

1161
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:25,838
wow

1162
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:28,078
yeah

1163
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:30,480
i had no clue about that yeah it's

1164
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:32,079
really cool but you got to get organic

1165
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,838
because

1166
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:35,599
what they do to honey from the time they

1167
00:45:33,838 --> 00:45:37,519
pull it from the beehive so it gets in

1168
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:39,838
that jar with a little bear you know

1169
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:42,480
i'll let you know yeah um

1170
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:45,039
it's a sad story you know it's not like

1171
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,599
the real deal you know yeah

1172
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:50,159
but anyway so that's why if we use

1173
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:52,079
malted grains in our soil

1174
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:55,519
the chitinase you don't have to go

1175
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:56,960
through the expense of using crabmeal

1176
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:58,880
because what you're really after is the

1177
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:02,960
chitinays not the chitin

1178
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:06,160
yeah so here you get it right in the uh

1179
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:08,240
malted grains along with uranus urea

1180
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:10,559
protease protein

1181
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:13,838
phosphatase what cannabis grower doesn't

1182
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:15,759
obsess about phosphorus right yep uh

1183
00:46:13,838 --> 00:46:18,400
much to their barrel usually

1184
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,800
um yeah right yeah but you get the idea

1185
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:23,680
i mean so there's like 360

1186
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:26,880
enzymes in a malted grain

1187
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:29,279
so what i can do and have done is i can

1188
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,640
document okay here are the

1189
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,000
you could take something out from under

1190
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:34,159
your fingernail and put it in water and

1191
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,639
say it's got enzymes

1192
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:39,440
oh yeah okay

1193
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:41,838
but i can explain each one and how they

1194
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:44,079
work and i'm only taking like 10 out of

1195
00:46:41,838 --> 00:46:46,400
the 360

1196
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:48,480
that are in barley so

1197
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:52,079
and then you add corn of the cytokinins

1198
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,079
and what that does to

1199
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:55,679
between the tip of the root system and

1200
00:46:54,639 --> 00:46:57,679
then

1201
00:46:55,679 --> 00:47:00,159
mary stem

1202
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:03,838
at the end of the branches is quite a

1203
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:05,118
phenomenal uh study

1204
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:08,880
and the first

1205
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:12,160
cytokinin was discovered in corn in 1937

1206
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:15,280
in the latin name for corn is zia

1207
00:47:12,159 --> 00:47:17,679
so they named this enzyme zeatine

1208
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:20,559
um makes sense yeah so that's and

1209
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:23,759
there's other uh there's other pgrs and

1210
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:26,559
other things in the corn besides

1211
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:30,000
that one enzyme excuse me hormone

1212
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:31,839
yeah so anyway

1213
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,440
i was just thinking botany 101 i

1214
00:47:31,838 --> 00:47:35,679
probably bored your audience there but

1215
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,760

1222
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:53,679
talking to uh gardeners

1223
00:47:49,358 --> 00:47:54,799
instead of a salesman you know yeah man

1224
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:57,358
it's a pleasure

1225
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:59,760
to have you look at my feed

1226
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:01,358
your what my feet yeah okay you've seen

1227
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,520
some of the plants

00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:08,960
yes yes don't you think it's a little

1231
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,640
disingenuous to come on my feet and tell

1232
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,519
me what i should be doing

1233

1238
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:23,920

not so much

1240
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,440
editorial stuff you know until you kind

1241
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:29,039
of

1242
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:32,800
uh

1243
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:32,800
i figured i've been involved in at least

1244
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:37,960
yeah at least 300

1245
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,960
325

1246
00:48:38,318 --> 00:48:43,519
serious gardens in my career

1247
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,960
yeah i can imagine so dude

1248
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:47,199
hey the first slice i ever bought was

1249
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:50,079
some jor oh yeah it was called george

1250
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:52,239
cervantes then before he became jorge

1251
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:54,000
so uh yeah he had a place here in

1252
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:55,838
portland it was one of three gross

1253
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,800
stores in portland at the time that was

1254
00:48:55,838 --> 00:48:58,639
it

1255
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:01,200
and uh

1256
00:48:58,639 --> 00:49:03,759
we went and bought these uh dutch lights

1257
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:06,159
from pl light systems

1258
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,839
okay i mean the professional stuff i was

1259
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:10,159
gonna burn down my house in orange

1260
00:49:07,838 --> 00:49:12,159
county california

1261
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:13,440
you know trying to grow some weed so we

1262
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:14,838
decided

1263
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,519
there was you

1264
00:49:14,838 --> 00:49:20,159
know funding was available i'll leave it

1265
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:23,519
at that so uh yeah we decided to set it

1266
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:26,558
up first cabin and uh i was using uh

1267
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:29,039
what do you call them oh dosatrons

1268
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:31,599
30 years ago

1269
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:34,159
that's funny yeah and buying like full

1270
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:36,640
jugs i think they were five gallons

1271
00:49:34,159 --> 00:49:38,480
yeah dyna girl and dinah bloom uh we'd

1272
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:40,318
ride down to uh

1273
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:42,079
there was some in the bay area like san

1274
00:49:40,318 --> 00:49:44,960
jose something like that

1275
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:47,200
yeah and uh so we just put the dosatron

1276
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:49,760
inside the jugs

1277
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:50,799
and then i had i did the strip system i

1278
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,960
mean

1279
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:55,519
by today's standard you guys got it made

1280
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:58,400
i mean it's all off the shelf and plug

1281
00:49:55,519 --> 00:50:00,559
and play for the most part you know

1282
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:03,440
we had to kind of like huh

1283
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:07,440
so how are we going to do this oh yeah

1284
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:10,079
one time pulling stuff out of the field

1285
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:12,000
and staging it next to the pickup trucks

1286
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:14,079
and uh

1287
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:17,920
the guy that was like our leader i

1288
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:19,440
called him oph our personal hero

1289
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,639
in this case i just said hey some dick

1290
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,440
have you given a thought where you're

1291
00:50:20,639 --> 00:50:24,879
gonna dry this

1292
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:28,960
and everybody just looks down at the

1293
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,960
ground like oh man

1294
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,880
and we were using bull tacos to go back

1295
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,318
into the forest to get the

1296
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:39,440
the plants where i can bring them back

1297
00:50:36,318 --> 00:50:42,719
and stage them you know

1298
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:43,838
so uh jorge servants

1299
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:45,279
i know he's friends with some of the

1300
00:50:43,838 --> 00:50:47,119
northern lights crew did you interact

1301
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,040
with those guys at all

1302
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:51,119
no not at all because that came out of

1303
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:53,440
uh what they called the uh

1304
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:55,200
bcga the british columbia growers

1305
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:57,280
association

1306
00:50:55,199 --> 00:51:00,318
and uh

1307
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:03,280
the nl came out of uh canada

1308
00:51:00,318 --> 00:51:05,279
on a guy that broke you see the bcga

1309
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,040
wasn't going to do business with any of

1310
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,680
the two groups that came out of holland

1311
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:12,558
the what is now called scentsy seeds

1312
00:51:09,679 --> 00:51:15,199
then it was called the sssc

1313
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:18,000
and then uh neville and

1314
00:51:15,199 --> 00:51:19,358
his partner uh david yeah

1315
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,519
so yeah

1316
00:51:19,358 --> 00:51:23,759
they wandered around and everybody had

1317
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:25,920
cash you know

1318
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:28,960
yeah a briefcase is full of cash and

1319
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:30,318
they were buying seeds and cuts

1320
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,720
so

1321
00:51:30,318 --> 00:51:35,679
northern light came out from a

1322
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:37,039
grower in canada

1323
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:39,519

1324
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:41,519

00:52:03,039 --> 00:52:07,679
life that i you know

1338
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,960
every story i hear about old older

1339
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:10,879
growers that we're growing the northern

1340
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,639
lights haze and it's heyday they all

1341
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:15,119
have very very fond memories and they

1342
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:17,118
talk about how many keepers were found

1343
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:19,280
that became like one of them clone only

1344
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:21,680
that are still around nowadays well

1345
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,760
there is a caveat to my comment i want

1346
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:25,358
to make this is really important

1347
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,400
here's where you're getting conflicting

1348
00:52:25,358 --> 00:52:29,920
things

1349
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:32,639
in a case that i was indirectly

1350
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:35,119
i wasn't involved but

1351
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:37,358
i was on the possible list of uh come

1352
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:39,119
talk to us

1353
00:52:37,358 --> 00:52:40,960

ditch weed seeds

1361
00:52:56,318 --> 00:53:01,119

00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:09,280
lunch or something and decide how

1367
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,039

1390
00:53:56,639 --> 00:53:59,759
because we know who brought them into

1391
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:02,000
the united states

1392
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:04,079
and the whole history

1393
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,800
and who who had possession of them and

1394
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:09,200
everything else so

1395
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:11,359
i don't have a lot of confidence

1396
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:14,000
one breeder here

1397
00:54:11,358 --> 00:54:17,039
that a farm or whatever they call them

1398
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,440

1399
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:21,358

1400
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:22,838

1401
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:24,400
gram or half an

1402
00:54:22,838 --> 00:54:26,159
ounce

1403

this i've had put them in a bag i

1407
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,720
brought them home

1408
00:54:33,679 --> 00:54:38,639
they were going to hire me as a

1409
00:54:34,719 --> 00:54:40,639
consultant and uh

1410
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:43,039

industry is like that too the whole hemp

1463
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:38,318
industry i i just made my my entrance

1464
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:40,720
into the hemp industry last year and i

1465
00:56:38,318 --> 00:56:43,440
was shocked at how many people um are

1466
00:56:40,719 --> 00:56:45,039
playing grower in that i really thought

1467
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:47,519
i never [ __ ] with it i figured they're

1468
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:48,639
people that are that are better than i

1469
00:56:47,519 --> 00:56:50,639
would be at doing it because they've

1470
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:51,838
been studying specifically hemp longer

1471
00:56:50,639 --> 00:56:54,078
working with it longer i figured they

1472
00:56:51,838 --> 00:56:55,920
had that [ __ ] [ __ ] dialed in and boy

1473
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:57,280
was i confused when i got in there and

1474
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:00,240
saw the people were just playing

1475
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,240
constantly playing

1476
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:03,280
i don't know

1477
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:07,358
all i know is

1478
00:57:05,039 --> 00:57:09,759
wild world

1479
00:57:07,358 --> 00:57:09,759
without

1480
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:16,318
you know proprietary this and i can't

1481
00:57:13,838 --> 00:57:18,558
tell you that and you know i mean

1482
00:57:16,318 --> 00:57:20,880
you think let's think about it this way

1483
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:23,359
the issues facing the human race isn't

1484
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:25,280
whether johnny gets his tank on is how

1485
00:57:23,358 --> 00:57:26,400
are we going to feed

1486
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:28,400
people

1487
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:30,318
and if this crap work

1488
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:32,000
they'd be sitting in front of the u.n

1489
00:57:30,318 --> 00:57:33,759
picking up checks for billions of

1490
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,199
dollars

1491
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:38,400
on solving

1492
00:57:35,199 --> 00:57:38,399
world hunger right

1493
00:57:38,838 --> 00:57:42,480
right

1494
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:45,280
i mean to me it

1495
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:47,838
it's that simple

1496
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,559
it is that simple

1497
00:57:47,838 --> 00:57:50,480
so

1498
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:52,839
that's why like on my new product i'm

1499
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:54,559
