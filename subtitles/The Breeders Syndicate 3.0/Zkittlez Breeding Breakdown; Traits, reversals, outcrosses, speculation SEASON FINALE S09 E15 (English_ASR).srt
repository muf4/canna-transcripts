cannabis Show Breaking Down the myths

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,599
and history in cannabis I'm Matthew seed

4
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:12,439
maker for over a decade and a half and

5
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:15,160
this is my journey into finding my truth

6
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:18,278
in this wild world of cannabis I invite

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:20,600
you to join me and the can Illuminati by

8
00:00:18,278 --> 00:00:22,960
strapping into the passenger seat but be

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,560
warned it's not always pretty with the

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,960
invasion of corporate culture into

11
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:28,518
cannabis it's getting even more muddy

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,359
which is why I've made it my mission to

13
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:32,519
have a permanent record before all the

14
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,160
history is lost and buried under a pile

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,359
of

16
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:39,039
cookies we are the traditional Market

17
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:40,600
The Syndicate is a collection of seed

18
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,479
makers that want to push back against

19
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,120
all the smok and mirrors in doing so we

20
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:47,238
will continue to ruffle the feathers of

21
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,839
those who oppose and my personal mission

22
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:52,358
has become much bigger than myself

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,520
welcome to the Cannabis underground this

24
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:56,600
is the

25
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,920
revolution welcome to breeder Syndicate

26
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,079
I'm Matthew here with my co-host

27
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,079
thousandfold and today we have local and

28
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,840
farmer Dan with us thousand let's hear

29
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:08,439
about the show and this is our season

30
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:12,400
finale yep so we finally get to our

31
00:01:08,438 --> 00:01:15,079
Skittles episode and we have Dan and

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,320
locco both because they have had an

33
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:20,319
interest perhaps different angles of

34
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:23,000
interest uh into the Skittles green sh

35
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:25,798
keine pie question um both have some

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,719
experience uh either with the cut uh and

37
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,000
or with the uh

38
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:33,560
s1s of either the Sher or the Skittles

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,959
uh Dan has worked with it commercially

40
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,240
if I'm not mistaken Dan in some

41
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:41,438
degree yeah pretty

42
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:43,919
extensively yeah okay and also we

43
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:46,078
initially plan to do this with uh CSI

44
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,719
but he's been too busy so we have his

45
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:50,478
Blessing and also a little

46
00:01:47,718 --> 00:01:53,359
representation of him right

47
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:58,118
there there he is right there there he

48
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:58,118
is just about how

49
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:02,359
the so a little bit about how the

50
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:06,158
episode is going to be structured the

51
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:10,000
first half is really just us unpacking

52
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:12,319
um what uh we all know and have observed

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,159
and not me so much as these three uh

54
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:17,518
whether in the cut itself or the

55
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:19,878
s1s um and then the second half of it is

56
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:23,239
going to be about hypothetical breeding

57
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:26,120
projects we won't be going into origin

58
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:28,719
stories per se uh as we have for

59
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,120
other clones so we're not going to be

60
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,759
talking about like the people deci side

61
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,640
like who did what when I think that's

62
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:38,280
less the priority today that's just a

63
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:39,878
cluster anyway so yeah yeah I think we

64
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,719
want to stay away from that and you know

65
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:44,399
to be honest I've always been keen on

66
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,598
and Matt I know has always been keen on

67
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,480
this side of things where you actually

68
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:53,439
work to find out what's happening yeah

69
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:56,158
traits yeah so without further Ado we

70
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:58,759
can step in I think to talking about

71
00:02:56,158 --> 00:03:00,399
some of the traits of the Skittles

72
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:02,560
clone

73
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,599
Dan do you want to start us off just uh

74
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,000
and we Matt obviously jump in at any

75
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:09,039
time local jump in at any time um but we

76
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,039
may as well start with what I think is

77
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:14,400
its

78
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:17,000
most uh notorious uh attribute its scent

79
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,879
right yeah like it scent is something

80
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,360
that like blows people's minds if

81
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,919
they've never smelled anything like that

82
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,680
in cannabis and so especially for like

83
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:26,559
people that are kind of like I don't

84
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,920
know touring a facility or something

85
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,479
it's like always a treat to be able to

86
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:32,079
be like oh you don't really smell weed

87
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:33,639
very often like come smell this plant

88
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,799
and like to me it's kind of like this

89
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:39,000
like Cherry Lemon grapefruit thing you

90
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,719
know like somewhere in between all of it

91
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,759
with like this creaminess that's like

92
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:45,158
really pretty mild compared to some

93
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:48,679
other Cuts but like also it's there and

94
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:52,639
it's distinct um but like it's it's also

95
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:55,280
like a dwarf little mutant that grows

96
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:58,119
super super slow and has just an

97
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,280
absolutely terrible root system that

98
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,560
like it I and the roots are there they

99
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,318
just don't work well for whatever reason

100
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,280
like maybe it has like a naturally low

101
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:08,518
respiration rate or something like that

102
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:13,079
but it's um it's a pretty hard to work

103
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:16,079
with plant like it's hard to clone it uh

104
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:18,519
um yeah like you can veg them for weeks

105
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,160
and weeks longer than everything it's a

106
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:22,439
pretty short flowering plant like we

107
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,199
like to take it at uh between like 50

108
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:26,879
and 56 days um before that nose

109
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,720
disappears because it will and just turn

110
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:31,800
into cardboard um but yeah that's kind

111
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,960
of my little my little summary of it

112
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,079
it's a nice plant though all

113
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:40,719
green a realistic picture of Z right

114
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:43,560
here yeah dead on Photo realistic photo

115
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:47,400
realistic it's not the most impressive

116
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:49,720
plant Matt what's your take on the scent

117
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:51,959
um is it the same as dance or do you

118
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,759
have a different opinion for me like

119
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:56,279
when we grew it it was um extremely I

120
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:57,840
can't I don't want to say Citrus in the

121
00:04:56,279 --> 00:05:00,478
sense that it's like orangey because

122
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:03,879
it's not to me it was like the essence

123
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:05,800
of grapefruit and and the flavor lingers

124
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:08,478
like it it gives you the the lip

125
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,840
smacking thing where it's con it stays

126
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:12,758
in your mouth for quite some time after

127
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:15,679
and it's just it it hangs in my mouth

128
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:17,319
like Tangi and Calo do so yeah that

129
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,800
that's why I have a big association with

130
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:21,918
the Citrus Parts but yeah um grapefruit

131
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,759
is where I lean most

132
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:26,198
to and locco have you have you tried the

133
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:28,600
cut local I can't remember if I've asked

134
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:30,919
you this um I haven't tried the cut

135
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,479
specifically but I've tried a few uh Zs

136
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:36,799
ones from Caleb that he

137
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:38,478
grew um and those were honestly kind of

138
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,360
all within the range of what Dan and

139
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:42,478
Matt both described uh really heavy kind

140
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:48,319
of

141
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:51,918
like citrusy like kind of candy thing um

142
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:54,080
it the the smoke is like really

143
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:57,599
transparent too like the way it tastes

144
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:59,918
and and smells um it's almost damn near

145
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,639
identical but yeah it's it's really

146
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:04,560
tasty I like it a

147
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:07,319
lot yeah this thing does translate to

148
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,000
flavor uh yeah yeah that's obviously a

149
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:12,720
big deal as we've discussed um what is

150
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,478
the sense in terms of effects

151
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:19,120
potency low

152
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:22,318
nothing I mean I weed I I definitely

153
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,360
built up a tolerance to to Z and the Zs

154
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,919
ones and the sh best ones um extremely

155
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,680
fast extremely fast and but it wasn't

156
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:31,680
like there was ever like a whoa this

157
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,840
deep you know I never never hit there

158
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,840
even uh at first

159
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:43,598
smoke is it like uh how does it compare

160
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:45,879
in that sense to like other cookie

161
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:49,399
derivatives or

162
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:51,399
hybrids you say less less potent than

163
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:53,839
average oh wow okay you know because

164
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:56,000
there's like decent potency in modern

165
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:58,839
you know like gelato Bas lines and stuff

166
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,399
it's not always there but um you know

167
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:02,159
with just like a little heterosis from

168
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:04,598
outcrossing you can usually bring stuff

169
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,800
into the i20s and get you know like a

170
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:08,439
decent effect but yeah Skittles like I

171
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,199
think you're pretty hard pressed to get

172
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:12,279
high off it I like to blend it with

173
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:15,759
potent weed that may not be the most

174
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:17,559
flavorful like a a nice camon OG or

175
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,199
something and then like add that fruity

176
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:22,839
element so you got like the skunky

177
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:25,120
earthy you know what I mean with the

178
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:27,000
candy so I use it as like a flavor

179
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,199
modifier in

180
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,680
Blends you know one of the things that

181
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,720
like I think when we talk about the

182
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,800
Clone being kind of like a kind of piece

183
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,800
of crap I think some people do agree

184
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,639
like growing it it's not the most

185
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,759
friendly plant um is the branching and

186
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:47,560
when we try to talk about the branching

187
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:50,319
it it has even to me it has even more

188
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,598
bendy limp limbs structure than say an

189
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,360
OG and because it's not as tall and it's

190
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:56,959
more short and squat it's very odd

191
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,439
looking almost like a train wreck Style

192
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:00,680
just to where it just flops all over

193
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:03,439
itself it never had good turgid

194
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,038
structure for me yeah and it it also

195
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:07,000
like doesn't really have like strong

196
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:08,839
epical dominance like you'll never get

197
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,240
like a tall lanky

198
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:15,839
clone it's always this little ball

199
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,800
plant like that yeah without without

200
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:20,079
topping yeah without topping it does

201
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:23,478
that yes breus Syndicate 3.0 is coming

202
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:25,439
at you with props guys hope you ready

203
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:29,000
right I wanted to ask this kind of a

204
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:31,038
random question but like in your minds

205
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,839
are there any other kind of cuts or

206
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:34,360
lines that are comparable in whatever

207
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:36,360
fashion like does it remind you of

208
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:38,240
anything else for whatever reason

209
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,080
whether in structure or smell or

210
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,080
anything or no it's quite

211
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,519
unique I think it's like sweet pee and

212
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:48,440
grapefruit just along not the exact same

213
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:50,959
but the the the TPS are similar enough

214
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,120
and unique enough for what SPG was at

215
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:55,239
the time to have made the same kind of

216
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,200
impact I think that's why I associate

217
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:00,600
them so much and the grapefruit part of

218
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,879
it maybe one thing for the people who

219
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,519
are not in the US especially like when

220
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:07,240
did it come into the market this isn't

221
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,839
in my outline but I just kind of came to

222
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,839
mind when did it really like hit the

223
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:13,959
market and how much of an impact would

224
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:17,240
you all say it has had relative to

225
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:20,159
something like gelato 2017

226
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,560
2018 yeah um is when it really impacted

227
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,799
the market I remember the emerald cup

228
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:25,719
where they were trying to sell every

229
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:29,199
seed form of it possible yeah I think it

230
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:31,959
was like I think it was I think it was

231
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,440
spring 2017 when the dookie Bros dropped

232
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:36,119
their trades in Humble because that's

233
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,160
what I remember I was still in college

234
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:41,560
but I think it was my senior year or my

235
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:44,000
super senior year something like that um

236
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:45,958
and uh I remember ditching class and

237
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,839
going because like they had announced on

238
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:49,439
Instagram that they were you know had

239
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,959
limited quantities of it and I think I

240
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,959
got the last one that was on the tray

241
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:55,239
and it was like the least well rooted

242
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:57,518
and like I didn't know how big of a

243
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,240
piece of [ __ ] it was but yeah um we

244
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,159
actually didn't end up keeping that cut

245
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,600
long term because the hype hadn't built

246
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:07,120
yet and um it was still spell like the

247
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,600
candy too there was no Z's involved and

248
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,759
um uh yeah I couldn't get anyone to grow

249
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,519
it because it was a bad router it was

250
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:15,879
veg so slow just like those growth

251
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:19,440
traits nobody really wanted to grow it

252
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:19,439
because that hype hadn't built up

253
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:26,920
yet and as far as the impact it's had I

254
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:28,759
think I mean just look at the Modern

255
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:30,838
names on the market everything's got a z

256
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:33,639
in it now whether it has actual Skittles

257
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:36,680
in it or not its actual impact has been

258
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:39,240
that everybody sticks Z's on [ __ ] now so

259
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:41,799
yeah I think it and GMO also are like

260
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:45,079
single-handedly responsible for the the

261
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:46,958
whole rosin revolution in extracts

262
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:48,519
because Z actually does have I forgot to

263
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:50,838
mention that earlier it does have really

264
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:53,360
nice resin traits for washing and they

265
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:55,680
those tricomes just fall right off and

266
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:59,039
so um those were like I think the first

267
00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:01,319
two that were the earliest I think that

268
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:02,679
ended up being washers that have lasted

269
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,440
to this

270
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:09,239
day I have a cultural question here is

271
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:12,160
the Z responsible for the term zah or is

272
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:15,440
that from something else I would bet

273
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:17,679
yeah I don't think you get zah without

274
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,320
the Z revolution in like Matt was

275
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:23,120
talking talking about a second question

276
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,519
if I call it Zed what will people think

277
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:29,720
you think that you're British just like

278
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:32,839
you are yeah you T totaler yeah

279
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:35,120
um in terms of like this crappy growing

280
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:36,839
like this kind of uh you you know you

281
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,159
have mentioned multiple times how bad it

282
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:42,480
is is there anything else that grows as

283
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:45,879
poly or that grows like it maybe

284
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:48,240
urle yeah ask actually

285
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:50,759
yeah yeah yeah that's kind of like what

286
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,720
I would compare it to if I was like

287
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:55,039
being like hey you've never grown this

288
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,800
but like here's the reality of it and if

289
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:58,719
they like knew their purple oh yeah I

290
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:02,879
see I don't have experience with that P

291
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,440
very similar yeah yeah not as leafy uh Z

292
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:06,639
is not as leafy as Puck obviously but

293
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:10,079
yeah no same kind of structure slow

294
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:12,919
growing shitty RS

295
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:15,679
yeah another thing that came to mind was

296
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:19,719
like have there been any

297
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:22,278
notable outcrosses uh with it

298
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:25,720
historically yeah tons like it just

299
00:12:22,278 --> 00:12:27,600
depends on um what you consider notable

300
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,560
you knowly what I was going to say I

301
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,079
guess 201 2018 I don't find anything

302
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:35,559
notable too much but at the same time it

303
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:38,759
has had a major impact on the culture

304
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:40,599
and notably like yeah I mean there's a

305
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:43,559
lot of just like I said the z's are in

306
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,320
everything so I mean yeah definitely I

307
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:47,319
think it's honestly I think it's been

308
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,560
more of like a marketing Revolution than

309
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,519
actual like number of plants that have

310
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:53,719
come from it kind of thing there you go

311
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,198
it's like Skittles and then like maybe

312
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:58,079
moonbow kind of thing and rainbow belts

313
00:12:56,198 --> 00:12:59,958
those are the only like three like big

314
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:02,519
names and they weren't really that

315
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:04,198
widely distributed and I don't think the

316
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:06,879
first iteration of rainbow belts was

317
00:13:04,198 --> 00:13:09,359
like super well received and so what's

318
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:12,320
the lineage on that I think I don't know

319
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:15,519
about rainbow isn't it Dosey

320
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:18,360
Do [ __ ] Skittles I thought that was

321
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,360
moonbow but um I could be wrong on all

322
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,680
of it I don't know yeah me too yeah you

323
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,519
might be right that is moonbow what was

324
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:24,879
rainbow belts bro I'd have to ask I

325
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,879
don't know but I've seen stuff that

326
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:30,639
looks like rainbow belts come out of

327
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:32,519
like some classic combos of like Z OG Z

328
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,560
headband stuff like that sometimes you

329
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:36,278
get those dwarf little guys with the

330
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:39,078
really chunky

331
00:13:36,278 --> 00:13:40,958
buds yeah um zcube was the one that I

332
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:43,078
had the first experience with before the

333
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:48,239
moon bows and all that stuff um how much

334
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:49,879
you pay for those $500 a pack yeah

335
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,919
that's what I remember too and I

336
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:54,000
remember I think it was Shiloh from

337
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:56,879
Fields no I bought them from Shiloh and

338
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,120
Shiloh charged me $500 a pack for I

339
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:03,480
think I spent 6K and 500 to pack all the

340
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:05,120
way up no breaks yeah yeah every time

341
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,199
I've met Shiloh at like events and stuff

342
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,000
he's been a really nice guy he's nice

343
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:12,359
super nice businessman for sure yeah

344
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,720
yeah the one I get out of all those

345
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:18,240
dudes all those dudes the only one I get

346
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,240
along with yeah yeah Matt since you

347
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,278
mentioned it Matt what was it like

348
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,560
working

349
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:28,320
with Z or the

350
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:30,518
zcube um there the the zittles smell is

351
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,040
not consistent in zcube despite it

352
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:35,839
supposedly being a

353
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:40,240
bx3 um and that was bx3 yeah could old

354
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:42,480
bx3 um a very fast bx3 I might add

355
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,680
meaning like it was made very quickly

356
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,320
yeah like a year and a half exactly and

357
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:48,958
the other thing I noticed was despite

358
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:52,120
buying many different kinds of the

359
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:52,958
Skittles hybrids that everything except

360
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:58,720
um the

361
00:14:52,958 --> 00:15:01,039
Ros Rosé types were identical like not

362
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,440
in and not that everything was

363
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:06,240
uniform but everything looked like the

364
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,880
same Expressions coming out of different

365
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,639
packs no matter what the parent was if

366
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:14,838
that makes

367
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:17,240
sense so it was a lot to spend to see

368
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:19,720
something I could have seen in one pack

369
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:22,759
um with that said the outcrosses they

370
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,560
could definitely outcross Z dominant um

371
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:28,720
I like the structure better on

372
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:30,119
zcube um the crosses it's just it wasn't

373
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,639
consistent for the chirp so I had a

374
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,519
really hard time calling any of its

375
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:35,919
Skittles unless it was uh dominating

376
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:39,519
that particular cross but it didn't

377
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:41,240
really bring much in that in that sense

378
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,440
um it could have I think it could have

379
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,360
been done better relatively speaking

380
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,399
like what was the what were some of the

381
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:51,159
more successful results do you think in

382
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:53,278
your opinion um we had a a Dosey dose

383
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:55,719
NorCal IC mag cut cross to the zcube

384
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:57,838
early on called do Skittles which is

385
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,759
essentially similar to moonbo but it was

386
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,199
a few years earlier and people really

387
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,959
like that one a lot but again it's like

388
00:16:02,198 --> 00:16:06,799
I didn't love it uh my favorite was the

389
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:10,159
the Skittles Blue Bonnet and I I work

390
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:11,799
that further but but that one was like a

391
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:14,120
a merging of the the graef fruit and

392
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:17,318
blueberry which to me reminded me a lot

393
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:19,440
of like um blue satellite you know so

394
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:21,159
and I like blue satellite what' you call

395
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,560
that Skittles Bonnet I didn't I didn't

396
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:24,799
think he did that I never released it of

397
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:26,838
course I only I only uh ran them and

398
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:30,719
then used it in the blue Skittles

399
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:33,360
blueberry Mac one send them to me yeah

400
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,160
you want I might have sent the last them

401
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,600
to D actually I don't remember what

402
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:39,198
happened to them yeah they were all

403
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,480
white they were all shitty seeds so I

404
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:43,519
was just like I can't sell this they pop

405
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,319
it's pretty it happens a lot even with

406
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,799
like a really healthy expression of it

407
00:16:45,318 --> 00:16:48,679
that you get a pretty fair portion of

408
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:50,919
white seed in there yeah I mean they

409
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:53,359
were they were like modeled gray but

410
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:54,559
just like not full brown tiger stripes

411
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,680
so I knew there's no way I can sell

412
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:59,799
these because people would just like

413
00:16:55,679 --> 00:17:02,679
flip out so yeah yeah it definitely has

414
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:05,000
like its own unique seed morphology too

415
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:08,438
I've actually used that surprisingly

416
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,038
successfully as like a predictor of uh

417
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:15,439
like those TPS you know and in my line

418
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:17,400
it's like a a limey kind of smell um but

419
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,439
once I fixed that like they were all

420
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,319
like really consistently limey like I

421
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,160
had one run where I like was doing a

422
00:17:21,318 --> 00:17:25,119
breeding project I was pretty stra for

423
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,558
time and I didn't take as good of notes

424
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:29,159
as I should have and so I was kind of

425
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:31,798
just like smelling these like flower bit

426
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:33,320
and the Shu seeds off to the side and

427
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:35,400
like um I was kind of just like well

428
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:37,678
that one looked really similar to the

429
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,600
mother seeds you know what I mean like

430
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,840
oh I'm gonna I'm gonna try that and like

431
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:42,959
when I grew them they were just like

432
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:44,519
amazing you know and so I actually look

433
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,519
for that now and I've kind of noticed

434
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:48,279
that's interesting yeah that's

435
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:50,440
interesting I yeah like it's not

436
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:52,240
something that people ever like look at

437
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,720
but um I'm actually kind of obsessed

438
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,480
with it to a certain degree um cuz when

439
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:00,159
you know a line you know what its seeds

440
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:02,519
look like like yeah chmd seeds are like

441
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:04,720
little dark brown circular like

442
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:05,720
spherical balls you know what I mean

443
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,839
like that's what I've always kind of

444
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:10,159
seen from them and uh um I don't know

445
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:12,399
yeah Z is kind of like these little

446
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:15,480
dinosaur eggs with these like few but

447
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,960
like pretty specific looking uh uh

448
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,200
modeling on it I think is what it's

449
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,679
called um those tiger stripes but yeah

450
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,080
they look like dinosaur eggs that's what

451
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,600
I always call it you know because they

452
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:26,639
look different you know what I mean than

453
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:29,558
the average

454
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,480
seed funny little OTE I had like a buddy

455
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:34,000
telling me in a trim room one time we

456
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,279
had some seeded weed on this outdoor and

457
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,880
he's like you can't tell the difference

458
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:38,480
of these seeds and I'm just like let me

459
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,360
look at them and like I'm looking at

460
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,839
these five cups of seeds and I'm like

461
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:44,639
mix them all up you know what I mean and

462
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:46,399
I separated them perfectly and told them

463
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,120
exactly what they were you

464
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,159
know yeah I mean if you've gone through

465
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:53,239
a lot of seeds and you've made a lot of

466
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:55,600
lines and you just you know sorted seeds

467
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,038
a lot like it it becomes very evident

468
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:58,879
like oh this came from that this came

469
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:01,000
from that like train W has own type of

470
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,880
seeds you know like there's all kinds of

471
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,679
strains that that really have

472
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,320
distinctive seed types yeah yeah I was

473
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,519
working a bunch of s ones and so they

474
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:12,678
were like distinct separate a bunch of

475
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:14,839
Caleb stuff yeah I mean it's the same as

476
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:17,159
if you were like a I don't know a wood

477
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:19,000
worker looking at work uh wood you know

478
00:19:17,159 --> 00:19:20,559
like you can see a lot more than someone

479
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,279
else could just because of the time

480
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:25,038
spent with it

481
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:26,759
um I'm glad you mentioned the oh you go

482
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:29,000
man I was just going to say like for

483
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:30,798
that comment uh me and someone else were

484
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,400
talking about a

485
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:34,359
mutual I should call them an

486
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,080
acquaintance now a mutual acquaintance

487
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:38,519
that it seems like what they were doing

488
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:40,678
and this is very typical in the weed

489
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:42,839
business was taking someone else's seeds

490
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:46,038
looking at what it was and was thinking

491
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:48,959
oh let me think this has skunk one Haze

492
00:19:46,038 --> 00:19:53,079
and something El and and and I'll five

493
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:56,279
in it let me say this is you know uh a

494
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:57,798
Thai Afghan something you know like and

495
00:19:56,279 --> 00:20:00,480
we'd see him move these things around

496
00:19:57,798 --> 00:20:02,639
but the problem was like if people knew

497
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,839
those lines well enough that he was

498
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,640
confabulating for the others it's still

499
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:07,959
just as obvious because traits or traits

500
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,159
are traits and that's the one thing a

501
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,558
lot of people Miss if they aren't able

502
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:12,240
to see it themselves they don't

503
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:15,240
understand that other people can see it

504
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:18,038
they don't get it but it is

505
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,880
there yeah and I think you know that

506
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:21,679
should be a strong implication of this

507
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:24,559
whole episode you know the way we're

508
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,480
exploring this is through traits and

509
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:29,918
through observations not

510
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,880
through uh yeah not through a you know

511
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:34,320
as I mentioned like a historical lens as

512
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:36,840
much absolutely which I think I think is

513
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:40,759
a really interesting um way to go for us

514
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:42,599
as well even in terms of the show um I'm

515
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:43,879
glad Dan mentioned the s1s obviously

516
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:47,798
we're going to dive

517
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:50,840
into yeah thoughts on Skittles s1's sh

518
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:54,519
say S1 someone say

519
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:57,720
S1 it's the S1 master

520
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:59,480
um can I ask locco before we jump into

521
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,360
the S1 was there anything else I know

522
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,200
local doesn't uh mention that heat may

523
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:04,759
not have as much to say about the Clone

524
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,480
itself but local was there anything else

525
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:11,240
you wanted to add before we went into

526
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:14,319
the s1s um not at the moment that's cool

527
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:16,480
yeah okay if well we can just like

528
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:18,639
briefly just so like people can like

529
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,200
understand my kind of experience with

530
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,880
the plant in general and just like the

531
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:25,159
timeline so like we mentioned like the

532
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,720
Dy Bros um breaking up with like I don't

533
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:28,799
even know what their group was called at

534
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,200
that point right it wasn't Dying Breed

535
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:33,720
yet it wasn't turp Hogs yet like I don't

536
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,400
was it third gen or you know what was

537
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:38,440
that it might yeah I don't know I

538
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,759
remember I remember the the KY kushman

539
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,159
Shiloh thing but I don't remember

540
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:44,278
anything what what it was before then I

541
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,240
wasn't as keyed in to like the whole

542
00:21:44,278 --> 00:21:47,798
like IG like I was just kind of getting

543
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,519
into it and figuring out like who

544
00:21:47,798 --> 00:21:53,558
everyone was in California like I was

545
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:56,319
hidden away for a while but um yeah like

546
00:21:53,558 --> 00:21:58,599
they do that in 2017 spring I get the

547
00:21:56,319 --> 00:22:02,240
Clone couldn't get anyone to grow it

548
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:05,240
drop it um I come across it again or the

549
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,558
the kind of family in La that's when I

550
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,679
get the green shb and the sunset and we

551
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:11,240
do run I was telling you about this I

552
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,759
think like a week ago but yeah like we

553
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,400
get the sunset we get the green sherb

554
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:17,000
and um we run them side by side and

555
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,320
we're like well [ __ ] this green thing

556
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,319
you know what I mean the sunset's the

557
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:23,519
way to go it's purple it's gas it's

558
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:25,720
creamy it's like you know yeah um but

559
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:28,480
like I saw a plant that had like pretty

560
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:30,880
good modern structure like pretty full

561
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,120
um pretty unremarkable in most ways just

562
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:38,640
like lime green like a little fruit

563
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:40,319
basket kind of bouquet um and uh like I

564
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,038
I forgot about it for another year or

565
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:45,278
two you know until I got a cut called

566
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:48,879
Skittles quote unquote from a buddy in

567
00:22:45,278 --> 00:22:51,319
Oregon and um that cut was more similar

568
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,278
in structure to the green sherb but it

569
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:55,960
smelled like the keyme pie yeah you know

570
00:22:54,278 --> 00:22:58,119
and so I bred with that for a couple

571
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,600
years and now recently you know know

572
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:01,038
since I've had my current job for the

573
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:04,240
past year I've just been like crossing

574
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:07,079
Skittles to everything and doing tons of

575
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,839
Inc Crossing or outcrossing work a bunch

576
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:12,439
of different inbreeding projects and

577
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:15,000
stuff and so um it's been interesting to

578
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:16,519
see it all it's just like it's a like we

579
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,079
were saying earlier it's those traits

580
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:21,400
don't always line up the way that you

581
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:24,119
really want them to yeah that's for sure

582
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,240
yep yeah no that's great and maybe local

583
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:26,879
can say a bit as well I know it's

584
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,440
obviously not on the same scale and not

585
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,760
not trying to you know Mak him feel

586
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,720
awkward or anything but logo head you

587
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:38,599
you've run some sheris once correct yeah

588
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:42,919
I ran two packs from Caleb in the past

589
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:45,158
um and then I have another six going

590
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:47,000
right now I had one damping off so I'm

591
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:50,799
I'm just down to

592
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,599
six um but yeah I mean relatively

593
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:56,879
speaking they're all really nice plants

594
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:58,639
um what I've kind of found it that was

595
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,240
cool um

596
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:04,038
is that I know people [ __ ] on the

597
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:07,720
structure of Z A lot um that's one thing

598
00:24:04,038 --> 00:24:09,759
I did not notice um in the the shb best

599
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:15,440
ones is is there is like No Lack of

600
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:17,400
vigor uh so to say um you got some

601
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,519
pretty nice like you know decent

602
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:22,600
yielding plants nothing you

603
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:26,639
know out of the ordinary or like you

604
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:29,558
know spectacular or whatever um there

605
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:32,360
was some color on the leaf but not much

606
00:24:29,558 --> 00:24:34,639
of it really faded to the bud um but

607
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:39,158
then again my room wasn't the

608
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:41,200
coldest um and then um I was showing

609
00:24:39,159 --> 00:24:42,880
some pics to Matt the other day and he

610
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,200
would pointed one out that looked kind

611
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,440
of like a like what you would see in

612
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,600
cookies um which I thought was really

613
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:53,480
interesting um what do you mean by that

614
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:55,038
uh so like the the nug structure and I

615
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:58,000
think it would be like the interner noal

616
00:24:55,038 --> 00:25:00,558
spacing like the the way you kind of see

617
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,440
them spaced out from each other it's

618
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:04,319
pretty kind of obvious like now that I

619
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:07,360
look at it again

620
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:09,960
yeah um but I don't know like the smell

621
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:13,959
is just really nice too but I don't

622
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:17,399
think it's as strong as like the Z S1

623
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:21,000
smells but they are like the exact

624
00:25:17,398 --> 00:25:23,759
same theme if that makes sense I don't

625
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,079
know also I wanted to I wanted to add

626
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:28,359
here like we haven't been able to um

627
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:30,000
verify that key lime pie is the exact

628
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:32,038
same cut as green Sher there's never

629
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,839
been a time when anyone that I know

630
00:25:32,038 --> 00:25:35,319
personally has gotten them both sourced

631
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:37,278
from really good sources at the same

632
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:39,798
time to run them side by side so I just

633
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:41,038
wanted to add that caveat actually yeah

634
00:25:39,798 --> 00:25:42,960
we should actually really explicitly

635
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:44,278
signpost this because I don't think we

636
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,840
actually spelled it out but the

637
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:50,798
speculation is that green sherb keyme

638
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:51,839
pie Skittles are either the same thing

639
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:54,720
will have something to do with each

640
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:56,278
other very close right no no Skittles is

641
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,640
something different what's the Skittles

642
00:25:56,278 --> 00:26:00,960
is is is defitely a different clone than

643
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,919
the keyme pie and green Sher but um

644
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,480
keyme pie and green Sher it's definitely

645
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:06,038
debatable on whether they're related I

646
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,159
don't I don't really know I like I

647
00:26:06,038 --> 00:26:10,158
describe I describe keine piie different

648
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,640
than Dan does for example because we

649
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:15,080
didn't have in the same environment same

650
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:16,880
room all that um how how Z is related to

651
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:18,798
Green sh like that is definitely

652
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:22,000
speculation but there's a lot so much in

653
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:24,440
common that it's hard to ignore I would

654
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,720
say okay so there's speculation

655
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:29,640
basically that they are that these three

656
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:32,399
are at least Loosely related yes I think

657
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:36,240
that's fair to say okay yeah gotcha

658
00:26:32,398 --> 00:26:38,439
gotcha I mean if we were taking we were

659
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:42,000
like placing bits then what would your

660
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:42,000
bit be just I don't

661
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:50,639
know I mean I still don't know that's

662
00:26:49,398 --> 00:26:53,359
kind of like why it's such an

663
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,360
interesting topic is that um I still

664
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:57,918
don't think anyone's found a Dead Ringer

665
00:26:55,359 --> 00:27:00,599
in a green sh S1 but I think a green

666
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:03,759
Sher bag seed is definitely part of the

667
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:05,719
equation you know because like for those

668
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:08,319
traits the the way that I've seen the

669
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:10,200
traits break down and how they outcross

670
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:11,599
versus when you self and stuff is that

671
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,640
like the structure and the resin

672
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:16,678
qualities are really dominant and the um

673
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,480
Aromas are really recessive and so you

674
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:20,840
only ever really see them when you cross

675
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:24,159
it to things that it's kind of related

676
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:26,038
to already which is sure you know and so

677
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,039
you can actually get some of those Z

678
00:27:26,038 --> 00:27:30,879
turps at low rates to pop up by even

679
00:27:28,038 --> 00:27:34,839
Crossing like Z into gelato stuff you

680
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:36,919
know um but it's not very common and

681
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:40,720
like as far as like the percentage

682
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:43,880
breakdown um so I would yeah go

683
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:46,200
ahead no sorry you finish oh yeah I was

684
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:49,200
just going to say like I think that

685
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:52,159
green sherb like a green sherb double up

686
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:54,759
on some of these traits that being like

687
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:57,120
in an S1 I think is like a necessary

688
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:58,640
step but I also do have a suspicion that

689
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:00,918
it was out

690
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,080
cross so we've kind of piered the

691
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:05,640
conversation with this already but Dan

692
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:08,759
would you tell us like uh in terms of

693
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:12,480
these Zs ones like what did You observe

694
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:14,319
so I grew 45 of them and um I got 35

695
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,038
jars of flour out of it because some of

696
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:18,240
them hmed and then some of them were

697
00:28:16,038 --> 00:28:20,960
just like literally so unworkable and

698
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,319
dwarf and slow growing that like it just

699
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,919
wasn't going to happen you know with the

700
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:28,119
pace of our work and so um what I saw

701
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:31,240
was like

702
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:34,158
90% Skittles like dead ringers of

703
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:36,960
Skittles and its structure and its uh

704
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:39,000
expression but just with cardboard turbs

705
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,360
you know like not good at all like

706
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,398
almost aromal less you know what I mean

707
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:48,599
and then the other 10% was eily similar

708
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:51,199
to cookies and and uh Sunset sherbet it

709
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:56,240
had a very sherb look to it and um they

710
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:58,200
were also completely aromal you know um

711
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:01,960
but there was a handful full I think we

712
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:04,360
had four Keepers out of those 35 um that

713
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:05,840
were all notable for one reason or

714
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:07,519
another you know some of them had better

715
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:10,319
potency some of them had a more true

716
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:13,120
Aroma but I personally didn't see any of

717
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:15,319
them that I was like this when I smelled

718
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:17,239
this and real Skittles at the same time

719
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:18,759
like that's the exact same Aroma it was

720
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:22,440
all like how local was saying it's in

721
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:24,319
the same ballpark which um I call like a

722
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,919
mixed Starburst you know what I mean

723
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:27,879
like if you had like a cherry a lemon

724
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:29,799
and an orange Starburst like all right

725
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:32,679
there on your hand that's kind of like

726
00:29:29,798 --> 00:29:35,079
the closest thing you see um even in the

727
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:38,200
s1s and so I do personally think that

728
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:41,519
like um Skittles its Aroma and profile

729
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:44,960
is a very rare trait combination or Gene

730
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:47,319
combination in that pool because I Haven

731
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:51,360
seen it pop up yet just to clarify and

732
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:55,038
the s1's that you you ran uh you saying

733
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:57,798
like 90% of them were aromal less no

734
00:29:55,038 --> 00:30:00,038
like 90% were like Skittles expression

735
00:29:57,798 --> 00:30:01,879
like if I showed you the flower and a

736
00:30:00,038 --> 00:30:03,319
real Skittles plant like the Clone side

737
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,159
by side you'd be like yeah that's the

738
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:06,558
same

739
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,960
plant like yeah it's a different

740
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:11,359
individual yeah morphologically yeah but

741
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,600
there was some nice smelling things like

742
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:16,079
what is that four out of 35 you know

743
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:19,158
like that's like one in seven has like a

744
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:22,480
pretty nice Aroma you know so it's not

745
00:30:19,159 --> 00:30:24,360
like non-existent it's just like not

746
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,240
very high prevalence you know like when

747
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:28,759
we're working lines I like to fix traits

748
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,159
towards like you pop a pack of 10 you

749
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:33,398
have like a few to keep you know what I

750
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:34,840
mean that are in that same range but

751
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:37,439
you're just going to hone in on what you

752
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:39,398
prefer specifically you know so did you

753
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,320
did you run out sure best ones as well

754
00:30:39,398 --> 00:30:43,479
or no you haven't you haven't seen no I

755
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:45,639
haven't but um I really want to I'm just

756
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:47,839
so limited on my like personal space and

757
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:50,600
I don't think it has like a purpose for

758
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:52,839
my work um at my job you know what I

759
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:55,319
mean they don't really care about like

760
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:57,278
the lineage and uh you know what I mean

761
00:30:55,319 --> 00:31:00,918
like the mystery kind of thing that's

762
00:30:57,278 --> 00:31:03,240
more of a personal project and so

763
00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:06,120
yeah that makes sense you know like I

764
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:08,399
don't see msos really giving two shits

765
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:10,199
about lineage they just you know what's

766
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:13,000
already hyped what's marketed what can

767
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,639
we hype better things like that yeah

768
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,278
like don't get me wrong they want that

769
00:31:14,638 --> 00:31:18,038
profile and some of those traits and

770
00:31:16,278 --> 00:31:20,839
other things but it just doesn't really

771
00:31:18,038 --> 00:31:24,038
make sense in some regard to like be

772
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:26,959
like oh let's go buy seven packs of s1's

773
00:31:24,038 --> 00:31:28,440
run them find something that's like you

774
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,079
know I mean like I've already kind of

775
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,000
figured out other ways with just the

776
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:33,720
Clone to kind of get those expressions

777
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
bumped up a little higher percentage

778
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:39,120
wise and so um I actually had a little

779
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:43,079
side tangent do you know anything Matt

780
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:45,278
about the um the zprite cut no nothing

781
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:47,918
yeah that one is honestly even more

782
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:50,278
mysterious than Skittles itself in like

783
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:53,320
its whole Origins because like it just

784
00:31:50,278 --> 00:31:56,960
like appeared no one can really tell me

785
00:31:53,319 --> 00:32:00,480
anything about it the Bri yeah yeah yeah

786
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:02,558
and it's actually I think a another

787
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,519
little side tangent off that same

788
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:06,440
profile but it really does smell like

789
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:09,120
Sprite and I [ __ ] love it and I think

790
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:11,320
it has a better a better High to it and

791
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:12,959
so like I've worked with it I don't know

792
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:16,398
if it's like the real cut but it has

793
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:19,120
like you know the namesake trait yeah um

794
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:21,518
and so um that one is honestly even more

795
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:23,158
mysterious to me because it's it's cool

796
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:26,079
it's obviously related you can get some

797
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:29,080
of those zprite combos to pop up pretty

798
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:31,079
easily when you cross together and so

799
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:32,199
well if anybody in the comments uh or

800
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:35,678
that's watching this leave in the

801
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:37,798
comments if you know who the came from

802
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:41,240
or anything about it

803
00:32:37,798 --> 00:32:42,599
please also ask real quick let me let me

804
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,200
chime in on this because Caleb the one

805
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:46,000
thing that I did or inspector the one

806
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:49,919
thing I did get him to comment on right

807
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,119
here was on the the prevalence of Z chps

808
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:55,000
in the zs1 and that was I think that's

809
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:57,678
the one thing that he took um like a

810
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,880
different take on he felt like

811
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:03,559
popping a lot of these Zs ones that he

812
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:06,880
found that TP in there um a lot a lot

813
00:33:03,558 --> 00:33:08,918
but not the ex exact dead-on turp but he

814
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:12,278
said that the the scent profile was

815
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:14,840
there but in in abundance but not that

816
00:33:12,278 --> 00:33:16,519
same exact clone with that scent profile

817
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:18,199
if that Mak sense yeah well and I've

818
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:20,200
been kind of thinking about this too

819
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:22,240
because like um you know I got that

820
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:24,480
feedback you know was that a couple days

821
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,679
ago or something like that um and I've

822
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,360
been kind of thinking of it because I'm

823
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,559
just like man maybe I didn't phrase my

824
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:31,319
like question or like wording right but

825
00:33:29,558 --> 00:33:33,440
I think what it really comes down to is

826
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:35,200
that like we have very very different

827
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,200
cultivation Styles and like the work

828
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:40,120
that we're doing and he's doing those

829
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,679
like living soil organic beds you know

830
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:43,398
um which is like more what I would

831
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:46,278
personally do if I was doing this for

832
00:33:43,398 --> 00:33:48,879
myself like he is um but it couldn't be

833
00:33:46,278 --> 00:33:50,679
more opposite from what I do at work

834
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,679
yeah in our cultivation style which is

835
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:55,840
like small pot cocoa drip line direct

836
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,480
injection you know what I mean and so I

837
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:59,079
bet you he's actually getting a higher

838
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:01,120
prevalence just because he's growing

839
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:03,000
weed in a way that like that plant

840
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:06,558
probably prefers more than what I'm

841
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,320
doing you know I also noticed this too

842
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:11,239
in a similar way with the bubbleberry V2

843
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:14,039
like when I first popped you know a

844
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:17,479
handful of them I saw a lot of very

845
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:19,878
blueberry dominant smelling plants in it

846
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:21,159
but when the larger population got a

847
00:34:19,878 --> 00:34:24,239
hold of it like when I sold it and

848
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:26,559
people got packs of it I was finding out

849
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:27,559
it the the blueberry trips were the

850
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:29,639
least

851
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:31,398
comment Expressions it was really really

852
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:32,679
bubble gump dominant and it was weird

853
00:34:31,398 --> 00:34:36,118
because I felt like I had a pretty good

854
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:38,200
representation there and it just like

855
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:39,358
different rooms different styles you

856
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:41,039
know what I mean there's so much that

857
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:42,918
goes into it that really doesn't get

858
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:44,398
accounted for on variables like when

859
00:34:42,918 --> 00:34:46,319
customers ask me hey what am I going to

860
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:48,799
expect from this is it gonna you know

861
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,399
help my anxiety etc etc there's so many

862
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,800
variables involved and it's really

863
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:54,519
impossible to explain unless you give

864
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,480
good examples like these yeah yeah

865
00:34:54,519 --> 00:34:57,838
there's definitely so much difference in

866
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,599
how dir different people are going to

867
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:02,159
grow weed and so like you kind of have

868
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:04,240
to take an average of those and so like

869
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:06,440
if I even only have two data points it's

870
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:07,959
like well the the reality is probably

871
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:11,039
somewhere in between you know what I

872
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:12,880
mean like um you know maybe the way he's

873
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:14,519
doing it is literally just like perfect

874
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,440
for those expressions on this plant

875
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:17,838
whereas like a salt diet in Cocoa is

876
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:19,679
just like not really going to bring it

877
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:21,880
out because like there are other cuts

878
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:23,838
that I breed with that I get routinely

879
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:25,680
upset that I'm like well we didn't grow

880
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:28,880
it well so like how can you judge this

881
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:30,239
expression yeah you know and so I was

882
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,720
definitely kind of thinking about that

883
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:33,078
for the last few days where I'm like you

884
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:35,679
know what I think I could be really

885
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:37,880
wrong about that um based on our

886
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:40,358
cultivation style or not wrong but like

887
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:43,400
that our cultivation style is so like

888
00:35:40,358 --> 00:35:46,039
specific to production and not like like

889
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,480
best turpine expression you I think I

890
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:48,559
think the way you qualify it isn't that

891
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,039
you're saying that this is what

892
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:51,318
everybody should expect and the only way

893
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:52,960
it goes down it's just like you're

894
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:54,239
saying this is how I ran it so I don't I

895
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,400
don't think it's necessarily wrong I

896
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:59,318
just think it's a completely different

897
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:02,039
run and take that it's

898
00:35:59,318 --> 00:36:04,559
notal yeah yeah but it makes me want to

899
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:06,239
like slow down and change some things if

900
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:07,639
I could ever like do that at work you

901
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:09,039
know what I mean because I'm like I've

902
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:11,039
been like I've talked to you guys about

903
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:12,318
my frustration with OG too you know what

904
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:14,559
I mean like it doesn't like that

905
00:36:12,318 --> 00:36:16,838
cultivation environment that's like very

906
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:18,960
prevalent now and so like how can you

907
00:36:16,838 --> 00:36:20,358
really judge a breeding project if like

908
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,760
the expression you're getting is the

909
00:36:20,358 --> 00:36:24,358
worst possible one I wonder if that's

910
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:26,160
why everybody thinks OG is just gone

911
00:36:24,358 --> 00:36:27,358
despite every [ __ ] OG hybrid out

912
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:29,199
there still

913
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:30,719
oh I I think I really think it is I

914
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:33,439
think there's a lot of stuff that people

915
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:35,239
like renamed for clout like um I was

916
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,679
telling you before like the ghost OG

917
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:38,279
that's going around right now like

918
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:40,000
people have I've heard many people say

919
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,800
that it's not the same ghost that used

920
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,920
to go around of course and I'm pretty

921
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:46,680
positive that it's like a chmd OG based

922
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:48,318
on the structure and the expression and

923
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:50,960
the potency and like passing motor

924
00:36:48,318 --> 00:36:52,639
breath around yeah yeah man but like a

925
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,599
way better cut than motor breath it

926
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:57,199
actually is a really nice cut if you

927
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:58,920
guys can get your hands on it um called

928
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:00,598
just it's just called ghost now it's

929
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:03,119
just called yeah ghost OG that's what

930
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:04,960
it's been going around as um but it's

931
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,680
actually really nice man I'm I was

932
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:10,400
really pleased with it when we r in it

933
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:13,559
so that's cool total s um I wanted to

934
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,119
come back to Dan's questions for Caleb

935
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:18,000
even though I know that Caleb didn't

936
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:20,318
really get an opportunity to answer them

937
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,318
Dan I

938
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:27,318
wonder I wonder if Dan wanted to at

939
00:37:23,838 --> 00:37:28,639
least tell us about why he wanted to

940
00:37:27,318 --> 00:37:30,440
ask these question some of these

941
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:31,598
questions um in the outline I don't know

942
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,440
if you guys are looking at the outline

943
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,880
but the second page has some of Dan's

944
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:38,559
questions okay um Dan I don't know if

945
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:41,440
you just wanted to tell us about why you

946
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:42,480
thought of these or like what what you

947
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,240
what what kind of outcomes you were

948
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,318
looking for yeah well I mean that that

949
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:51,279
first one I feel like we already covered

950
00:37:47,318 --> 00:37:54,559
and that maybe the second one too

951
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,200
um your overall strategy yeah oh I mean

952
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:58,039
the main reason that I was like I've

953
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:59,799
been so so curious about this is that

954
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:02,199
like the cut does have nice traits but

955
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:04,200
when you outcross it to just like any

956
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:07,439
and everything like I kind of been doing

957
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:10,039
the last year um you don't see the

958
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,679
things that you want as much as the

959
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:14,079
things that you really don't like the

960
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:16,000
dwarfism some like slight hermaphrodism

961
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:17,680
like it's definitely not a Herm bomb

962
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,119
like um I've heard some people describe

963
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:22,879
it as but there is some hermaphrodism in

964
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:24,280
it um but like the main thing is is that

965
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,240
like I would cross it to all kinds of

966
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:29,480
stuff and I never got even a semblance

967
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:31,479
of the knows and so like that's

968
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:33,159
partially I think due to cultivation

969
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:36,358
style from like you know our previous

970
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:38,159
little anecdote but um at the same time

971
00:38:36,358 --> 00:38:40,199
it's also just that like I've heard

972
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:41,639
plenty of people say that you know that

973
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:43,719
it's just like you don't end up with

974
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:45,920
that Aroma and outcrosses which leads me

975
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:48,000
to believe that it's some like very

976
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,599
recessive combination of traits that

977
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,639
actually make

978
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:54,200
it and express the yeah or some link tra

979
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:57,318
I mean the link traits like the aroma is

980
00:38:54,199 --> 00:39:01,358
definitely tied to the dwarf is as far

981
00:38:57,318 --> 00:39:03,039
as I've seen you know um but um I I try

982
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:05,358
and stay out of like the linked trait

983
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:07,400
whole thing just because it's like

984
00:39:05,358 --> 00:39:09,400
SOC theortical

985
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:11,358
theoretical almost impossible to prove

986
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,880
at this and I mean even talking about

987
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:15,880
the aroma as like recessive it's like

988
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:18,400
well it's probably like dozens and

989
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,960
dozens if not hundreds of genes like

990
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,720
yeah that all need to be correctly

991
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:24,920
aligned in the proper way to like

992
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:27,799
Express that way but um what I've

993
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:30,920
actually oh go ahead reminds me a bit of

994
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:34,000
like uh Matt talking about Crossing two

995
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:35,760
super skunk types yes yes yes yeah yeah

996
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,559
double recesses and whatnot well and

997
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,400
that's kind of like what I'm getting to

998
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:42,119
is that like so maybe Skittles like

999
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,920
let's for Simplicity sake let's call

1000
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:46,800
that a Roma profile like a double

1001
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:49,720
recessive if it was a single trait so

1002
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,760
like the only way to like really ever

1003
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:53,519
get that expression then would be to

1004
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,000
find something else that also has a

1005
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:58,280
double recessive you know and that's

1006
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,280
kind of honestly like the success that

1007
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:03,839
I've had in like upping the um the rate

1008
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,000
of expression for that really nice Aroma

1009
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:09,400
even the ballark of it has been from

1010
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:12,480
using two children of Z that both have

1011
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:14,280
those traits um and or children quote un

1012
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,599
quote like one of them being like the Z

1013
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,720
Sprite and one of them being rainbow

1014
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:19,440
belts you know because rainbow belts do

1015
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:21,799
smell similar to Z but it's definitely

1016
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,760
not as like pungent or is nice you know

1017
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:26,640
sure it's um yeah it's just good you

1018
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:29,960
know but um I actually had to pretty

1019
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:33,039
decent rate of uh you know zerbs pop up

1020
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:35,318
and so um that just means that you have

1021
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:37,639
to like only incross it really like

1022
00:40:35,318 --> 00:40:41,000
weird types of incrosses cousin to

1023
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:44,440
cousin kind of thing to be able to ever

1024
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:47,199
um maintain that profile in a line and

1025
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:49,159
so St yeah it's it's challenging to work

1026
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:52,078
with in that regard because like you can

1027
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:54,679
only really cross it with itself to get

1028
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:56,599
those expressions out and I don't think

1029
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:58,598
that like I think other people talked

1030
00:40:56,599 --> 00:41:01,440
about like using s1's and like maybe the

1031
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:02,480
S1 will pass it better and I'm like no I

1032
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,760
really don't think it will because

1033
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,159
you're going to break it up again yeah

1034
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:08,240
let me pause you here because I think

1035
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:10,879
that's going to I think we're going to

1036
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:14,199
move straight into um possible

1037
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:17,680
directions projects Etc just to wrap up

1038
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:19,759
this kind of like your your and and even

1039
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:22,279
locals observations on the shus ones

1040
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:24,480
like um but actually wait now what am I

1041
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:28,680
saying sorry your your experience with

1042
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:30,679
Skittles s1's what do you speculate its

1043
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:32,480
lineage to be based on what you've seen

1044
00:41:30,679 --> 00:41:34,480
I know that like again don't hold down

1045
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:37,440
to any of this this is just like go what

1046
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:39,599
is it Dan well the only the only clue

1047
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,039
you get right because if you see 90%

1048
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,640
Skittles types is the sherb expression

1049
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:46,800
and so it just leads you to sherb which

1050
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:50,480
is still kind of like not really an

1051
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:52,760
answer either you know what I mean and

1052
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,240
green the green sh I tried but that's

1053
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,240
what's funny is that it look the ones

1054
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:57,919
look like

1055
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:59,799
sunset you know what I mean I didn't get

1056
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,159
it really much of anything that reminded

1057
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:05,720
me of the green sherb cut or the the key

1058
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:10,318
lime pie and structure and so um it's

1059
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:12,519
all just Skittles you know um but that's

1060
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:14,318
kind of the whole confusing part to me

1061
00:42:12,519 --> 00:42:16,759
you know it's definitely not a child of

1062
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:19,159
sunset but like it shares a common

1063
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:20,839
ancestor you know or like a shared

1064
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:23,000
lineage with the green you know like

1065
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:24,679
that's why it's so I mean we can talk in

1066
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,880
circles for hours about this kind of

1067
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:28,960
thing because like there's only enough

1068
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:32,000
info to ask questions but not enough

1069
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,639
info to ever have an answer you know Dan

1070
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,559
you're so keyed up on this dude I can

1071
00:42:33,639 --> 00:42:38,759
hear those like sharp intakes of breath

1072
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:41,760
like yeah where you're like you don't

1073
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:44,119
even end your sentences yeah yeah yeah

1074
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:46,000
local did you have anything to say even

1075
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:47,920
just based on your like distant

1076
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,280
experience with this just on like

1077
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:53,960
speculation like got you

1078
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:56,440
know I mean there's some kind of

1079
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:59,480
relation like obviously between like

1080
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:04,559
Sher and Skittle of some

1081
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:07,960
sort um yeah based on what I saw I mean

1082
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:10,839
some cookie look alike I mean maybe that

1083
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,838
would be some kind

1084
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:18,000
of thought on what it could

1085
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:21,239
be not it's like 100% but you know maybe

1086
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,679
that's something in there but yeah I

1087
00:43:21,239 --> 00:43:25,199
really don't know what it is well I

1088
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:27,239
think there's another like conflating

1089
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:28,719
part that makes it equally confusing is

1090
00:43:27,239 --> 00:43:30,799
that like the only difference between

1091
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:33,558
sherb and cookies is the supposed

1092
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,359
outcross right of pink panties well what

1093
00:43:33,559 --> 00:43:39,040
the [ __ ] is pink

1094
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:41,239
panties you know that was yeah yeah I

1095
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:43,719
had experience with it in running it

1096
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:45,279
it's kind of a [ __ ] plant but um and a

1097
00:43:43,719 --> 00:43:47,279
[ __ ] breeder at that too I mean it's

1098
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:50,559
better than it's a better breeder than

1099
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:53,280
it is a grower but actually looking at

1100
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:55,359
F1 derb I would be quicker to think pink

1101
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,640
panties is related to F1 derb based on a

1102
00:43:55,358 --> 00:43:59,358
lot of the same um traits it has a lot

1103
00:43:57,639 --> 00:44:03,838
of the same stem traits and stuff and

1104
00:43:59,358 --> 00:44:05,159
and the way it sets the plan up um yeah

1105
00:44:03,838 --> 00:44:07,799
but like I've looked it up it's supposed

1106
00:44:05,159 --> 00:44:10,440
to be like what Burmese or Burmese Kush

1107
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,920
maybe cross to [ __ ] I forgot what the

1108
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:14,240
other part of it was but none of it made

1109
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:16,760
any sense to me um yeah I think they say

1110
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:18,519
like burmes to OG yeah something like

1111
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:20,800
that something stupid it's not and

1112
00:44:18,519 --> 00:44:22,280
there's no possible way yeah it's not

1113
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,000
it's not a good cut bro it doesn't have

1114
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:26,119
the same scent profile does not have the

1115
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:30,000
same tur profile whatsoever not even

1116
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:31,920
close kind of fruity not not all it did

1117
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,358
was kind of beef up the sherb whatever

1118
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,400
it was yeah it's it's I wouldn't go with

1119
00:44:34,358 --> 00:44:38,039
pink panties I really really wouldn't

1120
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,720
and and I know Sher sherb says that's

1121
00:44:38,039 --> 00:44:43,199
what's in it and you know he seems like

1122
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:45,519
a nice guy but I I after growing that

1123
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:47,759
cut I just am very hard pressed to see

1124
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:50,280
that um oh by the way rainbow belts it

1125
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:53,960
looks like it's a a skittles cross to

1126
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:56,319
moonbow number 75 so it's like a g bx1 I

1127
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:57,519
think that Fletch did okay yeah that

1128
00:44:56,318 --> 00:45:00,000
makes sense you

1129
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:02,639
go yeah which actually may get you

1130
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,679
farther away from what you want than you

1131
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:06,440
know what I mean yeah um the other thing

1132
00:45:04,679 --> 00:45:08,759
is like we aren't going to go too much

1133
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:11,480
into history but when I think about the

1134
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:14,079
people working with that cut and the

1135
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:17,519
history basically that it came from some

1136
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:19,160
dude's girlfriend's dad in a tray blah

1137
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:21,800
blah blah was labeled

1138
00:45:19,159 --> 00:45:23,039
cookies um and I think about what the

1139
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:24,400
third gen dudes were growing they were

1140
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:26,920
growing a lot of Sweet Tooth in

1141
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:29,200
something called Adonai and and uh

1142
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:31,599
Russian Kush there were a few other

1143
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:33,558
things that were Staples in their crew

1144
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:35,559
and when I think about sweet pink grap

1145
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:37,280
grapefruit and I think about like sweet

1146
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:40,720
tooth and stuff like that I'm like hm I

1147
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:43,359
wonder but it came to them supposedly by

1148
00:45:40,719 --> 00:45:46,000
the story ready so maybe that's just

1149
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:48,279
like a a red herring but yeah I just

1150
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,119
don't know it's really hard that is a

1151
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:52,160
very confabulated T it's gotten much

1152
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:56,280
worse since third gen Dying Breed and

1153
00:45:52,159 --> 00:45:58,480
the the other dudes um broke up and stop

1154
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:00,160
being frenzies it's gotten even worse on

1155
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,838
the on what they say things are and who

1156
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:04,639
did what where it came from less

1157
00:46:02,838 --> 00:46:07,279
consistent I should say so you don't

1158
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:09,719
subscribe to The Grape Ape grapefruit

1159
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:11,359
crop you know it's funny like I I say

1160
00:46:09,719 --> 00:46:13,838
grapefruit but like it's not like

1161
00:46:11,358 --> 00:46:16,358
obviously that's not graping it's there

1162
00:46:13,838 --> 00:46:19,159
though I I remember tasting some early

1163
00:46:16,358 --> 00:46:21,880
extracts like some BHO of Skittles and

1164
00:46:19,159 --> 00:46:23,318
it was like pure grapefruit it's very

1165
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:26,880
grapefruit and that's where like a lot

1166
00:46:23,318 --> 00:46:29,279
of my Z stuff is extracts I that I smoke

1167
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,920
and it's like this is [ __ ] grapefruit

1168
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,599
this is sweet pink grapefruit like I

1169
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:35,280
know what this is and um but I don't

1170
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:37,119
know that that's why you know I don't

1171
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,720
know if the the cuts in it and I I

1172
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:40,559
basically I I really doubt it because

1173
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:43,799
sweet pink grapefruit was a robust big

1174
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:46,160
huge healthy plant but um yeah whatever

1175
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:48,240
like the process was to make Skittles I

1176
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:51,199
think it involved a lot of inbreeding

1177
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:52,959
and s1's and not on purpose yeah exactly

1178
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:55,759
like most [ __ ] right like just a lot of

1179
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:58,599
accidents and re relabels and renames of

1180
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:00,640
clones and trays and just [ __ ] like that

1181
00:46:58,599 --> 00:47:03,200
yeah someone got super lucky on that

1182
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:05,358
like one in a thousand one in 10,000 bag

1183
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:07,598
seed you know

1184
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:09,400
like otherwise I think we would see

1185
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:12,640
sisters to it you know what I mean like

1186
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:14,280
if it wasn't so obscure and rare and

1187
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:16,000
recessive I think that you would see

1188
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:17,800
sisters because if you get a bag of bag

1189
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,960
seeds or like the way I keep bag seeds

1190
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:22,039
you know what I mean it's like I got

1191
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:24,159
like you know like ideally like 20 30 of

1192
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:28,119
them if it was really seated yeah you

1193
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:30,399
know so yeah I have to agree on that but

1194
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:32,358
trying to find out even guess what could

1195
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,800
be in Skittles other than like there's

1196
00:47:32,358 --> 00:47:36,679
cookie type Sher types yeah like the

1197
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:39,480
other Factor would be really really

1198
00:47:36,679 --> 00:47:41,078
shooting in the dark I think yeah that's

1199
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:43,400
why I want to eventually go back to the

1200
00:47:41,079 --> 00:47:44,559
green shb s ones and like actually run

1201
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:47,119
through those it's just like I don't

1202
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:48,720
have the like capability of doing it at

1203
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,760
the scale that I would want to like I

1204
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:52,639
want to do like

1205
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:54,400
120 you know I'm glad we're here because

1206
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:58,838
this is where I think we pivot towards

1207
00:47:54,400 --> 00:48:00,880
looking at it its potential um but

1208
00:47:58,838 --> 00:48:02,239
before we do that I guess it's like so

1209
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:05,039
the question is like what is the future

1210
00:48:02,239 --> 00:48:08,118
of Z before that I want to ask like who

1211
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:12,920
cares do we care do you care does Matt

1212
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:16,559
care um how far can it be taken um

1213
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:19,039
and okay Matt so Matt I doesn't seem

1214
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:21,480
super enthusiastic about its future why

1215
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:23,239
is that Matt um just the future of the

1216
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,639
Clone in general even talking to Dan

1217
00:48:23,239 --> 00:48:26,318
like the fact that they're having to do

1218
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:28,558
all these go to all these Mees to keep

1219
00:48:26,318 --> 00:48:30,358
it alive to be able to reproduce like I

1220
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:32,040
can see it being kept alive in other

1221
00:48:30,358 --> 00:48:33,400
lines but as far as that clone goes I

1222
00:48:32,039 --> 00:48:35,519
think that there is going to be a day

1223
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:38,519
where that clone is gone because of how

1224
00:48:35,519 --> 00:48:39,800
um sickly it is not necessarily with hlv

1225
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:42,679
but I mean just like its natural

1226
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:44,440
structure is very not not good it's been

1227
00:48:42,679 --> 00:48:46,919
in a lot of shitty rooms before it made

1228
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:49,280
it up to a bunch of us and it's just not

1229
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:51,400
Hardy I don't see it living as far as

1230
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:53,040
like it's not widely held either yeah

1231
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,240
exactly like people couldn't keep it

1232
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:55,719
they couldn't root it they couldn't you

1233
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:59,639
know what I mean that's why I don't have

1234
00:48:55,719 --> 00:49:03,439
it I couldn't keep rooting it um yeah I

1235
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:05,679
just I I don't know like I think because

1236
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,880
it's an inbred type plant but it's

1237
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:09,598
recessive I don't know what kind of

1238
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,838
future it would even have in breeding I

1239
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:12,400
mean people are going to keep doing it

1240
00:49:10,838 --> 00:49:14,440
whether it should be done or not or

1241
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,358
whether it's making better [ __ ] because

1242
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:17,880
the Market's determined by names and it

1243
00:49:16,358 --> 00:49:20,239
doesn't really matter how good it is as

1244
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:22,519
long as it's hyped so in this kind of

1245
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:24,239
Market maybe it'll last forever in

1246
00:49:22,519 --> 00:49:27,039
hybrids who knows because i' I've

1247
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:28,919
actually heard from Dan his excitement

1248
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:32,159
um that he just kind of cares about

1249
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:33,760
solving the mystery if I'm not mistaken

1250
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:37,358
Dan you don't actually I don't even like

1251
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:39,359
it that much yeah yeah yeah I think it's

1252
00:49:37,358 --> 00:49:41,838
flavorful but I think it's a really

1253
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:43,960
shitty breeding tool unless you want

1254
00:49:41,838 --> 00:49:47,039
resin traits that come with a ton of

1255
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:50,159
baggage so like me sour essentially like

1256
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:53,000
I I don't I don't love sour better than

1257
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:55,879
anything else but the mystery of of it

1258
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,199
has held me for so godamn long that I'm

1259
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:59,000
not going to drop it until I figure it

1260
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:00,960
out for sure yeah it's it's like the

1261
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,639
whole like murder mystery kind of thing

1262
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,798
like I'm not really into that stuff but

1263
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:06,558
I can get hooked on it if I get that

1264
00:50:04,798 --> 00:50:07,280
introduction of the story you know what

1265
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:10,079
I

1266
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:11,200
mean murder mystery game yeah like what

1267
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:13,200
happens you know what I mean I got to

1268
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:14,838
know what what happens you know and so

1269
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:16,759
like I've just been around it a lot and

1270
00:50:14,838 --> 00:50:18,679
had like experiences but like I don't

1271
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:20,319
personally like it that much and I hate

1272
00:50:18,679 --> 00:50:22,838
working with it because it never does

1273
00:50:20,318 --> 00:50:24,400
what you want it to yeah um but like

1274
00:50:22,838 --> 00:50:27,239
going back to that whole like

1275
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:29,720
theoretical like recessive thing you can

1276
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:33,000
actually have a recessive trait like

1277
00:50:29,719 --> 00:50:36,239
that that's in like dominant and a or

1278
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:39,079
dominant prevalent in a population but

1279
00:50:36,239 --> 00:50:41,318
everyone has to have it you know what I

1280
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:43,200
mean because like over Generations if

1281
00:50:41,318 --> 00:50:45,558
like there's even like a handful of

1282
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:47,719
individuals that don't those are going

1283
00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:49,599
to be dominant over the recessives and

1284
00:50:47,719 --> 00:50:52,439
eventually take over at like a

1285
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:54,640
population scale over time you know and

1286
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:56,798
so like I think it's kind of a doomed

1287
00:50:54,639 --> 00:50:58,279
tool be because of that you know what I

1288
00:50:56,798 --> 00:51:00,960
mean like there will I think it'll be

1289
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:03,079
around and like people will hold cuts of

1290
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:05,519
different crosses or like s1's or

1291
00:51:03,079 --> 00:51:08,039
whatever because like it is really tasty

1292
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:09,880
and it makes delicious extracts but like

1293
00:51:08,039 --> 00:51:12,519
as a breeding tool I think it's like

1294
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:14,318
next to useless honestly unless you love

1295
00:51:12,519 --> 00:51:16,798
breeding for resin

1296
00:51:14,318 --> 00:51:18,759
traits I want to Pivot to local here

1297
00:51:16,798 --> 00:51:21,480
because I know local is looking at some

1298
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:22,839
shest ones as he mentioned and maybe I'd

1299
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:25,079
like to hear from him like what he

1300
00:51:22,838 --> 00:51:27,798
thinks might be possible or what maybe

1301
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:29,720
first what is he looking for in the s1s

1302
00:51:27,798 --> 00:51:31,079
and then if he does find that thing you

1303
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:32,798
know what what does he think he could do

1304
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:36,000
with it

1305
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:38,119
later um honestly bro I'm kind of just

1306
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:42,639
looking for some

1307
00:51:38,119 --> 00:51:44,960
zah that's really it um yeah I mean I

1308
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:48,000
say Z like I need some cultural context

1309
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:49,880
like what oh um

1310
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,639
like you

1311
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:56,480
know it's like tasty flavorful exactly

1312
00:51:53,639 --> 00:51:57,759
yeah that people would eat up right

1313
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,559
yeah because even though it's low

1314
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:03,200
potency people [ __ ] love it like low

1315
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:04,599
potency isn't always bad you know but

1316
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:07,798
what else local like is there something

1317
00:52:04,599 --> 00:52:13,119
that you want to do with it as well um I

1318
00:52:07,798 --> 00:52:15,199
don't know um I don't think I like it's

1319
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:17,559
really nice like the flavor and

1320
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:19,960
everything but I don't know if it would

1321
00:52:17,559 --> 00:52:21,680
make anything particularly worthwhile in

1322
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:24,280
my collection like it's not something

1323
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:27,798
that I would go back to and like dig

1324
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:29,319
through extensively again or no but

1325
00:52:27,798 --> 00:52:32,358
you've talked to me about like having

1326
00:52:29,318 --> 00:52:36,960
some ideas for potential

1327
00:52:32,358 --> 00:52:40,598
outcrosses oh um yeah I mean I don't

1328
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:43,119
know if I'd ever get to them um but I

1329
00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:47,039
mean there's some really nice U mango

1330
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:49,318
gummy bear tasting eie appy uh plants uh

1331
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:51,558
that could be like maybe a cool outcross

1332
00:52:49,318 --> 00:52:54,639
your sheret like thing I don't know

1333
00:52:51,559 --> 00:52:57,599
increase the legs a bit um keep like

1334
00:52:54,639 --> 00:53:00,598
those candy notes in like intact

1335
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:03,240
possibly I mean I really wouldn't know

1336
00:53:00,599 --> 00:53:07,280
how to pan out fun enough I'm pretty

1337
00:53:03,239 --> 00:53:08,959
sure Matt might have mentioned something

1338
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,920
like this in that I don't know one of

1339
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:13,838
the weird cookies episodes that we did

1340
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:15,798
about like how you would try to

1341
00:53:13,838 --> 00:53:19,078
Counterpoint cookies with something and

1342
00:53:15,798 --> 00:53:22,639
I think we did mention appy as like a oh

1343
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:24,640
probably yeah like hearing um that would

1344
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:26,519
be interesting yeah I guess just from

1345
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:28,838
the point of view like oh sorry you got

1346
00:53:26,519 --> 00:53:31,239
M yeah no just I remember trying to

1347
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:33,920
think about it it was like um trying to

1348
00:53:31,239 --> 00:53:36,399
add speed a better high and all kinds of

1349
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,760
stuff my first idea was like c99 and I

1350
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,798
was like wait a minute I have something

1351
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:42,599
way better than c99 that accomplishes

1352
00:53:39,798 --> 00:53:46,079
all that and is way more dank and way

1353
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:48,240
more pungent that's appy so yeah

1354
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:50,519
definitely yeah yeah because I guess for

1355
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:51,919
me this this section is interesting like

1356
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:54,440
more or less all of you have said that

1357
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,200
you don't get that much about his future

1358
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:58,880
which is funny so I'm trying to force

1359
00:53:56,199 --> 00:54:00,519
you to pretend that you do uh so that we

1360
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:02,920
can have can kind of like tease out some

1361
00:54:00,519 --> 00:54:06,559
like possible hypothetical directions

1362
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:09,599
maybe can pass it to Dan now Dan I like

1363
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:11,798
the I like the appy idea but the problem

1364
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:15,798
is is I think it would take a minimum of

1365
00:54:11,798 --> 00:54:17,559
two steps oh easy yeah like guaranteed a

1366
00:54:15,798 --> 00:54:19,599
minimum of two steps where it's like

1367
00:54:17,559 --> 00:54:21,798
you'll have to make the cross and the

1368
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:24,920
harder part will be like well how do I

1369
00:54:21,798 --> 00:54:27,079
find the plants that to double up on to

1370
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:29,240
get the expression and the aroma that I

1371
00:54:27,079 --> 00:54:30,760
want out of it you know you're kind of

1372
00:54:29,239 --> 00:54:32,879
just picking at random we don't really

1373
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:36,319
have that type of genetic phenotyping

1374
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:38,039
yet and so um it'll take a lot of trial

1375
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:40,440
and error I think but I think it could

1376
00:54:38,039 --> 00:54:41,199
potentially be really awesome you know I

1377
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:44,599
went

1378
00:54:41,199 --> 00:54:47,199
with yeah I like that angle I I think

1379
00:54:44,599 --> 00:54:49,200
blueberry Z would be [ __ ] awesome I

1380
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:53,439
think I had a what was it the blue

1381
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:55,679
Skittles clone yeah um and I I I never

1382
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:59,240
really knew what that was cuz like the

1383
00:54:55,679 --> 00:55:02,239
Dying Breed one was blue Domina Skittles

1384
00:54:59,239 --> 00:55:05,399
or whatever but like the one that I saw

1385
00:55:02,239 --> 00:55:07,558
was kind of like a squirt grapefruit

1386
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:09,838
like super nice easy to grow you know

1387
00:55:07,559 --> 00:55:12,319
what I mean like I've never actually I

1388
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:15,000
wish I still had that clone because it

1389
00:55:12,318 --> 00:55:16,960
was if it was what it says it was like

1390
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,239
lineage wise it was actually like a

1391
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,358
really nice expression what was it

1392
00:55:19,239 --> 00:55:22,279
supposed to be lineage wise do you

1393
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:24,679
remember well that's what I don't know

1394
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:26,480
is like I just got it as blue Skittles

1395
00:55:24,679 --> 00:55:28,399
but like it could either be the one that

1396
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:30,318
you made or the one that Dying Breed

1397
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:33,240
made I'm sure it's the one they made cuz

1398
00:55:30,318 --> 00:55:35,679
I me mine came way later than gotcha

1399
00:55:33,239 --> 00:55:37,439
yeah yeah yeah and I didn't I didn't

1400
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:40,480
come across that honestly though until

1401
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:42,519
about like 2019 2020 that sounds a about

1402
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:45,280
when it showed up I'm pretty sure that's

1403
00:55:42,519 --> 00:55:46,838
when it got real popular I remember 2018

1404
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:49,200
Emerald cup a lot of people were smoking

1405
00:55:46,838 --> 00:55:50,759
on blue Skittles there and I really and

1406
00:55:49,199 --> 00:55:53,960
thinking this is not fairy this is not

1407
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:55,760
blue what the [ __ ] are they doing but uh

1408
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:58,400
yeah no I think uh space B Invader kept

1409
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:59,960
clones of the the main blue blue Z pop

1410
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:01,760
that we did from our stuff I think he

1411
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:03,679
kept it CL yeah there was some good

1412
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:06,480
breeding clones in there too that was

1413
00:56:03,679 --> 00:56:08,639
still not pure Z but in the outcross

1414
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:11,639
with the Mac one there is one that looks

1415
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:15,400
like blue bonnet with Mac with Z turs so

1416
00:56:11,639 --> 00:56:16,798
that does exist it's just crapshoot yeah

1417
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:18,680
that's kind of where I'm at with like my

1418
00:56:16,798 --> 00:56:20,280
work with it too is like trying to push

1419
00:56:18,679 --> 00:56:23,078
those boundaries of like well what's

1420
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:25,599
closely related enough to like get the

1421
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:29,280
right expression but like not just gonna

1422
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:31,119
be boring and Z only you know and trying

1423
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:33,960
to get away from those morphological

1424
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:36,400
traits you know yeah um and I've had

1425
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:39,960
some mild success but you know they're

1426
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:41,798
uh um you know it's you I still have

1427
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:43,000
never come across a Dead Ringer it's

1428
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:45,639
always just

1429
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:48,199
ballpark yeah and the zcube stuff too

1430
00:56:45,639 --> 00:56:49,000
like I said it was very unpredictable it

1431
00:56:48,199 --> 00:56:51,719
was

1432
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:53,400
wildly not predictably Skittles like you

1433
00:56:51,719 --> 00:56:55,439
could find him in there but you'd be

1434
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:59,760
finding a lot more other stuff in there

1435
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:01,240
like I know um when when Dying Breed and

1436
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,640
whatever they called them Platinum

1437
00:57:01,239 --> 00:57:06,719
Skittles I think they called it at the

1438
00:57:02,639 --> 00:57:09,519
time broke up um they one of them had a

1439
00:57:06,719 --> 00:57:11,558
Z3 which was the Platinum Skittles guys

1440
00:57:09,519 --> 00:57:13,000
phony meno and those dudes and uh there

1441
00:57:11,559 --> 00:57:15,519
was a

1442
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,920
uh like zcb so I'm not sure that those

1443
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:18,480
were any different they said that they

1444
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:20,639
were after they broke up they're like

1445
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,838
ours Hindu Kush ours was with this but I

1446
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:26,118
saw a lot of Hindu Kush what I what I

1447
00:57:22,838 --> 00:57:30,279
recognizeed Hindu Kush stuff inside of

1448
00:57:26,119 --> 00:57:33,160
the um zq so I don't know which is which

1449
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:36,200
I've had some later iterations of uh um

1450
00:57:33,159 --> 00:57:37,239
bx2 of Skittles um I won't name who

1451
00:57:36,199 --> 00:57:40,519
they're from because I'm about to talk

1452
00:57:37,239 --> 00:57:43,199
some mad [ __ ] but they were [ __ ]

1453
00:57:40,519 --> 00:57:45,079
terrible like some of the wor like like

1454
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:47,159
imagine if you had the shittiest all the

1455
00:57:45,079 --> 00:57:49,720
shittiest traits fixed perfectly in a

1456
00:57:47,159 --> 00:57:51,519
population so they were all dwarf they

1457
00:57:49,719 --> 00:57:53,639
they were resin lless somehow so they

1458
00:57:51,519 --> 00:57:56,880
lost the good resin trait and they were

1459
00:57:53,639 --> 00:57:59,480
all cardboard yes and like I ran a lot

1460
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:02,599
of them and I was like what the [ __ ] is

1461
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:04,079
this trash how is this group so popular

1462
00:58:02,599 --> 00:58:05,960
yeah doesn't surprise me so all you have

1463
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:08,798
to do is go type in who made Skittles

1464
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:08,798
bx2 you'll figure it

1465
00:58:09,358 --> 00:58:14,719
out

1466
00:58:11,639 --> 00:58:17,038
yeah well you're welcome we may well

1467
00:58:14,719 --> 00:58:18,838
have a shorter episode today uh we're

1468
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:20,720
kind of like come to the end of like at

1469
00:58:18,838 --> 00:58:24,400
least the structured questions that I

1470
00:58:20,719 --> 00:58:26,318
had for us um so we can talk about

1471
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:29,318
whatever really at this point um if we

1472
00:58:26,318 --> 00:58:32,038
wanted to start wrapping up

1473
00:58:29,318 --> 00:58:34,719
um any you know any kind of final

1474
00:58:32,039 --> 00:58:36,280
questions or thoughts from everyone um I

1475
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:38,038
knew that we wouldn't get to you know I

1476
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:40,960
knew that two hours is quite long for

1477
00:58:38,039 --> 00:58:43,280
Skittles show sure yeah yeah there's

1478
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:47,199
only so much to say you know right that

1479
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:49,680
it's like um the plant is cool but it

1480
00:58:47,199 --> 00:58:51,639
also sucks you know what I mean and so I

1481
00:58:49,679 --> 00:58:53,759
mean I'll be honest with you in many

1482
00:58:51,639 --> 00:58:56,078
ways the plant was really just a foil

1483
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:57,599
for us to talk about looking at traits

1484
00:58:56,079 --> 00:59:00,079
and what you learn from looking at

1485
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:01,880
traits like that's really I think what I

1486
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:04,519
care about more than

1487
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:05,838
anything yeah yeah no honestly that's

1488
00:59:04,519 --> 00:59:07,239
kind of where I'm at too is like I've

1489
00:59:05,838 --> 00:59:10,000
been really getting into like

1490
00:59:07,239 --> 00:59:11,759
visualization of data and like looking

1491
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,599
at the inheritance rates of these things

1492
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:15,720
and like trying to quantify it and make

1493
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:18,000
like visual aids to like assist my own

1494
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:19,519
work with it and so it's been really fun

1495
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,159
because it's been a challenge you know

1496
00:59:19,519 --> 00:59:23,239
what I mean and which is forcing me

1497
00:59:21,159 --> 00:59:25,279
outside of the box of where I would

1498
00:59:23,239 --> 00:59:26,919
normally hang out like I was never

1499
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:28,480
really a data guy I was always like

1500
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:31,440
breeding and selecting plants on

1501
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:33,079
Instinct and my little handwritten notes

1502
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:35,720
like it's given me an opportunity to

1503
00:59:33,079 --> 00:59:37,960
like really expand the toolbox to more

1504
00:59:35,719 --> 00:59:37,959
like

1505
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:42,480
analytics yeah that's cool you know me

1506
00:59:41,079 --> 00:59:44,798
and local have been talking a lot about

1507
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:47,639
traits lately privately U mostly

1508
00:59:44,798 --> 00:59:50,519
revolving around Super Skunk um the

1509
00:59:47,639 --> 00:59:52,639
different looks of it um you know I talk

1510
00:59:50,519 --> 00:59:54,038
a lot about like privately not even

1511
00:59:52,639 --> 00:59:57,038
privately like on the server about the

1512
00:59:54,039 --> 00:59:58,799
dog tongue traits inside of Super Skunk

1513
00:59:57,039 --> 01:00:01,039
um and and I've given examples of it I

1514
00:59:58,798 --> 01:00:02,838
think there's probably examples of it in

1515
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:05,720
another episode even is that like a

1516
01:00:02,838 --> 01:00:07,759
single bladed Leaf yeah the little it's

1517
01:00:05,719 --> 01:00:09,358
like a little leaf that looks like a

1518
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:11,480
little dog Stone but it's Absol it's

1519
01:00:09,358 --> 01:00:12,679
rounded and that's a very specific point

1520
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:14,159
to it because there's a lot of stuff

1521
01:00:12,679 --> 01:00:16,598
that has those little pointy leaves you

1522
01:00:14,159 --> 01:00:19,480
know um yeah yeah but no I that's what I

1523
01:00:16,599 --> 01:00:21,720
look for in like as a sour trait exactly

1524
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:26,679
and that's and it's in jel it's in it's

1525
01:00:21,719 --> 01:00:28,558
in p91 it's in uh clock Orange it's in

1526
01:00:26,679 --> 01:00:30,919
it's it what I've come to realize over

1527
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:32,839
all this just by observing not just that

1528
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:34,079
trait there's other traits inside of

1529
01:00:32,838 --> 01:00:35,440
Super Skunk that I don't really talk

1530
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:37,880
about much that I've talked about to

1531
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:40,838
local um that I kind of keep back

1532
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:43,079
because I I don't like other people

1533
01:00:40,838 --> 01:00:45,440
using those traits against the plant if

1534
01:00:43,079 --> 01:00:47,640
that makes sense yeah you'll see it on a

1535
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:49,480
strainly listing tomorrow exactly

1536
01:00:47,639 --> 01:00:52,239
exactly like look it has this tra and it

1537
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:54,559
won't and then I'll be pissed so um but

1538
01:00:52,239 --> 01:00:56,038
the one thing I've learned is I think

1539
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:58,839
just because of looking at traits and

1540
01:00:56,039 --> 01:00:59,920
nothing but traits I do think that and

1541
01:00:58,838 --> 01:01:01,318
and this goes along with what Neville

1542
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:03,960
said one of his highest selling seeds

1543
01:01:01,318 --> 01:01:05,719
ever was super skunk and it looks like

1544
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:08,039
super skunk proliferated in the early

1545
01:01:05,719 --> 01:01:10,279
90s throughout the United States and a

1546
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:12,440
lot of different groups picked it up ran

1547
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:14,720
with it found their specific cut and it

1548
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:16,679
became like a local Legend in a lot of

1549
01:01:14,719 --> 01:01:18,719
different places uh under different

1550
01:01:16,679 --> 01:01:21,118
names and a lot of the the history on

1551
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:23,480
it's gone like the history on p91 is

1552
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:25,880
just so obscure but the one thing you

1553
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:27,798
can follow is trait and traits just

1554
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:31,838
don't lie they really don't I mean there

1555
01:01:27,798 --> 01:01:33,798
can be times where like um maybe a trait

1556
01:01:31,838 --> 01:01:35,239
isn't just standard to one line you know

1557
01:01:33,798 --> 01:01:36,960
what I mean and that can pop up and be

1558
01:01:35,239 --> 01:01:39,078
like oh [ __ ] well that means nothing to

1559
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:40,838
me then it's just another data point um

1560
01:01:39,079 --> 01:01:42,359
I guess I was wrong but in this one I

1561
01:01:40,838 --> 01:01:43,920
haven't really seen that specific trait

1562
01:01:42,358 --> 01:01:45,880
and it's not just the dog tongue it's

1563
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:49,159
how it's the pattern of that's laid out

1564
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:51,200
on the bud um specifically that that

1565
01:01:49,159 --> 01:01:54,519
denotes the super skunk trait for that

1566
01:01:51,199 --> 01:01:57,000
one uh yeah so like following traits to

1567
01:01:54,519 --> 01:01:58,798
me I'm slowly learning over time traits

1568
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,760
can be a lot more honest than trying to

1569
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:03,079
untie people's stories and go back talk

1570
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:04,799
to these people get inconsistencies talk

1571
01:02:03,079 --> 01:02:06,720
to them three years later get more

1572
01:02:04,798 --> 01:02:09,199
inconsistencies that just leads to you

1573
01:02:06,719 --> 01:02:10,919
spinning your head but really really

1574
01:02:09,199 --> 01:02:12,480
understanding traits and breeding traits

1575
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:14,639
can take you so much further when you're

1576
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:17,519
trying to figure out what stuff is in my

1577
01:02:14,639 --> 01:02:20,400
opinion

1578
01:02:17,519 --> 01:02:22,679
yeah does that dog tongue trait appear

1579
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:25,680
in the like the original sensey Super

1580
01:02:22,679 --> 01:02:28,318
Skunk yeah yep in the original picture

1581
01:02:25,679 --> 01:02:31,239
of ciny super skunk you can see it

1582
01:02:28,318 --> 01:02:33,480
gotcha sorry D yeah I was just gonna say

1583
01:02:31,239 --> 01:02:35,639
I had this thought earlier is that um

1584
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:37,240
when you're a newer grower it's like

1585
01:02:35,639 --> 01:02:39,199
pretty easy to like look at the

1586
01:02:37,239 --> 01:02:41,959
landscape of like what's available for

1587
01:02:39,199 --> 01:02:43,480
purchase or like collecting and think

1588
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:46,559
that there's this like infinite

1589
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:48,358
diversity within the gene pool and like

1590
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:50,599
what my experience over the last you

1591
01:02:48,358 --> 01:02:54,078
know like 10 11 years has told me is

1592
01:02:50,599 --> 01:02:55,838
that like honestly there's really not

1593
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:58,400
you know there's a lot of stories but

1594
01:02:55,838 --> 01:03:01,119
there's not that many traits and so like

1595
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:03,318
I recently saw like an argument on IG

1596
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:05,640
about like Lemon Cherry gato you know

1597
01:03:03,318 --> 01:03:07,920
what I mean not like the most desirable

1598
01:03:05,639 --> 01:03:09,838
plant by any stretch in my opinion um

1599
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:13,278
but I did S1 it and I've run through a

1600
01:03:09,838 --> 01:03:15,838
bunch of hybrids of it and um one thing

1601
01:03:13,278 --> 01:03:16,719
that popped up at a really low rate was

1602
01:03:15,838 --> 01:03:20,719
lemon

1603
01:03:16,719 --> 01:03:23,278
tree the exact like not dead on but like

1604
01:03:20,719 --> 01:03:26,598
the mouth coat

1605
01:03:23,278 --> 01:03:28,480
yeah the basement version the the the

1606
01:03:26,599 --> 01:03:30,798
Stanky version you know what I mean like

1607
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:34,278
a must musty version of [ __ ] lemon

1608
01:03:30,798 --> 01:03:37,159
tree and so like to me I don't give a

1609
01:03:34,278 --> 01:03:39,318
[ __ ] about what any of those dudes on IG

1610
01:03:37,159 --> 01:03:42,759
were talking about it being an a renamed

1611
01:03:39,318 --> 01:03:44,759
assai like gato 47 or like you know

1612
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:46,960
being a renamed runs all that and I'm

1613
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:50,119
just like bro like it's got lemon tree

1614
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:52,039
traits in it yeah like it's not a really

1615
01:03:50,119 --> 01:03:53,640
high prevalence but like it's it's in

1616
01:03:52,039 --> 01:03:56,039
there you know what I mean and like it

1617
01:03:53,639 --> 01:03:57,920
didn't come from out of the blue you

1618
01:03:56,039 --> 01:04:00,599
know these combinations of traits that

1619
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:04,200
give you that expression like they're

1620
01:04:00,599 --> 01:04:06,000
less common than you would imagine being

1621
01:04:04,199 --> 01:04:07,798
a newer grower you know what I mean like

1622
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,358
if you smell lemon tree the chances that

1623
01:04:07,798 --> 01:04:11,318
there's Lemon Tree in it regardless of

1624
01:04:09,358 --> 01:04:13,920
what anyone says like it's probably in

1625
01:04:11,318 --> 01:04:16,558
there man and for me I smell lemon tree

1626
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:18,639
and I smell lemon G like that it's like

1627
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:22,079
a hard burnt rubber lemon peel that's

1628
01:04:18,639 --> 01:04:23,719
just offensively lemon yeah it totally

1629
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:26,079
just yeah that that reminds me of that

1630
01:04:23,719 --> 01:04:28,399
one so much

1631
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:31,278
yeah now that's a whole another clone

1632
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:33,519
that's actually taken my interest in uh

1633
01:04:31,278 --> 01:04:35,239
the last year or two is that um I've had

1634
01:04:33,519 --> 01:04:37,838
lemon tree under like four different

1635
01:04:35,239 --> 01:04:41,038
names yeah but it was all the same exact

1636
01:04:37,838 --> 01:04:43,119
plant lemonade and all that lemonade

1637
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:47,880
lemon are people associated with that

1638
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:50,440
one I don't know yeah so um yeah there

1639
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:53,720
are people associated with lemon tree

1640
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:55,358
one of them is a complet lunatic like

1641
01:04:53,719 --> 01:04:57,078
anti Semite so and he's the one that

1642
01:04:55,358 --> 01:04:58,318
likes to talk about it the most so it's

1643
01:04:57,079 --> 01:05:00,680
really hard to get the actual back

1644
01:04:58,318 --> 01:05:03,400
history and know if it's correct but in

1645
01:05:00,679 --> 01:05:06,960
the end none of them know what it is at

1646
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:09,798
all or have any clue so

1647
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:12,639
yeah yeah but I've got lemonade and

1648
01:05:09,798 --> 01:05:16,440
lemon tree myself yeah I've got lemonade

1649
01:05:12,639 --> 01:05:19,838
lemon tree organ lemons and um God it

1650
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:22,838
was like a Le play on Lemon Tree

1651
01:05:19,838 --> 01:05:24,719
um uh like maybe it was just lemon trees

1652
01:05:22,838 --> 01:05:26,880
with Z or something I can't

1653
01:05:24,719 --> 01:05:29,199
the top of my head it's all been the

1654
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:32,880
exact same PL yeah

1655
01:05:29,199 --> 01:05:34,278
yeah um but honestly I try and stay away

1656
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:36,079
from that stuff because it is like

1657
01:05:34,278 --> 01:05:38,838
really dominant you kind of get the same

1658
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:41,119
thing dominant yes the same thing over

1659
01:05:38,838 --> 01:05:44,719
and over it's definitely not something

1660
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:46,278
that I've tried uh you know down here um

1661
01:05:44,719 --> 01:05:48,358
but I'm a bit scared too based on what

1662
01:05:46,278 --> 01:05:50,239
you guys are saying the way I just some

1663
01:05:48,358 --> 01:05:52,038
people love it some people really love

1664
01:05:50,239 --> 01:05:54,838
it they do some people love it I

1665
01:05:52,039 --> 01:05:58,559
describe it as picture a lemon coming to

1666
01:05:54,838 --> 01:06:01,278
life growing legs and a ballsy dick and

1667
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:03,559
pissing in your mouth like pure lemon

1668
01:06:01,278 --> 01:06:05,798
lemon Flor cleaner but not like L but

1669
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:07,119
like just pure like actual cleaner and

1670
01:06:05,798 --> 01:06:09,880
that's what it's it's very much like

1671
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:11,559
that lemon man pissing in your mouth you

1672
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:13,318
can get it to be a little sweeter to

1673
01:06:11,559 --> 01:06:15,480
where it's just like a really potent

1674
01:06:13,318 --> 01:06:17,000
lemon candy but that that cleaner side

1675
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:20,000
of it's always kind of there where it's

1676
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:23,400
like offensive you're like

1677
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:26,079
oh co your mouth lemon G is the hard

1678
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:28,358
offensive part of that to me like it's

1679
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:30,240
just same mouth coding same everything

1680
01:06:28,358 --> 01:06:31,880
and it's it's one of those where like I

1681
01:06:30,239 --> 01:06:33,759
I know it was super popular in Ohio and

1682
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:36,400
I'm like how could people smoke this

1683
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:39,559
[ __ ] over and over for years it is all

1684
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:42,440
lemon it is Wild Well when all the weed

1685
01:06:39,559 --> 01:06:44,519
just tasted like burnt [ __ ] before that

1686
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:47,599
they were like this is delicious yeah

1687
01:06:44,519 --> 01:06:49,480
probably right when we say cleaner in

1688
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:52,640
this context like is there any relation

1689
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:55,079
to kind of like OG soapy type cleaner or

1690
01:06:52,639 --> 01:06:58,239
totally different yeah like like like

1691
01:06:55,079 --> 01:06:59,839
pinea pungency but like not Piney like

1692
01:06:58,239 --> 01:07:02,318
lemony so like I don't know lemon

1693
01:06:59,838 --> 01:07:05,440
cleaners are pretty common like Goan and

1694
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:09,119
like any of those like

1695
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:12,960
Limon Pine yeah Pine is like a furniture

1696
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:12,960
polish in OG is very furniture

1697
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:26,960
polishyellow line that makes that

1698
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:28,559
because those cuts aren't even that

1699
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:31,358
particularly high in

1700
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:33,839
line yeah like I think today I actually

1701
01:07:31,358 --> 01:07:36,159
just saw like my first test where I like

1702
01:07:33,838 --> 01:07:38,960
I saw over one and a half percent limine

1703
01:07:36,159 --> 01:07:41,598
and I was like holy [ __ ] like Jes that's

1704
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:44,119
a [ __ ] lot of lmon like most on

1705
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:45,720
anything specific um I can't remember

1706
01:07:44,119 --> 01:07:48,160
off the top of my head I was doing a ton

1707
01:07:45,719 --> 01:07:50,838
of data entry today and so like I just

1708
01:07:48,159 --> 01:07:53,078
noticed [ __ ] that like is abnormal you

1709
01:07:50,838 --> 01:07:56,278
know like when a canono profile like

1710
01:07:53,079 --> 01:07:58,640
you'll get like a total total THC or

1711
01:07:56,278 --> 01:08:01,559
like to you'll get some cannabinoid

1712
01:07:58,639 --> 01:08:03,000
total cannabinoid and then total THC and

1713
01:08:01,559 --> 01:08:04,519
they're all calculated slightly

1714
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,559
differently and so when there's like

1715
01:08:04,519 --> 01:08:09,358
large discrepancies between some

1716
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:11,920
cannaboid and total THC like more than

1717
01:08:09,358 --> 01:08:13,798
10% of the potency I'll go and kind of

1718
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:15,798
like dig in the cannaboids and be like

1719
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:17,119
well where's all that extra percentage

1720
01:08:15,798 --> 01:08:18,838
coming from because it's got to be

1721
01:08:17,119 --> 01:08:23,158
something like CBG

1722
01:08:18,838 --> 01:08:24,479
CBC um is CBG 1% CBG common to find in

1723
01:08:23,158 --> 01:08:27,158
stuff or

1724
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:30,119
1% is very common yeah up to like one

1725
01:08:27,158 --> 01:08:32,719
and a half or 2% because like CBG is the

1726
01:08:30,119 --> 01:08:36,479
precursor for a holster of cannabinoids

1727
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:39,439
right yeah CBD and THC included and so

1728
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:42,238
um when the plant is not quite finished

1729
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:44,599
you'll see an abnormally High CBG

1730
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:47,718
content but for me to notice that like

1731
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:49,679
10% threshold like average difference

1732
01:08:47,719 --> 01:08:52,239
between those two metrics is like 5 to

1733
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:54,480
7% and so when I see like 10% or above

1734
01:08:52,238 --> 01:08:57,439
I'm like oh what the [ __ ] is in there

1735
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:58,718
and yeah it's usually CBC and CBG but

1736
01:08:57,439 --> 01:09:02,639
it's like that's like kind of one of my

1737
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:04,759
next Avenues is uh trying to get like I

1738
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:08,239
have one plant that's like pretty high

1739
01:09:04,759 --> 01:09:11,000
in CBG but it's also very high in THC

1740
01:09:08,238 --> 01:09:12,879
and so I can't I haven't quite figured

1741
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,960
that one out yet because it doesn't like

1742
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:17,640
really make sense like that CBG would

1743
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:20,439
probably all convert to THC if I ran it

1744
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:21,960
long enough like 11 12 weeks but like

1745
01:09:20,439 --> 01:09:24,278
when you harvest it at nine weeks like

1746
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:26,640
it's done and it's like you know loaded

1747
01:09:24,279 --> 01:09:28,279
with all these accessory canono and so

1748
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:30,159
interesting I'm wondering if I can like

1749
01:09:28,279 --> 01:09:31,759
if I find another one I'm like oh I'm in

1750
01:09:30,158 --> 01:09:33,960
the money you know what I mean I can

1751
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:36,198
cross these two together maybe it's due

1752
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:38,039
to the same kind of like genetic play at

1753
01:09:36,198 --> 01:09:39,318
work you know what I mean yeah but

1754
01:09:38,039 --> 01:09:40,519
that's all like guess and check work

1755
01:09:39,319 --> 01:09:42,798
it's like you just got to find two

1756
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:44,719
plants with the same trait and hope that

1757
01:09:42,798 --> 01:09:46,119
it's for the same reason and cross them

1758
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:48,279
together and see what happens like

1759
01:09:46,119 --> 01:09:51,238
that's kind of where I'm at with my

1760
01:09:48,279 --> 01:09:53,440
rosin work you know um because at least

1761
01:09:51,238 --> 01:09:55,039
it's an easy to test for trait I don't

1762
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:57,678
have to to do like analytics I can just

1763
01:09:55,039 --> 01:10:01,399
