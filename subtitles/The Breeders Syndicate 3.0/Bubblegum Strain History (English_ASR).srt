1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,019
X would be bubble gum ah

2
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:08,519
bubble gum I am I I did I had a lot of

3
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:10,199
experience with a lot of other bubble

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:12,719
gums in the seed line but this this

5
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:15,239
specific clone I didn't get until a few

6
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:18,239
years ago and I I find it phenomenal

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:21,300
it's an amazing breeder uh it's mold

8
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:25,018
resistant this specific cut that CSI and

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,880
pip and all those guys use came via 1995

10
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:29,278
from the cup I believe it was bought the

11
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,778
same year that it won the cup so uh

12
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:32,399
that's that's what goes around it's a

13
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:35,759
serious it's a selection from serious

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,399
seeds bubble gum the bummer for me it's

15
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:40,500
a great breeder yeah it's very frosty

16
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,780
yeah it's fairly potent I wouldn't say

17
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,100
it's up yeah I wouldn't say it's up

18
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,739
there with the best of the best but it's

19
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,539
got It's got a good little punch uh the

20
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:52,199
disappointing thing about it to me is

21
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:54,000
that it smells very strongly of bubble

22
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,039
gum Terps yes

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,500
um but the flavor does not translate for

24
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,760
me not even a little bit no I don't you

25
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,759
don't get any it doesn't it's
