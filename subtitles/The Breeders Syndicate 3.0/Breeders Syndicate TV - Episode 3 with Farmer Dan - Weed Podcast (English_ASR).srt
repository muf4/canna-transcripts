83
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:12,560
the first time you heard about weed uh

84
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,479
how old were you where if you can share

85

87
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:23,920
to cannabis for you yes I I went to

88
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,680
school like right outside of Sacramento

89
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:28,559
a little town called Davis and uh I

90
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,599
didn't really know anyone that smoked

91
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:35,400
weed it was like one friend had an older

92
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:38,119
sibling that like got us our first bag

93
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,280
and uh or like maybe one dude bought a

94
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,878
baggie off these other guys we knew

95
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,878
something like that you know what I mean

96
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:48,959
but like um we used to like smoke pipes

97
00:03:45,878 --> 00:03:51,560
like we had metal pipes and shitty

98
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,840
little glass pipes and [ __ ] um none of

99
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,239
it had any names because we're like

100
00:03:52,840 --> 00:04:00,280
13year old kids um just like smoking

101

103
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:08,639

104
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,639

00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:37,560
in the area and uh like it was all like

164
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,280
okay you know what I mean none of it was

165
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,199
like crap at all you it was more likely

166
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:45,918
to get like ripped off in some other way

167
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,240
like someone gives you like a foil baggy

168
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:49,758
like you know some [ __ ] there like

169
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,120
some

170
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,598
he yeah yeah to me one was a little nug

171
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,280
of weed in there still though so I was

172
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:59,598
like at least there's enough to smoke

173
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:03,359
most of the time when you got weed

174
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:04,800
growing up it was either pinch bro uh or

175
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,840
you you would find weird [ __ ] like

176
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,360
pebbles string hair a lot of a lot of

177
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:13,000
times in it um a lot of like weave hair

178
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,639

my packs but uh yeah dude just terrible

181
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,439
[ __ ] but you know there was something

182
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:26,719
maybe it was just because we were so

183
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:28,478
isolated and we couldn't get weed on a

184
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,360
regular basis a lot I mean I still

185
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:33,079
remember droughts at times even for like

186
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:37,400
reg stuff especially in the fall and

187
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:38,878

190
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,158

191
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:47,079
not really not really man not really

192
00:07:45,158 --> 00:07:49,879
maybe the occasional one because I do

193
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:51,918
remember popping like one little seed at

194
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:53,319
like 14 in my window sill and it grew

195
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:54,918
like this big and I was like I got to

196
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:57,400

197
00:07:54,918 --> 00:08:01,839

203
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,079
calling culture but just like that

204
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:19,359
growing up in a place like Cali where

205
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:21,560
you would find like your homie's dad

206
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:25,319
that was growing weed because like I

207
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:27,478
mean in Kentucky it was just so looked

208
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:29,520
down upon that you didn't really tell

209
00:08:27,478 --> 00:08:32,199
[ __ ] what that [ __ ] if you were

210
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:34,598
fing with it bro cuz I swear to God

211
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:38,320
everybody I knew that did or every grow

212
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:41,039

213
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,640
of the time robbed bro and robbed by

214
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:46,439
like people they knew it was like 99% of

215
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:49,278
the time it was by like [ __ ] new bro

216
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,839
and speaking of speaking of which did

217
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,600
you ever get into and maybe you don't

218
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:54,600
want to share them and that's fine uh

219
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,800
last episode I talked about getting uh

220
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,800
held up but uh is there has there been

221
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:01,958
any sketchy situations as you you grown

222
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:05,159
up you know in your younger days uh

223
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:07,838
getting you know pinched or or robbed or

224
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:10,480

225
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,560

00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:47,480
like the dude that we bought the weed

264
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,720
from it was him that [ __ ] jumped

266
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,759
dude dude that that reminds me of uh we

267
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,720
were did the episode on the main show

268
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:01,958
with Matt uh with magad and was talking

269
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,800
about uh I asked him the same question

270
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:06,039
basically sketchy like if he ever been

271
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:07,319
in sketchy situations and [ __ ] he talked

272
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:09,599
about it a little bit but he was talking

273
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,399
about how he carried a like a big

274
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,639
[ __ ] hunting knife with him and I

275
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,200
laughed I didn't bring it up to him but

276
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:16,680
back in the day that I don't know if you

277
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,759
watched the last episode but I did get

278
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:20,559
robbed one time in my in my life when I

279
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:24,200
was really young dude over like an ounce

280
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:26,599
of Reggie and uh at the time I did carry

281
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:29,639
a big ass [ __ ] uh my dad had this old

282
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,519
K Bar that he had in the service and I

283
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:35,480
that with me bro and when I got robbed

284
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,759
dude you know you I always I always

285
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,120
thought if it was a possibility I'd have

286
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:39,799
that knife on me and you always have

287
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,039
these ideas of the way the shit's going

288
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:44,000
down going down like a movie but it was

289
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:45,639
it's never like that I mean my situation

290
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,320
in particular I was surrounded by like

291
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:50,360
four Dudes that I could see at night in

292
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,480
the middle of a parking lot by myself

293
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,320
and they had a 45 45 on me but it wasn't

294
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,240
like everybody I talked to was always

295
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,519
like I would have grabbed a gun and it's

296
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,399
like dude the dude didn't even get in

297
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:02,639
the whip though the dude didn't even get

298
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:06,000
in the whip I'm in an old Monte Carlo

299
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,440
you know big I could this dude he's

300
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,159
clear across on the other side there's

301
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,240
nothing I can do I have no power

302
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:13,838
steering bro it's snowing outside

303
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:16,039
parking lot full they robbed me bro and

304
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,760
luckily thank God there was snow in that

305
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:21,078
parking lot dude because I did my best

306
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:24,039
to try to run these [ __ ] over bro and

307
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:25,638
luckily for them it was snowy and they

308
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:27,360
they just jumped over the curb in the

309
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:28,799
parking lot jumped a fence dude but I

310
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,639
drove up over that [ __ ] curb trying

311
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:35,159
to get these guys bro and crazy art town

312
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,278
is so small bro that by the next day I

313
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:39,958
knew who it was because they were

314
00:12:36,278 --> 00:12:41,360
bragging about it a ounce of Reggie bro

315
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:43,599
you know what I'm saying this is the

316
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,039
[ __ ] back then I was like it's like a

317
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,079
you know 70 bucks 100 bucks for for it

318
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:50,240
or whatever but it's so silly bro

319
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:52,319
looking back but that changed the way I

320
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,360
did [ __ ] uh you know dealing and stuff

321
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:58,320
for sure moving on from from then uh uh

322
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:01,120

324
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,560

326
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:09,879
homie dad teaching you how to grow and

327
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,120
stuff like that or the basics at what

328
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:13,838
point do you uh decide I know you said

329
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,000
you popped a few little seeds and stuff

330
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,839
but at what point do you attempt to like

331
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,120
you know do your first grow and was it

332
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,600
an outdoor grow or was it an indoor grow

333
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:25,839
maybe you could talk about that a little

334
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,680
bit yeah yeah so um another friend of

335

336
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:34,000
four years older than me something like

337
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:36,760
that U he uh um he has a few plants in

338
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,600
his backyard and I just got to kind of

339
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:40,439

340
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,199
finish you know and like he went on

341
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,639
vacation or some [ __ ] and I watered him

342
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:47,120
for a week for him and that was like the

343
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,839
first time that I ever like even had my

344
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,839
hand in it really you know other than

345
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:52,560
that it was just like peek into the grow

346
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:54,199
room see somebody doing something like

347
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:57,719
oh [ __ ] that's cool you know and that

348
00:13:54,198 --> 00:14:00,000
was just a handful of times you know um

349
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,120
and I saw a few other people little tent

350
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,480
grows and [ __ ] you know in their

351
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:07,000
apartment that were just like little

352
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,959
track grow kind of things you know back

353
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:14,958
when weed was worth like 4,000 a pound

354
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:17,399
right but um I didn't really grow myself

355
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:20,239
until I think I was like

356
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,720
25 when I moved up to Humble because

357
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,959
that was like the first time I had my

358
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:27,759
own place and I lived on this big old

359
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:30,439
lot and like I had plenty of power and

360
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:33,159
for bedroom and I started slow I just

361
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,759
got like a like a four bulb T5 like one

362
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:38,679
of those vho

363
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:40,480
t5s um and I bought some clones and my

364
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:42,159

366
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:48,639
[ __ ] like you know and then like one day

367
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:50,240
um got like a little I think it was like

368
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,198
a 250 watt

369
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,720
HPS um because it's just so hot you know

370
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:56,599
I didn't have any of that [ __ ] figured

371
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,560
out yet I just had this like bacon hot

372
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,360
room with some clones and I was like

373
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:03,638
just SL slowly figuring it out but my

374
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:07,120
buddy's dad had given me the Jorge

375
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:08,799

379
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:19,360

380
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:21,879
of got me through the first like year or

381
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,199

382
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:26,679
trying to build a grow room that doesn't

383
00:15:24,198 --> 00:15:31,838
go to 100 degrees during the day you

384
00:15:26,679 --> 00:15:34,120

385
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,759
took my student loan money that was like

386
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,440

387
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,639

419
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:53,000
you're coming up and you finally get

420
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:55,000
your your crib and when you turn 25 and

421
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,559
you do your first grow like a lot of the

422
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,440
guy a lot of people the few guests I've

423
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:59,719
had on so far have said you know they

424
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,040
didn't really make it through their

425
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,078
first uh grows and stuff were you at

426
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:05,558
that point did you kind of uh know

427
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:07,639
enough that you were able to kind of

428
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:10,639
make it through your first few grows de

429
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:12,600
like you know or was it it was decent

430
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,600
weed yeah I just didn't take it long

431
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:16,798
enough I was like way too eager I was

432
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:18,838
like man like I didn't understand the

433
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:20,798
whole like days to harvest and how it

434
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:23,038
varies between like I didn't know that

435
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:25,038
much about like strengths and stuff and

436
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:27,240
like how they all differ anything like

437
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:28,720
that um I just knew that they smoked

438
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,359
them you know it's like each one gave

439
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,798
you a different effect I'm like I like

440
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:35,678
that I like this I like that but um it I

441
00:17:33,798 --> 00:17:37,319
was like a I'm a late bloomer in like

442
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,360
everything I always just feel like it's

443
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:43,480
like every 10 years I'm like holy [ __ ]

444
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:45,558
like I [ __ ] for like 10 years mean

445
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:48,360
dumb as

446
00:17:45,558 --> 00:17:50,000
[ __ ] but yeah like that Bubba grow came

447
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:51,279
out like pretty nice it was just super

448
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,519
light that was the thing I was

449
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:55,960
struggling with was like everyone I knew

450
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:57,639
was getting like a pound of light was

451
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,000
like good you know what I mean that's

452
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,480
what you should be getting is more than

453
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,599
that you know and anything over that's

454
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,159
acceptable you know but I was getting

455
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:07,119
like half pounds and I'm just like what

456
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:11,640
am I doing but little I was harvesting

457
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:14,199
Bubba like 49 days you like 45

458
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:16,400
days I think uh you know between

459
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,080
overwatering and pulling early and a

460
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,240
couple other things like that that's

461
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:20,759
that's some of the biggest thing with

462
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,240
new Growers because I did the same thing

463
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:26,000
and because they swell so much in those

464
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:28,880
last few weeks bro like if you if you're

465
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,240
pulling like you you're eager be

466
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,720
especially in your first [ __ ] few

467
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,519
grows because it is like exciting bro I

468
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,600
mean I want to say my first few grows I

469
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:40,158
probably definitely hell even grows now

470
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:42,038
sometimes if I'm in the pinch bro and I

471
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:44,280
need some weed I'll pull pull a couple

472
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:46,400
plants early just just to get it going

473
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:48,759
just I told told you before the podcast

474
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,480
I ran out of weed like a month ago so

475
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:51,919
sometimes you know when you're grow

476
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,319
that's the thing people don't talk about

477
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:58,400
I feel like uh growing your own pot is

478
00:18:54,319 --> 00:19:01,200
really cool and [ __ ] bro but yeah uh but

479
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,798
the big thing for me is like you know

480
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,919
obviously once you find cuts that you

495
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:41,319
system down but I literally cloned let's

496
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:46,320
just say a lot of [ __ ] clones dude uh

497
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:48,200
yeah a rack full uh but my point is uh

498

507

the the thrips just ate up the last

508
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:16,599
little bit of uh vegetation that was

509
00:20:13,558 --> 00:20:19,158
there and I just it [ __ ] me bro and uh

510
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:21,439
I just ended up uh I just was like you

511
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:23,480
know if I found this in one pack bro

512
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,558
I'll find something better there's you

513
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,919
know yeah yeah for sure you might have

514
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:29,319
gotten lucky though that's happened to

515
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:32,600
me before it's like [ __ ]

516
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:35,439
I can't find it again you know you know

517
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:37,959
I don't think I I thought that maybe but

518
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,240
I I popped another pack this run and I

519
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,079
got one I got one structurally that's

520
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,839
exactly like that one obviously that

521
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:46,839
doesn't mean [ __ ] um but something I'm

522
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:49,240
more excited about and I'm hoping the

523
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:51,798
buds came out come out the same uh

524
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:53,599
structure because like last time the

525
00:20:51,798 --> 00:20:55,240
turps and like the smoke and the high

526
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:56,719
was all pretty consistent like the

527
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,759
everything that was all consistent but

528
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,000
the structure of the actual plant and

529
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:02,200
the bud structure was the main

530
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,400
differences on each plant but something

531
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:07,600
I'm excited about this run bro uh is I'm

532
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:10,000
I'm doing full can of teror run Dude

533
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:12,158
full full pumping them dude and I got

534
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,440
one in this tent here bro that is

535
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,320
literally it's it's in it stretch right

536
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,240
now it's like 10 days in to flower bro

537
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:21,839
and that [ __ ] off the top of the

538
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,400
pot is almost five foot tall bro so I'm

539
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:25,399
the last one I grew that I really liked

540
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,159
it was only two foot when I started

541
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,120
flowering it end up about three foot or

542
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:30,880
so couple of the other ones I got

543
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:33,359
are that similar structure but this one

544
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,080
here is a monster and it's got really

545
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:37,798
nice internodal spacing bro I'm hoping

546
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:40,000
it Stacks like the last one does they

547
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:41,839
all stacked really nice bro from top to

548
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,679
bottom and I've trained this one a

549
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:47,079
little bit so I'm kind of I'm hyped for

550
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,559
it but um so bro you gotta be careful

551
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:50,558
with me on these because I get high on

552
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:53,519
GoLine I'll talk forever about myself so

553
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:55,119

555
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:59,558
little crib you're [ __ ] growing uh at

556
00:21:58,278 --> 00:22:01,599
you know are you just doing this for

557
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:03,158
yourself and if I ever ask you something

558
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:05,798
you don't want to answer bro feel free

559
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:07,960
not to answer it but at one at some

560
00:22:05,798 --> 00:22:09,679
point do you try to make some money off

561
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,200
this [ __ ] or do you just [ __ ] are you

562
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,559
just in it for the the experience or or

563
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,319
the smoking or a little bit of all of it

564
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:18,918
like that was like most people where

565
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:21,480
it's like uh you can't afford to smoke

566
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:23,679
as much weed as you would like to and so

567
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:27,798
you got to do something like as far as

568
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:30,120
either selling a few extra baggies or um

569
00:22:27,798 --> 00:22:32,480
uh mainly just yeah for personal smoke

570
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:34,519
you know cuzz I found after that Bubba

571
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,159
run and maybe like one or two other ones

572
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:38,200
I don't remember like I got some of

573
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,880
these like mesino clones that was just

574
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:43,080
like red and blue with like a number

575
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,000
after them and I I remember looking it

576
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:46,359
up at the time and there was information

577
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,960
but I can't remember what the [ __ ]

578
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:50,719
numbers were anymore and so like I kind

579
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,679
of wish I remember what they were just

580
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,558
to like even uh look back at it someone

581
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:59,400
had me have

582
00:22:55,558 --> 00:23:03,798
seen um but uh I found the blue green

583
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:05,840
cut 8 PRC it's like a famous dispens

584
00:23:03,798 --> 00:23:07,200
it's closed now unfortunately it was

585
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:09,839
like the coolest dispensary for the

586
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,600
longest time but um but I got the blue

587
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:14,678
dream cut and I just started croing [ __ ]

588
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:16,480
out like I just kept growing only that

589
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:18,960
because it yielded so well it was such

590
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,319
an easy to grow plant I wasn't even

591
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,400
taking it to 77 and it still yielded

592
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:27,119
well you know I think I would only take

593
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:29,600
it to like 63 60 you know I was still in

594
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:30,918
that like trying to figure that part

595
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:33,719
that's one of those ones that a lot of

596
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:37,320
people [ __ ] [ __ ] ran it wasn't it

597
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:41,400
out there for to for it was kind of done

598
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:44,558
by the time I was grow this was like

599
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:46,320
2015 um nobody really cared about it

600
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:48,960
even when you grew it like triaa

601
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:51,200
gorgeous unless you love to smoke it

602
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,600
like nobody gave a [ __ ] right you know I

603
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,159
would bring like a pound of it to

604
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:55,759
somewhere and they'd be like yeah I'll

605
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,120
give you like 1,200 bucks for it and

606
00:23:55,759 --> 00:24:01,278
it's like pounds are going for like 24

607
00:23:58,119 --> 00:24:03,879
you know yeah so it's like no

608
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:07,480
thanks you outdoor it

609
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:10,159
was what uh what would that have been

610
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,519
about would that been what year would

611
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,760
that have been when people were [ __ ]

612
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:14,599
with that if you know because it seems

613
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:17,278
like it was coming to Kentucky I was

614
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:20,278
working at this Factory uh around I want

615
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:21,880
to say it was like see I graduated in 07

616
00:24:20,278 --> 00:24:24,440
I started working at factory like four

617
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:27,880
years later so that would have been what

618
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:30,640
like 2010 2011 I was hearing about it I

619
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,480
think was like I think it was late 2000s

620
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,320
early

621
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:36,759
201s um even by like

622
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:38,678
201617 I still knew people that cropped

623
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:42,398
it Outdoors but they were like really

624
00:24:38,679 --> 00:24:43,840
big scale like just like gnarly outdoor

625
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:46,079

site over at Riot seeds.com oh I don't

640
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,679
know he actually I think he sold out of

641
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:26,599
the s1's but so they're proba I think

642
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:29,559
they're sold out but some of the crosses

643
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:31,839
were crazy though you know some were

644
00:25:29,558 --> 00:25:34,000
like in my opinion like the wet dream

645
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:36,678
the Green Crack Blue Dream cross was

646
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,359
like I'd almost prefer that in

647
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:41,278
some

648
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:43,000
yeah but it just has that sweeter vibe

649
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:46,880
to it instead of like the straight dryer

650
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:52,278
sheets you know I had I had drier sheets

651
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:54,760
uh I I really liked it I liked the uh I

652
00:25:52,278 --> 00:25:56,359
liked everything about it I don't know

653
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:58,919
it just wasn't one that I wanted to keep

654
00:25:56,359 --> 00:26:00,519
I only I mean I ran that uh one in that

655
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:02,720
Grove contest and I think we only got

656
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:04,440
like two or three seeds of it so I mean

657
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,120
obviously that doesn't I mean I need to

658
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:09,798
be running numbers to even like get any

659
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:12,239
kind of real uh data on that that

660
00:26:09,798 --> 00:26:14,158
particular cross but I would say I'm

661
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,640
more I liked it a lot something I talk

662
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,760
about all the time with that particular

663
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:20,399
cross was how like three months down the

664
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:23,240
road in my dry out tent I had a tent at

665
00:26:20,398 --> 00:26:24,839
the other crib I had when I ran it uh I

666
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:27,359
had cleaned it out even after I had

667
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:28,918
cured and dried the uh or dried the uh

668
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:31,639
dry sheets in that t and that [ __ ]

669
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:33,679
tent still smelled like dryer sheets

670
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:35,799
like it's dank as [ __ ] I liked it I just

671
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:39,200
is yeah yeah I think I I think I'm just

672
00:26:35,798 --> 00:26:41,000
not a big fruity tur guy no matter what

673
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,720
it is I I like some of the blue stuff I

674
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,599
mean the blue dream's cool I like some

675
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,720
of Matt blueberry work and stuff but I I

676
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:50,839
really like she makes fun of me because

677
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:54,759
I like runchy nasty [ __ ] like I don't

678
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:58,079
know gassy skunky rank like oniony

679
00:26:54,759 --> 00:27:01,319
garlicky any kind of in that range but I

680
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:03,839
like Bubba uh coffee kind of Vibes

681
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:05,439
anything like that that's what I like uh

682
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:09,599
I like it

683
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,798
all the Z King can you talk about can I

684
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:12,759
don't know if you can even talk about

685
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:15,119
some of this [ __ ] but at a certain point

686
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:16,359
I think you do get a job in the industry

687
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:19,558
and I don't know if you can even talk

688
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:22,000
about any of that [ __ ] but uh if you can

689
00:27:19,558 --> 00:27:23,440
at what point did that happen and what

690
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,798
uh inspired you to do that I mean

691
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,000
obviously probably uh financial reasons

692
00:27:25,798 --> 00:27:29,639
but is there something what led up to

693
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,798
that if you could even if you can't talk

694
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,880
about it maybe you can talk about what

695
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:36,359
led up to getting into the industry I

696
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:38,919
guess basically yeah so like after um

697
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:40,798
the market crashed out like you know we

698
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:43,799
didn't we paid our expenses for that

699
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:45,519
year and we made like a small little

700
00:27:43,798 --> 00:27:47,558
amount of money you know I didn't have

701
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:50,278
enough money to like replant like buy

702
00:27:47,558 --> 00:27:52,158
first like you know it was just like and

703
00:27:50,278 --> 00:27:54,119
I didn't want to I was just like dude

704
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:57,159
this is like some killer greenhouse and

705
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:58,798
like you want it for 400 bucks a pound

706
00:27:57,159 --> 00:27:59,799
you know like

707
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:03,558
[ __ ]

708
00:27:59,798 --> 00:28:05,038
that like I'm not about it you know and

709
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:06,839
uh and it didn't recover I was like

710
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:09,440
maybe it's just like a phase and it'll

711
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:11,359
like you know wave up it and it didn't

712
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:15,080
at all and so like I'm glad I did get

713
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:16,359
out um but I came back and uh I went

714
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:18,839
back up into the mountains in my

715
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:20,798
hometown in Northern Napa County and I

716
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:22,199
was working on this vegetable farm and

717
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:23,639
like I just couldn't find a place to

718
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,278
live out there because there's been tons

719
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,640
of fires the last like five 10 years

720
00:28:26,278 --> 00:28:30,839
that have just like displaced like so

721
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,720
many people no rentals to find they're

722
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:34,639
all like three grand 10 to 10 grand a

723
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,480
month you

724
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:40,399
know it's too much and I was making just

725
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:42,519
like normal vegetable farmer money you

726
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:44,239
know and so that job was sick but I

727
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:45,880
needed to find something better and so I

728
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,159
was just looking for a job and like I

729
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:50,960
applied for it I found one that was just

730
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:53,120
like a plant breeder job and uh it was

731
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,798
for a big California company and I was

732
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:56,719
just like [ __ ] dude that's B money and

733
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:58,639
like I've always wanted to do this like

734
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,839
for real because i' like played around

735
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,960
making seeds and like tried to like half

736
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:05,639
ass start like a little seed company but

737
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,880
like never really put the time into it

738
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,960
so I was like a you know like you're

739
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:12,399
[ __ ]

740
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:14,319
busy and so uh I just never put enough

741
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:17,278
time into that side of it and so I just

742
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:19,599
had the opportunity to get the job and

743
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:22,480
they kind of like the things that that

744
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:24,439
company wanted it's like asking for like

745
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:28,278
a unicorn because they wanted someone

746
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:29,798
with like a full plant science like

747
00:29:28,278 --> 00:29:32,960
background with a bachelor's degree

748
00:29:29,798 --> 00:29:34,720
minimum preferably a master's degree I

749
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,720
hate that [ __ ] phrase you see it all

750
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:40,519
the time in plain science uh and then

751
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:43,000
but also with like a full black market

752
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:45,120
weed grower skill set right you know and

753
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,599
like know the market know the culture

754
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:50,439
know everything that you want to know

755
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:54,119
about like seed lines and people and all

756
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:58,519
that [ __ ] so um I managed to get the job

757
00:29:54,119 --> 00:30:01,879
like pretty immediately I realized that

758
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:04,558
it was like day one no like within the

759
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:06,240
first like two weeks you know I just

760
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:09,519
kind of realized that like they designed

761
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:12,480
a job that guaranteed that everyone you

762
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:14,240
worked with kind of hated you all right

763
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,759
because all I did was make work for

764
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,200
people when when we're doing a new seed

765
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:21,359
pop that grow is going to get inundated

766
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,319
with like hundreds and hundreds of new

767
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:26,158
plants that all have to be individually

768
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:27,480
tagged and like doing the metric for all

769
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,399
that [ __ ] to pain in the ass because

770
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:32,159
you're literally weighing out every

771
00:30:29,398 --> 00:30:33,278
[ __ ] phenotype and like it's just a

772
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,760
nightmare and then they all have to be

773
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:37,880
trimmed separately so it's like a

774
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:40,119
special trim scene for it too and then

775
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:42,200
it all has to be packaged and Jarred for

776
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:44,959
like people to evaluate it and all that

777
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,558
so like you just like there's no way

778
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,519
around it that that person is going to

779
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:50,158
be like maybe they like you as a person

780
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:52,558
but they hate that you exist at that

781
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:55,039
company right because you just make work

782
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:58,839
for everyone and then they they had kind

783
00:30:55,038 --> 00:31:00,599
of like a corporate like

784
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:04,319
like it was like

785
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:07,798
a selection based by committee you know

786
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:10,200
what I mean and like everyone's like was

787
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:12,278
weighted differently on like what their

788
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,200
vote was and [ __ ] and obviously like the

789
00:31:12,278 --> 00:31:16,200
owners are way up here all the way down

790
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:19,240
to me who's like on the vote but doesn't

791
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:21,000
count at all right and so like there was

792
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,839
just never any opportunity to do real

793
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,880
plant breeding it was just like cross

794
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:26,918
this and that together pick out the one

795
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,639
that they think smells the best looks

796
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:31,480
the best and then like keep testing it

797
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:34,719
and eventually it may become a

798
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:36,919
commercial you know um but it was just

799
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,639
like it was just like there was no you

800
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:42,639
couldn't do multip reading and if you

801
00:31:39,638 --> 00:31:45,558
did it was all just like together I

802
00:31:42,638 --> 00:31:47,879
basically crossed everything

803
00:31:45,558 --> 00:31:51,720
everything and then they would just sort

804
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:54,919
through it you know and it it sucked I

805
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:56,720
had all these ideas are you are you are

806
00:31:54,919 --> 00:31:59,440
you working with cuts or are you working

807
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,558
with the SE pops specifically I know you

808
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:05,000
said something both yeah constantly

809
00:32:01,558 --> 00:32:07,720
acquiring every clone you can find and

810
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,759
uh also they acquired their own seeds

811
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:11,798
from like events that people would give

812
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:14,079
them and stuff that they would buy that

813
00:32:11,798 --> 00:32:16,038
was super hyped up but everything that

814
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:19,240
was super

815
00:32:16,038 --> 00:32:22,200
hype was dark not even just like oh it's

816
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:24,120
like modern like it was straight trash

817
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,480
and these are from like the biggest some

818
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:27,439
of the biggest companies with the

819
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:30,558
biggest names that charge 300 bucks per

820
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:35,960
a package 10 se you know and it was just

821
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:38,599
[ __ ] trash dude um so I mean you get

822
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:40,399
this job right and you say with it

823
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:42,240
pretty quickly you realize you don't you

824
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:46,719
don't like it I mean how long do you end

825
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:48,200
up staying there uh and then do you uh I

826
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,278
guess yeah like how long did you end up

827
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,440
staying there and then maybe like what

828
00:32:50,278 --> 00:32:54,798
at what at after that what did you end

829
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:56,679
up get getting into did you continue to

830
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:59,558
look for other work in the in the

831
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:01,360
industry or did you hang up the towel or

832
00:32:59,558 --> 00:33:05,398
maybe you could talk about the the end

833
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:08,240
of it I guess yeah so uh I was there for

834
00:33:05,398 --> 00:33:09,798
a year in two or three months I just

835
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,159
stuck it out so I was just like it's

836
00:33:09,798 --> 00:33:14,558
paying my bills and I got to do a bunch

837
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:17,000
of [ __ ] that they never asked me to do

838
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:18,440
but like because it's research it's like

839
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,880
totally cool because if it leads

840
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,840
somewhere cool then they can be like

841
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,600
yeah we totally wanted you to do that

842
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:29,000
you know and I was like figuring things

843
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:31,599
out um about reversals and um pollen

844
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,558
quality in reversals doing some

845
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:36,719
microscopy with that helping them out

846
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:39,240
mildly with their tissue culture just

847
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,038
like um looking through their stuff and

848
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,919
throwing ideas in their brain and [ __ ]

849
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:46,119
but

850
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:48,000
um it uh I was just so unhappy there and

851
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:50,398
I I apparently rubbed someone the wrong

852
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,079
way because he he went to HR and was

853
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:53,678
just like this dude hates his job we

854
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:58,918
don't like him like get him the [ __ ] out

855
00:33:53,679 --> 00:34:00,919
of here and I was gone like immediately

856
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:02,960
damn yeah which is funny because that

857
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:05,120
dude talked more [ __ ] than [ __ ]

858
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,480
anyone about everyone at the company the

859
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:09,799
owners everyone involved that the dude

860
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:12,199
that ratted me out was like the biggest

861
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:14,399
hater of all time of course they usually

862
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:17,118
are sucked at his [ __ ] he sucked at

863
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:20,039
growing meat oh he probably wanted your

864
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,760
job bro or something you know yeah I was

865
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:24,398
just bringing the vibe down and I knew

866
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,440
it too you know it was like it was bound

867
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:29,440
to happen eventually whether I left or

868
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:31,320
they like didn't like me anymore but I

869
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,559
my boss hated me pretty immediately too

870
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:36,440
like my direct manager he knew that he

871
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:37,799
couldn't like manage me you know because

872
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,480
it's like how do you manage someone

873
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:42,359
that's like he didn't have any real

874
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,519
industry experience before this he was

875
00:34:42,358 --> 00:34:46,759
just a science dude a plant scientist

876
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:49,358
right and like there was nothing he

877
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:51,000
could tell me about my job besides like

878
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:53,679
the politics of the people in the

879
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,239
company that like I didn't already know

880
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:57,960
more you know and he never wanted to

881
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:59,679
even collab on anything I was always

882
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,639
trying to get him to help me like do my

883
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:04,239
stats and [ __ ] and get my like data

884
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:06,319
collection like really fine- tuned and

885
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:08,479
like he just never gave a [ __ ] and he

886
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,920
never wanted to invest any time in it so

887
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,159
I was just like dude he doesn't want to

888
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,760
manage me he thinks I'm a pain in the

889
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:16,598
[ __ ] ass like I have all these

890
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:19,280
[ __ ] ideas and [ __ ] um so it's just

891
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:21,800
like it's funny that because I actually

892
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,359
wanted to do the real job it eventually

893
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:28,119
led to

894
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:29,880
me getting booted out you know well it's

895
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:32,480
a couple things I wanted to uh make a

896
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,079
point on was uh I can totally relate to

897
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,679
you when you're saying that your job

898
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,920
basically was making people hate you

899
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:39,759
because you're making work for them uh

900
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,000
when I used to mow I used to mow for a

901
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:45,000
long time for a living bro cut grass and

902
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,079
[ __ ] and uh I I got hired on obviously

903
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,800
the bottom just a weed eater guy and

904
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:51,160
then within a year I was the manager of

905
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,280
the whole crew and all [ __ ] and uh that

906
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:55,519
was my job but I loved it I love making

907
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,280
a [ __ ] hate me dude because

908
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:59,000
these guys [ __ ] with me for like a year

909
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,400
working there cuz I had no experience in

910
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Mowing and so they shited out on me cuz

911
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,880
like I didn't that's where all these

912
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,400
weeder jokes come from and [ __ ] cuz they

913
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:09,119
would do that [ __ ] to me and [ __ ] with

914
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:11,838
me and [ __ ] right and uh ended up I

915
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:13,318
became their boss eventually bro and uh

916
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:15,358
and I loved it at that point because I

917
00:36:13,318 --> 00:36:16,559
was [ __ ] you know but but and it's

918
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:17,838
something else like you were saying the

919
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:20,519
morale that's something when you're

920
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:22,078
doing a physical [ __ ] job you need

921
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:24,318
everybody on point it's just like

922
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:26,000
playing a sport or something like if if

923
00:36:24,318 --> 00:36:28,039
you're your head's not in the game if

924
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,838
you're partying out at late at night and

925
00:36:28,039 --> 00:36:31,800
you're coming in drunk and hung over the

926
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:33,719
next day and nobody else is and you're

927
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36,640
not doing the same level of work it it

928
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:39,199
sets up bad tone because you know in

929
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:42,358
Kentucky bro when it's 98 Degrees and

930
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:44,598
88% humidity and we're out there doing

931
00:36:42,358 --> 00:36:46,759
these horse farm fences for [ __ ] 20

932
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:48,318
miles bro and you're over here hanging

933
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:51,160
on the fence and [ __ ] like I can't

934
00:36:48,318 --> 00:36:53,440
respect you anymore so uh you know it's

935
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:55,159
the same [ __ ] so my my other thing I

936
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,599
wanted to say it sounds like you kind of

937
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:59,639
wanted to get you sound you sounded like

938
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,240
you were wanting to more get into like

939
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:03,199
get into it to kind of like you were you

940
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:05,919
were talking about it was experiment and

941
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:07,358
play and breed and learn and really they

942
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,639
kind of just want you to come in and do

943
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:11,679
what the [ __ ] they wanted you to do and

944
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:13,559
make make money and that was it and kind

945
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:14,799
of soul sucking at that point you know

946
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:17,318
because you're you're literally just

947
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:18,880
working for the check and like I mean we

948
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:20,519
all need to make money because we all

949
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,119
have families and bills of course

950
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:24,480
especially with the three or 4,000

951
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:27,000
[ __ ] rent you guys got out there but

952
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,559
uh but there I think when especially

953
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,920
when you talk about something like this

954
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:34,318
that is a hobby or passion project or

955
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:36,800
passionate uh hobby for a lot of people

956
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:38,358
uh I think it would be very soul sucking

957
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,440
because I talked about this before on

958
00:37:38,358 --> 00:37:42,838
other podcast is like for me even

959
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:45,720
there's a limit and it's usually like

960
00:37:42,838 --> 00:37:48,880
four or five six lights at that point

961
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:51,078
anything after that uh I start to get

962
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,559
not into it I'm now I'm talking about

963
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:55,359
from the standpoint of like in my house

964
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:58,039
like a normal ass house with a setup in

965
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:59,920
a room or a couple rooms you know that's

966
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:01,559
not I'm not talking about like a fac a

967
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,119
facility where it's like you know

968
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:05,358
streamlined to do large [ __ ] but I'm

969
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:08,400
talking about just putting up some tents

970
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:11,279
in your crib uh I can after after about

971
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,920
five six lights dude I'm it's not that I

972
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,119
can't maintain all that work uh it's

973
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,000
just not as fun as it as it is for me

974
00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:20,318
because we were talking about cloning

975
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,159
and [ __ ] earlier like stuff like that if

976
00:38:20,318 --> 00:38:25,039
I got to do too much of that [ __ ] it it

977
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:27,759
is work at that point right and it's not

978
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:29,800
as it's not as fun for me so but that

979
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,119
being said I [ __ ] sucked it up

980
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,000
because I ain't no Little [ __ ] and I

981
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:35,920
cloned everything out this this [ __ ]

982
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:39,760
run because I learned my lesson yeah but

983
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:41,200
but uh so you you you leave this job and

984
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,880
you and I wanted to ask one more

985
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:44,318
question about that and it and you

986
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,358
probably already answered it for me but

987
00:38:44,318 --> 00:38:48,000
did you learn anything at all other than

988
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:50,119
not to deal with certain types of people

989
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,920
again I guess or no probably nothing

990
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:54,760
from the growing aspect of it or you not

991
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:57,519
from the growing side I saw a lot of

992
00:38:54,760 --> 00:39:00,119
stupid [ __ ] on the growing side yeah um

993
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:03,480
I learned how to

994
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:06,160
gr from the the nursery manager he was a

995
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:10,039
really cool gu yeah he had more of a

996
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:12,960
background like PL science degree weed

997
00:39:10,039 --> 00:39:16,279
like in the medical scene you know he

998
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,639
was just a really cool down but I guess

999
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,040
what I mainly learned is I suck at

1000
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:22,078
playing politics you know you can't be

1001
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:24,079
up front and like say what's on your

1002
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:27,599
mind in those games you know everybody's

1003
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:30,119
playing the long game and uh I'm just a

1004
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:32,519
slimy piece of [ __ ] like that you

1005
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:34,680
know I got to see a lot of cool plants

1006
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:37,358
like I got to see so much [ __ ] as far as

1007
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:40,199
like all the modern stuff I

1008
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:42,159
know so many cuts that I'll never work

1009
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:43,879
with and I know exactly why I'll never

1010
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:44,960
work with them you know what I mean

1011
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,599
because it's just like there's nothing

1012
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,400
to find there there's literally nothing

1013
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:52,359
like you will never find

1014
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:55,039
something different in even without

1015
00:39:52,358 --> 00:39:59,679
Crossing you know it's just like it's

1016
00:39:55,039 --> 00:40:00,960
just too much of the same and so uh um I

1017
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:02,919
don't know and I got to learn a lot more

1018
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,760
about reversals I guess that's one thing

1019
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:07,639
I got to like really fine-tune and play

1020
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,760
around with like so many different

1021
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:11,719
commercial sprays and then like started

1022
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,680
developing my own and like it works for

1023
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:15,039
me but like we've been trying it out a

1024
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:18,879
little bit and it's like you know still

1025
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:21,599
got some pickups to go through um and uh

1026
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:25,358
I don't know yeah maybe it's just like

1027
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:27,838
uh for me it's like I can when you know

1028
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:29,719
your plants like you can read it and

1029
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:32,400
like know when to just like do a little

1030
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:33,879
less here maybe lower the concentration

1031
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,280
it's like it's hard to put that in

1032
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:37,880
instructions for someone else you know

1033
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,079
and so I guess that's more what it is is

1034
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,838
like we're trying it out and I'm like

1035
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:43,119
here's some blanket instructions and it

1036
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:44,838
didn't work and so it's like all right

1037
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,960
well you know that's where we need to

1038
00:40:44,838 --> 00:40:48,599
find tune it's just like is it

1039
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,480
concentration is it number of

1040
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:53,359
applications is it just be flexible is

1041
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,480
it just not a viable product because you

1042
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:58,239
have to be like in the moment flexible I

1043
00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:01,559
don't know yet that's what we're

1044
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:03,639
I can I can I can relate because I know

1045
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:05,679
the guys will all joke on autof flowers

1046
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:08,759
but like trying to tell somebody how to

1047
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:11,318
grow a autof flower the right way is so

1048
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:13,440
difficult because I feel like to get a I

1049
00:41:11,318 --> 00:41:15,279
mean I personally don't think they're

1050
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,880
good for new beginner people I think

1051
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,680
they would be good for a new beginner if

1052
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:23,079
you've have experience with plants in

1053
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:26,000
general uh and you understand like how

1054
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:27,880
to properly water how to properly feed a

1055
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,760
plant how to look for signs of

1056
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:32,039
deficiencies or pest I mean there's all

1057
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,400
kinds of things I think that a lot of

1058
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:37,000
people get [ __ ] up on autoflowers is

1059
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,480
they come into it from uh uh the way

1060
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,280
they would treat a traditional plant as

1061
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:43,480
far as like how much light how much

1062
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:45,760
nutrients uh how what size pots they're

1063
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,880
putting in how close the lights are to

1064
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,680
them [ __ ] like that especially with

1065
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,920
these modern uh Autos uh if you know

1066
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:53,799
what you're doing they're very easy to

1067
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:56,119
grow but I think that uh they can have

1068
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:59,240
their pitfalls for a new grower in

1069
00:41:56,119 --> 00:42:01,000
particular but I can totally relate and

1070
00:41:59,239 --> 00:42:02,679
trying to explain to somebody that is a

1071
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,440
new girl or even someone that's not and

1072
00:42:02,679 --> 00:42:05,960
just hasn't [ __ ] with them and it's a

1073
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:08,200
tail sign whenever I see somebody it's

1074
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:09,960
like yeah I [ __ ] with some autos and

1075
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:11,598
they they you know they show me a

1076
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,599
picture and it's this [ __ ] auto

1077
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:15,318
that's like this tall and I'm sitting

1078
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:17,160
here like literally right now I'm

1079
00:42:15,318 --> 00:42:19,400
looking across the room at like [ __ ]

1080
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:20,838
eight autos and they're all as tall as

1081
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:23,039
the [ __ ] traditional plants right

1082
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:25,039
next to them and they're half the age so

1083
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:26,639
it's like you know for me when I see

1084
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:28,719
[ __ ] like that I'm like okay well you

1085
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:29,598
probably them a little bit too hard you

1086
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:31,639
probably there's some you've probably

1087
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,480
done wrong but uh not to go off on a

1088
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:35,078
tangent about Auto flowers but that's

1089
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,639
something I have a hard time explaining

1090
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:38,720
to people you have to dial it down a lot

1091
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:41,039
um and speaking of it since we're

1092
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:43,679
already on the topic you said you [ __ ]

1093
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:45,239
with Autos a little bit back in the day

1094
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:47,078
uh could you and you were talking about

1095
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:49,759
low roders and [ __ ] can you talk about

1096
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:53,039
anything on autof flowers at all uh your

1097
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:56,960
experience with them and [ __ ] so I was

1098
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:57,960
working uh growing some like this after

1099
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,039
my

1100
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:02,639
I moved up to Oregon I was working with

1101
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:04,920
these guys doing some outdoor projects

1102
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:06,719
um it was like during the hemp rush and

1103
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:08,800
[ __ ] you know so it's like you know kind

1104
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:10,719
of free to do as you will because

1105
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,720
there's so much weed plants around

1106
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:14,719
everywhere you know it's just like

1107
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:16,879
you're kind of off the radar if you just

1108
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:18,679
have this like small little farm because

1109
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:22,720
there's like you know multi Hundred Acre

1110
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:27,358
Farms of weed now um yeah and

1111
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:31,719
so I needed Auto for project uh we

1112
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:34,679
needed for oil and so I bought some from

1113
00:43:31,719 --> 00:43:38,078
a pretty wellknown Seed

1114
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:41,078
Company ended up I was thinking I was

1115
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:44,000
like we paid like 10 grand you know for

1116
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:46,640
like 10,000 seeds a dollar a piece I was

1117
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,639
like I make these you know and I was

1118
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:50,558
just like [ __ ] cocky about it you

1119
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:53,279
know and I didn't realize how easy

1120
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:53,280
reversals

1121
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:59,279
are you know

1122
00:43:56,039 --> 00:44:01,558
so end up popping like I don't know 120

1123
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:07,359
of them and separated them out by like

1124
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:09,119
flower time and general look and and uh

1125
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:12,119
reversed a handful of them just kind of

1126
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:15,640
at random and let them all

1127
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:17,800
hit they were Killers you know I I found

1128
00:44:15,639 --> 00:44:20,598
really nice plants in there even in the

1129
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:23,440
original stock and then my buddy and I

1130
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:25,838
both grew those the next year uh for the

1131
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,639
outdoor season and they [ __ ] crushed

1132
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:29,639
everything that he

1133
00:44:27,639 --> 00:44:31,358
he had like nine other varieties from

1134
00:44:29,639 --> 00:44:33,358
other people and like the [ __ ] that I

1135
00:44:31,358 --> 00:44:35,598
made was just like massive yielding

1136
00:44:33,358 --> 00:44:37,519
super resonance and I was just like cool

1137
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:39,920
man like it's all just going to biomass

1138
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:44,679
you know it's all just uh turning into

1139
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:47,599
carts and [ __ ] so um but um that was it

1140
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:49,519
was a fun project it taught me just like

1141
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:51,200
it got me organized you know what I mean

1142
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:53,559
where I'm like all right you know like

1143
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:56,318
it got me to start like doing real like

1144
00:44:53,559 --> 00:44:58,800
uh notes on stuff and like starting to

1145
00:44:56,318 --> 00:45:01,519
separate PL by characteristics and

1146
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:03,240
traits and stuff and um I think Autos

1147
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:05,280
are a really good way to get into

1148
00:45:03,239 --> 00:45:07,598
breeding honestly because you have to

1149
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:10,119
learn a lot of fundamentals and like

1150
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:11,920
start looking at like recessive versus

1151
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:15,119
dominant genes if you're like making a

1152
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,800
new Auto and stuff like that so um then

1153
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,920
you can also just like shorten flower

1154
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,599
time or make things sorry not shorten

1155
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:22,960
flower times like turn things into like

1156
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:24,800
early trigger plants where it's just

1157
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,599
like maybe you don't have an auto plant

1158
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:29,800
but it's going to start flowering like

1159
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:32,440
mid July instead of um where you first

1160
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:35,680
see it in like early to mid August yeah

1161
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:38,440
you know so uh just a lot of stuff like

1162
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:40,039
that it was definitely a cool experience

1163
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,800
I didn't ever get back into it though

1164
00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:44,159
it's like I made a ton of those I grew

1165
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:45,599
them for what I needed them for and ever

1166
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:48,399
since then they've just been collecting

1167
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:51,440
dust in my fridge but I probably have

1168
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:53,400
like I don't know 20,000 Auto seeds of

1169
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,599
like a couple dozen or like maybe a

1170
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:58,160
dozen varieties and they're all like low

1171
00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:00,440
rider Basu like you see low rider pop up

1172
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:03,279
everywhere in every single line just

1173
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:06,240
like kind of midy but resonance uh

1174
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:08,720
fruity you know and purple traits you

1175
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:12,159
know like that's exactly what you find

1176
00:46:08,719 --> 00:46:14,558
um it's in everything yeah you still see

1177
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:17,318
so I've spent the last couple years

1178
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:18,920
collecting basically the best and see

1179
00:46:17,318 --> 00:46:20,719
this is this is something that the

1180
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:23,920
reason why I started making Auto season

1181
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:25,679
the on the side because uh the selection

1182
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,079
of what you have on the modern day

1183
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:30,639
Market is and proba back then too is

1184
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:32,920
horrible like you can't find RS there's

1185
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:36,558
very few people with RS there's like two

1186
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:38,440
to three uh breeders that will drop some

1187
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:42,240
and that have dropped some or that carry

1188
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:45,400
them and uh so I got into it because uh

1189
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:47,358
when I first started growing again uh

1190
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:49,318
there just a way I was able to have a

1191
00:46:47,358 --> 00:46:51,719
per a Perpetual Harvest of some kind

1192
00:46:49,318 --> 00:46:53,279
when I only had a couple tents uh and

1193
00:46:51,719 --> 00:46:54,759
people people get it [ __ ] up people

1194
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,440
think I started with Autos but I

1195
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:59,640
actually started with um uh just

1196
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,480
traditional plants uh one of my first

1197
00:46:59,639 --> 00:47:03,920
seeds what seed bank was it from it was

1198
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,440
over was it seedsman I think it was

1199
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:08,000
seedsman in Europe seedman I think

1200
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:09,240
seedman was one of the first placees I

1201
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,079
actually ordered and I didn't order any

1202
00:47:09,239 --> 00:47:13,959
Autos my first first uh run some of the

1203
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:16,039
pl stuff I picked up was from like a

1204
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:18,358
seeds and like I still remember that's

1205
00:47:16,039 --> 00:47:20,400
the one one one of the packs I remember

1206
00:47:18,358 --> 00:47:22,558
was a little [ __ ] tin can bro it was

1207
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,039
round 10 cans had eight seeds on it and

1208
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:26,200
you push it down and pop over and all

1209
00:47:24,039 --> 00:47:28,639
the [ __ ] and uh I got a bunch of [ __ ]

1210
00:47:26,199 --> 00:47:30,318
from there but my to keep it on Autos

1211
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:32,960
something I find it really interesting

1212
00:47:30,318 --> 00:47:36,000
is to learn learning about uh breeding

1213
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:38,039
and something else that I found uh my

1214
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,559
goal of recent with him at least is to

1215
00:47:38,039 --> 00:47:45,000
find a more of a OG or a k a Kim leaning

1216
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:46,920
or just a rank smelling uh autof flow

1217
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,159
because you're right a lot of uh

1218
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:51,680
profiles are more of the fruity profiles

1219
00:47:49,159 --> 00:47:55,000
or I know that Matt said this that stuff

1220
00:47:51,679 --> 00:47:56,960
like grape uh or uh other certain

1221
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,039
profiles I know specifically with grape

1222
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,559
carry over into other plants pretty

1223
00:47:59,039 --> 00:48:04,079
easily so I have seen a lot of that type

1224
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:05,839
of [ __ ] but the last few [ __ ] runs

1225
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:08,200
dude and it's really interesting because

1226
00:48:05,838 --> 00:48:10,199
I had a huge amount of my auto seeds

1227
00:48:08,199 --> 00:48:12,679
were from about two or three years ago

1228
00:48:10,199 --> 00:48:14,358
and I ran a bunch of those last run and

1229
00:48:12,679 --> 00:48:16,239
then I ran a bunch of the more literally

1230
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:18,759
the most modern autons you can get like

1231
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:22,199
from all the most recent drops in the

1232
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:25,240
last like three or four months and uh

1233
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:27,199
I've ran uh a couple of them a few times

1234
00:48:25,239 --> 00:48:29,959
before but anyways my point is as I

1235
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:32,118
found a few that are insanely resinous

1236
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:33,720
dude and I'm [ __ ] hyped for them and

1237
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:36,160
what's [ __ ] funny is we make fun of

1238
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:37,519
hype [ __ ] all the time but I think the

1239
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:41,399
answer to

1240
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:44,199
increase uh you know um some of these

1241
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:46,480
autos at least the way they look and and

1242
00:48:44,199 --> 00:48:48,039
the their Frost appeal or their appeal

1243
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,719
and things like that especially because

1244
00:48:48,039 --> 00:48:51,480
I'll be honest there are some that pop

1245
00:48:49,719 --> 00:48:53,480
up that look like dog [ __ ] that like

1246
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:54,760
when you look at them they're but but

1247
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:56,199
that being said when you're running 20

1248
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:58,839
or 30 of them at a time there'll be

1249
00:48:56,199 --> 00:49:00,439
three or four out out of them that will

1250
00:48:58,838 --> 00:49:02,078
pop out and I got some now that I've

1251
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:05,920
crossed I've made a few crosses and

1252
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:08,200
stuff and I'm getting stuff like Funk uh

1253
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:10,039
I am getting still some Berry and banana

1254
00:49:08,199 --> 00:49:12,358
and strawberry like funky plants and

1255
00:49:10,039 --> 00:49:15,920
fruity [ __ ] I do like those but I've I'm

1256
00:49:12,358 --> 00:49:18,440
leaning away from the more grapy floral

1257
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:20,280
uh type of Auto like traditional kind of

1258
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:22,240
Vibes you get and some of these these

1259
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:23,640
leaves on some of these more modern ones

1260
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:25,519
bro I've shown them and test them on

1261
00:49:23,639 --> 00:49:27,199
people in the Discord they can't tell

1262
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:29,599
[ __ ] difference one bro bro and some

1263
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:31,838
of the frost on some of the the [ __ ]

1264
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:34,119
like fan leaves and the water Le or all

1265
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:37,558
the just the frost on them is awesome

1266
00:49:34,119 --> 00:49:39,838
and the smells bro fire bro some of them

1267
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:42,440
are dank they're dank though bro they

1268
00:49:39,838 --> 00:49:44,078
are this last run that I did with some

1269
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,599
of these in particular I took them down

1270
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:47,680
with me to Kentucky when my dad was

1271
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:49,599
going through [ __ ] and I was smoking on

1272
00:49:47,679 --> 00:49:52,879
them bro and they were I wouldn't say

1273
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:55,880
they hold up to like a the top tier H&amp;L

1274
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:57,880
seed you know but they are better than a

1275
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:59,358
lot of wck that I've had they are better

1276
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:02,400
than like I say this all the time

1277
00:49:59,358 --> 00:50:05,279
they're often the best Autos are always

1278
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:07,240
as good as some of the worst seeds

1279
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,960
you'll find in like a pack sometimes

1280
00:50:07,239 --> 00:50:11,479
like if you pop a pack of you know what

1281
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:13,920
I'm saying because not average yeah your

1282
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:15,358
average traditional plant not the best

1283
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,440
one in the pack it's kind of like on

1284
00:50:15,358 --> 00:50:19,519
that level a lot of times but for the

1285
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:21,000
speed and what you bringing it back into

1286
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:23,199
breeding I thought was interesting is

1287
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,480
you know your male uh my whole goal was

1288
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:27,358
to get a lot of R Auto so I could [ __ ]

1289
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,880
around and learn uh more about bradian

1290
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:30,639
and the interesting thing about the

1291
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,000
males they're dumping melon they're

1292
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:34,480
they're starting to dump pollen at week

1293
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,119
three and four so you can do these these

1294
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,079
really quick turnaround so like for

1295
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:39,960
example when I broke everything down

1296
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:41,960
from my last run where I went to back to

1297
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:44,480
Kentucky for a while to visit dad and

1298
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:46,679
the thrips I came back I had no Clon so

1299
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:48,679
I was starting everything from seeds so

1300
00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:51,399
I literally just started flipping two

1301
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:53,440
weeks ago on all the stuff that I popped

1302
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:55,240
and all the Autos I popped at the same

1303
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:57,639
time are are about two weeks out from

1304
00:50:55,239 --> 00:51:00,879
finishing flow so they're they're great

1305
00:50:57,639 --> 00:51:02,239
for utilizing them like that if you are

1306
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,400
you know you're restarting you have no

1307
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:06,000
flour are they going to [ __ ] rip your

1308
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,880
head off every time you smoke them [ __ ]

1309
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,679
no but if you enjoy growing weed and

1310
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:13,079
like to look at plants and and we were

1311
00:51:10,679 --> 00:51:15,199
talking about the unknowns earlier

1312
00:51:13,079 --> 00:51:17,559
something that it tickles my fancy and

1313
00:51:15,199 --> 00:51:19,439
it kind of something about running a lot

1314
00:51:17,559 --> 00:51:21,119
of a pack a lot of the same pack it's

1315
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:24,280
great for finding obviously Great

1316
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:26,358
Expressions and Keepers and outlier uh

1317
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:28,319
plants and stuff like that but it's

1318
00:51:26,358 --> 00:51:30,039
sometimes if they're all really it's

1319
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:33,119
like skank dog it's a great plan and

1320
00:51:30,039 --> 00:51:35,318
stuff but because it is so uh consistent

1321
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:38,079
it's not that exciting for me I got ADHD

1322
00:51:35,318 --> 00:51:39,159
bro so I got I want to see random color

1323
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:42,200
I want to see all kinds of different

1324
00:51:39,159 --> 00:51:43,519
[ __ ] so uh the Autos I think they're

1325
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:45,719
they're here to stay in my garden at

1326
00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:47,679
least dude I I enjoy the aut yeah they

1327
00:51:45,719 --> 00:51:49,838
have their purpose man that's why I like

1328
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:51,480
I've gone on rant on this on the [ __ ]

1329
00:51:49,838 --> 00:51:53,039
server and [ __ ] where it's just like

1330
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:55,400
dude y'all just a bunch of [ __ ]

1331
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:57,880
haters like everybody wants to hate on C

1332
00:51:55,400 --> 00:52:00,039
everyone wants to hate on flowers I'm

1333
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:01,880
like dude that shit's just like even

1334
00:52:00,039 --> 00:52:04,279
that is like a cultural thing it's

1335
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:06,640
[ __ ] old news you're not the cool guy

1336
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:08,559
cuz you hate [ __ ] cookies bro yeah

1337
00:52:06,639 --> 00:52:10,639
like they're good cookies Cuts you know

1338
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:12,680
what I mean like I've had some that are

1339
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:15,679
like maybe they're not going to get you

1340
00:52:12,679 --> 00:52:17,919
like high every single day and like

1341
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:19,239
blast you up in the outer space over and

1342
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:21,240
over and over again like some of these

1343
00:52:19,239 --> 00:52:23,519
older Cuts but like I build up a

1344
00:52:21,239 --> 00:52:26,159
tolerance to the older cuts too there's

1345
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:28,400
only a few that like always cut through

1346
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:30,199
you know know but it's just like uh I

1347
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,599
don't like smoking the same kind of weed

1348
00:52:30,199 --> 00:52:34,639
more than like a few days in a row you

1349
00:52:32,599 --> 00:52:37,318
know I'm always switching it up by time

1350
00:52:34,639 --> 00:52:39,838
of day like I like having all of it all

1351
00:52:37,318 --> 00:52:41,880
the [ __ ] time like my modern [ __ ] my

1352
00:52:39,838 --> 00:52:43,679
old school [ __ ] depending on who's

1353
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:45,599
coming over I may roll something up

1354
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:47,399
different just to like keep them

1355
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:49,519
comfortable so it's like I've said it

1356
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:51,838
before it's like you get like a person

1357
00:52:49,519 --> 00:52:53,920
who wants to casually smoke like a few

1358
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:56,039
times a year at like a dinner party or

1359
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:58,519
some [ __ ] like you give them some

1360
00:52:56,039 --> 00:53:01,960

1411
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:08,000
weeks out and uh it just looks amazing

1412
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:10,719
mango smells coming through or like

1413
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,599
[ __ ] kill her and I only grew two

1414
00:55:10,719 --> 00:55:14,399
[ __ ] seeds of it I think our sprouted

1415
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:17,079
like five and I got three

1416
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,880
males um you know but out of two plants

1417
00:55:17,079 --> 00:55:20,680
they're both [ __ ] look like they're

1418
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,960
going to be killer fug you know

1419
00:55:20,679 --> 00:55:23,919
especially one one looks crazy like H&amp;L

1420
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,039
was like that one looks like it's going

1421
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,119
to

1422
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:30,039
hurt you

1423
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:32,000
weapon yeah yeah then I got the P Haze

1424
00:55:30,039 --> 00:55:33,960
too that's probably a little closer cuz

1425
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,719
the the PE is not long flowering you

1426
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:37,559
know cuz I think I got three that are

1427
00:55:35,719 --> 00:55:39,919
like the shorter flowering ones maybe

1428
00:55:37,559 --> 00:55:43,280
like I'm at 10 weeks now so I think

1429
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:44,760
they'll go like 11 maybe 12 on a few of

1430
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:51,039
them and then I got one that'll go like

1431
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:53,039
14 or 15 but yeah p is pH is is a a

1432
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:55,960
sweet pea times Band-Aid Haze number

1433
00:55:53,039 --> 00:56:00,000
seven I believe isn't it I think it is

1434
00:55:55,960 --> 00:56:02,599
and it sweet PG from uh local his grow

1435
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,440
of it and so I looked up his grow log he

1436
00:56:02,599 --> 00:56:07,359
posted some photos of like finish flower

1437
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:11,240
um and like the it's like in the

1438
00:56:07,358 --> 00:56:13,199
Bittersweet Channel um of the grow logs

1439
00:56:11,239 --> 00:56:15,598
and um those plants are like the

1440
00:56:13,199 --> 00:56:17,679
spitting image of the PE leaners like

1441
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:20,480
it's it's a dominant [ __ ] plant even

1442
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:22,639
as the reversal like the pollen Doner I

1443
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:25,358
like the I only got one that's evil

1444
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:28,759
looking at all I I got the worst luck I

1445
00:56:25,358 --> 00:56:31,000
got mostly Ina leaners I feel like I

1446
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:32,680
mean I'm taking a guess you know here I

1447
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,400
guess that's what they were now I have

1448
00:56:32,679 --> 00:56:36,519
smoked sweet PE so I could pick up

1449
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,880
hunting the P leaners there were two

1450
00:56:36,519 --> 00:56:40,280
that stood out on of like the eight or

1451
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:42,880
nine that were that came up that were or

1452
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:45,880
whatever uh that I finished and I smoked

1453
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:47,680
on that sweet PE or I smoked on that um

1454
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:49,838
uh phes for a month that was the last

1455
00:56:47,679 --> 00:56:52,440
[ __ ] I had to smoke up because I I

1456
00:56:49,838 --> 00:56:54,239
smoked up the two uh Expressions that I

1457
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:56,440
really liked like way before that and

1458
00:56:54,239 --> 00:56:59,318
ended up smoking the rest of them yeah

1459
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:02,358
um but yeah man I'm not a big you know I

1460
00:56:59,318 --> 00:57:04,400
think H he told me I'm going to like SSH

1461
00:57:02,358 --> 00:57:06,719
there's certain hes bro it's it's that

1462
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,519
I've tried so far and you're right like

1463
00:57:06,719 --> 00:57:11,919
on the mango hazes from H&amp;L I really

1464
00:57:08,519 --> 00:57:13,559
like the electric mango um there's and

1465
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:15,798
that we were talking about earlier about

1466
00:57:13,559 --> 00:57:17,240
smoking out people with certain [ __ ] I

1467
00:57:15,798 --> 00:57:18,559
wouldn't smoke people out with any of

1468
00:57:17,239 --> 00:57:20,000
that [ __ ] [ __ ] for the first time if

1469
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:21,680
they don't smoke because remember at the

1470
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,199
[ __ ] party I know I talk about this

1471
00:57:21,679 --> 00:57:26,598
[ __ ] party all the time but you were

1472
00:57:24,199 --> 00:57:28,318
there with me and we got to share uh a

1473
00:57:26,599 --> 00:57:31,160
whole day on a boat actually which was

1474
00:57:28,318 --> 00:57:35,838
awesome and we got [ __ ] baked but uh

1475
00:57:31,159 --> 00:57:37,759
and fish but uh the um but that that

1476
00:57:35,838 --> 00:57:40,679
whole trip we were smoking a lot of the

1477
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:42,200
H&amp;L crosses of the mango Haze and that

1478
00:57:40,679 --> 00:57:44,879
one night dude I think it was the first

1479
00:57:42,199 --> 00:57:46,798
night we were there Rob Clark and myself

1480
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,039
and a few other of us tried to go lay

1481
00:57:46,798 --> 00:57:50,400
down because we had to get up at what

1482
00:57:48,039 --> 00:57:53,039
like six to go fish and uh man I'm

1483
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:55,079
laying in bed and I'm [ __ ] dude I

1484
00:57:53,039 --> 00:57:58,720
closed my eyes and I could like see [ __ ]

1485
00:57:55,079 --> 00:58:00,680
like racing RAC my mind's racing like um

1486
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:03,399
Rob Clark said he he he tried to lay

1487
00:58:00,679 --> 00:58:06,480
down and he got back up too and he got

1488
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:07,880
back up like five times he said I saw

1489
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:10,240
what did he say eyelid movies or

1490
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:12,318
something like that yeah yeah so I

1491
00:58:10,239 --> 00:58:14,199
wouldn't recommend smoking sleep at all

1492
00:58:12,318 --> 00:58:16,719
that [ __ ] we were smoking Band-Aid Haze

1493
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:17,960
with bandaid Haze until like [ __ ] 3

1494
00:58:16,719 --> 00:58:19,519
in the morning every night like you're

1495
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:22,720
not gonna [ __ ] sleep for those two

1496
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:24,599
hours that you go yeah I would kind of

1497
00:58:22,719 --> 00:58:26,399
just like huh but I was sleeping on the

1498
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:30,200
couch so like I had to like wait till

1499
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:34,119
everyone went to yeah that [ __ ] was like

1500
00:58:30,199 --> 00:58:36,000
I was like all right yep um before we uh

1501
00:58:34,119 --> 00:58:37,960
jump into the next seg segment and kind

1502
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,838
of get uh I wanted to ask you a couple

1503
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:41,838
things about some of the more H uh

1504
00:58:39,838 --> 00:58:44,400
modern uh varieties that maybe you might

1505
00:58:41,838 --> 00:58:46,358
have some information on uh the first

1506
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,639
the first one and this confused me at

1507
00:58:46,358 --> 00:58:49,318
first because I don't really [ __ ] with a

1508
00:58:47,639 --> 00:58:52,199
lot of modern [ __ ] other than like some

1509
00:58:49,318 --> 00:58:55,239
Auto stuff um can you explain the

1510
00:58:52,199 --> 00:58:57,038
different uh sherbs or sunset sunset

1511
00:58:55,239 --> 00:58:59,159
sherbs and stuff like that and or maybe

1512
00:58:57,039 --> 00:59:00,880
the Green sherb in any kind of way

1513
00:58:59,159 --> 00:59:02,960
because uh that that confused the [ __ ]

1514
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,760
out of me and and I'm sure it is for a

1515
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,960
lot of n Growers and people that might

1516
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:10,119
be watching

1517
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:13,119
too yeah yeah so when sherbet came out

1518
00:59:10,119 --> 00:59:15,599
um the first one I saw was the Shir and

1519
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:18,119
it was the green shirt and uh I thought

1520
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:20,960
it was a nice little plant like outside

1521
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:23,079
I never had any issues with it like uh

1522
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,679
herming or anything and I saw like I

1523
00:59:23,079 --> 00:59:26,720
used to run some trim scenes when I was

1524
00:59:24,679 --> 00:59:28,399
in college then too and like I saw

1525
00:59:26,719 --> 00:59:30,000
plenty of it like it wasn't loaded with

1526
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:32,200
seeds and [ __ ] but I guess it was kind

1527
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,599
of common on indoor and I'm actually

1528
00:59:32,199 --> 00:59:37,759
growing a hybrid of it right now that I

1529
00:59:34,599 --> 00:59:39,838
made back then and uh it hered [ __ ]

1530
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:42,359
everywhere and not just like once early

1531
00:59:39,838 --> 00:59:45,639
in flow late in flow like the whole time

1532
00:59:42,358 --> 00:59:48,318
[ __ ] through top to bottom or just on

1533
00:59:45,639 --> 00:59:51,358
your yeah just like on the tip of every

1534
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:55,079
single like Bud site just like one or

1535
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:56,920
two bananas sticking out um and like one

1536
00:59:55,079 --> 00:59:58,960
of them seated itself all super heavy

1537
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:01,119
but anyway that's besides the point like

1538
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:03,480
uh and then a little bit later the

1539
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:04,920
sunset was released I think they were

1540
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:07,280
kind of holding that one a little more

1541
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:10,838
tight um and it was just purple and it

1542
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:13,359
had a little bit of like like a creamy

1543
01:00:10,838 --> 01:00:15,880
gas where the other one was like creamy

1544
01:00:13,358 --> 01:00:18,400
like lime you know like like kind of

1545
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:20,039
citrus but not Tangy at all you know

1546
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:22,280
what I mean it's definitely more like a

1547
01:00:20,039 --> 01:00:23,599
key lime pie kind of thing gotcha where

1548
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:25,359
it's just like and that's what people

1549
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:27,400
think the green sherb and the key lime

1550
01:00:25,358 --> 01:00:30,558
are the same

1551
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:33,079
um but I I don't know about that because

1552
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:36,119
like I drew the key lime a lot too and

1553
01:00:33,079 --> 01:00:39,599
it was like super long Innes and like

1554
01:00:36,119 --> 01:00:43,079
the green sh stacked you know um and it

1555
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:45,798
looked kind of like just sunset shb with

1556
01:00:43,079 --> 01:00:48,359
no purple you know it had that modern

1557
01:00:45,798 --> 01:00:49,960
gelato look where I don't feel like the

1558
01:00:48,358 --> 01:00:52,880
the key line did it kind of had like

1559
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:54,318
this rounded toop and [ __ ] but nobody

1560
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:56,920
has it anymore I met one dude on

1561
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:58,558
Instagram and said he still has it

1562
01:00:56,920 --> 01:01:00,440
um I probably need to hit him back at

1563
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:04,200
some

1564
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:06,039
point I don't know man uh and so they

1565
01:01:04,199 --> 01:01:07,679
they say that it's Girl Scout cookies

1566
01:01:06,039 --> 01:01:11,079
across the pink

1567
01:01:07,679 --> 01:01:13,358
panties who knows right you know I never

1568
01:01:11,079 --> 01:01:15,640
saw pink panties or anything like that I

1569
01:01:13,358 --> 01:01:15,639
think

1570
01:01:16,358 --> 01:01:19,358

1572
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:31,440

1573
01:01:28,679 --> 01:01:35,440

1575
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:40,519
weeks and so like my plants were just

1576
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:42,920

1577
01:01:40,519 --> 01:01:44,519

01:02:00,519 --> 01:02:06,079
lost them all but

1586
01:02:03,159 --> 01:02:08,598
um uh yeah Sunset was fired I still want

1587
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:10,318
to cut back of it like it's good the

1588
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:12,160
problem is is like even the guys in the

1589
01:02:10,318 --> 01:02:13,920
big companies that are like connected to

1590
01:02:12,159 --> 01:02:16,519
those people originally and like grew

1591
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:19,318
for them like they came so it's in

1592
01:02:16,519 --> 01:02:23,440
someone's Garden somewhere you know but

1593
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:25,400
uh so yeah what is the what is the S1 uh

1594
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,880
that Caleb has on his website is that

1595
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:29,920
gonna is that going to be the the green

1596
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:32,160
sherb I guess that's the one yeah yeah

1597
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:35,000
and I forgot yeah yeah he did do the

1598
01:02:32,159 --> 01:02:37,759
green sherb as one um and when I think

1599
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:40,798
Sean and local both grew a pack of them

1600
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:43,000
and all you find is more green shirt you

1601
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:46,599
know like there's no like Clues to

1602
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:49,760
anything like it's just all more green

1603
01:02:46,599 --> 01:02:53,000
and so uh I like those turps you know

1604
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:56,480
like they're cool I had a I had a couple

1605
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:58,599
of uh the sweet pea I think it was was

1606
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:01,719
it was EI I think it was sweet his local

1607
01:02:58,599 --> 01:03:04,079
sweet peed times the uh one of the s1's

1608
01:03:01,719 --> 01:03:05,879
I think it was of some kind maybe it was

1609
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:06,720
a reversal I'm not really sure but I had

1610
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:09,559
a pack

1611
01:03:06,719 --> 01:03:12,798
of uh I had a pack of them I ran them

1612
01:03:09,559 --> 01:03:14,880
and actually dude I [ __ ] uh the ones

1613
01:03:12,798 --> 01:03:16,679
that came out fruity or kind they came

1614
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:19,160
out kind of candy almost like a pixie

1615
01:03:16,679 --> 01:03:21,598
stick kind of kind of vibe those weren't

1616
01:03:19,159 --> 01:03:23,480
a super super potent they were cool like

1617
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:25,960
the flavor and the smells were really

1618
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:28,119
cool when you open the jar but the PE

1619
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:30,559
ones dude they had this like that mouth

1620
01:03:28,119 --> 01:03:33,400
Savory raunchiness to them a little bit

1621
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:35,200
of fru to them but not like like more

1622
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:39,200
what in my tone with what I like you

1623
01:03:35,199 --> 01:03:41,239
know um but they were cool um like we

1624
01:03:39,199 --> 01:03:43,480
said earlier you know um I'm younger and

1625
01:03:41,239 --> 01:03:46,639
you're younger as well uh we're in our

1626
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:48,358
mid and early 30s so um you know I grew

1627
01:03:46,639 --> 01:03:49,960
up flipping some of this stuff and there

1628
01:03:48,358 --> 01:03:52,679
is some stuff that is modern that I

1629
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:54,480
actually enjoy myself I think I think we

1630
01:03:52,679 --> 01:03:57,519
you know maybe we could uh kind of

1631
01:03:54,480 --> 01:04:00,159
summit uh the modern conversation up

1632
01:03:57,519 --> 01:04:02,038
with it's not that I think that people

1633
01:04:00,159 --> 01:04:03,399
wouldn't like it it's just I think it is

1634
01:04:02,039 --> 01:04:05,760
I think you know this better than I do

1635
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:07,639
it's it's what it all stands for right

1636
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:10,319
uh you know if it if it didn't go the

1637
01:04:07,639 --> 01:04:11,558
way it did with it all maybe uh you know

1638
01:04:10,318 --> 01:04:13,920
without [ __ ] on a bunch of people

1639
01:04:11,559 --> 01:04:15,599
and getting drama uh you know if it

1640
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:17,440
didn't go the way it all did it maybe it

1641
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:20,079
wouldn't have been the way but I agree

1642
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:22,798
with you being that I've tested out

1643
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:25,000
extensively all the [ __ ] R stores or

1644
01:04:22,798 --> 01:04:27,278
stores I could find in Michigan bro that

1645
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,719
are my general area it it's upwards to

1646
01:04:27,278 --> 01:04:32,559
like 20 something now and made multiple

1647
01:04:29,719 --> 01:04:33,919
visits to them and [ __ ] and uh man

1648
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:35,680
there's something in that store if you

1649
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:37,318
know what you're looking for I wouldn't

1650
01:04:35,679 --> 01:04:38,759
go in there asking the people that work

1651
01:04:37,318 --> 01:04:40,119
there what the what it is because

1652
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:42,520
they're just off the street for looking

1653
01:04:40,119 --> 01:04:44,240
for a job but it it's one of those deals

1654
01:04:42,519 --> 01:04:46,358
where you're GNA have to spend money and

1655
01:04:44,239 --> 01:04:48,159
find something that you like there I'm

1656
01:04:46,358 --> 01:04:50,519
not saying go out and buy little

1657
01:04:48,159 --> 01:04:52,639
prepackaged eights but like up here

1658
01:04:50,519 --> 01:04:54,719
where we're at you can go into still

1659
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:57,278
daily styles and then you can actually

1660
01:04:54,719 --> 01:04:58,558
get like bulk flour still uh I know you

1661
01:04:57,278 --> 01:05:00,559
were saying you can't even get bulk

1662
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:02,359
flour it's all prepackaged Ace and [ __ ]

1663
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:04,400
so that sucks and there's not even rules

1664
01:05:02,358 --> 01:05:06,639
that make it that way I think they just

1665
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:08,639
decided like because we had deli style

1666
01:05:06,639 --> 01:05:11,038
for a long time you know what I mean I

1667
01:05:08,639 --> 01:05:12,400
think even into the beginning of wck

1668
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:15,480
maybe they passed a while that it all

1669
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:16,920
has packag I don't know but um yeah it's

1670
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:19,358
[ __ ] wacky you want an ounce you got

1671
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:20,440
to buy eight little prepackaged dates

1672
01:05:19,358 --> 01:05:22,440
and they're going to charge you full

1673
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:26,400
retail for every single one of them

1674
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:29,358
that's wild bro seez California taes on

1675
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:31,318
all see here like a lot of the [ __ ] they

1676
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:33,278
do have like prepackaged eights but a

1677
01:05:31,318 --> 01:05:35,159
lot of it is stuff a lot of that stuff

1678
01:05:33,278 --> 01:05:37,358
you can actually get in the bulk stuff

1679
01:05:35,159 --> 01:05:39,920
too it'll either have a different name

1680
01:05:37,358 --> 01:05:42,239
or just uh be an older Harvest basically

1681
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:44,838
so it's like yeah it's not the dank as

1682
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:46,358
fresh as [ __ ] but like for 40 bucks you

1683
01:05:44,838 --> 01:05:48,838
can kind of walk out with like a half

1684
01:05:46,358 --> 01:05:51,480
ounce of something pretty decent I feel

1685
01:05:48,838 --> 01:05:53,078
like compared to compared to from what

1686
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:54,838
you guys and maybe that's part of the

1687
01:05:53,079 --> 01:05:56,798
problem with a lot of guys is a lot of

1688
01:05:54,838 --> 01:05:58,920
you guys are out C and if it's that bad

1689
01:05:56,798 --> 01:06:01,318
out there at the rec stores like that

1690
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:02,960
sucks cuz uh I'm not saying we got the

1691
01:06:01,318 --> 01:06:05,199
best weed or nothing like that here in

1692
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:06,838
Michigan but I I gotta say yeah I can't

1693
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:09,798
[ __ ] on every single place because there

1694
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:12,000
are there I found I found some stuff

1695
01:06:09,798 --> 01:06:13,880
that was pretty decent now it giv the

1696
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:17,519
opportunity or the choice would I take a

1697
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:19,599
bag of homegrown over that of course you

1698
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:21,719

1699
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:24,200
day like you know when we were talking

1700

1702
01:06:26,798 --> 01:06:30,960

definitely on the better end of things

1741
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:04,078
uh I like the more of the smells and the

1742
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:07,119
flavors and the turch just that riness

1743
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:09,920
bro but uh the last question I had about

1744
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:12,880
um uh some of the more modern [ __ ] uh

1745
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:19,119
was you're a z man bro what the [ __ ] is

1746
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:22,560
z z Skittles the original Z yeah um yeah

1747
01:08:19,119 --> 01:08:25,559
it's a it's some sort of like a like my

1748
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:28,199
personal theory is like a green SHP uh

1749
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:29,880
Sweet Tooth kind of thing um but it's

1750
01:08:28,198 --> 01:08:31,960
like it's it's just got this depth to

1751
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:33,759
the fruit on it you know what I mean

1752
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:36,158
like you most of the time you smell F we

1753
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:38,920
it's like strawberry or like oh yeah

1754
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:40,238
that's Berry or like that's grape you

1755
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:42,039
know this one it's just like it's like

1756
01:08:40,238 --> 01:08:44,798
when you smell it like you keep going

1757
01:08:42,039 --> 01:08:47,679
back to it you're just like okay like

1758
01:08:44,798 --> 01:08:49,838
that's Cherry that's like a lemon that's

1759
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:52,158
grapefruit you know like it just kind of

1760
01:08:49,838 --> 01:08:53,838
has that depth to it and that's what

1761
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:55,479
sucks about it is that when you cross it

1762
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:58,119
out I feel like you get some of that

1763
01:08:55,479 --> 01:09:00,678
like candin but you don't get that depth

1764
01:08:58,119 --> 01:09:02,158
of flavor and Aroma to it anymore so

1765
01:09:00,679 --> 01:09:03,719
like that's the only thing that I really

1766
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:06,679
and it doesn't do what you want it to in

1767
01:09:03,719 --> 01:09:09,679
breathing so like it's kind of like my

1768
01:09:06,679 --> 01:09:12,520
obsession with it is like that it just

1769
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:14,600
like making it good you know what I mean

1770
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:16,239
I don't think it'll ever be potent but

1771
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:19,400
like how do you work with it in a way

1772
01:09:16,238 --> 01:09:21,599
that like preserves that debt you know

1773
01:09:19,399 --> 01:09:23,399
and um other people have done it you

1774
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:26,560
know what I mean like uh I heard the

1775
01:09:23,399 --> 01:09:28,238
original Z Cube had some baners in it

1776
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:30,359
you know and that people have like

1777
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:33,838
stabilized that uh through more like

1778
01:09:30,359 --> 01:09:35,319
line breing in it and so like uh for me

1779
01:09:33,838 --> 01:09:38,039
I'm just trying to find something now

1780
01:09:35,319 --> 01:09:40,600
that I like to smoke and it'll just be a

1781
01:09:38,039 --> 01:09:42,600
clone that maybe I hit other stuff to

1782
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:44,359
when I find cool plants you know just to

1783
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:45,960
be like all right there let's that's my

1784
01:09:44,359 --> 01:09:49,560
one that I throw some hype and some

1785
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:52,600
candy on you know what I um so I'm grow

1786
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:56,000
in some like uh permanent marker cross

1787
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:57,239
and uh and old s ones stuff like that

1788
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,800
you know just trying to find some cool

1789
01:09:57,238 --> 01:10:01,279
plants to with but not like I don't

1790
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:03,640
think I'm really going to continue wine

1791
01:10:01,279 --> 01:10:07,238
breeding with it I think this one I

1792
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:10,159
think I've done it and um now it's just

1793
01:10:07,238 --> 01:10:13,479
finding the plant in that L you know

1794
01:10:10,158 --> 01:10:17,399
that's like the like exemplary example

1795
01:10:13,479 --> 01:10:18,759
of It kind of H yeah yeah I you know and

1796
01:10:17,399 --> 01:10:19,679
I like asking you these kind of

1797
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:21,280
questions because I don't know if I'll

1798
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:23,119
be able to some of the other people

1799
01:10:21,279 --> 01:10:24,840
could we even have a be able to comment

1800
01:10:23,119 --> 01:10:28,279
on them so I wanted to ask you [ __ ] more

1801
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:30,520
modern leaning questions too uh but uh

1802
01:10:28,279 --> 01:10:31,880
maybe we could talk about like I know we

1803
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:33,199
were kind of dragging on here a little

1804
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:34,279
bit and you got [ __ ] you got to do so

1805
01:10:33,198 --> 01:10:37,799
maybe we

1806
01:10:34,279 --> 01:10:39,800
could maybe we could talk about uh how

1807
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:42,679
uh at what point did you kind of get

1808
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:44,360
online uh and were you like involved

1809
01:10:42,679 --> 01:10:46,359
with the forums did you watch YouTube

1810
01:10:44,359 --> 01:10:48,960
videos and then maybe once you kind of

1811
01:10:46,359 --> 01:10:51,198
get into that what point did you find

1812
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:53,319
the uh Matt in the breeder

1813
01:10:51,198 --> 01:10:56,198
Syndicate yeah so I didn't really do

1814
01:10:53,319 --> 01:10:58,559
anything online like the forums I didn't

1815
01:10:56,198 --> 01:11:00,678
know about the good ones and even with

1816
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:03,280
forums what nobody really like says is

1817
01:11:00,679 --> 01:11:05,800
that you got to just [ __ ] scroll

1818
01:11:03,279 --> 01:11:07,800
forever through endless pages to find

1819
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:09,400
what the information you're looking for

1820
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:12,119
or you have to be like active in the

1821
01:11:09,399 --> 01:11:13,319
community the question but even then

1822
01:11:12,119 --> 01:11:15,519
like a lot of those guys are just

1823
01:11:13,319 --> 01:11:17,639
[ __ ] [ __ ] just gonna like [ __ ] on

1824
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:19,400
you you know and so like I never had

1825
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:22,000
anything to do with the forums I still

1826
01:11:19,399 --> 01:11:27,238
don't you know like I'm just on the

1827
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:27,238
Discord but I found not through

1828
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:33,600
podcast I think I was driving from

1829
01:11:30,198 --> 01:11:35,479
Oregon to Oklahoma in like

1830
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:38,920
20 the

1831
01:11:35,479 --> 01:11:40,399
2019 and um had to find some [ __ ] to

1832
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:42,679
download and listen to because there's

1833
01:11:40,399 --> 01:11:45,039
like experiences of nothing in the west

1834
01:11:42,679 --> 01:11:48,359
you going to drive

1835
01:11:45,039 --> 01:11:51,039
through so I got to the m episode

1836
01:11:48,359 --> 01:11:54,399
somewhere around likees or

1837
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:56,719
something and he was just talking so

1838
01:11:54,399 --> 01:11:58,719
much [ __ ] on everybody and like I knew

1839
01:11:56,719 --> 01:12:01,439
some of those stories point just from

1840
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:03,920
like like Word of Mouth from other

1841
01:12:01,439 --> 01:12:05,678
people in the industry and stuff and I

1842
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:07,679
was just like finally somebody's not

1843
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:09,359
full of [ __ ] you know what I mean this

1844
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:11,960
like this guy says exactly what he's

1845
01:12:09,359 --> 01:12:13,759
[ __ ] thinking um so many of these

1846
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:18,439
people are douchebags and nobody [ __ ]

1847
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:21,079
says it U and uh from then I think they

1848
01:12:18,439 --> 01:12:23,799
plugged his show that it just started I

1849
01:12:21,079 --> 01:12:26,319
think they were in the first season and

1850
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:28,719
uh started my rating over that way

1851
01:12:26,319 --> 01:12:30,840
because the podcast got like there was a

1852
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:32,639
few good interviews on there and then it

1853
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:35,039
got kind of weird you know what I mean

1854
01:12:32,639 --> 01:12:37,920
with the the caliber of people coming on

1855
01:12:35,039 --> 01:12:41,439
and [ __ ] I I really hate when a weed

1856
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:44,279
growing show is just like it always just

1857
01:12:41,439 --> 01:12:46,238
feels like a plug for someone's company

1858
01:12:44,279 --> 01:12:48,359
you know like I'm not there for that you

1859
01:12:46,238 --> 01:12:50,079
know I want to like know get like learn

1860
01:12:48,359 --> 01:12:52,839
something about you your work you're

1861
01:12:50,079 --> 01:12:56,158
doing like what you're like working with

1862
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:59,079
right now and [ __ ] uh but like it always

1863
01:12:56,158 --> 01:13:02,279
just seems like a softball questions to

1864
01:12:59,079 --> 01:13:04,920
like plug the company

1865
01:13:02,279 --> 01:13:07,399
kind that's everything nowadays bro me

1866
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:08,800
and my old lady we sit there I I'll look

1867
01:13:07,399 --> 01:13:10,960
at her sometimes I'll watch something on

1868
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:12,480
YouTube I used to love watching YouTube

1869
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:14,679
and I get on there I say is anything

1870
01:13:12,479 --> 01:13:16,319
even [ __ ] real anymore these mother I

1871
01:13:14,679 --> 01:13:18,000
say at the end of this [ __ ] video

1872
01:13:16,319 --> 01:13:20,079
they're gonna sell us something watch

1873
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,479
there's gonna be a link to something but

1874
01:13:20,079 --> 01:13:24,639
that being that being said dude there is

1875
01:13:22,479 --> 01:13:26,839
a file nine though because I've

1876
01:13:24,639 --> 01:13:28,359
experienced this recently and I don't

1877
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:30,840
think you everybody needs to be out here

1878
01:13:28,359 --> 01:13:33,479
making money off of doing [ __ ] but like

1879
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:35,400
when you do when you are doing [ __ ] for

1880
01:13:33,479 --> 01:13:38,079
people like a podcast or a show you are

1881
01:13:35,399 --> 01:13:39,638
creating like value for people so like I

1882
01:13:38,079 --> 01:13:43,439
do understand when some of these shows

1883
01:13:39,639 --> 01:13:44,960
do bring in like sponsors or a brand or

1884
01:13:43,439 --> 01:13:46,719
whatever but I think it's the way they

1885
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:49,639
approach it and it is like you were

1886
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:51,600
saying it's like uh the everything is

1887
01:13:49,639 --> 01:13:54,279
like a question leading up to it whereas

1888
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:56,400
like if at the end of the video you or

1889
01:13:54,279 --> 01:13:58,399
like 5 Seconds at the beginning or 5

1890
01:13:56,399 --> 01:14:00,799
Seconds at the end just say hey like you

1891
01:13:58,399 --> 01:14:02,719
know uh you know that we're sponsored by

1892
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:04,079
these people da da check these prods out

1893
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:05,639
here you go boom that's it that's all

1894
01:14:04,079 --> 01:14:08,119
you got to do but it's like you said

1895
01:14:05,639 --> 01:14:09,960
when it's a constant like oh you know

1896
01:14:08,119 --> 01:14:12,599
like every five [ __ ] seconds they're

1897
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:14,279
like making a plug about their [ __ ] it's

1898
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:17,600
yeah it's too much because like there

1899
01:14:14,279 --> 01:14:19,399
you know it is a lot of work uh for some

1900
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:21,159
for some of these people to do [ __ ] I'd

1901
01:14:19,399 --> 01:14:22,719
imagine but like I think that's what's

1902
01:14:21,158 --> 01:14:25,158
great about like what like Matt does in

1903
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:26,639
the patreon it's like it's cool cuz like

1904
01:14:25,158 --> 01:14:28,559
you don't have to buy like products or

1905
01:14:26,639 --> 01:14:30,279
nothing you can just support like if you

1906
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:32,840
want to through that way it's like five

1907
01:14:30,279 --> 01:14:34,880
bucks you can join it's you know five

1908
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:37,360
bucks ain't [ __ ] a month for in my

1909
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:39,079
opinion and it does filter out a lot of

1910
01:14:37,359 --> 01:14:41,399
people that are there just start the

1911
01:14:39,079 --> 01:14:43,359
drama and stuff you know so well it's

1912
01:14:41,399 --> 01:14:46,039
like a dream to get sponsored by like

1913
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:47,519
good products you actually use I don't

1914
01:14:46,039 --> 01:14:49,158
think there's anything wrong with that

1915
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:51,199
it's just like just don't be plugging me

1916
01:14:49,158 --> 01:14:54,158
some [ __ ] that has nothing to do you

1917
01:14:51,198 --> 01:14:58,399
know what I mean like or scammy new

1918
01:14:54,158 --> 01:15:01,000
thing yeah um like fertilizer is like

1919
01:14:58,399 --> 01:15:03,119
such an easy one where I'm just like

1920
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,840
like God damn man like most of these

1921
01:15:03,119 --> 01:15:06,760
companies it's just like yeah you like

1922
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:08,719
grow some fine weed with it and all but

1923
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:10,360
like when you do like get on something

1924
01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:12,920
like some Cana you're just like dude

1925
01:15:10,359 --> 01:15:15,960
this makes me look good it's [ __ ]

1926
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:18,000
easy to use it's just like it's a really

1927
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:21,198
good product you know what I mean and it

1928
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:23,319
has been for a long period of time too

1929
01:15:21,198 --> 01:15:26,719
so we're not we're not sponsored by Cana

1930
01:15:23,319 --> 01:15:29,319
but hey yo Cana

1931
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:33,719
yeah up bro you know running low on

1932
01:15:29,319 --> 01:15:35,039
Boost yeah bro no but yeah if I think if

1933
01:15:33,719 --> 01:15:36,840
you know people don't want to talk about

1934
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:38,920
that kind of [ __ ] because it is very a

1935
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:41,119
lot of people uh we've talked about this

1936
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:42,840
before people want to join a Discord or

1937
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:44,359
or a community just to talk about weed

1938
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:47,119
they don't get pluged stuff every five

1939
01:15:44,359 --> 01:15:50,158
minutes yeah but I do think like if if

1940
01:15:47,119 --> 01:15:52,399
the if it makes sense and the person in

1941
01:15:50,158 --> 01:15:54,719
charge is has their [ __ ] together

1942
01:15:52,399 --> 01:15:56,799
financially already it could actually be

1943
01:15:54,719 --> 01:15:59,198
pretty beneficial to the community too

1944
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:00,719
because like like like for example with

1945
01:15:59,198 --> 01:16:03,439
like we do the grow offs the

1946
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:05,039
competitions and [ __ ] like to be able to

1947
01:16:03,439 --> 01:16:06,119
put more prizes in [ __ ] like that if

1948
01:16:05,039 --> 01:16:09,238
you're actually doing that kind of [ __ ]

1949
01:16:06,119 --> 01:16:10,960
I think is awesome uh I think uh I think

1950
01:16:09,238 --> 01:16:12,359
too you know uh if you're actually

1951
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:14,000
creating real value for people and

1952
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:17,279
they're willing to do some patreon stuff

1953
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:18,800
for you that's really cool um but I also

1954
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:21,079
I also think like you were saying if it

1955
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:22,719
makes sense oh if if we're going to talk

1956
01:16:21,079 --> 01:16:25,800
about some plugin Mars Hydro I've been

1957
01:16:22,719 --> 01:16:29,399
rocking with you for five years I know

1958
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:31,520
hook a brother up dude no but know Mark

1959
01:16:29,399 --> 01:16:33,679
hydra's got like the [ __ ] Market

1960
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:35,560
quarters for like the more affordable

1961
01:16:33,679 --> 01:16:37,199
[ __ ] and then like all the way to AC

1962
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:39,039
Infinity which is like a little more

1963
01:16:37,198 --> 01:16:41,919
bougie but they make good products too

1964
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:44,079
man yeah they do so it's just like uh

1965
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:45,480
you know it's just like I don't know

1966
01:16:44,079 --> 01:16:47,238
it's it's just it's especially if you're

1967
01:16:45,479 --> 01:16:49,759
new to all this even just getting

1968
01:16:47,238 --> 01:16:52,759
exposed to the companies could be right

1969
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:56,760
you know so I wish there was

1970
01:16:52,760 --> 01:17:00,079
more it's like they kind of go for

1971
01:16:56,760 --> 01:17:01,360
some the more fluff ones well I think

1972
01:17:00,079 --> 01:17:04,399
that being said since we'll probably

1973
01:17:01,359 --> 01:17:08,439
have some new people uh watching uh you

1974
01:17:04,399 --> 01:17:09,839
know guys gals I should say uh the

1975
01:17:08,439 --> 01:17:12,359
products aren't what's going to make

1976
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:14,840
your grow the best that it can be it it

1977
01:17:12,359 --> 01:17:16,839
can help in certain degrees like there

1978
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:18,520
are so many variables to grow [ __ ]

1979
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:21,159
weed I mean I don't think you really

1980
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:23,199
ever have a perfect run that being said

1981
01:17:21,158 --> 01:17:25,799
a lot of the guys included myself and

1982
01:17:23,198 --> 01:17:27,839
gals have used uh equipment from and I

1983
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:30,199
do today in my garden now I mean I have

1984
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:33,520
products from all the companies really

1985
01:17:30,198 --> 01:17:35,279
and really now nowaday is a nowadays is

1986
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:37,400
a great time for a new grower because

1987
01:17:35,279 --> 01:17:39,119
the products and the competition is so

1988
01:17:37,399 --> 01:17:41,039
fearsome amongst these companies that

1989
01:17:39,119 --> 01:17:43,760
they're all pretty consistent you're

1990
01:17:41,039 --> 01:17:46,560
going to get pretty decent results uh

1991
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:49,360
from most of them I would say I mean I I

1992
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:53,080
go from using them I use Mars hydro and

1993
01:17:49,359 --> 01:17:58,399
I use h&amp; or not H&amp;L I use Mars Hydro

1994
01:17:53,079 --> 01:18:00,359
lights and I use H&amp;L hlg lights um do I

1995
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:03,359
think anyone's even any better I would

1996
01:18:00,359 --> 01:18:06,198
say the hlg I've had better runs more

1997
01:18:03,359 --> 01:18:07,439
consistent h&amp; LG see this is the point

1998
01:18:06,198 --> 01:18:09,759
where we talked about ear smoking too

1999
01:18:07,439 --> 01:18:13,119
much I do have more consistent better

2000
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:16,280
runs with the hlg light but I have also

2001
01:18:13,119 --> 01:18:18,359
had runs where the runs in the Mars

2002
01:18:16,279 --> 01:18:21,279
Hydro light tents have came out better

2003
01:18:18,359 --> 01:18:25,399
than the hlg so it's like uh you know

2004
01:18:21,279 --> 01:18:27,920
that's a uh for a 4x4 that's a 250 light

2005
01:18:25,399 --> 01:18:29,799
versus I think the Blackbird one of the

2006
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:33,079
black it's like seven I think it's like

2007
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:34,360
7 700 bro so yeah yeah they're worth it

2008
01:18:33,079 --> 01:18:36,039
but it's just like if you don't got the

2009
01:18:34,359 --> 01:18:38,799
money you don't got the money you know

2010
01:18:36,039 --> 01:18:41,319
like um but it was a game changer for me

2011
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:44,079
I was rocking some like old first gen

2012
01:18:41,319 --> 01:18:46,359
LED kind of [ __ ] and I switched to an

2013
01:18:44,079 --> 01:18:48,039
hlg and was like immediately back where

2014
01:18:46,359 --> 01:18:49,399
I needed to be you know I was just like

2015
01:18:48,039 --> 01:18:51,399
oh thank God it was just the [ __ ]

2016
01:18:49,399 --> 01:18:53,238
light I thought I sucked at this and I'm

2017
01:18:51,399 --> 01:18:55,799
not amazing you know what I mean I was a

2018
01:18:53,238 --> 01:18:58,119
cash Cropper like not like like

2019
01:18:55,800 --> 01:19:00,039
Bittersweet is like to the tea you know

2020
01:18:58,119 --> 01:19:02,079
what I mean like that man knows his [ __ ]

2021
01:19:00,039 --> 01:19:04,800
and is good at what he does like I do

2022
01:19:02,079 --> 01:19:07,639
not claim to be that kind of guy no but

2023
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:09,560
at the same time for a hundred bucks I

2024
01:19:07,639 --> 01:19:12,960
could probably grow you like five pounds

2025
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:16,719
of weed outside you know and so it's

2026
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:18,760
just like you know yeah yeah yeah that's

2027
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:22,158
being said I try to do this on the

2028
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:24,320
intros but any myself included anybody

2029
01:19:22,158 --> 01:19:26,479
we have on the show I personally don't

2030
01:19:24,319 --> 01:19:28,079
claim to be expert I no you don't Dan

2031
01:19:26,479 --> 01:19:30,198
and we're just speaking from our own

2032
01:19:28,079 --> 01:19:32,399
experience I mean I'm not a scientist I

2033
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:35,079
barely graduated [ __ ] third grade I'm

2034
01:19:32,399 --> 01:19:37,679
not really either yeah so all this [ __ ]

2035
01:19:35,079 --> 01:19:40,119
like I think the best thing we can do is

2036
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:41,840
try to help new Growers by just speaking

2037
01:19:40,119 --> 01:19:43,800
from our own experience and that being

2038
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:46,480
said it's not about the equipment y'all

2039
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:49,159
I mean I think as far as IEM not a like

2040
01:19:46,479 --> 01:19:50,479
guy Bittersweet shout out you're the guy

2041
01:19:49,158 --> 01:19:52,920
like I said join the Discord if you want

2042
01:19:50,479 --> 01:19:54,759
some real actual factual information but

2043
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:56,800
speaking from experience I don't know

2044
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:59,239
LEDs have improved so dramatically over

2045
01:19:56,800 --> 01:20:00,719
the last five years that like I mean I

2046
01:19:59,238 --> 01:20:01,959
still am literally to this day I'm

2047
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:05,639
looking at one right now I have a

2048
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:07,239
[ __ ] 5-year-old Mars Hydro 100 watt

2049
01:20:05,639 --> 01:20:09,880
light running on my autos and it's

2050
01:20:07,238 --> 01:20:11,919
working just as good as the uh one I

2051
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:13,719
bought six months ago for the other

2052
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:15,399
little entt that I have so like I think

2053
01:20:13,719 --> 01:20:17,920
that's the main thing you want with LEDs

2054
01:20:15,399 --> 01:20:20,039
is longevity yeah you know does it do

2055
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:22,840
its job and does it stick around because

2056
01:20:20,039 --> 01:20:25,198
a lot of the first gen ones like the B

2057
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:27,679
would like burn out and [ __ ] or

2058
01:20:25,198 --> 01:20:29,879
like I don't know I a lot of them that

2059
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:32,880
ended up getting return in like

2060
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:35,480
commercial set trying to return

2061
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:37,480
40 they all went

2062
01:20:35,479 --> 01:20:40,759
out you know what I

2063
01:20:37,479 --> 01:20:44,439
mean like we're on like rural power man

2064
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:46,239
[ __ ] ain't ain't the main city grid like

2065
01:20:44,439 --> 01:20:49,479
well you say that but nowadays that

2066
01:20:46,238 --> 01:20:52,039
still happen so for example uh the ions

2067
01:20:49,479 --> 01:20:53,879
the 4 foot ion bar lights I forget

2068
01:20:52,039 --> 01:20:55,158
that's like 35 Watts maybe I forget what

2069
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:57,199
the wattage is on

2070
01:20:55,158 --> 01:20:59,879
Bittersweet put them on to me for my

2071
01:20:57,198 --> 01:21:02,359
clone racks and my seedlings uh they had

2072
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:05,520
a recall or I guess you call it a recall

2073
01:21:02,359 --> 01:21:08,759
of some kind of or whatever malfunction

2074
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:11,120
I got went to the uh hydro store and I

2075
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:14,079
guess a big bunch of them were basically

2076
01:21:11,119 --> 01:21:16,000
coming out like [ __ ] purple like and

2077
01:21:14,079 --> 01:21:19,000
they're not supposed to do that so they

2078
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:21,399
had they they gave me a a mine wouldn't

2079
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:23,319
even do it but hey first one speaks

2080
01:21:21,399 --> 01:21:27,079
loses they gave me a free light the free

2081
01:21:23,319 --> 01:21:29,799
set so I took it yeah yeah but that

2082
01:21:27,079 --> 01:21:32,119
being said uh you know I do use products

2083
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:34,560
from everybody and like you were saying

2084
01:21:32,119 --> 01:21:36,158
that the longevity U for me that think

2085
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:39,120
that's why I do [ __ ] with some of like

2086
01:21:36,158 --> 01:21:41,359
maybe a cheaper product uh you know like

2087
01:21:39,119 --> 01:21:44,119
say Mars Hydro because I have had lights

2088
01:21:41,359 --> 01:21:46,039
for five years that have you know a 100

2089
01:21:44,119 --> 01:21:48,198
watt light bro come on and I've like the

2090
01:21:46,039 --> 01:21:50,439
SK dog the best one of the best plants I

2091
01:21:48,198 --> 01:21:52,079
ever had was the skank dog and I [ __ ]

2092
01:21:50,439 --> 01:21:55,238
started flowering that [ __ ]

2093
01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:57,840
under that same little 100 watt light so

2094
01:21:55,238 --> 01:22:00,158
you know it's and the guys in the

2095
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:01,800
Discord will say all the time H&amp;L says

2096
01:22:00,158 --> 01:22:04,519
some of the best wheat he grows is the

2097
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:06,279
ones that are in the shade so it's like

2098
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:09,040
yeah so I don't know if that means

2099
01:22:06,279 --> 01:22:10,800
anything but bro signs basically but I

2100
01:22:09,039 --> 01:22:14,039
just did that where like basically I

2101
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:16,480
have one hlg over like a 4 by8 space and

2102
01:22:14,039 --> 01:22:18,560
I put it up a little higher because like

2103
01:22:16,479 --> 01:22:20,839
I have a bunch of plants right now that

2104
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:23,000
need to not be in that direct light

2105
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:24,639
especially not when they're finishing

2106
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:26,319
cuz like it went from I was looking at

2107
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:29,760
picked and it was like two weeks ago I

2108
01:22:26,319 --> 01:22:32,039
had like dark like nice green plants and

2109
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:33,760
within two weeks flat of being just like

2110
01:22:32,039 --> 01:22:35,039
a little too light stressed and I

2111
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:36,960
probably I think I went a little too

2112
01:22:35,039 --> 01:22:39,960
heavy on the calcium and lock some [ __ ]

2113
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:42,880
up um bidder got me back on track with

2114
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:44,239
that and so it's just like um you know

2115
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:46,000
it's little things like that where you

2116
01:22:44,238 --> 01:22:49,359
just live and learn with your plants you

2117
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:52,279
know is those am hazes and [ __ ] I say

2118
01:22:49,359 --> 01:22:54,719
the am when they're finishing they don't

2119
01:22:52,279 --> 01:22:57,559
want that direct light and the am I

2120
01:22:54,719 --> 01:23:00,760
don't think they want it ever they don't

2121
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:02,600
they want low and slow for like 14 weeks

2122
01:23:00,760 --> 01:23:04,280
bunch I noticed that I've said this

2123
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:07,199
before in the last episode or the one

2124
01:23:04,279 --> 01:23:08,479
before that when I grew the AMS uh

2125
01:23:07,198 --> 01:23:10,039
matter of fact I knew that same one

2126
01:23:08,479 --> 01:23:11,959
under white light when they were about

2127
01:23:10,039 --> 01:23:13,600
you know this stall and bro yeah the

2128
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:15,039
ones directly under the light they just

2129
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:16,880
didn't [ __ ] like it and it blew my

2130
01:23:15,039 --> 01:23:18,479
mind because growing up you know you

2131
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:20,760
hear about these hazes or these

2132
01:23:18,479 --> 01:23:23,479
equatorial [ __ ] varieties and you

2133
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:26,280
think like surely they're like they like

2134
01:23:23,479 --> 01:23:29,119
light bro come on like

2135
01:23:26,279 --> 01:23:30,920
what they're like my P ass bro they get

2136
01:23:29,119 --> 01:23:33,479
some

2137
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:36,399
sunburns yeah yeah sure yeah they don't

2138
01:23:33,479 --> 01:23:38,000
like it man yeah y so so you gota be you

2139
01:23:36,399 --> 01:23:39,519
got to stay flexible with that kind of

2140
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,800
thing or it's like if you see something

2141
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:42,760
happening with your plants that they

2142
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:44,960
don't like usually adding something is

2143
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:46,320
not the answer no you know what I mean

2144
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:48,039
that's where people always go it's like

2145
01:23:46,319 --> 01:23:49,639
well what am I what am I deficient in

2146
01:23:48,039 --> 01:23:51,519
and I'm like well you probably gave an

2147
01:23:49,639 --> 01:23:54,000
excess of something that actually locked

2148
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:56,280
up what you need and so you need to like

2149
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:58,800
get rid of some of that somehow or like

2150
01:23:56,279 --> 01:24:00,198
rebalance your ratios you know it's not

2151
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:02,159
really that something's missing or you

2152
01:24:00,198 --> 01:24:03,799
need to just dim your [ __ ] light you

2153
01:24:02,158 --> 01:24:05,759
know because everyone wants to like

2154
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:08,920
crank their LEDs all the way up but with

2155
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:10,880
like the hlg even like for a while like

2156
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:13,719
up above the the canopy you know more

2157
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:15,880
than a foot um they finish a lot closer

2158
01:24:13,719 --> 01:24:18,359
but so I don't have tall ceilings but

2159
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:21,880
they uh I don't think I think I started

2160
01:24:18,359 --> 01:24:24,719
like 30% and then I only get up to 70

2161
01:24:21,880 --> 01:24:26,199
anything past that and I'm cooking even

2162
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:27,679
you know like the the pH in the

2163
01:24:26,198 --> 01:24:29,719
beginning loved the light you know what

2164
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:32,359
I mean and it started cooking them too

2165
01:24:29,719 --> 01:24:35,079
so it's just like mine did too bro I

2166
01:24:32,359 --> 01:24:37,158
don't care at all what the par value is

2167
01:24:35,079 --> 01:24:38,679
and what the DLI is and [ __ ] you know

2168
01:24:37,158 --> 01:24:41,000
what I mean I'm just like is the plant

2169
01:24:38,679 --> 01:24:44,800
like doing what it needs to do well you

2170
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:49,079
know the Mars Hydro uh 450 it it even

2171
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:50,520
burnt the phes on like [ __ ] 60% bro

2172
01:24:49,079 --> 01:24:52,000
like I didn't know that's what it was

2173
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:53,800
doing at the time until you said

2174
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:56,719
something about it I thought it was just

2175
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:58,560
like nutrients bro because like I uh I

2176
01:24:56,719 --> 01:25:00,239
had went out of town and she re up

2177
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:01,920
potted it and I wanted her to upot them

2178
01:25:00,238 --> 01:25:03,319
into bigger pots but they she put them

2179
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:05,600
in two pots and they were already in

2180
01:25:03,319 --> 01:25:07,599
like a gallon basically so it didn't

2181
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:10,000
they and at the time I wasn't really

2182
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:12,840
leaning into bottles I was doing mainly

2183
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:16,039
just uh leaning into my media or my my

2184
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:17,880
soil and stuff and my uh my I wasn't

2185
01:25:16,039 --> 01:25:21,039
really in dry amendments a little bit

2186
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:22,840
here or there and like in flour basic in

2187
01:25:21,039 --> 01:25:25,639
flour I would lean into bottles a little

2188
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:27,840
bit but yeah yeah uh this run I've been

2189
01:25:25,639 --> 01:25:29,800
so proud of myself dude and happy with

2190
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:32,000
uh and I'm not plugging Cana because you

2191
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:35,039
could get way cheaper nutrients Cana is

2192
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:37,760
not the uh uh best nutrient line in the

2193
01:25:35,039 --> 01:25:41,519
world it's just easy to use basically

2194
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:44,239
for me and um great results yeah it's

2195
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:47,000
great results dude I mean I went from H

2196
01:25:44,238 --> 01:25:50,718
you know starting to have trouble uh

2197
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:52,679
with a plant in an ocean Fox Farm like

2198
01:25:50,719 --> 01:25:55,000
you know three four weeks in if I didn't

2199
01:25:52,679 --> 01:25:57,880
start not the same as it used to be

2200
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:00,238
bro I'm talking I got plants in little

2201
01:25:57,880 --> 01:26:03,520
[ __ ] cups I got them in Solo cups I

2202
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:05,879
got them in0 five gallon uh half gallons

2203
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:07,159
bro I would I I'd have pull some [ __ ]

2204
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:08,800
next time I'll be ready because Matt let

2205
01:26:07,158 --> 01:26:11,118
me show plants last episode nothing

2206
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:13,639
happened so next time I'll be ready but

2207
01:26:11,118 --> 01:26:15,198
I got a little I like it just have like

2208
01:26:13,639 --> 01:26:16,520
kind of changed the whole way of looking

2209
01:26:15,198 --> 01:26:18,559
and growing and I think this is

2210
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:20,000
important for new people watching to

2211
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:21,520
never really get set in your ways

2212
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,279
because you might think you're doing the

2213
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:24,639
best and I didn't really think that cuz

2214
01:26:23,279 --> 01:26:26,719
I think here's always room for

2215
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:29,520
improvement especially when you hang

2216
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:32,000
around with the caliber of guys that we

2217
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:33,960
hang around with and girls uh with the

2218
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:37,399
experience and the knowledge and stuff

2219
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:39,319
it rubs off on you but uh yeah dude like

2220
01:26:37,399 --> 01:26:41,479
this run is probably gonna be my best

2221
01:26:39,319 --> 01:26:43,479
run I went around in every [ __ ] light

2222
01:26:41,479 --> 01:26:46,399
I own I went and looked up the

2223
01:26:43,479 --> 01:26:49,039
manufacturing recommendations bro I got

2224
01:26:46,399 --> 01:26:51,399
every because for Years bro I kind of

2225
01:26:49,039 --> 01:26:53,399
just there's been times where I've like

2226
01:26:51,399 --> 01:26:55,238
ramped up my inputs into my grows of

2227
01:26:53,399 --> 01:26:57,039
course like trying new [ __ ] or like

2228
01:26:55,238 --> 01:26:58,759
really stay on top of them phing and all

2229
01:26:57,039 --> 01:27:01,439
this stuff I've always stayed on top of

2230
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:02,679
phing but like never really measuring

2231
01:27:01,439 --> 01:27:04,960
nutrients and things like that I've

2232
01:27:02,679 --> 01:27:07,520
always worked on visuals and or like

2233
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:10,600
preventative things uh and trying to be

2234
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:12,560
ahead of it a little bit but um and

2235
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:14,159
especially when you work in the same

2236
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:16,320
environment for four or five years you

2237
01:27:14,158 --> 01:27:17,839
kind of understand your you know your

2238
01:27:16,319 --> 01:27:19,599
water's coming out the same pH just

2239
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:21,760
about every time so like you get set

2240
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:24,199
into these rhythms and you're growing

2241
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:27,119
the same plants the same cut so uh it's

2242
01:27:24,198 --> 01:27:29,118
kind of becomes easy but uh yeah man

2243
01:27:27,118 --> 01:27:31,479
this Canon [ __ ] has really stepped it up

2244
01:27:29,118 --> 01:27:33,639
it's it's changed the way I grow so now

2245
01:27:31,479 --> 01:27:36,198
I've been going keeping [ __ ] in Solo

2246
01:27:33,639 --> 01:27:37,880
cups or [ __ ] 0. five gallons I like

2247
01:27:36,198 --> 01:27:40,279
the 05 because it's a little bit bigger

2248
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:41,560
of a root ball to start with and then I

2249
01:27:40,279 --> 01:27:43,479
just straight up I've been using those

2250
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:44,840
AC you said you don't care for them much

2251
01:27:43,479 --> 01:27:46,439
because you had to do hundreds of them

2252
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:49,840
at a time but I've been using those

2253
01:27:46,439 --> 01:27:52,238
[ __ ] AC uh fabric uh they're kind of

2254
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:54,679
like a like a fabric bag but they're

2255
01:27:52,238 --> 01:27:58,039
real thin so the roots can penate and

2256
01:27:54,679 --> 01:27:59,679
bro I love them bro I just sit them once

2257
01:27:58,039 --> 01:28:01,439
again they got their place I use them

2258
01:27:59,679 --> 01:28:03,560
occasionally set them right down into

2259
01:28:01,439 --> 01:28:05,919
the [ __ ] three or three I I've been

2260
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:08,400
doing three three gallons but I set them

2261
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:10,359
right down in in a three gallon and uh

2262
01:28:08,399 --> 01:28:13,000
dude I give them a week or so just

2263
01:28:10,359 --> 01:28:15,799
chilling and uh yeah man and then I flip

2264
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:18,319
bro and I got I mean I'd show you [ __ ] I

2265
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:20,279
it's giving me better plants like I used

2266
01:28:18,319 --> 01:28:22,799
to up poot like uh at least once

2267
01:28:20,279 --> 01:28:24,599
sometimes twice and he giving me bigger

2268
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:25,719
PL I mean this skank dog bro I kid you

2269
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:29,480
not I'm going to show some pictures this

2270
01:28:25,719 --> 01:28:31,760
gang dog is [ __ ] huge bro I'm I'm

2271
01:28:29,479 --> 01:28:33,638
it's that local Tech man the [ __ ] six

2272
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:36,880
foot plant in a one gallon pot that get

2273
01:28:33,639 --> 01:28:38,639
watered three times a day yep I I

2274
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:41,039
actually got some one gallons too bro

2275
01:28:38,639 --> 01:28:42,679
and they're [ __ ] bigger than plants

2276
01:28:41,039 --> 01:28:45,079
that I used to grow in three gallons

2277
01:28:42,679 --> 01:28:46,639
it's wild yeah I just threw some new

2278
01:28:45,079 --> 01:28:48,800
plants in the Perpetual that's like a

2279
01:28:46,639 --> 01:28:51,679
pheno hunt of clones that I took off

2280
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:54,440
some little seed bombs that I keep tiny

2281
01:28:51,679 --> 01:28:56,639
um and when I do stuff like that I L

2282
01:28:54,439 --> 01:28:58,519
like pot it into the one gallon directly

2283
01:28:56,639 --> 01:29:00,239
and I just send it just put it right

2284
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:02,080
into the perpetual and then you'll end

2285
01:29:00,238 --> 01:29:04,718
up with like a little plant like that

2286
01:29:02,079 --> 01:29:08,039
you know like yeah 18 inches or two feet

2287
01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:09,639
tall and sometimes you'll be blown away

2288
01:29:08,039 --> 01:29:11,600
because like you can do that and still

2289
01:29:09,639 --> 01:29:13,520
end up with a four or five foot tall

2290
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:15,840
like full size [ __ ] plant like you

2291
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:18,960
look at commercial grow now there's

2292
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:18,960
never more than a gallon

2293
01:29:19,639 --> 01:29:28,000
of nobody grows a soil anymore right

2294
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:28,000
yeah and you'll have an

2295
01:29:29,679 --> 01:29:34,880
entire one with like two drip

2296
01:29:35,719 --> 01:29:40,920
emitters you know yeah so that's one

2297
01:29:39,639 --> 01:29:43,560
thing I've learned that's helped me a

2298
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:46,118
lot is like keep your [ __ ] like the

2299
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:47,639
whole dry backs thing I think I've kind

2300
01:29:46,118 --> 01:29:49,559
of come to the conclusion that it's like

2301
01:29:47,639 --> 01:29:52,760
well you need it to a certain extent but

2302
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:55,800
actually like if you look at like a like

2303
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:57,880
a moisture content EC in the soil when

2304
01:29:55,800 --> 01:30:01,279
you have full dry backs you're doing

2305
01:29:57,880 --> 01:30:04,000
this huge wave of just like super high

2306
01:30:01,279 --> 01:30:06,880
EC when it's drve like super low

2307
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:09,719
moisture content or know it's just none

2308
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:12,359
of it's you're just like edging towards

2309
01:30:09,719 --> 01:30:15,079
dis and this Pass Run what I've been

2310
01:30:12,359 --> 01:30:18,000
trying to do is just keep everything

2311
01:30:15,079 --> 01:30:21,079
pretty moist all the time like not like

2312
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:24,238
water loged and super heav but it's

2313
01:30:21,079 --> 01:30:27,158
changed the game I grew some fire like

2314
01:30:24,238 --> 01:30:28,678
uh I had like one issue that set off

2315
01:30:27,158 --> 01:30:30,719
like two weeks ago when I kind of got

2316
01:30:28,679 --> 01:30:33,239
some of my yellowing like what prompted

2317
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:35,158
it was like a late water I got home

2318
01:30:33,238 --> 01:30:38,238
super late I was [ __ ] exhausted I

2319
01:30:35,158 --> 01:30:40,319
should have just B down 20 minutes the

2320
01:30:38,238 --> 01:30:42,439
[ __ ] out I go down and the plants are

2321
01:30:40,319 --> 01:30:44,279
like starting to hang just a little bit

2322
01:30:42,439 --> 01:30:46,238
and ever since then that's when all the

2323
01:30:44,279 --> 01:30:48,880
problems came up you know yeah and so

2324
01:30:46,238 --> 01:30:50,678
it's like like I don't I don't Edge like

2325
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:53,239
that with dryb backs anymore just like I

2326
01:30:50,679 --> 01:30:54,440
want consistent moisture with his

2327
01:30:53,238 --> 01:30:57,279
minimal VAR

2328
01:30:54,439 --> 01:30:58,799
at the optimal Point always you yeah and

2329
01:30:57,279 --> 01:31:01,118
that's what commercial Growers do now

2330
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:02,840
too that's why they water every 45

2331
01:31:01,118 --> 01:31:04,399
minutes for a few seconds or whatever is

2332
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:08,520
like you're try to keep it in this band

2333
01:31:04,399 --> 01:31:11,238
of optimal not like too wet too dry too

2334
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:13,119
wet too dry especially with Coco like

2335
01:31:11,238 --> 01:31:16,319
when you see the media change color to

2336
01:31:13,118 --> 01:31:18,439
that dry lighter brown like you already

2337
01:31:16,319 --> 01:31:20,479
[ __ ] up you know like you don't need

2338
01:31:18,439 --> 01:31:23,599
to dry back cocoa at all it's got

2339
01:31:20,479 --> 01:31:25,519
built-in paracity you know see what I've

2340
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:27,840
noticed with I think it depends on like

2341
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:30,520
what you're growing in I I noticed with

2342
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:32,279
the ocean bro if you're watering like I

2343
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:33,480
know obviously you're doing way less if

2344
01:31:32,279 --> 01:31:36,158
you're doing and when you're doing it

2345
01:31:33,479 --> 01:31:38,879
more often but bro I noticed I see it

2346
01:31:36,158 --> 01:31:43,158
right now because I got uh I would say

2347
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:46,840
two or three T um uh our promix uh

2348
01:31:43,158 --> 01:31:48,319
promix with microa really low obviously

2349
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:50,800
not a lot of food in there and then the

2350
01:31:48,319 --> 01:31:53,079
other half are on the ocean and dude

2351
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:54,520
ocean I will say bro you got to be very

2352
01:31:53,079 --> 01:31:58,559
[ __ ] careful especially with like

2353
01:31:54,520 --> 01:32:00,560
triangle kushes and like this certain um

2354
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:01,600
I guess OG leaners I don't know britter

2355
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:04,080
talked about this before and he could

2356
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:06,679
speak on it better but uh I noticed if

2357
01:32:04,079 --> 01:32:08,519
in the ocean yeah bro like I guess we I

2358
01:32:06,679 --> 01:32:09,920
don't know if it's the ocean itself it's

2359
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:11,800
not that it's a bad product or anything

2360
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:14,000
it's just it's very easy to over waterer

2361
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:16,600
I noticed in it and I noticed like when

2362
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:18,198
I have the uh promix where it's so

2363
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:19,840
[ __ ] I mean that [ __ ] you can't even

2364
01:32:18,198 --> 01:32:21,759
hardly overwater that it's really hard

2365
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:24,079
to overw waterer oh yeah it's just with

2366
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:26,239
the with the amount of pearlite in it

2367
01:32:24,079 --> 01:32:27,920
like it's pretty hard to overwater like

2368
01:32:26,238 --> 01:32:29,919
you can do it because like with Pete

2369
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:32,158
Moss it just keeps expanding the sponge

2370
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:33,960
just gets bigger and more full of water

2371
01:32:32,158 --> 01:32:36,519
yeah like Coco just gets to a certain

2372
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:38,560
point and then drops it yeah just flows

2373
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:40,400
through you know and so that's why I

2374
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:42,280
point beginners towards Coco even though

2375
01:32:40,399 --> 01:32:43,439
in some ways it can be a little more

2376
01:32:42,279 --> 01:32:46,319
difficult or like you know just

2377
01:32:43,439 --> 01:32:47,559
knowledge intensive to do it right but

2378
01:32:46,319 --> 01:32:49,679
like you're at least not going to [ __ ]

2379
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:52,000
up your like with overwatering which I

2380
01:32:49,679 --> 01:32:53,239
feel like is like the new guy mistake

2381
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:55,719
where it's just like you're just trying

2382
01:32:53,238 --> 01:33:00,279
to pump you know yeah they're not ready

2383
01:32:55,719 --> 01:33:02,118
for it yeah the um yeah I think I think

2384
01:33:00,279 --> 01:33:04,439
you gotta be definitely careful for sure

2385
01:33:02,118 --> 01:33:06,439
if you're doing some ocean but co coco

2386
01:33:04,439 --> 01:33:09,238
can have its own challenges too though

2387
01:33:06,439 --> 01:33:11,919
as well um I think uh since we're kind

2388
01:33:09,238 --> 01:33:13,000
of talking about people new Growers

2389
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:14,920
there might be some people out there

2390
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:16,439
that don't even know what the defin or

2391
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:18,600
maybe not the definition but what dve

2392
01:33:16,439 --> 01:33:20,479
Drive backs even mean could you explain

2393
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:24,159
that maybe for like new

2394
01:33:20,479 --> 01:33:25,678
people yeah so like the normal like I

2395
01:33:24,158 --> 01:33:29,439
guess is like you've got your pot of

2396
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:31,399
media cocoa you know let's not talk

2397
01:33:29,439 --> 01:33:35,319
include Hydro at all in this like cocoa

2398
01:33:31,399 --> 01:33:37,759
or or potting soil and uh when you first

2399
01:33:35,319 --> 01:33:40,158
water it it's kind of like hit this

2400
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:42,119
point of like saturation you know what I

2401
01:33:40,158 --> 01:33:44,879
mean and like that for a little while is

2402
01:33:42,118 --> 01:33:47,799
fine but if you what's happening is like

2403
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:50,039
that water is filling the the pore

2404
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:53,199
spaces between all the little fragments

2405
01:33:50,039 --> 01:33:56,560
of theia and the uh Peet Moss itself

2406
01:33:53,198 --> 01:33:58,519
expands so you need air space in the

2407
01:33:56,560 --> 01:34:03,000
soil for that root to basically breathe

2408
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:04,639
and do its own gas exchange and so um

2409
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:06,920
when you first water or if you overw

2410
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:09,560
waterer You' filled all that air space

2411
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:12,399
up and it's gone and so you can just

2412
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:16,400
suffocate the root and so drying back is

2413
01:34:12,399 --> 01:34:20,000
like the dry back from saturated to bone

2414
01:34:16,399 --> 01:34:21,799
dry like zero saturation of moisture you

2415
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:24,399
know and so there's an Optimum point in

2416
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:26,800
the middle somewhere depending on what

2417
01:34:24,399 --> 01:34:29,638
you're using and the pot size and I'm

2418
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:33,159
not sure what the uh

2419
01:34:29,639 --> 01:34:35,880
um uh the unit would be in that you know

2420
01:34:33,158 --> 01:34:37,879
but uh there is an Optimum point where

2421
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:39,800
you have the right amount of moisture

2422
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:42,239
for the root the right amount of air

2423
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:43,920
space for air exchange and then also

2424
01:34:42,238 --> 01:34:46,479
like you know like the fertilizer inside

2425
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:48,158
that it needs to hell yeah dude that's

2426
01:34:46,479 --> 01:34:51,359
awesome yeah yeah I think there's a lot

2427
01:34:48,158 --> 01:34:53,039
of terms that um we use on the main show

2428
01:34:51,359 --> 01:34:55,839
with Matt or whatever that are a little

2429
01:34:53,039 --> 01:34:57,880
he for people I mean we got new people

2430
01:34:55,840 --> 01:34:59,400
that join the Discord and we'll ask some

2431
01:34:57,880 --> 01:35:02,679
newer questions so I think it's kind of

2432
01:34:59,399 --> 01:35:04,479
important to to kind of you know I know

2433
01:35:02,679 --> 01:35:06,840
Matt doesn't care to do a lot of grow

2434
01:35:04,479 --> 01:35:08,039
content but or you know teaching people

2435
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:10,279
but I think it's kind of important

2436
01:35:08,039 --> 01:35:12,800
because you know if we want people to

2437
01:35:10,279 --> 01:35:14,359
grow better weed and stuff like that you

2438
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:17,279
do have to kind of splice that in a

2439
01:35:14,359 --> 01:35:19,039
little bit and I think a a quick little

2440
01:35:17,279 --> 01:35:21,000
tip for people out there that are are

2441
01:35:19,039 --> 01:35:24,039
new Growers and you and you are having

2442
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:26,158
problems uh overw waterer and uh just

2443
01:35:24,039 --> 01:35:28,039
just dip your pots up guys you know the

2444
01:35:26,158 --> 01:35:30,759
first time you [ __ ] water them in

2445
01:35:28,039 --> 01:35:32,198
feel how heavy that is weigh it uh and

2446
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:34,079
then weigh it again when it's completely

2447
01:35:32,198 --> 01:35:36,279
dry calculate the difference or if you

2448
01:35:34,079 --> 01:35:39,079
don't want to get [ __ ] too crazy just

2449
01:35:36,279 --> 01:35:41,079
feel it I mean just feel it and I mean

2450
01:35:39,079 --> 01:35:42,279
it's pretty simple but it is it is

2451
01:35:41,079 --> 01:35:44,559
challenging because that is one of the

2452
01:35:42,279 --> 01:35:46,079
bigger problems I feel like uh you know

2453
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:48,039
just I steal overw waterer sometimes

2454
01:35:46,079 --> 01:35:49,279
with myself just because uh you know if

2455
01:35:48,039 --> 01:35:51,279
I have to go somewhere and I'm not going

2456
01:35:49,279 --> 01:35:52,198
to be around for a little bit of course

2457
01:35:51,279 --> 01:35:53,920
you know I'm going to go ahead and get

2458
01:35:52,198 --> 01:35:55,839
them watered in I don't have have a

2459
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:58,319
[ __ ] irrigation system I'm not doing

2460
01:35:55,840 --> 01:36:01,039
Hydro like I I said my the way I have my

2461
01:35:58,319 --> 01:36:03,158
[ __ ] is real simple real low inputs I

2462
01:36:01,039 --> 01:36:05,000
like the kiss method you know people say

2463
01:36:03,158 --> 01:36:06,519
that all the time just keep it simple I

2464
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:10,000
still hand water a lot of [ __ ] I

2465
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:12,320
recently did get some of those uh uh

2466
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:14,238
wicking uh trays I might try some of

2467
01:36:12,319 --> 01:36:16,039
that [ __ ] out but yeah you sent me I saw

2468
01:36:14,238 --> 01:36:18,198
a photo of that yeah yeah yeah they're

2469
01:36:16,039 --> 01:36:20,479
pretty cool and they do work it's just

2470
01:36:18,198 --> 01:36:22,879
I'm my Gardens right now are so mobile

2471
01:36:20,479 --> 01:36:25,519
like I'm moving [ __ ] around I did do a

2472
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:27,719
little seed not too long ago so the

2473
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:30,440
particular Garden I wanted to use or

2474
01:36:27,719 --> 01:36:31,880
area I wanted to utilize them in uh the

2475
01:36:30,439 --> 01:36:34,519
tent specifically that was like the

2476
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:36,760
right size for everything uh I got a

2477
01:36:34,520 --> 01:36:38,800
bunch of Autos in there right now so

2478
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:42,560
it's just not set up for it uh but yeah

2479
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:44,119
dude um uh maybe to kind of jump back on

2480
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:46,119
uh kind of getting I don't know how long

2481
01:36:44,118 --> 01:36:47,799
we've even been running for but kind of

2482
01:36:46,118 --> 01:36:50,799
let's let's kind of get back to where

2483
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:52,239
the the Discord I guess you you at some

2484
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:54,719
point you join the Discord did you join

2485
01:36:52,238 --> 01:36:56,559
it right away or did you [ __ ] kind of

2486
01:36:54,719 --> 01:36:58,520
just watched the lives a little bit or

2487
01:36:56,560 --> 01:37:01,199
whatever or no yeah I just watched the

2488
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:04,040
lives for like and listened to the show

2489
01:37:01,198 --> 01:37:06,158
for like God maybe like the first two

2490
01:37:04,039 --> 01:37:10,279
years it was going you

2491
01:37:06,158 --> 01:37:13,719
know um and then because I only I've

2492
01:37:10,279 --> 01:37:16,880
only been on there for I think two years

2493
01:37:13,719 --> 01:37:18,960
now and the first year I was like pretty

2494
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:20,760
quiet and I didn't really talk to anyone

2495
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:22,840
and I I had no clue like the

2496
01:37:20,760 --> 01:37:24,520
affiliations and the friend groups and

2497
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:30,039
stuff and

2498
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:32,000
um and then uh Once Matt uh brought me

2499
01:37:30,039 --> 01:37:34,000
into the more Inner Circle then I

2500
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:37,000
started kind of like figuring out who's

2501
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:39,238
who and like how's everyone connected

2502
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:42,719
and like who's IRL friends and who's

2503
01:37:39,238 --> 01:37:45,118
like online only and [ __ ] like that but

2504
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:47,920
everybody's tied that's been the best

2505
01:37:45,118 --> 01:37:49,960
part is that it's like um the whole time

2506
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:52,719
I was growing weed I was into the nerdy

2507
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:56,039
[ __ ] but I had never been exposed to it

2508
01:37:52,719 --> 01:37:59,118
IRL you know like I never met another

2509
01:37:56,039 --> 01:38:01,039
dude that was into it in the same way or

2510
01:37:59,118 --> 01:38:02,039
questions or answers yeah or chick yeah

2511
01:38:01,039 --> 01:38:05,560
shout out

2512
01:38:02,039 --> 01:38:07,519
peaches yeah yeah exactly and so uh it's

2513
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:11,360
dope to just being a community of people

2514
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:12,760
that are like all into we in similar way

2515
01:38:11,359 --> 01:38:15,319
you know where it's just like no no

2516
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:17,079
we're nerding out on like the specifics

2517
01:38:15,319 --> 01:38:18,559
you know what I mean and like history in

2518
01:38:17,079 --> 01:38:19,760
general like you said it on one of the

2519
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:22,159
previous episodes it's like it's a

2520
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:25,119
pretty Niche like content you know what

2521
01:38:22,158 --> 01:38:26,399
I mean and so but there is like a market

2522
01:38:25,118 --> 01:38:29,880
for it and there's people that are

2523
01:38:26,399 --> 01:38:31,519
curious and so I'm happy to share my

2524
01:38:29,880 --> 01:38:33,118
knowledge and the things that I've

2525
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:35,040
experienced and learn through this whole

2526
01:38:33,118 --> 01:38:37,158
journey with it that's why I'm glad to

2527
01:38:35,039 --> 01:38:39,238
have you on and we were able to talk

2528
01:38:37,158 --> 01:38:41,198
talk about some of your experience out

2529
01:38:39,238 --> 01:38:43,198
and Cali and some of the more modern

2530
01:38:41,198 --> 01:38:45,678
[ __ ] because I do know there are a lot

2531
01:38:43,198 --> 01:38:47,839
of younger uh people out there that that

2532
01:38:45,679 --> 01:38:50,679
might watch that you know think that we

2533
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:52,880
only grow hazes and [ __ ] uh we do [ __ ]

2534
01:38:50,679 --> 01:38:54,639
with other [ __ ] like our Discord we you

2535
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:56,159
know we got a bunch of older dudes so

2536
01:38:54,639 --> 01:38:57,440
you know they going to they going to

2537
01:38:56,158 --> 01:38:59,679
joke on us a little bit when we're

2538
01:38:57,439 --> 01:39:01,279
popping the auto flowers and stuff but I

2539
01:38:59,679 --> 01:39:04,480
think that's part of the that's part of

2540
01:39:01,279 --> 01:39:06,039
how you know communities used to be bro

2541
01:39:04,479 --> 01:39:08,279
like it reminds me of hanging out in

2542
01:39:06,039 --> 01:39:10,118
like an auto mechanic shop we just give

2543
01:39:08,279 --> 01:39:13,039
each other [ __ ] all day and it's kind of

2544
01:39:10,118 --> 01:39:14,598
like the the best filtering system for

2545
01:39:13,039 --> 01:39:17,118
people that probably shouldn't be around

2546
01:39:14,599 --> 01:39:20,119
because if you get if you get butt hurt

2547
01:39:17,118 --> 01:39:22,158
by you know if you get butt hurt really

2548
01:39:20,118 --> 01:39:24,238

2552
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:34,840
know it you know it depends on how you

2553
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:36,679
approach it too like you know I came

2554
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:39,199
into the Discord making memes about

2555
01:39:36,679 --> 01:39:42,118

2559
01:39:45,319 --> 01:39:50,000

Kentucky because you know I feel like

2602
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:37,199

you know what I mean but like that Slow

2654
01:43:28,639 --> 01:43:33,359
Burn adrenaline where it's just like

2655
01:43:30,800 --> 01:43:35,560
cortisol just like that buildup you know

2656
01:43:33,359 --> 01:43:38,118
what I mean that's what I'm addicted

2657
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:40,440
yeah that just like impending doom but

2658
01:43:38,118 --> 01:43:43,399
it hasn't popped off yet like that's

2659
01:43:40,439 --> 01:43:45,039
like I I like living a normal life now

2660
01:43:43,399 --> 01:43:48,879
and just like working as like a [ __ ]

2661
01:43:45,039 --> 01:43:51,760
Carpenter and [ __ ] like um it's [ __ ]

2662
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:54,239
boring dude it is the only reason I can

2663
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:57,199
do carpentry is that it's like your mind

2664
01:43:54,238 --> 01:43:59,238
is occupied because it does take like I

2665
01:43:57,198 --> 01:44:01,719
haven't been doing it for so long that

2666
01:43:59,238 --> 01:44:02,959
it's like second nature to I mean I have

2667
01:44:01,719 --> 01:44:04,760
to think about what I'm doing I'm

2668
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:08,719
learning new [ __ ] all the time and so

2669
01:44:04,760 --> 01:44:11,400
it's like um like it keeps my mind like

2670
01:44:08,719 --> 01:44:12,840
still because I'm having to focus yeah

2671
01:44:11,399 --> 01:44:15,158
you know but I need that because if I'm

2672
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:17,440
not focused and I'm just like in my mind

2673
01:44:15,158 --> 01:44:19,319
about [ __ ] I'm just [ __ ] dude yeah

2674
01:44:17,439 --> 01:44:21,638
normal life can be like really

2675
01:44:19,319 --> 01:44:25,319
monotonous and boring compared to the

2676
01:44:21,639 --> 01:44:26,719
[ __ ] we used to do you know I I te her

2677
01:44:25,319 --> 01:44:28,479
back and forth sometimes I miss that

2678
01:44:26,719 --> 01:44:30,800
lifestyle but at the same time I did it

2679
01:44:28,479 --> 01:44:33,039
for so long I kind of look back too

2680
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:35,440
though I it is like a waste like I it

2681
01:44:33,039 --> 01:44:37,519
provided an income and a way of living

2682
01:44:35,439 --> 01:44:39,638
but like I did I kind of like got

2683
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:41,880
wrapped up in that lifestyle feel like a

2684
01:44:39,639 --> 01:44:44,639
little too hard and didn't really it

2685
01:44:41,880 --> 01:44:47,440
gave me uh the ability for a long time

2686
01:44:44,639 --> 01:44:50,960
to check out of reality and live in my

2687
01:44:47,439 --> 01:44:54,000
own little bubble and in the moment it

2688
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:56,319
was great but like people my like

2689
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:58,000
nephews and [ __ ] grew up around me and

2690
01:44:56,319 --> 01:44:59,599
like I didn't want to come I didn't want

2691
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:01,479
to come around doing the [ __ ] I was

2692
01:44:59,599 --> 01:45:03,960
doing because a lot of [ __ ] I was doing

2693
01:45:01,479 --> 01:45:05,638
was not good or it wasn't bad but it was

2694
01:45:03,960 --> 01:45:08,399
not [ __ ] that I wanted to get my my

2695
01:45:05,639 --> 01:45:10,840
family and my uh friends mixed up in I

2696
01:45:08,399 --> 01:45:12,598
mean to this day I mean my a lot of my

2697
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:13,880
friends and family didn't even KN knew

2698
01:45:12,599 --> 01:45:15,319
what I had done you know they all

2699
01:45:13,880 --> 01:45:17,199
thought I had a normal ass job for all

2700
01:45:15,319 --> 01:45:18,599
these years so I'm playing out like I

2701
01:45:17,198 --> 01:45:20,118
got a job to these people and they're

2702
01:45:18,599 --> 01:45:23,199
asking you know how's your job going

2703
01:45:20,118 --> 01:45:25,839
[ __ ] like that and great mom great mom

2704
01:45:23,198 --> 01:45:27,559
you know I'm you know she's thinking I

2705
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:30,960
got a job meanwhile I'm trapping out of

2706
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:34,440
her her house you know but any doing

2707
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:36,158
dumb [ __ ] the pitfalls for me was that I

2708
01:45:34,439 --> 01:45:38,598
got into this at a time where like you

2709
01:45:36,158 --> 01:45:41,638
didn't really need to hide anymore right

2710
01:45:38,599 --> 01:45:44,239
and so like I like all these older guys

2711
01:45:41,639 --> 01:45:46,719
they like had a full career while doing

2712
01:45:44,238 --> 01:45:48,079
this and when it kind of made it to the

2713
01:45:46,719 --> 01:45:49,439
point where it didn't make Financial

2714
01:45:48,079 --> 01:45:51,519
sense or they didn't really want to do

2715
01:45:49,439 --> 01:45:53,678
that side of it anymore they had that

2716
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:56,520
career to go to so now I'm like [ __ ]

about about this [ __ ] all the time like

2751
01:47:08,079 --> 01:47:12,158
I remember bro watching J santes you're

2752

a purpose and it's not like this thing

2763

Shady thing that I'm doing that I'm

2776
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:14,479

01:50:17,279 --> 01:50:23,519
[ __ ] like that's cool you know I uh I

2831
01:50:20,479 --> 01:50:25,879
took uh the resurrection uh

2832
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:28,920
this is the mobile one version not the

2833
01:50:25,880 --> 01:50:32,639
uh kimd 95 one this the resurrection

2834
01:50:28,920 --> 01:50:35,399
times the mobile one and uh I took uh

2835
01:50:32,639 --> 01:50:36,920
some pollen from uh I think it was just

2836
01:50:35,399 --> 01:50:38,598
the one I think I just had one mail from

2837
01:50:36,920 --> 01:50:41,039
that one I've done a bunch of them so

2838
01:50:38,599 --> 01:50:42,880
far but anyways took a mail some Po from

2839
01:50:41,039 --> 01:50:46,439
that one and then I hit all those phases

2840
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:48,078
that I uh grew oh did you yeah with that

2841
01:50:46,439 --> 01:50:49,559
uh I didn't get a ton and see because I

2842
01:50:48,078 --> 01:50:51,639
just did a real light dusting on like

2843
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:55,000
the lowers I probably

2844
01:50:51,639 --> 01:50:58,000
got I I probably got like maybe 100

2845
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:59,599
seeds but for me like that's more than

2846
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:02,039
that's that's more than enough for me

2847
01:50:59,599 --> 01:51:05,039
and a little decent little 20 pop or a

2848
01:51:02,039 --> 01:51:08,158
little 10 here 10 there but uh yeah you

2849
01:51:05,039 --> 01:51:09,920
know um that being said though uh you

2850
01:51:08,158 --> 01:51:12,598
know is there anything that you've grown

2851
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:14,239
out from the guys uh that excluding some

2852
01:51:12,599 --> 01:51:17,920
of the stuff you've already talked about

2853
01:51:14,238 --> 01:51:21,000
that's really stood out uh for you yeah

2854
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:23,279
the [ __ ] Eva for H&amp;L is probably some

2855
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:25,719
of my favorite weed I've

2856
01:51:23,279 --> 01:51:27,319
discovered like like blue dream was my

2857
01:51:25,719 --> 01:51:28,719
first one and there's another one blue

2858
01:51:27,319 --> 01:51:30,279
cheese that I really like too but

2859
01:51:28,719 --> 01:51:31,800
they're kind of in the same vein you

2860
01:51:30,279 --> 01:51:34,719
know what I mean one the cheese is a

2861
01:51:31,800 --> 01:51:36,599
little stonier and the blue dream is

2862
01:51:34,719 --> 01:51:38,039
like good little it's like gamer weed

2863
01:51:36,599 --> 01:51:39,960
you know what I mean it's like you feel

2864
01:51:38,039 --> 01:51:43,599
it but like you're still there like

2865
01:51:39,960 --> 01:51:46,198
[ __ ] pumped yeah um but the Eva dude

2866
01:51:43,599 --> 01:51:48,800

that that Pino one was just like like a

2871
01:51:56,840 --> 01:52:01,078
green crack like throwback I think is

2872
01:51:58,719 --> 01:52:03,439
what H&amp;L called it but it's just like it

2873

Rob Clark if there was anything you took

2944
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:48,360
away from it or or just your experience

2945
01:54:46,359 --> 01:54:51,198
meeting him like was he what you thought

2946
01:54:48,359 --> 01:54:52,639
he was going to be or or anything I

2947
01:54:51,198 --> 01:54:54,719
didn't really have like a of

2948
01:54:52,639 --> 01:54:56,760
preconceived notions because like I

2949
01:54:54,719 --> 01:54:58,920
wasn't deep into the forum stuff you

2950
01:54:56,760 --> 01:55:00,639
know like yeah that's that trip is

2951
01:54:58,920 --> 01:55:02,279
actually what prompted me to go back and

2952
01:55:00,639 --> 01:55:04,880
start reading all those old Forum

2953
01:55:02,279 --> 01:55:06,559
threads like with nible and like just

2954
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:09,239
like looking up old strains and like

2955
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:11,079
learning more about it and stuff and so

2956
01:55:09,238 --> 01:55:14,638
that's been like a later part of my

2957
01:55:11,078 --> 01:55:17,759
journey yeah uh but yeah it's got me way

2958
01:55:14,639 --> 01:55:20,920
into that stuff now and so like now like

2959
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:23,000

r.com if you want to check out that shet

3007
01:57:05,880 --> 01:57:09,760
go look it up but uh going to see him

3008
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:12,039
would be a a bucket list that would be

3009
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:14,360
[ __ ] cool bro and you know I have to

3010
01:57:12,039 --> 01:57:15,719
say like it's so humbling for me because

3011
01:57:14,359 --> 01:57:18,679
you know kind of like you were saying

3012
01:57:15,719 --> 01:57:20,520
with Rob like I don't know [ __ ] bro like

3013
01:57:18,679 --> 01:57:23,480
I really don't like I know how to grow

3014
01:57:20,520 --> 01:57:25,480
weed I know how to get house and smoke

3015
01:57:23,479 --> 01:57:27,799
uh you know the bare minimum of a [ __ ]

3016
01:57:25,479 --> 01:57:29,439
you know I I I don't I I'm not a

3017
01:57:27,800 --> 01:57:31,079
knowledgeable person I'm not a book

3018
01:57:29,439 --> 01:57:33,799
person like I don't claim to know a lot

3019
01:57:31,078 --> 01:57:36,000
of [ __ ] but uh it's really just humbling

3020
01:57:33,800 --> 01:57:37,560
just hanging out with these guys and

3021
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:39,520
yeah and like you said I felt kind of

3022
01:57:37,560 --> 01:57:41,520
like a dummy actually because I was you

3023
01:57:39,520 --> 01:57:42,840
know to me I was hanging out with I'm

3024
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:44,520
going to see this guy that almost

3025
01:57:42,840 --> 01:57:47,800
nobody's really got to meet other than

3026
01:57:44,520 --> 01:57:49,679
his his people right uh and so to be

3027
01:57:47,800 --> 01:57:52,880
able to go and talk to him about weed

3028
01:57:49,679 --> 01:57:55,078
especially and I I was like man like do

3029
01:57:52,880 --> 01:57:57,078
I have anything to bring to this and I

3030
01:57:55,078 --> 01:57:59,759
ultimately decided I don't so like I'm

3031
01:57:57,078 --> 01:58:01,960
like you said just listen to H and let

3032
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:04,960
H&amp;L do the talking and now looking back

3033
01:58:01,960 --> 01:58:07,039
I regret not having some [ __ ] to ask

3034
01:58:04,960 --> 01:58:10,118
because it's I mean since then I've

3035
01:58:07,039 --> 01:58:11,760
learned a lot and uh yeah and I feel

3036
01:58:10,118 --> 01:58:13,719
like yeah just doing the show with Mets

3037
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:15,360
like kind of made me realize like

3038
01:58:13,719 --> 01:58:16,679
there's way more bigger things and

3039
01:58:15,359 --> 01:58:18,799
important [ __ ] I should probably be

3040
01:58:16,679 --> 01:58:21,039
asking uh some of these guys especially

3041
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:22,639
some of the older dudes cuz uh uh you

3042
01:58:21,039 --> 01:58:24,599
know people pass away and I hope they

3043
01:58:22,639 --> 01:58:27,039
don't or you know obviously not to take

3044
01:58:24,599 --> 01:58:28,800
this uh bad tone or nothing but no but

3045
01:58:27,039 --> 01:58:31,880
everybody gets old yeah everybody gets

3046
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:34,039
old and everybody's time com so uh yeah

3047
01:58:31,880 --> 01:58:36,000
just being able to be going from

3048
01:58:34,039 --> 01:58:38,118
Kentucky bro this extreme has been such

3049
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:39,800
a [ __ ] rod for me that's why I don't

3050
01:58:38,118 --> 01:58:41,078
let it get past me every day that I'm so

3051
01:58:39,800 --> 01:58:42,560
thankful I don't put any of these guys

3052
01:58:41,078 --> 01:58:44,399
up on a pedestal because at the end of

3053
01:58:42,560 --> 01:58:46,400
the day I'm gonna always do my [ __ ] no

3054
01:58:44,399 --> 01:58:49,078
matter what I'll be me but but getting

3055
01:58:46,399 --> 01:58:51,118
the opportunity and getting the chance

3056
01:58:49,078 --> 01:58:55,799
to hang out with you guys and you you

3057
01:58:51,118 --> 01:58:57,479
and especially like H&amp;L Matt ER I mean

3058
01:58:55,800 --> 01:58:59,599
all the guys Sean everybody that getting

3059
01:58:57,479 --> 01:59:02,799
to talk to him and uh you know just

3060
01:58:59,599 --> 01:59:06,159
being a sponge and going from a dude

3061
01:59:02,800 --> 01:59:07,840
hustling in like Kentucky uh to like

3062
01:59:06,158 --> 01:59:10,078
being in Michigan being a hang out with

3063
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:12,199
you guys and and [ __ ] and it's it's

3064
01:59:10,078 --> 01:59:14,039
never lost on me bro I [ __ ] like I

3065
01:59:12,198 --> 01:59:15,799
said I it sounds nerdy because I know

3066
01:59:14,039 --> 01:59:17,679
some of you guys out there have been in

3067
01:59:15,800 --> 01:59:20,079
the black market [ __ ] and probably still

3068
01:59:17,679 --> 01:59:22,560
are to this day or maybe the industry

3069
01:59:20,078 --> 01:59:24,118
commercially or whatever some people

3070
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:26,039
like you said you get burned out on it

3071
01:59:24,118 --> 01:59:28,000
but bro like I'm not I feel like I

3072
01:59:26,039 --> 01:59:29,760
haven't really peaked bro cuz it's like

3073
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:31,840
I'm like a kid in a candy store where I

3074
01:59:29,760 --> 01:59:34,639
went years without talking to nobody

3075
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:38,159
about this [ __ ] and now I'm like able to

3076
01:59:34,639 --> 01:59:41,078
hang out these guys like H&amp;L and bitter

3077
01:59:38,158 --> 01:59:43,238
and Matt and like you know like any of

3078
01:59:41,078 --> 01:59:45,799
those or dislike them or whatever like

3079
01:59:43,238 --> 01:59:47,879
the experience that those guys have uh

3080
01:59:45,800 --> 01:59:50,320
yeah just on that level of learning how

3081
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:52,560
to be a better grower and I don't know

3082
01:59:50,319 --> 01:59:53,639
bro it's uh I tell tell her all the time

3083
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:55,280
I feel like I'm in my own little

3084
01:59:53,639 --> 01:59:57,760
simulation

3085
01:59:55,279 --> 02:00:00,559
dude like no I agree with you though

3086
01:59:57,760 --> 02:00:02,800
it's like you don't it's like I feel the

3087
02:00:00,560 --> 02:00:04,639
same way that's like I haven't peaked in

3088
02:00:02,800 --> 02:00:06,840
any real way because like I didn't know

3089
02:00:04,639 --> 02:00:08,400
any of this [ __ ] a year and a half ago

3090
02:00:06,840 --> 02:00:10,639
you know what I mean I'm still like in

3091
02:00:08,399 --> 02:00:12,238
that just absorb everything you can and

3092
02:00:10,639 --> 02:00:14,480
since like all the circles I came up

3093
02:00:12,238 --> 02:00:16,279
with were like cash crop dudes like they

3094
02:00:14,479 --> 02:00:17,638
thought all my questions and ideas were

3095
02:00:16,279 --> 02:00:20,399
[ __ ] stupid they're like that's not

3096
02:00:17,639 --> 02:00:22,639
how you make money dude you know so it's

3097
02:00:20,399 --> 02:00:25,439
just like I'd never met people like this

3098
02:00:22,639 --> 02:00:28,319
until I joined this group you know so

3099
02:00:25,439 --> 02:00:29,638
it's definitely like changed uh like I

3100
02:00:28,319 --> 02:00:31,679
was saying before it got me back into

3101
02:00:29,639 --> 02:00:34,560
weed before I was just like I just want

3102
02:00:31,679 --> 02:00:36,800
some good [ __ ] to smoke that's fine but

3103
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:39,239
now it's just like I'm back into making

3104
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:42,239
stuff and like trying new things again

3105
02:00:39,238 --> 02:00:44,078
and uh yeah everything I thought I knew

3106
02:00:42,238 --> 02:00:46,598
was like not it's like yeah maybe it

3107
02:00:44,078 --> 02:00:48,399
works or whatever you know but or a lot

3108
02:00:46,599 --> 02:00:50,199
of the [ __ ] I thought I knew about like

3109
02:00:48,399 --> 02:00:51,638
history and stuff was just like wrong

3110
02:00:50,198 --> 02:00:53,678
it's like one of those classic [ __ ]

3111
02:00:51,639 --> 02:00:56,800
stor that Matt's always like just

3112
02:00:53,679 --> 02:00:59,679
spelling for people and [ __ ] so yeah

3113

talking to this about but it's just I

3141
02:01:57,520 --> 02:02:02,840
think it was Stony where I was just like

3142
02:02:00,158 --> 02:02:05,118
dude like I've never had the opportunity

3143
02:02:02,840 --> 02:02:06,639
to like revive something old you know

3144
02:02:05,118 --> 02:02:09,158
what I mean that would be like a dream

3145
02:02:06,639 --> 02:02:11,760
come true is like have some old like

3146
02:02:09,158 --> 02:02:14,759
early 2000s packs or something you know

3147
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:16,520
and like try and just like bring some

3148
02:02:14,760 --> 02:02:18,239
sort of like bring it back onto the

3149
02:02:16,520 --> 02:02:19,520
scene in some way like some of these

3150
02:02:18,238 --> 02:02:21,919
guys have them like that would be a

3151
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:24,280
dream but I think I'm also just like not

3152
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:26,880
old enough and I wasn't in the scene at

3153
02:02:24,279 --> 02:02:28,960
the time to like have been there to buy

3154
02:02:26,880 --> 02:02:30,920
the scene require them and I don't know

3155

do have to make sacrifices I mean not

3196
02:04:09,279 --> 02:04:15,039
even from a uh you know in terms of

3197

just like in a legal Place grown weed uh

3199

3233
02:05:40,399 --> 02:05:44,279
if that's my dream too is to head out

3234
02:05:42,559 --> 02:05:46,480
that way I've been I talked about it a

3235
02:05:44,279 --> 02:05:48,078
bit with H&amp;L I was just like dude if I

3236
02:05:46,479 --> 02:05:50,000
didn't have like a family and like

3237
02:05:48,078 --> 02:05:51,840
elderly parents kind of like tying me

3238
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:55,118
down to California like I would would

3239
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:57,400
not live here I would visit twice a year

3240
02:05:55,118 --> 02:06:00,078
you know what I mean and like not look

3241
02:05:57,399 --> 02:06:02,039
back where I live it's like like we said

3242
02:06:00,078 --> 02:06:04,719
a few times so much [ __ ] money to

3243
02:06:02,039 --> 02:06:06,479
live here and like we're on like my wife

3244
02:06:04,719 --> 02:06:09,000
stays home so it's just like one [ __ ]

3245
02:06:06,479 --> 02:06:10,919
income it's just like and a lot of other

3246
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:12,599
places that's fine and you can do it you

3247
02:06:10,920 --> 02:06:14,000
know but it's just like here man it's

3248
02:06:12,599 --> 02:06:17,760
like it's Struggle Bus when you're on

3249
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:20,279
that solo income now I I wonder how much

3250
02:06:17,760 --> 02:06:22,280
uh the price of living and uh has

3251
02:06:20,279 --> 02:06:24,800
attributed to

3252
02:06:22,279 --> 02:06:27,118
uh the decline of that industry as well

3253
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:29,840
to a certain degree because I mean like

3254
02:06:27,118 --> 02:06:32,279
you know uh say you living in Kentucky

3255
02:06:29,840 --> 02:06:35,679
bro obviously the laws are not in your

3256
02:06:32,279 --> 02:06:37,679
favor uh but you know rent for a long

3257
02:06:35,679 --> 02:06:40,359
time preco was you could get a

3258
02:06:37,679 --> 02:06:43,480
three-bedroom brick house uh a big

3259
02:06:40,359 --> 02:06:46,000
basement a little building out back 550

3260
02:06:43,479 --> 02:06:49,558
bucks a month bro oh you know what I'm

3261
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:52,800
saying now you're looking at about seven

3262
02:06:49,559 --> 02:06:55,960
750 somewhere some if you're in the city

3263
02:06:52,800 --> 02:07:00,119
a thousand bucks now I will say in the

3264
02:06:55,960 --> 02:07:02,840
main city in in Kentucky there's some uh

3265
02:07:00,118 --> 02:07:06,158
housing oh my got lights going off uh we

3266
02:07:02,840 --> 02:07:08,239
got a a housing uh what do you call it

3267
02:07:06,158 --> 02:07:10,000
not a conglomerate but like a Investment

3268
02:07:08,238 --> 02:07:11,558
Group they're buying up a lot of rental

3269
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:13,359
prop properties and incre it's

3270
02:07:11,559 --> 02:07:15,039
increasing uh the value because they're

3271
02:07:13,359 --> 02:07:17,000
buying every other house in communities

3272
02:07:15,039 --> 02:07:20,238
and [ __ ] like that but yeah bro I always

3273
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:22,599
wonder how much that attributed to uh a

3274
02:07:20,238 --> 02:07:24,558
lot of it because you know if your rent

3275
02:07:22,599 --> 02:07:26,400
was I know like the price of living and

3276
02:07:24,559 --> 02:07:29,279
the price of or and the way how much you

3277
02:07:26,399 --> 02:07:31,759
make there's like a a difference there

3278
02:07:29,279 --> 02:07:33,920
but uh yeah man uh I always wonder if

3279
02:07:31,760 --> 02:07:35,599
that had it's only for certain things

3280
02:07:33,920 --> 02:07:37,359

02:08:05,679 --> 02:08:11,000
you know but um unless you like own a

3296
02:08:08,639 --> 02:08:13,520
business or you go Union like it's not

3297
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:16,158
like that amazing to pay for how much it

3298
02:08:13,520 --> 02:08:18,679
costs to live you yeah it's like I think

3299
02:08:16,158 --> 02:08:20,479
average rent in my area is up to like 2

3300
02:08:18,679 --> 02:08:23,399
200 bucks a month for like a really

3301
02:08:20,479 --> 02:08:26,638
simple like two bedroom one bath

3302
02:08:23,399 --> 02:08:29,960
old shitty house not like a dump but

3303
02:08:26,639 --> 02:08:33,599
like not like Pimpin by any means know I

3304
02:08:29,960 --> 02:08:35,960
mean and so uh but it's like that a lot

3305
02:08:33,599 --> 02:08:38,279
of places even in like Oklahoma like

3306
02:08:35,960 --> 02:08:41,118
rents were [ __ ] skyrocketing when I

3307
02:08:38,279 --> 02:08:43,000
was there it was like just as almost as

3308
02:08:41,118 --> 02:08:47,719
expensive as that year and I was just

3309
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:52,158
like the [ __ ] you believe it my house

3310
02:08:47,719 --> 02:08:54,520
payment is [ __ ] uh 1,700 bucks

3311
02:08:52,158 --> 02:08:57,879

3316
02:09:05,198 --> 02:09:09,158
the uh we are out out in the woods but

3317
02:09:07,479 --> 02:09:10,198
you get better pricing down in Kentucky

3318
02:09:09,158 --> 02:09:12,598
but you're living out in the middle of

3319
02:09:10,198 --> 02:09:14,399
nowhere bro I mean yeah you know you're

3320
02:09:12,599 --> 02:09:17,319
if you like fck I'm in a pretty

3321
02:09:14,399 --> 02:09:18,799
desirable spot overall yeah so you you

3324
02:09:20,840 --> 02:09:25,199
life there's going to be pros and cons

3325
02:09:22,920 --> 02:09:27,800
about living there you know whether you

3326
02:09:25,198 --> 02:09:29,399

3328
02:09:29,399 --> 02:09:33,519

3332
02:09:36,719 --> 02:09:42,679
two-bedroom house I don't know uh but uh

3333
02:09:39,920 --> 02:09:44,199
but yeah man we're kind of getting to a

3334
02:09:42,679 --> 02:09:46,359
closing Point man is there anything you

3335
02:09:44,198 --> 02:09:49,519
want to [ __ ] plug or talk about

3336
02:09:46,359 --> 02:09:51,039
before we get out of here or or uh yeah

3337
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:53,320
one thing that's been pissing me off a

3338
02:09:51,039 --> 02:09:55,238
lot lately is all these like crunchy ass

3339
02:09:53,319 --> 02:09:58,840
organic people where they're like I only

3340
02:09:55,238 --> 02:10:00,678
sh at Whole Foods you try and like like

3341
02:09:58,840 --> 02:10:03,199
the finer points of Organics are just

3342
02:10:00,679 --> 02:10:04,960
like lost on so many people and like

3343
02:10:03,198 --> 02:10:08,799
fertilizer Choice when it comes to

3344
02:10:04,960 --> 02:10:10,639
Organics is like the last thing that I'm

3345
02:10:08,800 --> 02:10:13,000
really concerned about like I feel like

3346
02:10:10,639 --> 02:10:15,800
the whole thing is the lack of use of

3347
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:17,198
pesticides and like chemical pesticides

3348
02:10:15,800 --> 02:10:18,480
you know what I mean like a lot of

3349
02:10:17,198 --> 02:10:21,598
organic dudes are just like I don't

3350
02:10:18,479 --> 02:10:22,718
spray but like if you had like a farm

3351
02:10:21,599 --> 02:10:26,000
that like

3352
02:10:22,719 --> 02:10:28,639
used uh you know synthetic fertilizer

3353
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:30,279
like man-made fertilizer and then don't

3354
02:10:28,639 --> 02:10:32,159
spray anything people are like that

3355
02:10:30,279 --> 02:10:34,559
shit's poison your weed's poison your

3356
02:10:32,158 --> 02:10:36,319
food's poison and I'm just like [ __ ] you

3357
02:10:34,559 --> 02:10:38,320
don't even know anything about this [ __ ]

3358
02:10:36,319 --> 02:10:40,639
all the fungi in the bacteria make it

3359
02:10:38,319 --> 02:10:42,840
into this exact fertilizer in the soil

3360
02:10:40,639 --> 02:10:44,760
it's just we found a more efficient way

3361
02:10:42,840 --> 02:10:46,880
that feeds the whole [ __ ] Earth and

3362
02:10:44,760 --> 02:10:49,760
not just rich people you know what I

3363
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:51,679
mean and so like uh that [ __ ] just it

3364
02:10:49,760 --> 02:10:54,280
keeps coming up in my life recently I'm

3365
02:10:51,679 --> 02:10:56,039
just like fertilizer is like the last

3366
02:10:54,279 --> 02:10:57,639
thing like do you think the river cares

3367
02:10:56,039 --> 02:10:59,399
if there's like a thousand pounds of

3368
02:10:57,639 --> 02:11:02,319
nitrogen flowing into it whether it's

3369
02:10:59,399 --> 02:11:03,839
from manure or from [ __ ] a factory

3370
02:11:02,319 --> 02:11:05,519
like it it doesn't matter there's still

3371
02:11:03,840 --> 02:11:08,800
a thousand pounds of nitrates in the

3372
02:11:05,520 --> 02:11:10,360
[ __ ] water you know it's so stuff

3373
02:11:08,800 --> 02:11:13,159
like that just drives me [ __ ] nuts

3374
02:11:10,359 --> 02:11:18,000
and so I just wanted to you know hey

3375
02:11:13,158 --> 02:11:20,598
[ __ ] off with that [ __ ] ble boys you

3376
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:22,679
know no you know I mean this is

3377
02:11:20,599 --> 02:11:24,119
something I thought about a lot and at

3378
02:11:22,679 --> 02:11:25,639
the end of the day and I know you're not

3379
02:11:24,118 --> 02:11:28,319
but at the end of the day like if

3380
02:11:25,639 --> 02:11:30,880
somebody wants to [ __ ] you know [ __ ]

3381
02:11:28,319 --> 02:11:32,719
in buckets and and grow their weat no if

3382
02:11:30,880 --> 02:11:34,520
somebody if somebody really if that's

3383
02:11:32,719 --> 02:11:36,719
the way people like to grow then [ __ ] it

3384
02:11:34,520 --> 02:11:39,239
bro I can't I like I said earlier I'm

3385
02:11:36,719 --> 02:11:41,639
still learning maybe maybe there there I

3386
02:11:39,238 --> 02:11:44,198
think you know if you're a new grower I

3387
02:11:41,639 --> 02:11:45,400
think Organics is probably you know and

3388
02:11:44,198 --> 02:11:47,198
there's going to be a lot of people that

3389
02:11:45,399 --> 02:11:49,039
disagree with this opinion but I think

3390
02:11:47,198 --> 02:11:51,238
Organics is more one of the more

3391
02:11:49,039 --> 02:11:54,519
challenging probably styles of growing

3392
02:11:51,238 --> 02:11:58,039
to approach indoors if you don't have

3393
02:11:54,520 --> 02:11:59,639
never grown before you know I ideally if

3394
02:11:58,039 --> 02:12:01,639
it was a perfect world and you can make

3395
02:11:59,639 --> 02:12:03,920
it work and you know all the [ __ ] and

3396
02:12:01,639 --> 02:12:05,800
you knew what you're were doing maybe

3397
02:12:03,920 --> 02:12:09,239
but like I just don't I just can't get

3398
02:12:05,800 --> 02:12:11,760
behind that when I see you know what

3399
02:12:09,238 --> 02:12:13,439
people can do with some bottles and just

3400
02:12:11,760 --> 02:12:15,199
you know a little bit of nothing bro

3401
02:12:13,439 --> 02:12:17,078
because I think a lot of the organic

3402
02:12:15,198 --> 02:12:19,399
grower guys and I would say a lot of

3403
02:12:17,078 --> 02:12:21,479
Bottle Boys myself included don't really

3404
02:12:19,399 --> 02:12:23,839
know what's going on in that [ __ ]

3405
02:12:21,479 --> 02:12:25,879
dude and they act like they do they act

3406
02:12:23,840 --> 02:12:28,360
like they do bro but the reality of it

3407
02:12:25,880 --> 02:12:29,880
is this is a [ __ ] weed bro you could

3408
02:12:28,359 --> 02:12:31,839
probably [ __ ] on the [ __ ] and

3409
02:12:29,880 --> 02:12:34,359
they'll grow like I don't know like not

3410
02:12:31,840 --> 02:12:36,880
you know what I mean like they're they

3411
02:12:34,359 --> 02:12:39,198
they'll grow on uh pretty easily under a

3412
02:12:36,880 --> 02:12:41,920
lot of different conditions but uh you

3413
02:12:39,198 --> 02:12:44,000
know that being said not to be a little

3414
02:12:41,920 --> 02:12:45,960
hater but when I start seeing a bunch of

3415
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:48,078
Organics guys buds bigger than my

3416
02:12:45,960 --> 02:12:50,719
Autoflower buds that I grow with little

3417
02:12:48,078 --> 02:12:52,319
of nothing I might I might be inclined

3418
02:12:50,719 --> 02:12:54,760
to start believe in it now that being

3419
02:12:52,319 --> 02:12:58,279
said I have seen some nice organic grows

3420
02:12:54,760 --> 02:13:01,840
out there that Crush but yeah but it's

3421
02:12:58,279 --> 02:13:03,840
far is [ __ ] amazing dude really well

3422
02:13:01,840 --> 02:13:06,199
done organic outdoor is like some of my

3423
02:13:03,840 --> 02:13:08,520
favorite smoke like I do it like when I

3424
02:13:06,198 --> 02:13:11,000
grow outdoors I go way heavier on like

3425
02:13:08,520 --> 02:13:13,199
organic amendments than I do the bottles

3426
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:15,399
you know it's is more cost effective

3427
02:13:13,198 --> 02:13:18,039
it's more suited to that side of style

3428
02:13:15,399 --> 02:13:21,238
of growing like indoors like you can

3429
02:13:18,039 --> 02:13:22,359
chase Your Tail endlessly trying to fure

3430
02:13:21,238 --> 02:13:24,638
out what you're doing wrong with

3431
02:13:22,359 --> 02:13:27,238
Organics like I found out one time I was

3432
02:13:24,639 --> 02:13:30,118
using seaborg guano and like seaborg

3433
02:13:27,238 --> 02:13:32,638
guano is dope but in 100 gallon smart

3434
02:13:30,118 --> 02:13:34,558
pots not in like three gallons in your

3435
02:13:32,639 --> 02:13:37,920
indoor because the [ __ ] has a pH of like

3436
02:13:34,559 --> 02:13:40,199
12 oh [ __ ] you throw a tablespoon on

3437
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:43,559
your [ __ ] plant and suddenly your

3438
02:13:40,198 --> 02:13:45,399
runoff is testing at like N9 pH you know

3439
02:13:43,559 --> 02:13:46,760
and it's just like oh that's a problem

3440
02:13:45,399 --> 02:13:49,679
you know what I mean but when you throw

3441
02:13:46,760 --> 02:13:52,079
like one cup of it into like a 100 or

3442
02:13:49,679 --> 02:13:54,000
200 gallon smart pot just like it's just

3443
02:13:52,078 --> 02:13:56,519
what the plant wants it's more stable

3444
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:58,559
you know what I mean yeah um but like

3445
02:13:56,520 --> 02:13:59,639
that [ __ ] has all its own problems too

3446
02:13:58,559 --> 02:14:01,800
you know what I mean like a lot of

3447
02:13:59,639 --> 02:14:05,199
organic derived fertilizers are like

3448
02:14:01,800 --> 02:14:07,559
mined by children in foreign countries

3449
02:14:05,198 --> 02:14:10,359
and like they're destroying habitats of

3450
02:14:07,559 --> 02:14:11,920
BS and seabirds and [ __ ] like you know

3451
02:14:10,359 --> 02:14:13,759
you're disturbing it and so it's like

3452
02:14:11,920 --> 02:14:16,199
there's still cost to all this [ __ ] like

3453
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:18,039
I'd personally rather have some nitrogen

3454
02:14:16,198 --> 02:14:19,839
that was just like used a little oil and

3455
02:14:18,039 --> 02:14:24,000
pulled it directly out of the [ __ ]

3456
02:14:19,840 --> 02:14:26,840
air um than some that some kid toiled in

3457
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:29,639
a [ __ ] bat cave in Southeast Asia

3458

3460
02:14:31,559 --> 02:14:34,679
about this all the time and we all need

3461
02:14:32,840 --> 02:14:36,480
to take a step or two down from our high

3462
02:14:34,679 --> 02:14:38,679
horses because if you're out there using

3463
02:14:36,479 --> 02:14:40,799
an iPad if you're out there using a

3464
02:14:38,679 --> 02:14:42,319
phone if you're using a lot of modern

3465
02:14:40,800 --> 02:14:44,719
day technology with some of these

3466

3471
02:14:56,238 --> 02:15:00,799
and we all participated in some way or

3472
02:14:58,639 --> 02:15:03,880
form whether you like it or not me and

3473
02:15:00,800 --> 02:15:05,520
my girlfriend or my old lady we get into

3474
02:15:03,880 --> 02:15:07,719
uh [ __ ] talking about because she was

3475
02:15:05,520 --> 02:15:09,920
really into organic stuff when we got in

3476
02:15:07,719 --> 02:15:11,960
you know from a food perspective and we

3477
02:15:09,920 --> 02:15:13,279
were just talking about how many like

3478
02:15:11,960 --> 02:15:14,760
you know because she's doesn't like to

3479
02:15:13,279 --> 02:15:16,000
kill animal she's really into animals

3480
02:15:14,760 --> 02:15:18,639
and [ __ ] like that and we're just

3481
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:21,439
talking about how many [ __ ] bugs and

3482
02:15:18,639 --> 02:15:24,118
things and and moles and I mean her own

3483
02:15:21,439 --> 02:15:26,558
dad her own dad mice die in a wheat

3484
02:15:24,118 --> 02:15:29,198
field when it gets harvested like deer

3485
02:15:26,559 --> 02:15:31,719
rabbits bro go go to and her own dad

3486
02:15:29,198 --> 02:15:33,519
farms and when he would bush hog bro go

3487
02:15:31,719 --> 02:15:35,880
look how many buzzards there out there

3488
02:15:33,520 --> 02:15:38,599
bro you know what I'm saying like so

3489
02:15:35,880 --> 02:15:40,679
it's but I get it though people want to

3490
02:15:38,599 --> 02:15:42,840
there's that disconnect between a lot of

3491
02:15:40,679 --> 02:15:44,199
[ __ ] in life with when it comes to stuff

3492
02:15:42,840 --> 02:15:46,520
like Organics and I'm not talking about

3493
02:15:44,198 --> 02:15:47,919
weed but uh food in particular you know

3494
02:15:46,520 --> 02:15:50,440
as we've gotten away from killing our

3495
02:15:47,920 --> 02:15:52,039
own food and stuff like that I think

3496
02:15:50,439 --> 02:15:54,198
that that Something's Happened to

3497
02:15:52,039 --> 02:15:55,920
society a little bit where you know

3498
02:15:54,198 --> 02:15:58,238
growing up when maybe me and you were

3499
02:15:55,920 --> 02:16:00,520
kids your dad took you out the fish your

3500
02:15:58,238 --> 02:16:02,558
dad took you out to deer hunt maybe or

3501
02:16:00,520 --> 02:16:04,840
squirrel hunt stuff like that and you

3502
02:16:02,559 --> 02:16:07,400
understood the you know and it taught

3503
02:16:04,840 --> 02:16:10,000
you the understand the meaning of life

3504
02:16:07,399 --> 02:16:11,399
and and how to get your own food and you

3505
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:13,000
know if we didn't have modern day

3506
02:16:11,399 --> 02:16:14,439
Technologies where we would all be at

3507
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:17,078
and what we would need and skills that

3508
02:16:14,439 --> 02:16:19,118
we would need and required to survive so

3509
02:16:17,078 --> 02:16:21,880
you know I think it I think that shit's

3510
02:16:19,118 --> 02:16:23,319
important and uh I think you know I

3511
02:16:21,880 --> 02:16:24,480
don't know we're getting into a deep

3512
02:16:23,319 --> 02:16:26,759
deep

3513
02:16:24,479 --> 02:16:29,158
water this is a whole topic and not to

3514
02:16:26,760 --> 02:16:30,800

3515
02:16:29,158 --> 02:16:33,119

02:16:34,799 --> 02:16:38,799

02:18:20,760 --> 02:18:24,840
trying to figure it out and I'm assuming

3568
02:18:22,799 --> 02:18:28,000
it's somewhere in between streamyard and

3569

downloading this [ __ ] podcast it for

3570

some reason on might end my video uh or

02:18:31,159 --> 02:18:35,359
my sound quality dips pretty hard y'all

3572
02:18:33,318 --> 02:18:38,039
so I do apologize for the up and downs

3573
02:18:35,359 --> 02:18:39,840
on the qualities with the audio [ __ ] but
