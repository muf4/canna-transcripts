done a little show before so thought

32
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,400
we'd get him on and delve a bit deeper

33
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,798
into his history in the scene he's uh

34
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,920
one of my favorite BLS besides being a

35
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,000
guy to go to about info like a mentor

36
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,478
he's a good mate as well so happy to

37
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,319
have W here

38
00:01:23,478 --> 00:01:30,078
today yeah excellent so yeah so pleased

39
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:31,519
to have both of these guys on um it's

40
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:34,719
hard to get high and low someon I will

41
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:37,000

00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,438
back well no it's actually booze this

43
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
whole thing was actually boo idea I

44
00:01:38,438 --> 00:01:44,239
should give Boo the credit for

45
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,879
that so I thought as a little Icebreaker

46
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:47,879
maybe Wally could just talk a little bit

47
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:49,599
about how he got started and then same

48
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:50,879
high and Lonesome just to point out that

49
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:53,640
high and Lonesome does have his own

50
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,478
episode from like maybe a year ago but

51
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,680

00:01:55,478 --> 00:02:00,438
more again um so yeah Wally tell us how

53
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,439
you got started to begin with uh like

54
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:05,639

55
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:08,758
mean yeah growing smoking bre any any of

56
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,439
it yeah wherever you want oh it was a

57
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:14,878
brother-in-law actually and um I was

58
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,919
pretty young he was a real Stoner and um

59
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,479
I was just sitting with him in the

60
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:21,919
lounge he's he's passed a joint to me uh

61
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:25,119
some tie stick in a joint uh I think he

62
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:28,000
he loved getting people High and um it

63
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,000
took me a lot though like uh two joints

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,719
and he's like sick of you know giving

65
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,759
weedway at that point

66
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:38,000
so um and I still wasn't High I had to

67
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:39,518
kind of like Get Up and and I I went

68
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
into another room and when I stepped

69
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:45,879
down into the next room it just hit me

70
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,120
all at once and um like uh complete

71
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:50,560
Euphoria you know and uh yeah I I never

72
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,879
looked back after

73
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,439
that fantastic I thought and uh yeah he

74
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:58,479
was part of me getting growing too

75
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:00,039
because um his friend had a property and

76
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:02,079
um

77
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:04,598
and we couldn't get tie sticks anymore

78
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:09,680
so we thought we we'd grow our own stuff

79
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:13,199
so and uh I was about 14 or 15 at that

80
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,560
point and um we grew a fair bit of weed

81
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:18,199
actually I think I was the only one of

82
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:21,598
my crew we were just young and we had

83
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:24,318
like pounds of weed and um everyone else

84
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,379
was still scratching around for a a few

85
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:26,759
grams you know

86
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:29,120

or def no there was there was no indoors

94
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:46,639
back then we just uh waited forever and

95
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,400
ever and uh it was all just bag seed we

96
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:53,878
grew and what year was this well like

97
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,959
roughly what period was this 82 83

98
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:58,239
something like

99
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,799
that oh actually it would be 83 it was

100
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,319
after like uh we had Ash Wednesday do

101
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:06,360

102
00:04:03,318 --> 00:04:09,039
young bush fires bit young but yeah yeah

103
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,480
it's before my time as well so it was

104
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,719
just after that and and all the scrub

105
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:15,199
had been burnt so um there was lots of

106
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,759
open ground at my friend's place so we

107
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:19,358
all stuck some weed up in the mountain

108
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:20,040
there and um a some of it took forever

109
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,079
to

110
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:25,840
finish and um Herm aphrodites and all

111
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:29,959
sorts of crazy stuff big couple of big

112
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:32,159
purple plants too and um

113
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:34,560
yeah it wasn't until it was into winter

114
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,600
where most of these things were

115
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,720
finishing that's crazy what was like the

116
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,879
import scene like at that time like I've

117
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,160
only got a little bit of experience

118
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:46,839
obviously I started smoking what

119
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,000
20 no 2011 something like that so by

120
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:50,679
that time it was just bushing Hydra but

121
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,759
you're saying you had like Tai and I

122
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,800
know me M's dad used to get Indonesian

123
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:57,000
and stuff like that what other stuff was

124
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:01,079
around at the time that was coming in as

125
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,639
import we mostly got Tai uh we got hash

126
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:06,359
too though Fair bit of hash all all

127
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:08,918
different sorts of hash um I don't know

128
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,000
who who imported it like I'm sure like

129
00:05:08,918 --> 00:05:12,240
there was large Imports in containers

130
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,478
and that but I think a lot of the

131
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,160
smaller stuff was just

132
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:18,478
uh uh Customs weren't as strict back

133
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,600
then and people being able to bring it

134
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:25,959
with them as far as I could work out

135
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:28,000
just like um we had Lebanese gold and um

136
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:30,680
that the the larger import was I think

137
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,959
it was moah hadine hash there's all this

138
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:38,079
uh you know gold stamp black hash um you

139
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:41,399
know squishy sort of stuff spongy

140
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:44,000
Wrapped in Red cellophane and um but but

141
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:46,879
we we mostly only got Tai where I was in

142
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,120
Melbourne there but we we got the uh the

143
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:54,120
stuff on sticks for quite a while uh and

144
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:57,319
then um we got loose stuff in bags uh uh

145
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:00,160
golden golden buds golden tie golden BHA

146
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:02,360
they called it yeah which um I I think

147
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,240
that was the best stuff that was I I

148
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,759
remember that the

149
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,680
best did you ever get into that tie

150
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:11,240

00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:57,839
young as I have noted before um

167
00:06:54,199 --> 00:07:00,840
basically soon after I started smoking

168
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:04,359
um I come from a farming family and it

169
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:06,359
was like man we can we can grow this so

170
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,240
um we were getting a lot of brick weed a

171
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,960
lot of Mexican weed occasionally get it

172
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,199
from somewhere a little more exotic

173
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:16,478
Colombia or something but uh for the

174
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:21,120
most part it was Mexican weed uh very

175
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:23,360
low quality um you know green sometimes

176
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,439
but a lot of it brown and just not you

177
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:31,319
know it did the trick but it wasn't you

178
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:34,879
know pleasurable to smoke so um started

179
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:37,479
you know trying to kind of cross over

180
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:41,759
some of my vegetable growing techniques

181
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:45,560
to weed and um it worked out you know I

182
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:49,158
uh I got started growing bag seeds and

183
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:51,839
um they they finish pretty well um in

184
00:07:49,158 --> 00:07:54,560
Virginia where I am uh you can usually

185
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:57,839
get them done right around the first

186
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,639
Frost but they're area plants you know

187
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:02,359
you don't you don't have the density you

188
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:04,918
have with a lot of these modern modern

189
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,360
lines so you can you can get them done

190
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:09,158
without getting too much mold or

191
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,439
anything like

192
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:16,519
that um but yeah started from there then

193
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:20,319
I moved on to Growing Dutch stuff and um

194
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:25,758
outdoor that's a whole different ball

195
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:27,639
game um here you know those skunk one

196
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,120
types Northern Lights types you have

197
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:33,200
issues with mold just because of density

198
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:36,200
um so took me a few years to realize

199
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,719
that I was better off growing kind of

200
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:41,320
thin Leaf varieties more open open

201
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:45,760
Plants looser bud structure that kind of

202
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:48,040
thing um but yeah I [ __ ] up plenty

203
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,039
well I

204
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,839
learned is there so we've got we've got

205
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:55,200
you growing in Virginia and obviously

206
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,000
while they're growing in Australia are

207
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,079
there is there any overlap in like the

208
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,120
climate at all and where you guys are I

209
00:08:59,078 --> 00:09:03,000
don't think so right but you both I

210
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:07,039
don't believe so

211
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,759
NL I don't I don't think there is um you

212
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:12,519
know Wally was a huge inspiration to me

213
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:14,838
on overgrow and IC mag I used to look at

214
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:16,560
you know his his gorilla pictures you

215
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:19,279
know his Fields out in the bush and it

216
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:22,639
was just like man like I want to do that

217
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:25,720
but um yeah completely different

218
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:30,159
environment to try to do it in so

219
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:34,839
yeah yeah d right tobacco in Virginia uh

220
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:38,319
h and h i yeah to Tobacco corn soybeans

221
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:41,720
all that stuff um it's a lot of the you

222
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:44,959
know mass production farming now um but

223
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:48,480
it's a good climate for tomatoes and you

224
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:51,399
know some of the traditional traditional

225
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,800
crops the problem here is the humidity

226
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:57,600
um we have such high humidity especially

227
00:09:54,799 --> 00:10:00,958
um later in the summer and the the fall

228
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,800
so it's um it's kind of tricky you know

229
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:06,199
you gota you got to work at it to to

230
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:08,879
make it happen here yeah just when you

231
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,879
don't want it around Harvest time oh

232
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:14,759
yeah

233
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:16,759
yeah well can I ask uh I can ask you

234
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:20,278
both I guess what were some of the first

235
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:21,600
plants or lines that you grew that you

236
00:10:20,278 --> 00:10:26,439
noticed actually

237
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,440
did exceptionally well in in the

238
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:35,799
area in my specific area you mean

239
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:38,560
yeah um the ERS do really well but we

240
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:40,000
had the same problem as H and now where

241
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:42,399
at the end of the season here because

242
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,120
we're close to the coast we that that

243
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:48,519
rain and humidity and so I I I opted for

244
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:51,839
growing in our dry season because the

245
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:55,360
the hours are still um you know the days

246
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:57,040
aren't very long still and um just

247
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,560
anything that would finish at that time

248
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:02,919
of year and that's how I ended up with

249
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:04,919
growing c99 actually cuz uh that thing

250
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:07,559
uh did really well here in that time of

251
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:09,679
year it uh produced you know fair fair

252
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:12,638
amount of weed the weed was really good

253
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:15,399
quality and it didn't rev you know with

254
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:17,639
the hours increasing like they were so

255
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:22,200
um that was my so I that's why I made

256
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:24,639
lots of crosses with c99 I was actually

257
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:27,440
I was not intent on on making seed for

258
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:30,039
sale it was actually seeds to grow and

259
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,600
then excess would end up

260
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:33,039
you know i' send to Gypsy or something

261
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,159
like that

262
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:37,639
so mate how did you select your c99 mate

263
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:39,319
like were you breeding it for the

264
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:41,560
conditions up there because like

265
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,720
obviously c99 had a pretty bloody good

266
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:45,159
run but I've spoken to a lot of people

267
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,879
and like people that are you know big

268
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:49,919
into Haze and stuff like that and a lot

269
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:51,838
of them rate your C c99 stock as some of

270
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:53,360
the best and I wonder if that's CU you

271
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,160
were breeding it for like a particular

272
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,039
effect or if it was strictly because you

273
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:59,519
were in that climate you likely

274
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:01,559
selecting more towards the hazy types or

275
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,278
what was the breeding like on that one

276
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:05,359
yeah maybe a bit of both but the

277
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:08,320
pineapple eh the pineapple was what I

278
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,959
was chasing because um the rest of it it

279
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,399
was okay but um when I found a pineapple

280
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:15,359
it was really you know it's all all nice

281
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:17,278
smelling good-looking bud but the

282
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,120
pineapple was just staks ahead of the

283
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:22,639
other stuff in my opinion and um so

284
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,639
that's what I was

285
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:28,078
chasing pineapple

286
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,919
weed the pineapple the c99 pineapple was

287
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:31,799
uh always one of my favorite Expressions

288
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:34,000
it was above and beyond especially

289
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:36,519
flavor wise to be able and and smell

290
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,480
that in weed was was

291
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:41,799
phenomenal

292
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,800
hash yeah

293
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:49,719
right all a f blood y that's incredible

294
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:53,600
yeah here you know like I said I started

295
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:58,160
with Mexican bag scine um that did

296
00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:00,120
pretty well here um we I never had major

297
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:03,399
mold issues you know a spot here or

298
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:07,278
there um then as I kind of started

299
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:09,759
looking at more magazines looking online

300
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:12,679
I decided to order some seeds and give

301
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:15,559
it a go so I started with some cheaper

302
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:20,319
stuff some Nirvana stuff Casey brain

303
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:22,278
stuff um I tried quite a few things and

304
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,600
realized pretty quickly that it was not

305
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:27,919
suited to my environment there were a

306
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,800
few that were uh Durban Poison did well

307
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:33,919
um northern lights

308
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:37,120
Haze uh from Nirvana did well but it

309
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:39,360
wasn't like an nl5 Haze like like an A5

310
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,078
or a C5 it was it had some skunk one or

311
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:45,120
something in it it was much quicker yeah

312
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:47,838
um then what

313
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:51,278
really started killing it for me outside

314
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:54,519
was super silver haze um that's that's

315
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:56,519
the one that really got me you know

316
00:13:54,519 --> 00:14:00,039
feeling like I could I could do

317
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:02,839
something nice outdoor here so um you

318
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:04,240
know it was definitely fenos specific

319
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:06,560
you know some of the longer ones you

320
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,519
couldn't finish some of the like eight

321
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:10,399
or nine weers you know you could you

322
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:13,919
could get them done but towards the end

323
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,600
you'd start to see some issues um some

324
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:18,360
issues with rot just because of the

325
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,800
density of those but um we had a cut

326
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,199
that we kept around that was a really

327
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:26,039
good outdoor uh really good outdoor cut

328
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:29,719
and um you know I I'm pretty hard-headed

329
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:32,278
I still try all kinds of stuff outdoor I

330
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:35,680
still Tred Bubba outdoor every few years

331
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:38,120
and um you know it just you can't

332
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:41,838
consistently get it done well here you

333
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:44,839
can sometimes but um you know that's why

334
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:48,360
I favor stuff like super silver haze

335
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:50,279
outside um appalache line I did and some

336
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,959
of those hybrids do well outside there

337
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:56,360
are a few cuts that do really well

338
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:59,758
outside um Shoreline probably

339
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:01,959
being one of the best uh for here you

340
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:07,199
know it gets done in time it doesn't

341
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:10,000
have any issues um you know it's

342
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:12,159
normally October 10th October 15th

343
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,759
somewhere in there it's done um so it

344
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:18,919
misses that kind of cool down and the

345
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:21,800
heavier rain season um but man I'm I'm

346
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:24,958
just always trying new stuff always

347
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:28,120
always seeing what works but I do love

348
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:30,479
doing Haze hybrids outside couldn't pull

349
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:33,600
off a pure Haze here but Haze hybrids

350
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,560
are kind of where it's at for me

351
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,560
yeah with I had one question about the

352
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:40,318
Appalachia real quick uh you may have

353
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:43,239
even touched on it the first time we

354
00:15:40,318 --> 00:15:45,360
spoke to you um not the first time sorry

355
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:48,159
in your episode last time

356
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,839
um when I think of like a kimd type I

357
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:52,318
don't think of I don't think of a region

358
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:55,000
like or you know a climate like the one

359
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:58,000
you describing um did it take much work

360
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,440
to to get the appy to kind of you know

361
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,440
um

362
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,880
I don't know be okay in that environment

363
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,120
like between between like you know the

364
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:08,078
trees dog and the green crackers I'm

365
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:11,360
like those don't sound like the yeah

366
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:14,039
tell me about that okay so of the Kim

367
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:18,480
cuts that I've grown outdoor here Kim D

368
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:22,278
does the best for me um you know kim4 is

369
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:25,959
bad Kim 91 is just a nogo um they just

370
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:29,879
melt away um kimd does pretty well

371
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:34,159
especially if you can um you know keep

372
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:36,559
it dry towards the end um we've done

373
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:40,600
hilarious things over the years to keep

374
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:43,638
you know the October rains off plants um

375
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:47,278
but uh Green Crack was great because it

376
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:50,720
was always done so early it triggers

377
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:54,639
really early here right you know it'll

378
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:58,079
trigger in July in Virginia um so you

379
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,639
can get that plant you know harvested

380
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:03,639
before October

381
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:07,599
so um you know I wanted

382
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:09,759
to cross the two to try to get something

383
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:12,399
like green crack with a little more

384
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:16,798
potency that kind of did double duty

385
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:21,400
indoor and outdoor here um it's appach

386
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:25,480
is definitely quicker than kimd um so it

387
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:29,080
helps there um it's just just a matter

388
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,759
of trying to get it done before October

389
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:33,918
you

390
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:33,919
know the first or second week of

391
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:39,960
October yeah that's really cool I might

392
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:43,000
even try one of your hybrids over our

393
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:45,759
summer here later on um just to see how

394
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,839
it how it does is it pretty dry

395
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:53,879
there

396
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:56,439
um it's probably like 60 70 uh okay yeah

397
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:59,080
yeah I think yeah you could it could

398
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,880
handle that yeah you talk an indoor

399
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:03,759
thousand or Outdoors yeah it's still

400
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:06,000
indoors but I still have to worry about

401
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:07,558
it because yeah oh Oh I thought you

402
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,759
talking about outdoor no you're you're

403
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:15,440
fine into it's pretty it's pretty solid

404
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:15,440
it's easy it's an easy plant to

405
00:18:15,558 --> 00:18:23,038
please yeah that's super cool um Boos

406
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:27,240
you had you you listed a few different

407
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:30,599
lines or cuts that we want to ask Wally

408
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:32,679
about yeah mate had a few things down so

409
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:34,038
obviously the first one um probably the

410
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:36,840
one that you're most known for besides

411
00:18:34,038 --> 00:18:38,400
the c99 was the golden pineapple I

412
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:40,759
remember seeing that in the canab Bible

413
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,519
3 what was the breeding like on that and

414
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:44,679
what was the plant like in

415
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:45,798
general I I don't know how that even got

416
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:48,720
in

417
00:18:45,798 --> 00:18:50,319
there I didn't know someone you know

418
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,720
years down the track said oh check this

419
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:56,599
out I had no idea but um that was just I

420
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:59,600
just had some um gypsy used to send me

421
00:18:56,599 --> 00:19:03,879
seeds all the time and uh there was the

422
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:06,558
a bunch of um squish whatever lines that

423
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:10,280
that guy uh what was his name

424
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:14,440
the the weasel guy Flying Flying

425
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:16,759
Dutchman [ __ ] Mongoose that's right he

426
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:21,360
he he he made all release

427
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:24,279
those yes that's right yeah oh yeah weel

428
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:26,399
the weasel guy yeah yeah yeah he's scary

429
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:30,720
he's a scary dude I know I tried to keep

430
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:32,759
away from that guy I'm glad I did

431
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,240
but um now I just put some in and

432
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:37,759
seriously that was just like uh it was a

433
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:40,440
plant that was there at the time and so

434
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:42,480
it cops some pollen and um it was

435
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,200
nothing intentional with it but um

436
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:48,000
apparently it came out quite good so uh

437
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,400
and I I grew a bunch of it too but and I

438
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,679
I just shared some with a bunch of guys

439
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,840
and that's how that must have happened I

440
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:56,080
think there was a cut someone kept

441
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:57,319
around for quite a while from that as

442
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:59,678
well too

443
00:19:57,319 --> 00:20:01,519
so still is

444
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,240
yeah I saw something pop up on the canak

445
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:05,000
banner recently I saw someone had some

446
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,079
golden pineapple cut they were raving

447
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,319
about

448
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:12,599
um see if we can time isn't it yeah

449
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:14,119
bloody mate but yeah I said I'll see if

450
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:17,959
we can get some seeds kick him over

451
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:21,479
that' be great is it I think uh [ __ ]

452
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,519
um Professor P messes with a golden

453
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,159
pineapple I don't know if it's the same

454
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:26,440
exact one but yeah

455
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,799
over yeah I'd Wonder I've got some

456
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:30,440
pineapple field stuff I mate um kick me

457
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:32,918
I was wondering if it had c99 in it

458
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:38,360
because it's super pineapple yeah it's

459
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:39,840
got it yeah another PPP skunk at some

460
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:41,279
point too I don't know whose it was I

461
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:43,158
can't remember but there was pineapp

462
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:45,599
skunk yeah

463
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:49,240
Green someone had some

464
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:49,240
pineapp somewhere

465
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:56,599
yeah was um the

466
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,919
S zaml yeah oh the double sour zaml I

467
00:20:56,599 --> 00:21:00,879
remember I heard you speak about that as

468
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:04,759
well like a bloody interest in outdoor

469
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:08,799
hybrid yeah I I I love that East Coast s

470
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:11,038
diesel that stuff was awesome and um

471
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:13,079
yeah I've grown some of h&amp; L's I've got

472
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:14,960
something in now of the appala that

473
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:18,278
you're talking about east east coast s

474
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,720
diesel cross and yeah I thought that was

475
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:23,839
going to be pretty good stuff but um the

476
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,600
the Z the zaml I got that from um what

477
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:28,079
was his name purple purple flowers

478
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:31,319
Purple Rain I don't know something like

479
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:33,319
that one of the guys on overgrow on IC

480
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:36,678
mag sorry and he just sent me all this

481
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:38,119
sativa stuff uh just out of the blue do

482
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:41,720
you want this stuff I said [ __ ] yeah

483
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:44,959
I'll have that and amongst it was a zaml

484
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:46,759
and um it was Gypsy zaml originally but

485
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:50,919
I think it was a couple of generations

486
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:54,679
along and um man that stuff was a beast

487
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:56,240
it um had this like uh I I known about

488
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:58,798
it for a while but everyone said it had

489
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,240
a carrot smell and I [ __ ] never like

490
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:04,359
that carrot smelling

491
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:06,798
we but this stuff it did it did smell K

492
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:09,839
initially but um then it ended up with

493
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:11,960
this like tea tree oil sort of uh pretty

494
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:14,558
strong Aroma and it was really strong

495
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:18,600
weed I was really surprised

496
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:20,678
but it was like a um that creeper weed

497
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:22,719
it wouldn't grow upwards it' get like a

498
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:26,120
couple of feet high and then it just

499
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:28,759
spay down you know all over and I had

500
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:30,079
this massive Bush of the stuff I I think

501
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:32,759
I kept that cutting for quite a while

502
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:35,918
and that's what I used for the initial

503
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:38,798
um sour zaml and then I I just crossed

504
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:41,159
it to S diesel again and yeah I've grown

505
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:43,038
a bit and some other guys I I know have

506
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:46,000
done that do you know bin chicken you

507
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:47,919
know bin chicken yeah yeah on the show y

508
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,319
we had him on the show yeah there you go

509
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:54,278
so he's used it in one of his that

510
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:57,839
uh what's that thing he's got with the

511
00:22:54,278 --> 00:22:59,519
oh doua isn't it in there I think it is

512
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:02,000
I think so or one of his things that

513
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:05,918
he's working with for sure yeah yeah I

514

know Sal yeah yeah we hadat a bit so and

515
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:11,880
we do a bit of swapping backward and

516
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:13,600
forward so um yeah he he really liked it

517
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,760
he liked a fair bit of the stuff I sent

518
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:17,798
him he said

519
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:20,599
so did y'all get the East Coast sour

520
00:23:17,798 --> 00:23:21,918

00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:26,158
off

522
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:28,840
um I can try to remember his name Santo

523
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:32,120
that's him yeah he sent it couple of

524
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:35,278
things down uh East Coast Sour Diesel uh

525
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:40,278
C5 that's where we got the C5 from and

526
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:43,000
uh star dog too so um yeah wow I'm

527
00:23:40,278 --> 00:23:44,558
impressed they made it me too I don't

528
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
know how they don't know how they got

529
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:49,440
there but they not

530
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,960
only yeah I

531
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,679
know tried to keep that one as long as I

532
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,200
could and it was actually the S I kept

533
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:59,559
the sour diesel and it wasn't until

534
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:01,679
recently that that ended because uh I

535
00:23:59,558 --> 00:24:03,879
had it with a friend and he shared it

536
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,640
with another friend of mine because he

537
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,360
couldn't it wasn't suitable for him

538
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,000
thinking my other friend would keep it

539
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:12,918
but he never did

540
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,119
so that's how that goes huh yeah it is

541
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:17,278
sharing's good though that way you know

542
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:21,119
you might run out of it and old mates

543
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:23,079
got it over there but it doesn't always

544

me um you you can get a few issues but

568
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:20,119
I've been the last few years I've been

569
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:22,599
doing them in a greenhouse and um I'm

570
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:24,558
depping some now they do really well

571
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:26,879
here that

572
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:29,599
way yeah

573
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:32,120
that it's a Kill ker Killer cut and it

574
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:35,519
pairs well I love the way it pairs up

575
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:37,439
with divas I'm finishing up a couple of

576
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:39,759

00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:44,440
the he had the SAA clone as well some

579
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:48,240

580
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:50,320
Sour Kush M tie cross to a k Kush mum

581

582
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:54,879
Speck of mold on him and they got you

583
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:59,360
know VB stby Co is so going pretty

584
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:00,919
fantastic and stoked on it hell yeah

585
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:03,240
this is kind of a nothing observation

586
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:06,799
but I just wanted to point out um it

587
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:08,599
seems like Wally's got pineapple and HL

588
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:12,679
has a lot of mango that's all I wanted

589
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:16,240
to say I do like mango couple boys in

590
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:20,840
here yeah Bo so yeah because I think I

591
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:23,679
was to you go go ahead goel I was just

592
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:27,678
gonna say you know like I think a lot

593
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:30,240
more stuff is mango than like some of

594
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:33,480
our friends like you know our buddy

595
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:36,558
local has said some of these things are

596
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:40,360
a little more like cut white grapes

597
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:43,119
which you know is pretty specific and um

598
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:44,879
I don't know um but yeah I after he said

599
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:49,398
that I noticed it in some of the you

600
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:51,960
know like the EV Appalachia stuff um you

601
00:26:49,398 --> 00:26:55,158
know it it can be a little white grapy

602
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:58,200
but mango I still get a lot of mango

603
00:26:55,159 --> 00:27:01,120
from Appalachia Green Crack um the mang

604
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:03,080
mango Haze was surprisingly mango on

605
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:07,079
some of the

606
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:09,720
fenos yeah very but yeah I sucker for

607
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:12,639
mango wonder if mango resists mold for

608
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,480
you there too oh do you think so it

609
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,240
could

610
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,759
um maybe I I don't know you know that's

611
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:21,440
something I've always kind of wanted to

612
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:23,038
dive a little more deep into but I

613
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:27,159
haven't because you know I've always

614
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:31,079
heard that t pentalene resists mold um

615
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:34,080
which makes sense to me like in some of

616
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:37,000
the sativas but then like train wreck

617
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:40,558
here if you don't take it early molds

618
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,759
pretty hard uh and that's like that's a

619
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:45,278
pretty terpinolene dominant plant so I

620
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:46,558
don't know if it's that or it's

621
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:49,398
something I've always wanted to kind of

622
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:51,480
dig into but I haven't I've been growing

623
00:27:49,398 --> 00:27:53,798
mids this whole time

624
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,240
instead I wonder if size of the Brack

625
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:56,759
has something well I reckon it probably

626
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,440
would but I think size of the BR has

627
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:00,319
heaps to do with it cuz looking at that

628
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,000
Shoreline like it's pretty dense but

629
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:03,879
those bracks look quite small like in

630
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,200
comparison to like green crack or train

631
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:09,080
wreck or something like that and same as

632
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:11,038
with malum tires like relatively small

633
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:13,599
bracks but very dense flowers so I

634
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:16,319
wonder that if it's just you know the

635
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:17,719
the Brack itself that will um rot and

636
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:19,119
then start to rot the flow out with the

637
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:22,759
ESS no

638
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:25,798
idea um I don't know I it's hard it's

639
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:30,278
hard to say because sour can have

640
00:28:25,798 --> 00:28:32,798
pretty large bracks and that does better

641
00:28:30,278 --> 00:28:35,720
than you know than if you tried to take

642
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:37,158
Green Crack to the end of October that

643
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:40,159
just wouldn't work here you know you can

644
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:42,200
get it the beginning of October um you

645
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,760
know but it's you're not going to get it

646
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:47,720
at Halloween it's going to be just

647
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:49,440
melted away um here you know the the

648
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:51,519
thing that I've noticed with a lot of

649
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,399
people talking to a lot of people over

650
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:56,558
the last few years is I mean you just

651
00:28:53,398 --> 00:29:00,119
have to have that plant Rock Solid going

652
00:28:56,558 --> 00:29:02,278
into flower you got to stay on it um you

653
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:06,479
know we get we get

654
00:29:02,278 --> 00:29:09,558
something uh saporia leaf spot uh here

655
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,519
and it's I see it in pictures of plants

656
00:29:09,558 --> 00:29:13,119
all the time and if you get something

657
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:14,880
like that in a plant something fungal

658
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:17,038
like that it just weakens the plant so

659
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,960
much that it's it's susceptible to

660
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:24,480
everything else um so I I try to you

661
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:28,679
know keep my plants well fed plenty of

662
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:32,038
calcium and I I spray a lot um

663
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:34,759
I Don't Spray flour but here it's just

664
00:29:32,038 --> 00:29:38,000
like trying to keep the plant as healthy

665
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:39,278
as you can going in and you'll see way

666
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,880

it it did it did come from prop 7 so it

675
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:15,199
came via I think prop sent it to Bushy

676
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:18,240
and then bushy sent it to me something

677
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:21,240
like that and um bushy knew more about

678
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:25,278
the the Mong part of it I don't know but

679
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:27,480
as far as I remember um prof's wife who

680

it and she couldn't go anywhere without

685
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:45,798
a bong we we went away uh for a couple

686
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:48,880
of days and uh she had to like make up

687
00:30:45,798 --> 00:30:54,599
like an orchie bottle bong you

688
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:58,000
know brother yeah and anyway so um so we

689
00:30:54,599 --> 00:31:01,359
her dad was a a smoker and I I think the

690
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,119
M tie came from bag seed from him uh we

691
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:05,199
initially thought he was a grow but I I

692
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:08,599
don't think he was I think he was just a

693
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:11,759
toker and uh and they knew they knew M

694
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:15,038
People I met some M people with them so

695
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:18,879
uh because I the hill tribe people you

696
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:21,440
know and um I think that's that's where

697
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:25,360
that stuff came from and uh you know I

698
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:27,600
grew some out in the jungle there and um

699
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:29,519
you know everyone says that uh Ty can

700
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:32,079
really handle rain the [ __ ] doesn't

701
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:35,079
like wet Roots much I you know wet it

702
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:37,558
died several of them died yeah seriously

703
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:38,599
I it was in an area where like it was

704
00:31:37,558 --> 00:31:41,000
still on a bit of a slope but it was at

705
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:43,199
the bottom of a slope and so it got wet

706
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,319
feet for just too long and several of

707
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:49,399
them died but um the higher ones they

708
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:52,960
went all right and um yeah it was it was

709
00:31:49,398 --> 00:31:55,158
nice weed someone uh that I gave some to

710
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,278
uh rated it as the best that they'

711
00:31:55,159 --> 00:31:59,159
gotten off me and uh they'd gotten a

712
00:31:57,278 --> 00:32:02,359
fair bit of what I thought was good weed

713
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:05,159
but they they seriously like that stuff

714
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:07,119
so obviously had a fair bit of

715
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:09,120
potential but um it's interesting that

716
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:10,359
it came from bushy or through bushy I

717
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:11,798
was going to ask you about that because

718
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:13,199
I'd seen that Kangle was growing it in

719
00:32:11,798 --> 00:32:15,798
that um I don't know if you've seen that

720
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,360
marijuana australiana documentary but I

721
00:32:15,798 --> 00:32:21,158
did I saw it and that that was it the

722
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:22,879
huge plant yeah yeah yeah and he said oh

723
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:24,720
no I think that was the oakk and mango

724
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,278
Hayes we said he put a Mong Tha in Lake

725
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,399
and so it was getting like it would have

726
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:30,679
gone 20 met or something but only got to

727
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:32,518
seven or 11 or something this year so

728
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:34,320
yeah okay would have been a big but I

729
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:35,480
wondered he because if bushy haded if it

730
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:37,000
was one of the ones that they were using

731
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,880
when they were doing the Outback and

732
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
that kind of yeah that's how it happened

733
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,320
yeah I got it through bushy and then I I

734
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,440
think I might have even sent some back

735
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:47,000
to him because he ran out or I can't

736
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:48,399
remember there was always a bit of uh

737
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:51,519
you know two and

738
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:53,558
fro did you ever a grow Hy tie or SE it

739
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,440

00:32:53,558 --> 00:32:58,759

746
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:14,240
yeah I'd be like the last guy on Earth

00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:23,679
on their website like a TVD at the

814
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,119
moment but they're looking at going to

815
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:28,118
like South

816
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:30,079
America um Morocco and then

817
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:32,559
places like Cambodia and um I've got an

818
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:34,640
aunt that's Cambodian and uh an uncle

819
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:36,279
that lived there for 10 years or so so

820
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:37,598
i' probably looked to head over there

821
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,319
it' be fantastic and I think there's

822
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,280
still some fantastic Cambodian land

823
00:36:39,318 --> 00:36:42,599
races there even this guy that's like

824
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,640
popped up over there I think he's the

825
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:47,838
expat that's um selling seeds so yeah it

826
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:50,199
could be a cool little venture all right

827
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:54,119
before we go any further Wally let's

828
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:55,799
talk Ducks foot like the first I knew

829
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:58,960
about you when I hit you up way back in

830
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:00,160
the day Wally and his d foot it's it's I

831
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,519
mean Wally

832
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:04,000
duck there's a lot of misconceptions

833
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:05,318
even nowadays like if you go online and

834
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,519
you hear people talk about ducks foot

835
00:37:05,318 --> 00:37:09,679
they'll refer to it as like in instead

836
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:11,838
of a a strain or something that you work

837
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:13,879
they'll refer to it as like a a trait

838
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:15,960
that goes through cookies or you know

839
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:18,760
through OG Kush um can you talk a little

840
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:21,318
bit about it where you found it um what

841
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:24,319
you found working with it Etc but give

842
00:37:21,318 --> 00:37:26,719
us a little Lowdown on it yeah we we we

843
00:37:24,318 --> 00:37:30,599
got it loely here and to be honest I

844
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:33,838
don't know the origin but it's just a a

845
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:35,800
a trait that can be in cannabis so the

846
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:37,400
origin doesn't have to be specific you

847
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:41,720
know doesn't have to have been from

848
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:45,000
Hawaii or Africa or sure whatever um and

849
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:47,559
and and a guy that I knew um that I grew

850
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,400
some weed with he um he he talked to me

851
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:51,480
a little bit about it but he just said

852
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:54,800
he he knew a guy that had some stuff

853
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:56,480
that had like uh three fingers leap on

854
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,400
it you know which I I said look I've

855
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,358
seen that it's no big deal he said oh

856
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:04,400
this is good weed and um but he said the

857
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:07,199
guy wouldn't give him any and then so um

858
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:10,039
so we had to wait till the guy was

859
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:13,679
desperate of course yeah and then so

860
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:15,880
he's given us like a box of uh plants or

861
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:19,358
something and old mates made some seed

862
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:21,920
out of it and he and I uh grew some and

863
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:25,239
um we actually only had one

864
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:28,480
um one Ducks foot plant I think we

865
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:31,399
had yeah and then we crossed oh man that

866
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:33,800
[ __ ] stunk yeah yeah it did it was

867
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,358
skunky yeah yeah really that's the only

868
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,599
thing I could like in it too wasn't the

869
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:38,880
same smell as skunk but just how it

870
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:41,039
permeated you

871
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,838
know the distance you could smell it

872
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:45,719
from

873
00:38:42,838 --> 00:38:48,920
and and so yeah it was a nice weed

874
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:51,239
little bit of hashy sort of uh and and

875
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:52,880
the tasted you get on your lips and you

876
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:56,919
could lick your lips and taste it

877
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:58,000
afterwards and um smile too happy happy

878
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,680
happy weed

879
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,838
so uh so we kept around but I kind of

880
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:05,919
didn't know what I was doing back then

881
00:39:02,838 --> 00:39:09,199
making seeds and um it was a bit of a

882
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:12,119
hit and a miss thing and I didn't do

883
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:13,639
that well on the first Recreation of it

884
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:17,720
and then I had I couldn't go back

885
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:20,519
because I lost seed and the guy that uh

886
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:23,719
that I'd got to hold on to the stash he

887
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:26,679
gave him away to his uh

888
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:30,959
ex-girlfriend's new guy which I thought

889
00:39:26,679 --> 00:39:32,838
[ __ ] who even GI yeah buy anything you

890
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:36,119
know

891
00:39:32,838 --> 00:39:38,199
yeah but honestly the um the best out of

892
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:41,200
the seed we had there was um I don't

893
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:45,159
know maybe it was 50% web Leaf stuff and

894
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:48,480
50% just the normal uh cannabis leaf and

895
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:50,960
the normal stuff was the the better stff

896
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:53,000
and I would have used that to you know

897
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:57,880
bring back the taste and the smell but

898
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:59,920
yeah I didn't have it so um so and then

899
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:04,640
like I lost most of my stuff but um I

900
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:06,960
got some um stuff off a Hawaiian dude uh

901
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:07,759
we we spoke together and it seemed like

902
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,679
his

903
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,760
stuff

904
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:14,879
uh the stuff what I had had all the

905
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:17,839
advantages that he wanted and and vice

906
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:22,079
versa and so we swapped and that was

907
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:24,480
that Hawaiian Webb Inda yes yeah and um

908
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:26,200
it grew short like about three or four

909
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,559
foot had one main Coler didn't want to

910
00:40:26,199 --> 00:40:32,799
Branch out huge stem huge Big Hollow

911
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:35,078
stem on it so in my idea I thought it

912
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:38,680
was definitely Inda whereas my stuff was

913
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:41,720
tall branchy you know flowered longer

914
00:40:38,679 --> 00:40:43,719
and so I I this wasn't a purti at that

915
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:46,159
ducks foot but it was definitely the

916
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:48,078
type of dominant you know yeah versus

917
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:52,559
that indicate so I made a cross of the

918
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:54,920
two wow that's stuff uh the strongest

919
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:58,679
smelling weed I've ever come across it

920
00:40:54,920 --> 00:41:01,200
just stunk and um but like

921
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:02,519
petroleum you know like that's why I

922
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:04,519
thought when I when I'm when I was

923
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:06,559
growing and and the people started

924
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:08,400
talking about Diesel and I'm smelling

925
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:10,639
this stuff and thinking wow it must be

926
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,000
like this stuff but this was even this

927
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:16,078
is even stronger than that that diesel

928
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,159
smell it didn't make you nauseous uh

929
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,440
pruning it i' prune like an ounce or two

930
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:23,358
and I'd have to stop and and and go away

931
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:25,838
from the smell it was just that bad yeah

932
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:28,078
bad bad in a good way you know yeah not

933
00:41:25,838 --> 00:41:31,318
just

934
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:34,560
but um I actually got some back from a

935
00:41:31,318 --> 00:41:37,079
dude recently uh and I I've just I've

936
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:39,759
just planted some this guy on on

937
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:42,560
Instagram and he he showed me showed me

938
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:45,920
a photo and he said his old man got this

939
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:47,559
stuff in blah blah year and he lives in

940
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,599
you know blah blah I said Fu that's just

941
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:54,000
down the road from me and I was on that

942
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:56,200
Webb Webb hybrid at the time and um and

943
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,039
I asked him do does it stink like this

944
00:41:56,199 --> 00:42:00,439
and he said oh yeah it's it stinks so

945
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:03,239
yeah maybe it's the same one I don't

946
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:05,559
know I remember seeing a blr Ducks foot

947
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:09,159
Widow while not even that long ago um

948
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:11,039
north side of Brisbane [ __ ] 2018 2019

949
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:12,879
I remember had a Ducks foot Widow in his

950
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:14,960
garden and it was doing the the leaf

951
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,400
thing so this is before I was even

952
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,400
getting into the seed stuff I was only

953
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,519
just started growing five years back or

954
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,599
something but um well at that time

955
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:25,480
really um yeah so yeah I wonder if it's

956
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:28,160
still around in any form even locally or

957
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:29,639
if even this is might be the same blow

958
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:33,000
yeah I don't know this guy he sells

959
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:34,719
seeds this guy uh the seed packets I got

960
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,199
from him they they look like a salable

961
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:42,719
item so I'm pretty sure he sells seeds

962
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:44,639
so I think I remember IED okay Sor no go

963
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:46,039
ahead when I when I got interested in

964
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:47,759
the Ducks foot what I wanted to do at

965
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:49,558
the time which is like silly looking

966
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:53,280
back but um I wanted to make an

967
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:56,079
Autoflower that was like kind of um you

968
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:58,079
know under the radar but that was the

969
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:00,200
problem was that it stunk so [ __ ] bad

970
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:02,599
that if you grew it Outdoors even if you

971
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:04,759
could a little bit with the Webb Leaf

972
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:06,160
trait there was no mistaking the smell

973
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:08,960
when the sun hit in the morning like

974
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:10,920
they're just not not happening anybody's

975
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,920
gonna be looking for it so it wasn't

976
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:17,200
really stealthy per se yeah that was

977
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,200
plan not in that

978
00:43:17,318 --> 00:43:23,318
regard what's that didn't one of the

979
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:25,519
Dutch companies do a auto duck not too

980
00:43:23,318 --> 00:43:28,400
long ago I remember there was like a

981
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:30,519
fian duck that that uh yeah yeah yeah

982
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:35,039
but then they did an auto version of it

983
00:43:30,519 --> 00:43:35,039
I always wondered if that was from W

984
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:42,680
stock Dutch fashion maybe yeah Dutch

985
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,039
fashion yeah yeah yeah I think I think

986
00:43:42,679 --> 00:43:47,039
they were think that was

987
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:50,239
your okay yeah and there's another guy

988
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:52,279
that released some too um I can't

989
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:54,039
remember his name but there's been a few

990
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:57,079
of them

991
00:43:54,039 --> 00:43:59,119
around yeah there were a bunch of uh

992
00:43:57,079 --> 00:44:01,119
filial Generations released on IC mag

993
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,599
and the like seed server fund and all

994
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,760
kinds of stuff over the years I don't

995
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:06,039
know if those were always coming

996
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:09,240
directly from you or if someone was uh

997
00:44:06,039 --> 00:44:13,719
F2 him or F3 him I know it was them F2

998
00:44:09,239 --> 00:44:16,159
or F3 or yeah whatever yeah yeah I never

999
00:44:13,719 --> 00:44:17,759
I shared some I I actually saw some on

1000
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:20,159
um and and I got a reminder the other

1001
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:22,400
day on Facebook and this guy in Africa

1002
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:24,920
said he's got this these plants and he's

1003
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:27,160
got them from a field in Africa and uh

1004
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:28,440
and then they were definitely ducks for

1005
00:44:27,159 --> 00:44:33,039
it was like the original stuff that I

1006
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:35,318
used to have and weirdly enough I um I I

1007
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:39,880
one of the first trades I did was to to

1008
00:44:35,318 --> 00:44:41,558
Africa this this last over there and so

1009
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:44,358
she gave it to some guys that were

1010
00:44:41,559 --> 00:44:45,839
growing larger amounts so uh it is

1011
00:44:44,358 --> 00:44:49,480
actually possible that that did come

1012
00:44:45,838 --> 00:44:52,119
from stuff that I'd sent there so you

1013
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:57,960
you never know works yeah it goes long

1014
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:57,960
and far doesn't it yeah it does man does

1015
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:04,400
did you ever hear of the molai frost

1016
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,119
Wally yes yeah I wonder if that might

1017
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,599
have been in the duck's foot cuz my mate

1018
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:09,358
um local bird seed grew a bunch of that

1019
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:11,119
from good gear seeds and that stuff

1020
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:13,318
[ __ ] stunk as you're saying you had

1021
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:15,280
some taller seeds in the first um the

1022
00:45:13,318 --> 00:45:17,440
f1s or the f2s or whatever wonder if

1023
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:20,079
maybe it's hybridized with or something

1024
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:22,599
because that was super stinky we yeah

1025
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:24,960
maybe because the guy that I I swapped

1026
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:26,599
with he also had that stuff but I think

1027
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,599
they all lost a lot of stuff around that

1028
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:31,680
same time time I kind of like seems to

1029
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:35,519
always happen with us in this trade that

1030
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:37,719
everyone loses all their stuff and

1031
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:41,119
line it that you were trading with the

1032
00:45:37,719 --> 00:45:44,598
Flying Hawaiian no no it wasn't it was

1033
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:49,160
um I'll get it

1034
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:52,240
ck2 okay yeah and um just trying to

1035
00:45:49,159 --> 00:45:54,199
think uh Puna Puna was where he lived or

1036
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:58,919
or where he got the staff one one of the

1037
00:45:54,199 --> 00:45:58,919

1043
00:46:13,239 --> 00:46:17,959
ha yeah okay yeah let's start maybe

1044
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:20,280
start with high L and we already

1045
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:22,400
mentioned the mango hay but do you want

1046
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:24,519
to tell us a bit more about how you got

1047
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:27,800
to working with it recently and what

1048
00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:33,119
that work has been like

1049
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:37,880
uh yeah I I got some from booze um I I

1050
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:39,838
actually wanted older stock um just

1051
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:43,280
because some of the more recent things

1052
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:45,119
I've gotten um you know the Northern

1053
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,240
Lights Haze and Super Silver Haze that

1054
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:52,160
I've gotten

1055
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:54,959
recently um from Europe uh they weren't

1056
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:57,838
representative of what I remembered um

1057
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,880
yeah I I mentioned wanting some and boo

1058
00:46:57,838 --> 00:47:03,920
had Wally stock and I was like man I'd

1059
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:06,760
love to grow his because I know you know

1060
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:10,760
he's he knows what he's doing and it's

1061
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:14,319
it's likely older stock um so I got

1062
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:17,000
those um I don't know year and a half

1063
00:47:14,318 --> 00:47:19,960
ago or something popped all of them went

1064
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:23,318
through them found found the ones I

1065
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:26,559
liked found unique ones um I found a

1066
00:47:23,318 --> 00:47:27,759
mail I really liked and um you know made

1067
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:30,960
a

1068
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:34,880
seeds with it increased it can you tell

1069
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:37,679
us a bit about uh what kind of spread of

1070
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:41,640
you know Expressions you saw in that in

1071
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:43,440
that pop yeah um so those plants it was

1072
00:47:41,639 --> 00:47:46,440
interesting to me at the same time I

1073
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:50,280
popped uh Wally's Neville's Haze mango

1074
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:53,880
Haze and comparatively uh the mango Haze

1075
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:57,640
was a much thinner leaf plant um more

1076
00:47:53,880 --> 00:48:00,920
open you know what you would think of

1077
00:47:57,639 --> 00:48:03,879
uh with the haze plant um you know they

1078
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:08,400
looked they looked more similar to the

1079
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:12,480
A5 cut I was growing um then the

1080
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:15,639
Neville's mango haast did uh there were

1081
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:19,079
there were a lot of you know they have

1082
00:48:15,639 --> 00:48:21,598
this weird like as they put on um new

1083
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:25,039
sets of leaves that kind of roll out um

1084
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:27,599
it's a really um characteristic trait I

1085
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:31,159
noticed in them um but you know once you

1086
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:33,440
flower them you have you have these very

1087
00:48:31,159 --> 00:48:36,719
strong almost like green crack smelling

1088
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:38,760
mango plants um you have some that are

1089
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:42,598
like a dirty metallic mango and then

1090
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:45,319
there were some that were kind of like

1091
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:48,359
Savory I had one that I swear smelled

1092
00:48:45,318 --> 00:48:50,480
like um like Salsberry steak you know

1093
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:54,920
what that is y have that

1094
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:58,639
there it was like super saory it's like

1095
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:59,720
a it's like right like steak Yeah Yeah

1096
00:48:58,639 --> 00:49:03,519
it's

1097
00:48:59,719 --> 00:49:05,399
like it's like a ground beef patty made

1098
00:49:03,519 --> 00:49:08,358
to be like it's like poor man like

1099
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:11,318
probably Depression era steak um but you

1100
00:49:08,358 --> 00:49:12,960
know like when I was a kid we had it and

1101
00:49:11,318 --> 00:49:15,039
it was something you got at school and

1102
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,440
like I had this plant and uh in the

1103
00:49:15,039 --> 00:49:19,920
mango Haze it was one of the later

1104
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:22,358
flowering ones actually and um I just

1105
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:25,519
love the structure of it it you know it

1106
00:49:22,358 --> 00:49:27,679
didn't throw big buds it threw a lot of

1107
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:29,838
small kind of hazy looking buds through

1108
00:49:27,679 --> 00:49:31,798
it and the whole time I flower it I was

1109
00:49:29,838 --> 00:49:34,798
like what the [ __ ] is that smell you

1110
00:49:31,798 --> 00:49:36,679
know it's just so obscure and then one

1111
00:49:34,798 --> 00:49:39,119
day it hit me you know I think I was

1112
00:49:36,679 --> 00:49:41,719
like harvesting it and I was it smells

1113
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:44,720
like [ __ ] Salsberry steak it's that's

1114
00:49:41,719 --> 00:49:48,078
incredible um but you know for the most

1115
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:50,879
part it was there was a lot of you know

1116
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:54,798
fruer Haze stuff it was more mango than

1117
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:57,318
I kind of expected it to be um but

1118
00:49:54,798 --> 00:50:01,239
they're great plants um I've been on a

1119
00:49:57,318 --> 00:50:05,440
bunch of the dry sift I made from it um

1120
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:05,439
I got a big jar I kind of tap into every

1121
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:10,280
day did you have any that were like on

1122
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,000
the lemony sort of kick like a Le oh you

1123
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:16,920
didn't have lemon mle yeah like um yeah

1124
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:19,519
yeah it's it's kind of like how uh like

1125
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:23,639
it's like a more mellowed

1126
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:28,239
version lemon yeah uh it kind of reminds

1127
00:50:23,639 --> 00:50:29,960
me of like a really wild version of some

1128
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:35,159
of the super silver haze stuff that kind

1129
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:37,639
of lemony hazy thing um you know that

1130
00:50:35,159 --> 00:50:39,798
that's cool too have you did you see a

1131
00:50:37,639 --> 00:50:42,358
bunch of those on your uh

1132

1133
00:50:42,358 --> 00:50:46,039
stuff too like we've got a couple of

1134
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:47,519
cuts here like the Harlem dreams and

1135
00:50:46,039 --> 00:50:49,440

1136
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:51,719
too and it's in that like in sensey sort

1137
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:54,960
of Frankincense realm I had a couple

1138
00:50:51,719 --> 00:50:57,439
like that one of my males that I used so

1139
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:59,358
I did uh I increased three packs using

1140
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:02,079
two males and then I utilized one male

1141
00:50:59,358 --> 00:51:03,880
just to seed up all of my Keepers um and

1142
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:05,760
that male was on the incense roomm and I

1143
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:08,318
had this like I called it like a Crocs

1144
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:10,200
back pattern the leaf was like Contour

1145
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:11,798
ah Contour the wrong word but it wasn't

1146
00:51:10,199 --> 00:51:14,679
like variegated it was weird it was like

1147
00:51:11,798 --> 00:51:16,358
a textured Leaf very ruffle yeah yeah

1148
00:51:14,679 --> 00:51:18,159
yeah yep I know exactly what you're

1149
00:51:16,358 --> 00:51:19,440
talking about oh awesome man yeah

1150
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:21,679
because I had three females that were

1151
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:25,880
like that too um but yeah I had I only

1152
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:28,039
had one okay my friend had this um Kina

1153
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:30,559
Negra from Buffalo seeds and that's

1154
00:51:28,039 --> 00:51:32,079
seedsman hay Colombian Black by seedsman

1155
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:34,040
Haze and so there were a few of the

1156
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:36,559
mango Haze that smelt exactly like that

1157
00:51:34,039 --> 00:51:38,079
it was like that lemon um sort of kick

1158
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:40,119
that I guess is like a oaz thing not

1159
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:41,798
sure but yeah I was stoked on it because

1160
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:44,240
I didn't get a lot of mango but a fair

1161
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:45,239
bit of this um lemony and like incense

1162
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:47,118
sort of

1163
00:51:45,239 --> 00:51:48,759
stuff but I didn't get to grow them

1164
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:50,760
properly like they were just for seed I

1165
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:52,119
um had planned to fill the greenhouse

1166
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:54,200
with them but my green houses were too

1167
00:51:52,119 --> 00:51:56,838
chalkers to get them in cuz they took

1168
00:51:54,199 --> 00:52:00,118
ages to flip man like I put them in 72

1169
00:51:56,838 --> 00:52:01,759
darkness and then um which Sam stunk man

1170
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:03,599
had said was like what you do for ctiv

1171
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:05,440
is to show sex or whatever and I chucked

1172
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:07,480
him outside and it still took like a

1173
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:10,400
good five weeks for them to sex hey like

1174
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:13,719
longest stuff I've ever um had to show

1175
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:18,000
sex yeah um the ones I did outside here

1176
00:52:13,719 --> 00:52:19,798
triggered super late um but indoor they

1177
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,079
don't really really hesitate I've

1178
00:52:19,798 --> 00:52:23,719
noticed they kind of go right to it

1179
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:26,519
which I thought was pretty weird but I

1180
00:52:23,719 --> 00:52:28,759
had some that it was you know set

1181
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:31,559
September before they flipped and I had

1182
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:33,760
to I had to move uh some of the ones I

1183
00:52:31,559 --> 00:52:37,200
did outside you know into a greenhouse

1184
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:38,960
to finish and it it's not that they took

1185
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:40,879
so long to flower it's just that they

1186
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:44,039
triggered way later than I mean they

1187
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:45,400
triggered later than A5 did here yeah

1188
00:52:44,039 --> 00:52:46,920
that's crazy I told my buddy that and

1189
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:49,079
he's like [ __ ] that's nuts because he'd

1190
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:51,639
only grown a few as well and um hadn't

1191
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:53,359
got to flower him so wow super sativa I

1192
00:52:51,639 --> 00:52:55,318
wonder if that's your like selection

1193
00:52:53,358 --> 00:52:56,880
Wally like when you got the seed line

1194
00:52:55,318 --> 00:52:58,558
like that's something my made asked me

1195
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:01,599
to ask you what do you know what mango

1196
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:04,680
Hay's IBL is like what what's is it

1197
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:08,760
inbred in a certain direction or for for

1198
00:53:04,679 --> 00:53:10,440
earlier stuff so Shanty reckons and I I

1199
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:13,280
I didn't I didn't really ask at the time

1200
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:16,119
how many like Generations he in breeded

1201
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:19,359
or or what he selected for but obviously

1202
00:53:16,119 --> 00:53:21,440
it was for earlier stuff and um I I've

1203
00:53:19,358 --> 00:53:23,598
grown a lot of mango ha before just the

1204
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,240
normal one and most of what I found was

1205
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:27,599
that incense sort of smell you were

1206
00:53:25,239 --> 00:53:30,318
talking about and uh it wasn't until I

1207
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:32,880
grew this I I actually found a mango

1208
00:53:30,318 --> 00:53:35,480
mango Haze which uh was a bit of a

1209
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:38,838
surprise it was fatter Bud though and um

1210
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:42,119
it SM like um more ripening mangoes

1211
00:53:38,838 --> 00:53:45,159
which I'm used to sour mangoes in like

1212
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:46,838
Asian stuff that I've grown and um so

1213
00:53:45,159 --> 00:53:50,558
then I I could see actually why it was

1214
00:53:46,838 --> 00:53:53,558
called mango ha prior to that I was more

1215
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:57,400
like incense Haze to me never came

1216
00:53:53,559 --> 00:53:57,400
across a mango one

1217
00:53:58,599 --> 00:54:04,039
for high and Lonesome what were some of

1218
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:06,519
your favorite crosses with the mango

1219
00:54:04,039 --> 00:54:08,440
Hayes or what you know what what did you

1220
00:54:06,519 --> 00:54:12,798
like coming out of

1221
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:16,559
that um it's I've really enjoyed all of

1222
00:54:12,798 --> 00:54:19,440
them it's it's uh it has something I

1223
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:22,599
like in a mail it's very I think it's

1224
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:24,720
very transparent um you get you get the

1225
00:54:22,599 --> 00:54:27,079
mango Haze in there it's definitely

1226
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:29,759
there you definitely you get the effect

1227
00:54:27,079 --> 00:54:32,519
from it um you know you get that

1228
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:36,079
instancy back into it but it lets the

1229
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:37,759
mother show through really well um you

1230
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:42,160
know

1231
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:46,640
the the kimd and the TK cross to Mango

1232
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:49,920
Hayes are both this to me it's like it's

1233
00:54:46,639 --> 00:54:52,719
like zombie weed you know like you're it

1234
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:54,880
completely spaces your mind out but

1235
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:56,838
you're still like motivated you're up

1236
00:54:54,880 --> 00:55:00,680
doing things it's just like

1237
00:54:56,838 --> 00:55:02,480
mechanical motion it's uh it's it's

1238
00:55:00,679 --> 00:55:07,279
really kind of awesome I've been smoking

1239
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:09,960
that every day um but then uh the the

1240
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:12,960
Green Crack mango Haze it really lets I

1241
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:15,838
mean it's like it's very mangoe um it

1242
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:19,039
kind of it goes in different directions

1243
00:55:15,838 --> 00:55:22,960
as it cures kind of um but that for

1244
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:26,358
flavor that one's incredible um

1245
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:29,318
the um breaking hazee which is the

1246
00:55:26,358 --> 00:55:33,318
electric boooo dog [ __ ] whatever mango

1247
00:55:29,318 --> 00:55:36,798
Hayes that's I I'm a big fan of that one

1248
00:55:33,318 --> 00:55:41,719
um I actually have a bunch going right

1249
00:55:36,798 --> 00:55:45,679
now um I've kind of been wanting to do a

1250
00:55:41,719 --> 00:55:48,279
a EB project for a few years I've made I

1251
00:55:45,679 --> 00:55:51,798
think this was the sixth outcross I made

1252
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:55,359
with it and I think it's the one to look

1253
00:55:51,798 --> 00:55:58,038
for a male to backat cross to um the

1254
00:55:55,358 --> 00:56:00,798
plants are

1255
00:55:58,039 --> 00:56:03,920
there what I wanted um you do get

1256
00:56:00,798 --> 00:56:06,679
variations on the mother there um there

1257
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:08,920
are a few straight mango Haze plants but

1258
00:56:06,679 --> 00:56:11,838
for the most part it it really lets the

1259
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,838
mother plant shine

1260
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:19,720
through super cool to hear

1261
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:22,358
that they sound delicious those crosses

1262
00:56:19,719 --> 00:56:25,558
actually yeah did did you get some of

1263
00:56:22,358 --> 00:56:28,519
them no just the um I don't think so

1264
00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:31,160
just the East Coast s diesel appala one

1265
00:56:28,519 --> 00:56:34,679
that I that I recall all right I'll make

1266
00:56:31,159 --> 00:56:38,399
sure you what did you get A5 mango Haze

1267
00:56:34,679 --> 00:56:40,279
mate and some La Kush mango Haze or

1268
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,920
something like that I might have I'd

1269
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:45,920
have to CH that that does seed

1270
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:48,519
containers I've got Fu they're full and

1271
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:51,599
I have trouble finding stuff

1272
00:56:48,519 --> 00:56:53,679
now it all so you I can sort it all out

1273
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:56,680
but uh there's so much stuff in there

1274
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:56,679
right

1275
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:01,720
I've literally I can't even find what I

1276
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,838
and I'm sure it's in there but I can't

1277
00:57:01,719 --> 00:57:06,118
find

1278
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:10,000
it Wally did you have anything else to

1279
00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:12,760
add to the uh mango Hayes account uh any

1280
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:16,159
anything um come to mind while H Lanson

1281
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:18,319
was talking about it well some of my

1282
00:57:16,159 --> 00:57:22,000
first experiences with it to be honest I

1283
00:57:18,318 --> 00:57:24,318
um it was um mold resistance better than

1284
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,920
anything I had ever seen I saw that

1285
00:57:24,318 --> 00:57:30,519
stuff go in later flower

1286
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:33,159
and it was just pouring here for weeks

1287
00:57:30,519 --> 00:57:35,880
like literally every day all day and

1288
00:57:33,159 --> 00:57:38,000
that stuff um you know you fold back the

1289
