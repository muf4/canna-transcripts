Matthew owner of Riot seeds and this

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,320
started as a one-man mission for strain

00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:17,160
history and breeding science over time

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,560
it's evolved into something bigger

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,960
better and more of a team effort we will

9
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:22,599
be joined by members of the can

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,880
Illuminati and other friends throughout

00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,039
the seasons to hear their takes on grow

14
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,000
combat the Nar that corporate cannabis

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,520

40
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:35,519
all right welcome to reader Syndicate

41
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,879
I'm Matthew and today I'm here with Yoni

42
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:40,438
the CEO of plant cell technology if that

43
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:43,000
is that correct that's correct all right

44
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:45,239
and um the other day I I kind of

45
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,680
stumbled on to you through a mutual

46
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:50,599
friend and they were showing that you're

47
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:54,000
doing a embryonic rescue on seeds which

48
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:55,879
fascinates me all the Breeders out there

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,640
um people that are just genuinely

50
00:01:55,879 --> 00:02:01,000
interested in seed collecting and so I

51
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,159
went in and look like you guys were

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,078
competently doing embryonic rescue which

53
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:09,759
is something I've not seen yet displayed

54
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:11,199
shown really like like you guys did um

55
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:13,958
so it fascinated me and I wanted to

56
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,399
reach out so here we are um tell me a

57
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:17,159
little bit about your and how it got

58
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,920
started tell me about yourself yeah so

59
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:20,639
so plant cell technology first off Matt

60
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:22,719
it's great to be here and uh I love that

61
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:25,000
you stumbled on our our our video you

62
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,800
know being confident is uh is is the

63
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,239
Baseline for what we

64
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,120
expect we it's it's important to be

65
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:32,640
professional and and more importantly to

66
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,560
to give people the resources and the

67
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,199
opportunity to watch right a lot of

68
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,759
science is hidden behind closed doors

69
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:40,359
and uh I think part of our mission is to

70
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:42,679
democratize tissue culture and make this

71
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,560
more accessible to the world so um on

72
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,800
that point you know plant cell

73
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,400
technology started about 30 years ago

74
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,400
okay and the the origin story that a lot

75
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,760
of people don't know is we actually

76
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,760
started as a toy company and the whole

77
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:56,719
idea yeah it's called pet plant so the

78
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:58,280
whole idea was you could get you know

79
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,199
three different test tubes filled with

80
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,400
gel and you'd get different seeds you

81
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:06,199
would have a corn seed you would have a

82
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,560
CA seed and you would have a tomato seed

83
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:09,878
and kids would be able to watch the

84
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:13,199
plants grow in in the test tube for

85
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:15,280
example um in the gel and you know it's

86
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,158
fun fun toy this is like around the time

87
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,640
pet rock was a thing you know pet

88
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:21,878
everything uh Space Monkeys or water

89
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:24,679
monkeys whatever you would call them um

90
00:03:21,878 --> 00:03:27,079
there was one problem with this toy is

91
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,239
that the gel kept getting contaminated

92
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:31,799
yeah so we developed plant preservative

93
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:33,560
mixture which is the only EPA approved

94
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:35,760
solution that you know protects the

95
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,560
plants doesn't hurt the plants but keeps

96
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:39,598
bacteria and fungus outside of your

97
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,199
outside of your cultures um and that's

98
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:43,000
really where that's really what got us

99
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:46,158
our foot in the door into the industry

100
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,878
so fast forward 30 years later PPM is is

101
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:50,280
widely used across the industry it's an

102
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:51,560
industry standard for for most labs and

103
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,280
internationally

104
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,719
especially but what we wanted to do is

105
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,759
is figure out a way to bridge the gap

106
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:01,759
between your bioengineers you know your

107
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:03,318
your highly educ ated scientists and

108
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:05,798
people that wanted to get into the space

109
00:04:03,318 --> 00:04:10,518
but might not have access so we started

110
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:12,840
developing a series of videos education

111
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:14,360
classes to show people what we did in

112
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,160
the lab you know what's the R&amp;D that

113
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,359
we're doing behind those doors what are

114
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,359
the products that we're using to be

115
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,680
successful and not only are we going to

116
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:23,599
provide you with those products but

117
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,160
we're going to teach you how to use them

118
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,080
and you know while we do service the

119
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,759
largest commercial tissue culture labs

120
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,758
in the world they know exactly what

121
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,720
there buying we thought that it's

122
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,919
important to create more education in

123
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,320
the space um more videos more content

124
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:39,279
and also break it down for people that

125
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:43,639
weren't

126
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:45,439
necessarily um learning from the

127
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:46,840
scientific journals and papers that they

128
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,000
either might not have access to or might

129
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:52,879
not understand um and I very much

130
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,079
believe that plant tissue culture is a

131
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:57,038
trade skill right being able to work in

132
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:59,680
a lab being able to be successful and

133
00:04:57,038 --> 00:05:01,159
and mitigate contamination uh being

134
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,879
successful lab technician is something

135
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,120
that we should be training more people

136
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,079
in and giving more people the

137
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,079
opportunity because this is a very

138
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:10,038
important skill and and as I like to

139
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:11,399
tell people at least with with cannabis

140
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:13,478
hemp specifically we're only in the

141
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:16,239
second or third inning of the ball game

142
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:19,279
right now and the research is flooding

143
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,840
in the opportunities are expanding and

144
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:23,839
and we're just we're seeing an exciting

145
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:25,599
wave now of energy that people aren't

146
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,959
just questioning whether or not TC is

147
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,840
good for them but they're now trying to

148
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:31,038
figure out how to do it for themselves

149
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:33,198
that was a little long monologue of how

150
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:34,800
we got started but we really you know

151
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,720
started from just a product company and

152
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:41,240
now I I try to think of us as a a

153
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:43,120
collective or an all-in-one shop for

154
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,879
plant tissue culture with education

155
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,600
Consulting products and support and and

156
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:50,120
we have this community that we've built

157
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,800
and hopefully continue to build that now

158
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,560
you're a part of so thanks for thanks

159
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:58,280
for joining our video and hopefully it's

160
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,519
many yeah it was it was smart and and I

161
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:03,399
don't usually get like motivated to hit

162
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:06,240
people up YouTube I I really don't it it

163
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:08,478
it was awesome and it was well done

164
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,879
first of many yeah first of many and

165
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:11,598
it's all free that's the that's the

166
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:13,199
beautiful part right people there's a

167
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:14,439
lot of pay walls behind this information

168
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,319
or people just don't want to talk about

169
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:18,598
it but yeah we're here to tell you as

170
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,800
much as we can right yeah some things

171
00:06:18,598 --> 00:06:22,159
are proprietary obviously but obviously

172
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,079
um something like when it comes to

173
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,919
embryo rescue uh that's a skill that I

174
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:29,598
think Growers especially will be excited

175
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:30,519
to learn about because I mean how many

176
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:33,399
seeds have you thrown out in your

177
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:34,959
lifetime my God so many there's so we

178
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:36,959
like between me and a few other breeders

179
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:40,159
we have a large stock of some of the

180
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:42,359
oldest seeds in in cannabis history just

181
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,800
sitting and waiting not doing anything

182
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,479
in fridges just waiting for people that

183
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,520
have the skill to do this and just just

184
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:51,279
and so many people have pretended to we

185
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:54,038
give them to him and nothing comes from

186
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:56,758
it ever so yeah yeah it's

187
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:58,519
exciting yeah so I mean what we can do

188
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:01,080
with embrya rescue while while we're not

189
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:04,279
guaranteeing 100% results you know no

190
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:06,240
nothing in science is ever 100% um but

191
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:07,758
if you do have old seeds I mean we we've

192
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,199
worked with seeds that are 30 40 years

193
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:13,240
old and we've been able to germinate

194
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:15,038
them um so yeah I can I can just Dive

195
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,079
Right into embryo rescue if you want

196
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:20,399
please do you know at its core um you

197
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:24,159
know majority of Growers like to pop

198
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:26,799
seeds uh feno hunt look for new strains

199
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,199
one of the big and common issues with

200
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,120
popping seeds was some of them just

201
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:32,680
won't work right yeah they're not going

202
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,160
to germinate and people throw them out

203
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,240
fortunately uh due to plant tissue

204
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,319
culture and some of the skills uh

205
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,759
developed in embryo rescue this is

206
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:43,400
actually I want to give credit to to

207
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:45,000
Bill Graham the very first yeah yeah uh

208
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:46,839
you know plant tissue culture in your

209
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,918
kitchen you know he's been the god I

210
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:52,279
like to call him the Godfather of DC

211
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:54,038
yeah uh but he's he's really perfected

212
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:56,000
this skill and and taught us and now

213
00:07:54,038 --> 00:07:57,399
we're trying to teach the world as well

214
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,879
but what we're doing is we're removing

215
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:02,198
the outer coat of the seed

216
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:04,199
sometimes a 20 30 40y Old seed doesn't

217
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:07,120
have enough energy to germinate outside

218
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:10,158
his coat um so you what we do is we make

219
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,280
a slight incision um after soaking it in

220
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:13,800
like a hydrogen peroxide solution for

221
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:15,719
anybody that has you know questions on

222
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,120
the actual details of or the actual

223
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,720
protocols on how to do it we're we're

224
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,478
happy to share those no problem just you

225
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,720
know feel free to reach out to Matt feel

226
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:24,800
free to reach out to us

227
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,319
someo yeah we we'll share the actual

228
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,879
videos that we did um but I'm I'm you

229
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:31,520
know giving you the broad Strokes here

230
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:35,200
so we're we're cting out the the the

231
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:37,598
seed embryo and inducing it in a

232
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:41,039
nutrient-rich medium so what we have

233
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:43,440
here for example this is a gel um it's

234
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:46,559
augur based so this is completely vegan

235
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,760
made out of seaweed and this this gel is

236
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:50,159
mixed with a variety of macro and

237
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:51,559
micronutrients it's actually a

238
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:53,639
proprietary formula that we'll be

239
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:55,119
launching soon fun fact and it it works

240
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:58,799
amazing I mean you can see this little

241
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,399
guy this is from L 1121 guava Tarts yeah

242
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:02,799
one of the uh seeds we actually popped

243
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,360
on the video but you know it's rooting

244
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:08,599
it's looking beautiful it's looking

245
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:11,919
great um you know this nutrient media is

246
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,759
about three times as rich in the macro

247
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:16,958
micronutrients that plants desire as

248
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:20,200
like traditional soil yeah so the seeds

249
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:22,439
have not only the you know the energy to

250
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,759
be able to germinate but they're

251
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,680
actually able to flourish you know both

252
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:31,240
root develop shoots quite vigorously I

253
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:33,759
mean this is uh maybe 10 days yeah after

254
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:36,000
the seed just wouldn't move if we if we

255
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:39,319
planted it in the ground so what what

256
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,159
we've tried to share with Growers is

257
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,760
that tissue culture is a new is is

258
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:46,240
actually not a new tool it's been around

259
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:48,879
since the 60s and earlier it really

260
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,200
started in the Orchid industry um every

261
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:53,799
Orchid that you buy in your Trader Joe's

262
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,800
or Walmart or grocery store is likely a

263
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:58,319
clone and likely started in tissue

264
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:59,958
culture right orchids are very hard to

265
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,040
germinate from seeds

266
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:05,319
tissue culture asexual propagation has

267
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:06,799
been the the go-to mechanism so now at

268
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,879
least within the the hemp and cannabis

269
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:11,958
space we're trying to tell Growers you

270
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:13,958
can adopt these same technologies that

271
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:15,639
have benefited some of the largest

272
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:17,559
pharmaceutical companies in the world

273
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:20,078
the largest agricultural companies in

274
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:22,719
the world flower companies we can apply

275
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:24,399
that same technology and it's it's

276
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,120
really right now being led by a lot of

277
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,200
the private sector I'd say there are a

278
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,679
few universities that can legally work

279
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,320
with it um but because of all the red

280
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:34,719
tape and bureaucracy it's taking a lot

281
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,639
more time than it should so something

282
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,920
like embryo rescue is one of the easiest

283
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:43,240
I'd say steps um in the tissue culture

284
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:46,278
process and when I say easy it's it's

285
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:48,519
not that the skill itself is easy but

286
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:50,799
the mechanism and once you learn how to

287
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:53,839
do it you ride a bike you yeah you're

288
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:55,879
gonna you're gonna Excel um but yeah

289
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,920
this at its very simplest form is I'd

290
00:10:55,879 --> 00:11:01,679
say step one um if you're a grower if

291
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:04,078
you're breeder and you want to work with

292
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:05,799
old seeds that you're scared won't

293
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:07,759
germinate this is one of the best shots

294
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:09,240
you have um you're cutting out that

295
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:11,879
outer shell and you're exposing it to

296
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,519
that nutrient-rich media that needs and

297
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:16,399
then the rest is uh just watching it

298
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:19,600
grow and putting it under light um and

299
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,919
then when you look at other kind of

300
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,639
techniques that you'll learn along the

301
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:25,799
way so this is from noo culture um what

302
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:27,440
that means is we're taking Noto

303
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:30,479
propagation so we're taking the cutting

304
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,320
from a mother plant okay and and we're

305
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,360
using that nutrient-rich media and we're

306
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,879
letting it flourish and then from here I

307
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,959
would take this and I'd acclimate it

308
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:43,720
either in rock wool cubes or I would

309
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:45,319
yeah probably rock wool um the the

310
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,800
biggest thing that I would tell Growers

311
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:51,560
or the biggest challenge they have is

312
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:53,799
acclimating these plants I mean just

313
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:55,958
yeah most plants need a hardening period

314
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:57,879
yeah so 10 to 12 days you're you're you

315
00:11:55,958 --> 00:12:00,719
know right now this is close to 100%

316
00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:02,879
humidity because there's a a little vent

317
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,480
right here it's allowed to breathe which

318
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:07,078
means humidity is slightly less however

319
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,680
you still want to adjust it right if I

320
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:12,599
was to take this out and try to plant it

321
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:15,638
in soil it's not GNA live go yeah yeah

322
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,399
so there is an acclamation period And

323
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:20,120
what I what I like to tell Growers is

324
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:22,320
all these skills can be obtained you

325
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,320
know you don't need a master's degree or

326
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,360
a PhD to do this uh but you do need a

327
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,399
will to uh to fail and and try again so

328
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,278
yeah a lot of people will fail fail when

329
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,399
you first start because contamination is

330
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:37,198
a problem right learning atic technique

331
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:40,679
learning how to work in the uh under

332
00:12:37,198 --> 00:12:42,879
under a Flo hood and and how to avoid

333
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:46,039
contamination risks is one of the

334
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:49,159
biggest challenges but again um we've

335
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:50,838
had classes where people watch us do uh

336
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:52,240
meristem dissection for example they

337
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,320
tell themselves you know they're scared

338
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,799
they're never going to be able to do it

339
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,959
and after three or four tries they did

340
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:59,919
it perfectly yeah once they did it once

341
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:02,838
they do it five six seven times and

342
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:04,958
nothing's scary anymore yeah so we you

343
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:07,399
know we've seen people from all age

344
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:09,638
groups all skill levels succeed in this

345
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:11,639
and it's it's really just about

346
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:13,480
commitment to pushing through some of

347
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:15,000
those challenges and also just asking

348
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,800
questions right if something doesn't

349
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,320
work why didn't it work was it the

350
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:22,439
lighting was it the media was it the was

351
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,000
there ventilation or no ventilation so I

352
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,240
think a lot of people want kind of

353
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,360
instant answers and the good news is you

354
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,879
know we're releasing a all-in-one media

355
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:34,320
so all you have to do is add water and

356
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:37,799
and uh solidify

357
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,399
however um if you want to do the

358
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:40,879
research and want to work through it you

359
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:42,480
can do that too and that's that's where

360
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:44,198
we can provide a guide for you we have

361
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,600
all the lists of pgrs that you can

362
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:47,639
access all the um different components

363
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,920
that you would need to run your own

364
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:52,879
experiments but it's uh I don't I don't

365
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,399
need to sell the specific products here

366
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:56,120
but that that's exciting kind of stuff

367
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,278
and and when you're talking about it one

368
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,159
of the first things you mentioned early

369
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:00,958
on was PPM

370
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:02,198
talk about what that means so people

371
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:03,879
understand what that means because most

372
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:06,278
people growing would think that means

373
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:08,198
parts per million like measuring stuff

374
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:09,919
out you know yep PPM if you use

375
00:14:08,198 --> 00:14:11,958
fertilizers you refer to parts per

376
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:14,759
million so plant preservative mixture at

377
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:16,599
its at its simplest is a preservative

378
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:18,879
that keeps out any bacteria or fungus

379
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,800
from growing in this test tube without

380
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:23,958
damaging the plant itself you know

381
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:26,120
pesticides and herbicides and certain

382
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:27,879
fertilizers are sprayed on Plants yeah

383
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,600
this is a way that we can avoid that all

384
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:31,958
together um

385
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,278
and it's mixed in with the media it's

386
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:35,958
autoclaved so you would mix in the

387
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:38,639
powder You' mix in the water you'd add

388
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:40,719
PPM and then you'd autoclave it and

389
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,000
you're good to go and what PPM does is

390
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,680
if you make a mistake if you uh

391
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,759
accidentally breathe or you might have

392
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:50,599
touched your scalp before you cut the

393
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:54,480
plant I mean it's giving you an extra

394
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:56,440
layer of insurance right these medias as

395
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,600
I mentioned earlier three times as

396
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,240
nutrient rich as traditional soils you

397
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,399
can imagine as much as the plant loves

398
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,399
it bugs love it bacteria love itely Fung

399
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:08,720
fungus loves it

400
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:10,000
so PPM is like PPM is insurance right

401
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,399
you're you're operating in a tissue

402
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,559
culture lab you're inevitably GNA get

403
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,559
contamination there are very few I would

404
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:18,599
say I don't I don't even know if there

405
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:20,319
are any labs that never experienced

406
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,399
contamination across the board humans

407
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,240
are imperfect right you're bound to make

408
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,120
mistakes um and especially if you're

409
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,159
doing thousands of cultures a day you're

410
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,759
mistakes are going to be made so PPM is

411
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:33,278
that extra layer of security no bacteria

412
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,000
or fungus is going to be able to grow in

413
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:38,439
there and then you can transfer that

414
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,519
plant so it's no longer exposed to those

415
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:43,000
contaminants in that small space so the

416
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,759
the biggest challenge when a plant is

417
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,919
exposed to fungus or bacteria in tissue

418
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:50,519
culture versus in the field is you're

419
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:54,198
competing for limited nutrients here um

420
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:57,560
versus a larger space and you know at

421
00:15:54,198 --> 00:15:59,958
its core it's it's enabled labs around

422
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:03,958
the world whether they're in Pakistan or

423
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:05,758
Benin or South Africa or Chile to be

424
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:07,799
able to operate at the same level as

425
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,360
some of the highest tech labs because

426
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:12,000
you know you can work there's a company

427
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,720
called viscon and I think they build out

428
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,679
Labs that are 10 152 million doar right

429
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,079
these are state-ofthe-art cream of the

430
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:21,838
crop best you can get of everything

431
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:24,559
fully automated beautiful labs and then

432
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:27,720
you have a lot of universities and

433
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:29,198
research centers and companies in

434
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,720
developing countries that might not be

435
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:33,799
able to afford that that likely can

436
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:36,199
afford that and that's where PPM can add

437
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:37,919
a little bit more support to their

438
00:16:36,198 --> 00:16:39,799
facility to their protocols and to their

439
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:42,360
workflow so that if their you know

440
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:45,159
workers inevitably do make a mistake

441
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:48,278
it's not going to cost them however much

442
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:49,719
each test tube is worth um so you know

443
00:16:48,278 --> 00:16:53,159
that that's really what got us the foot

444
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,759
in the door and so companies knew yeah

445
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:58,159
it's our creation it was

446
00:16:54,759 --> 00:17:01,159
patented um it was a game it was a major

447
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:02,759
game changer for for tissue culture yeah

448
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:04,359
the the the original claim was you could

449
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:06,558
do tissue culture without a lamin or Flo

450
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:09,198
hood and people went crazy uh oh I mean

451
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:11,199
that's oh yeah no it's that's that

452
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,038
wasn't uh you know we posted that in a

453
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,318
Minnesota University of Minnesota list

454
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:16,798
serve I think in the 90s and people just

455
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:20,159
people are I

456
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:21,400
rate I bet try being an outsider coming

457
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,000
into the industry and saying actually

458
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,720
guys you can do this differently um and

459
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,119
while we've had some success with that I

460
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,759
wouldn't recommend it yeah yeah I do

461
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:31,719
recommend using a Flo Hood I do

462
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:32,919
recommend practicing aseptic technique

463
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,919
because all those skills that you're

464
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:35,960
going to learn and you're going to

465
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,440
practice it's the right way to do it

466
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,360
right you can shoot a basketball

467
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,558
different ways but learning the right

468
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:43,678
shot I'd say is recommended for most

469
00:17:41,558 --> 00:17:46,759
players sure and I'd say the same goes

470
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,880
for tissue culture um but you know PPM

471
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:51,640
is that revolutionary product that put

472
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,480
us that put our foot in the door and I I

473
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,320
I can tell you it's over the last five

474
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:58,558
six years um if it weren't for a lot of

475
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:01,599
our marketing and sales efforts it's

476
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:04,639
been hard um some of our competitors are

477
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:06,599
signing you know non-exclusive contracts

478
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,880
with Distributors so you know they can

479
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:09,798
only distribute products that our

480
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:13,440
competitors don't carry so it really

481
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:17,119
forces us outside of our box to develop

482
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,480
new products yeah so PPM was the first

483
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:21,319
um we have two patent pending products

484
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,919
now one is called the bio coupler and

485
00:18:21,319 --> 00:18:25,759
the bioil and tell me a little bit about

486
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:30,799
the bio couler because I know that's a

487
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:32,759
lot absolutely so I think the 70s or 80s

488
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:34,759
there's been research in the plant

489
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:36,240
tissue culture and and agricultural

490
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:38,919
technology space about temporary

491
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:42,798
immersion and temporary immersion is

492
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:45,559
essentially your in in traditional

493
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:48,400
semisolid media you have one contact

494
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:50,480
point where the the root of the plant or

495
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,519
the the base of the plant contacts the

496
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,360
media and that's where it absorbs

497
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,798
nutrients with temporary immersion

498
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:56,678
you're actually soaking the whole plant

499
00:18:54,798 --> 00:19:00,359
in nutrients temporarily and then you're

500
00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:04,240
letting it dry out so mechanism and that

501
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:06,399
360 contact Point uh with the plant not

502
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,720
only increases the speed at which that

503
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,120
plant grows but increases the actual

504
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,839
quantity of plants that you're getting

505
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:16,359
yeah so this technology has been

506
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:18,918
revolutionary for almost 50 60 years but

507
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:20,959
the the systems and Contraptions and

508
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:23,159
pipes and tubes for temporary immersion

509
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,159
bioreactors are just not feasible uh if

510
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:27,640
you look at temporary immersion

511
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:30,120
bioreactors today a lot of them have you

512
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:32,799
know two three four four filters per

513
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:34,599
bioreactor they have these long air

514
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:36,960
tubes that connect to those filters and

515
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:40,240
then connect to oxygen tanks those tubes

516
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,798
are bound to get contaminated clogged

517
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,279
filters are are you know you need to

518
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:46,079
replace them maybe every six to 12

519
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:49,158
months those filters aren't cheap yeah

520
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:53,079
right and the risk of losing maybe five

521
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:54,960
liters worth of plants is high so while

522
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:56,599
the technology has been there there

523
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,480
hasn't been an application that's been

524
00:19:56,599 --> 00:20:02,279
feasible for the commercial ation of it

525
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,839
at scale um and there are companies that

526
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:06,440
use temporary immersion bioreactors

527
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:08,119
there are a few out there that are very

528
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:11,480
good I mean they're amazing at what they

529
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:13,678
do pumping in air works very well um but

530
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:17,759
not necessarily as commercially feasible

531
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:19,600
in the long run so what we did is uh you

532
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:21,879
know at its simplest it's it's keep it

533
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:23,558
simple stupid right yeah the most

534
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,000
complex system sometimes are the

535
00:20:23,558 --> 00:20:28,918
simplest so the bio coupler connects two

536
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,640
glass devices and every time you wrote

537
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:32,640
that device there's an air exchange so

538
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,440
instead of using a a tube and instead of

539
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,880
pumping in oxygen the plants that every

540
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,640
time the the bio coupler rotates oxygen

541
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:42,600
is pumped through the little air patch

542
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:44,038
filter that we have and the process is

543
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:46,199
quite simple I mean you screw out the

544
00:20:44,038 --> 00:20:48,359
bottom you screw a new media all you

545
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:51,120
have to do is change out the media and

546
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:53,158
it's I mean it'll take you less than 30

547
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:56,359
seconds versus the old bioreactors might

548
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:57,600
take you an hour 20 minutes 30 minutes

549
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:59,359
uh so what we've done is we've

550
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:02,519
simplified

551
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:04,678
the bioreactor model uh by creating a

552
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:07,119
more commercially viable option and it's

553
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:09,640
it's incredible what it can do um some

554
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:11,879
plants like orchids we're seeing 30 40

555
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,440
50 times multiplication rates versus

556
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,320
traditional semisolid media you're

557
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,400
getting three or four three or four

558
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:20,798
plants you know we're getting 40 we're

559
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:23,120
getting 50 um we see this application

560
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:27,240
being useful for all types of crops

561
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:30,199
bananas pineapples orchids cannabis you

562
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:32,720
name it and so what we've done the bio

563
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:35,319
coupler is is the base device the bio

564
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:38,120
tilt is our Automated machine so instead

565
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:40,240
of you flipping the device every single

566
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:42,479
day we have a device that does that

567
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,120
automatically you can program it you can

568
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,480
set your own timing on it you know I

569
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:48,038
want to flip it once every three hours I

570
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,400
want to flip it for I want it to soak

571
00:21:48,038 --> 00:21:51,359
for two minutes I want it to soak for

572
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:54,360
three minutes we've really created a

573
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:56,918
tool that people can master and create

574
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:59,759
their own research with uh by making

575
00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:02,600
slight modifications to the programming

576
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:05,558
and that enables people to with any

577
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:08,038
species have accessibility to a a

578
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:09,918
technology that's going to be a game

579
00:22:08,038 --> 00:22:11,679
changer that eventually will disrupt and

580
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,679
I think maybe replace the tissue culture

581
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:16,880
space Oh wow

582
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,600
and this is hopefully the you know 1.0

583
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,400
right this is the bio tilt 1.0 we're

584
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:22,759
gonna keep developing it keep improving

585
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,200
it and the hope is that this will help

586
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:28,519
Growers mass-produced plants that are

587
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,720
clean yeah more consistently and at a

588
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:32,119
cheaper price than if they were using

589
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,000
tissue culture because at the end of the

590
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:36,519
day the giling agent that you're buying

591
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,798
might cost you $90 to $100 a kilogram

592
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:40,319
with temporary immersion you don't even

593
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:41,879
need it wow you just cut that from your

594
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:45,720
budget

595
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:48,200
altoe so yeah and it's it's been and the

596
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,759
funny part is it's not new right we

597
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,400
didn't invent we didn't invent the wheel

598
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:54,720
here we just made a better wheel that

599
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:57,200
fits the car yeah um more efficient

600
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,600
wheel yeah doesn't break down as easy

601
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:03,480
the rubber Treads last long ER easier to

602
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:05,719
change the tires right we're trying to

603
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,480
make tissue culture more accessible to

604
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,558
people and and that's through education

605
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,880
but also through R&amp;D and I'll tell you

606
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:14,359
it's uh you know developing the stuff is

607
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:17,120
not cheap and it takes a lot of time so

608
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:19,359
we're we're doing our best and we are a

609
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:21,479
fairly small company so I think a lot of

610
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:22,719
people look at our website or look at

611
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:26,919
our history and they think we're this

612
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:29,000
huge corporation but we're not um we're

613
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:31,159
I think four or five fulltime people I

614
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
mean we have a lot of contractors and we

615
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:35,960
do contract manufacturing but yeah it's

616
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,440
family business we we're we're expanding

617
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:40,120
very fast and you know anybody who's

618
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,440
listening that made an order and that's

619
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:44,199
still waiting on it you know thank you

620
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,519
for your patience we apologize I mean

621
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,519
Black Friday was kind of insane for us

622
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:50,038
we're

623
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:51,918
uh we're so grateful I mean look these

624
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:53,640
are all blessings I I just want to be

625
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,520
able to keep up with the demand and I I

626
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,919
just want people to to know that we're

627
00:23:55,519 --> 00:24:00,240
here for them because yeah it's it's a

628
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:02,400
daunting industry it's you know you you

629
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,319
look on Google or Wikipedia and you just

630
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,159
there's all these journals and papers

631
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:09,399
and if you're not from that world it's

632
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:11,440
intimidating and uh hopefully we can be

633
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:13,038
that bridge for for The Growers and

634
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,200
especially in the Cannabis space like

635
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:16,200
we're here to help you know we're here

636
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:20,480
to answer your questions we want you to

637
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:23,038
use this tool because um Hops and vroid

638
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,240
fusarium uh spidermites powdery Milo I

639
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:28,038
mean these are big problems and they're

640
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:31,558
costing Growers money I mean I think I

641
00:24:28,038 --> 00:24:33,319
like to quaint um maybe maybe this is

642
00:24:31,558 --> 00:24:36,278
controversial but I like to call hops

643
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:38,158
Lon vroid the AIDS of of yeah it is it

644
00:24:36,278 --> 00:24:40,038
is and people don't realize it like

645
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,320
unless you're heavily into genetics

646
00:24:40,038 --> 00:24:43,960
collecting and like I we have ears all

647
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:46,519
over the the world and now we're hearing

648
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,120
about labs in Spain going down like that

649
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:49,599
have the major collections that have

650
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:52,000
been over in Amsterdam stuff that

651
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:53,759
haven't made it over here like it's bad

652
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,720
it's it's it's scary and everybody has

653
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:58,839
it or you know 70 80% of Growers have it

654
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,720
and so the good news

655
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:04,119
to that problem is there is a cure yeah

656
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:06,399
there is there is a protocol and a

657
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:08,000
mechanism of remediating those plants

658
00:25:06,398 --> 00:25:12,239
and that's where we come in that's where

659
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,079
plant tissue culture thrives yeah so the

660
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,679
for for surface pathogens when you're

661
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:17,278
talking about some of your your common

662
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,960
pests right your powdery mildew your

663
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:22,839
spidermites those are more easily

664
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:24,919
curable with um surface sterilization

665
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:26,798
and noal culture right we're we're

666
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:28,320
taking parts of the plant that might not

667
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:31,679
yet be infected or if they are infected

668
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:33,439
Ed they're they're less there's a lower

669
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,880
uh bug count than other parts of the

670
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,640
leaf we're yeah killing it we're you

671
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,760
know surfest sterilizing that leaf and

672
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,480
then we're inducing it in media that's

673
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:44,079
clean and then keeping it in this clean

674
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:46,319
container away from your mother room

675
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:48,278
away from potential contaminantes so if

676
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:49,558
your HVAC technician comes in the room

677
00:25:48,278 --> 00:25:51,960
he's not going to be able to infect this

678
00:25:49,558 --> 00:25:53,678
little guy because it's sealed yeah as

679
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,519
opposed to your mother room good luck

680
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,640
you know if uh if he brings in something

681
00:25:55,519 --> 00:26:01,200
from another facility or if if forget to

682
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,278
clean your your shears or if somebody

683
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,640
brings in cuting and they don't

684
00:26:02,278 --> 00:26:08,278
quarantine it adequately it will spread

685
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:11,000
oh yeah um when it comes to ferium

686
00:26:08,278 --> 00:26:13,278
and you know cops lat and broid the

687
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,440
worst of them all that's where we really

688
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:18,720
focus on the apical marem dissection so

689
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,558
what we're doing we have tons of videos

690
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,120
on this if you're if your users are

691
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:25,359
interested is we're isolating the apical

692
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:27,879
meristem which if you think about it is

693
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:30,158
the primordial tissue not connected to

694
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:32,159
the rest of the plant with scientific

695
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:35,679
terms it's it's disconnected from the

696
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:37,679
vascul of the plant tissue so that cell

697
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,480
cluster is not yet exposed to whatever

698
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,600
viroid or virus or fungus has infected

699
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,880
the rest of the plant I mean you're

700
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:47,119
literally going down to Mill millimeters

701
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,399
going very very small I mean it's you

702
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:50,439
won't be able to see it with the naked

703
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:51,759
eye we use a hypodermic needle to

704
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,600
isolate it and then we put it in this

705
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:55,960
grow medium and you know in in three

706
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:58,759
months it'll grow it'll grow up to be a

707
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:01,240
normal plant but it's small it's tiny

708
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:04,119
but that's the mechanism at least our

709
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:06,079
best plan of action right uh if a plant

710
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:07,879
is highly infected you might have to do

711
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:09,519
it a couple times yeah which means you

712
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,278
take the marem you let it grow out then

713
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:13,319
you take a marem again you let it grow

714
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:15,919
out it really depends on the viral load

715
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:17,480
but right now that is our best mechanism

716
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,520
that is our best tool that we can use

717
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,399
and we're not using pesticides we're not

718
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:23,558
using herbicides we're not soaking it in

719
00:27:21,398 --> 00:27:25,558
anything that's gonna you know affect

720
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:28,000
the actual outcome of the plant down the

721
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:30,960
line when it's eventually consumed uh

722
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,038
but this mechanism is highly highly

723
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,679
beneficial um and I'd say it's it's

724
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:38,398
probably the hardest skill to learn in

725
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:40,960
tissue culture yeah um so luckily noal

726
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:42,079
culture is fairly basic and and

727
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,360
something most people can learn but

728
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:46,599
merism takes a little bit of practice

729
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:48,558
but what I can tell you is a $100

730
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:50,959
microscope you can do it hypodermic

731
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:52,879
needle you can buy it on Amazon yeah um

732
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,240
you know you can really practice and get

733
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,679
better at the skill or you just have one

734
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:01,319
guy you know Joey's the the guy and he

735
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:03,240
can do 20 30 an hour right um but what

736
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:06,240
we tell Growers especially when it comes

737
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:08,399
to viroids and you know P serium

738
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,359
specifically is take as many meristems

739
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:12,319
as you can right because you don't you

740
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:14,599
don't want to use your

741
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:17,359
meristem we we like to be preventative

742
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:19,519
instead of reactive um so the proactive

743
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:22,479
measure is you know keeping your spaces

744
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:26,038
clean uh bleaching the floors you know

745
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:28,278
following propter Pro proper um

746
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:29,798
sterile conditions and and keeping your

747
00:28:28,278 --> 00:28:33,919
overall facility clean right not

748
00:28:29,798 --> 00:28:36,079
everybody does that but Mar steming and

749
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,720
learning that skill is I'd say the last

750
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:40,798
resort uh the first Resort is using

751
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,679
tissue culture using noal culture

752
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:45,398
testing your plants keeping them backed

753
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:47,798
up so that inevitably if and when

754
00:28:45,398 --> 00:28:50,759
something does get infected great I have

755
00:28:47,798 --> 00:28:53,079
10 of these or 50 of these so I can time

756
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:55,240
it out in two to three weeks they'll be

757
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:57,398
in the vegro and ready to go but you

758
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:59,880
have backups and we have the mechanism

759
00:28:57,398 --> 00:29:01,359
to back up our genetics now so we we

760
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,960
shouldn't be hearing about cannabis

761
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:05,038
strains going extinct we shouldn't be

762
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,880
hear about you know oh I can't I can't

763
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:09,119
get guava Tarts anymore because it's all

764
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,278
it's gone right every grower that's had

765
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:13,599
a heal C

766
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:17,640
fortunately till we [ __ ] stop can't

767
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:20,398
stop vomiting because it's exactly yeah

768
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:23,080
just hypothetical there is you know God

769
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:24,839
forbid you know God forbid especially

770
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:26,759
with some of the more medicinal strains

771
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:29,000
right the lower THC but more unique

772
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:30,720
canabo profiles that actually really

773
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,720
help people that are you know dealing

774
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,399
with a wide variety of health issues God

775
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:39,399
forbid one of those strains goes extinct

776
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:41,918
because uh a pesky vroid wiped it out

777
00:29:39,398 --> 00:29:44,079
yeah so what I'd like to you know tell

778
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,679
Growers and tell you specifically is

779
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:48,398
please please please even if you're not

780
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:50,759
going to invest in a lab open your mind

781
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:52,678
to tissue culture right yeah this is a

782
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:54,319
tool that you will be using in the next

783
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:58,399
five to 10 years it's not an if it's a

784
00:29:54,319 --> 00:30:00,759
when yeah and start practicing uh

785
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:03,918
because your genetics are your business

786
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:05,599
right if you're if you're an operator

787
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,320
that owns properties you have property

788
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:08,678
insurance you have flood insurance you

789
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:10,839
likely have fire insurance if you live

790
00:30:08,679 --> 00:30:12,278
in California yeah as a cannabis grower

791
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:13,519
you should have insurance for the number

792
00:30:12,278 --> 00:30:16,398
one product that you're selling which is

793
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:18,359
your PL which is your flowers right so

794
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:19,678
that's what tissue culture does is we're

795
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:21,439
backing up your genetics we're

796
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,278
protecting those genetics and and we're

797
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:28,120
keeping them contained so that when you

798
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:30,079
need them when when the disaster strikes

799
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:33,719
that's okay we have 50 backups ready to

800
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:35,079
go yeah um and then secondly I'd say the

801
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,960
main benefit of tissue culture for

802
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:39,278
Growers that aren is familiar is what if

803
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:42,278
you could shrink your mother room by

804
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:43,558
three fors I mean the whole concept of

805
00:30:42,278 --> 00:30:46,278
the mother room is going to become

806
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:49,558
extinct the idea of keeping these huge

807
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:52,240
trees alive attracts pests attracts bugs

808
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:53,918
takes up energy takes up space now

809
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,798
imagine if you know your mother room was

810
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:58,000
100 square feet instead of 12200 and

811
00:30:56,798 --> 00:30:59,879
imagine if you could have two more

812
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,398
bedrooms in there or you could dedicate

813
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:05,320
that space for a lab a mother room and

814
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:07,000
something else so Growers are obviously

815
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:08,839
dealing with a wide variety of issues

816
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,000
whether it's high taxation whether it's

817
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:13,839
you know High cap X labor costs this is

818
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,599
another mechanism where a tissue culture

819
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:17,638
can be a tool to actually reduce and

820
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:20,240
lower your costs in the long run by

821
00:31:17,638 --> 00:31:22,240
better optimizing the way that you grow

822
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:25,480
and optimizing the way that you use your

823
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:28,519
space to effectively produce plants that

824
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:30,839
flower um so yeah that's I I I could

825
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:33,759
talk about TC and its applications and

826
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:36,278
its its use cases all day I think it's

827
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:36,960
it's Paramount for tissue for cannabis

828
00:31:36,278 --> 00:31:40,240
to

829
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:42,038
survive um and yeah man we're we're just

830
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:45,120
excited this this media is g to be

831
00:31:42,038 --> 00:31:47,000
launched soon um we have all these new

832
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:50,119
products that Growers can use and

833
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:53,398
experiment with specifically with uh the

834
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:54,599
hemp cannabis space and um our classes

835
00:31:53,398 --> 00:31:56,439
of course you know we have classes

836
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:58,319
online we have classes in person we have

837
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:00,000
pre-recorded classes like there's

838
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:01,200
there's a million resources so I don't

839
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,638
want to hear somebody say there's

840
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,278
there's not enough information out there

841
00:32:02,638 --> 00:32:07,240
we have 800 videos for free on YouTube

842
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:09,519
on how to do this uh and that's just

843
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:12,960
scratching the surface so you know our

844
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:15,759
our dedication to the community is that

845
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,600
we we want this this skill this this

846
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:20,240
scientific practice to thrive in the

847
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:22,480
Canabis space because it's important

848
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,880
it's important for people it helps

849
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:27,399
people and uh this is just one way that

850
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,840
we can do it more efficiently yeah you

851
00:32:27,398 --> 00:32:32,278
know preaching the gospel no I mean a

852
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:34,839
lot of the moms in um the canidate space

853
00:32:32,278 --> 00:32:38,319
are kept in i' would say traditional

854
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:39,199
Market is as opposed to Legal Market um

855
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:41,759
or

856
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,120
or commercial Market I guess because the

857
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:46,359
commercial Market is would be the legal

858
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:49,199
market now yeah um they're kept in more

859
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:51,398
shoddy like homes and stuff like a lot

860
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,519
of the really old rare stuff by people

861
00:32:51,398 --> 00:32:55,479
who don't trust anyone so it's really

862
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,278
nice to see you know you guys coming out

863
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:59,839
putting all the stuff out there uh

864
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:03,398
showing can be used but yeah it'll be

865
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:06,439
interesting to see that that that space

866
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:07,918
adapt start installing Lamer Flo hoods

867
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,440
and and houses that are blowing up I

868
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,240
think it's important I think it's

869
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,639
awesome but it's it's going to be the

870
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,440
turning point because the commercial

871
00:33:12,638 --> 00:33:16,759
Market doesn't have access to most of

872
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:20,200
what needs to be saved in the first

873
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:21,679
place yeah yeah second inning man second

874
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:25,000
inning we're that that's what's so

875
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:26,519
exciting about this is we we haven't

876
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,679
even scratched the surface of what we

877
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:31,200
can do with this technology I mean soon

878
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,759
we we already have this the the

879
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,759
technology to extract secondary

880
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:38,960
metabolites so imagine growing THC or

881
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:41,558
CBD or turpins just on in gel without

882
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,360
the actual plant right extracting

883
00:33:41,558 --> 00:33:45,119
extracting those chemicals directly

884
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:47,278
right so there we're we're gonna

885
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:49,278
continue to develop more efficient

886
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:51,119
mechanisms that's not to say we're GNA

887
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:54,839
make growing flower Obsolete and growing

888
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:57,319
plants obsolete absolutely not but as

889
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:59,558
the industry develops and as hopefully

890
00:33:57,319 --> 00:34:03,439
research opens up on the medicinal side

891
00:33:59,558 --> 00:34:05,240
we'll be able to better identify canono

892
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,200
profiles and Turpin that actually help

893
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:11,280
people and then grow those specific

894
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:12,918
profiles yeah without you know it's huge

895
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,159
being able to reproduce something

896
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:17,679
exactly without worrying about the

897
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:19,599
environment like that would be a massive

898
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:22,240
step in reproduction and medical

899
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:24,399
qualities of everything I think so and

900
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:27,000
think about it if you're taking an Advil

901
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:28,559
if I'm if I'm taking uh you know Advil I

902
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,719
want 10 milligram every time I don't

903
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:35,119
want 10 9.7 and 8.9 it's not a medicine

904
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:38,000
at that point you're just guessing so

905
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:40,480
this this tissue culture specifically is

906
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,320
is one of the I'd say most important

907
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,760
steps that will marry the industry as a

908
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,679
transitions from you know Black Market

909
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,320
gray Market to fully white Market

910
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,878
corporatized commercialized at a large

911
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,960
scale and it's happening it's it's you

912
00:34:51,878 --> 00:34:54,878
know you're seeing your largest

913
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,720
producers your segas you have conception

914
00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:58,559
and node Labs I mean you have a lot of

915
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:00,279
companies in the space

916
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:02,039
however and we were talking about this a

917
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:04,280
little earlier backstage but there are

918
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:06,279
also a lot of people that love the word

919
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:08,079
tissue culture and they oh yeah use that

920
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:10,040
buzzword to claim what they're doing is

921
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:12,519
tissue culture when in reality it might

922
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:13,679
not be tissue culture it might be

923
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:15,079
something else that they're calling

924
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:16,519
tissue culture or they might just be

925
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:19,119
doing tissue culture incorrectly and

926
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:22,358
charging somebody a arm and a leg for it

927
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,800
so what I tell people is be weary right

928
00:35:22,358 --> 00:35:25,400
do your due diligence who are these

929
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,079
companies that are popping out of

930
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,559
nowhere that are claiming to you know

931
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:30,440
have the prot calls and the knowledge

932
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:32,320
and the skills to do it it's very likely

933
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:34,760
that they do have them right but at the

934
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,599
same time any industry that starts to

935
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,000
blow up or or starts to get popular

936
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:39,720
attracts people that like to take

937
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,960
advantage of others especially one with

938
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:44,838
the gray Market where that you can't get

939
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:46,440
so easily yeah noticed so you know you

940
00:35:44,838 --> 00:35:48,078
don't have to work with us I just want

941
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,519
you to you know your hard-earned money

942
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,839
should go to somebody that can actually

943
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:53,599
help you and not somebody that's gonna

944
00:35:50,838 --> 00:35:54,880
use a buzzword uh claim to claim to do

945
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,240
it charge you and then you know you're

946
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:59,400
left with a plant that's still infected

947
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:03,239
dead

948
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:04,960
or you know or Worse yeah seed companies

949
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:07,279
are is the same thing it's it's the same

950
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,119
Cesspool of uh of people there's

951
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,280
breeders and then there's seed makers in

952
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,838
my in my mind there's people that breed

953
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,599
and then there's people that can make

954
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:17,400
seeds which is everyone that has a male

955
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:20,280
and a female and trying to for people

956
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:22,800
coming in trying to guess who is who is

957
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:25,280
the is the worst game ever and like

958
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:28,599
marketing doesn't quite relay who is

959
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:31,079
what and does what yeah tissue for me

960
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:32,960
for me going from seed to tissue culture

961
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:35,440
and trying to navigate that sphere it's

962
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:38,240
a completely still like foreign sphere

963
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:41,800
to me even though I should be massively

964
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:43,679
invested in it it's been so tenuous and

965
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,920
yeah I mean we we'll send you some stuff

966
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:48,279
you can play around I mean happily do it

967
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:51,079
yeah yeah you don't you don't need a a

968
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,720
500 square foot lab to do this I need a

969
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:55,400
laminer Flowood because every time I've

970
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:57,239
tried it I've massively failed massively

971
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,838
but it's it's been because of small

972
00:36:57,239 --> 00:37:01,559
little and you

973
00:36:58,838 --> 00:37:03,318
know infections whatever it's infections

974
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:05,599
or or contaminant so no we'll get you

975
00:37:03,318 --> 00:37:07,960
some PPM we'll get you some test tubes

976
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,880
and then hopefully depending on how good

977
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,440
the instructions were in that video you

978
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:13,000
can start practicing on some seeds I

979
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,159
mean I I'd recommend some seeds that

980
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,639
aren't valuable to you first just so you

981
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:19,078
the protocol but you know getting the

982
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:20,719
getting the skills of grabbing the

983
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:22,280
scalpel putting the seed in without

984
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:24,639
touching the surfaces you know being

985
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:27,640
careful with your hands it's it's the

986
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:30,000
first step man and imagine just pH

987
00:37:27,639 --> 00:37:32,838
hunting in this way you can just put

988
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,000
them on a shelf and you can have 10,000

989
00:37:32,838 --> 00:37:37,759
of these little guys that take up you

990
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,400
know maybe a library shelf instead of a

991
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:43,200
whole farm right your your your space

992
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:46,800
efficiency is increased by a magnitude

993
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:49,679
of 10 to 15 times so you know you can

994
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,480
really store them keep them safe and

995
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:53,239
secure in these test tubes eventually

996
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,639
you know there is there is some

997
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:55,759
maintenance with this right so you're

998
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:58,000
not just going to put this at a test

999
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,680
tube it'll eventually outgrow to test

1000
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,639
oh yeah yeah you know that that's what

1001
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:03,639
you want that'll grow fast that looks

1002
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:05,559
like it'll grow fast it'll grow fast so

1003
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:07,159
there is a there is a maintenance uh

1004
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:08,639
maintenance involved with this and

1005
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:10,399
whether it's every two to three four

1006
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:12,879
weeks you're G to change that plant to

1007
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,880
New Media uh but that plant itself can

1008
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,000
survive in that media for you

1009
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,440
exstensively

1010
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,838
forever um no scientific report will

1011
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:24,679
ever say forever 100% with anything but

1012
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:28,679
a long time probably outlive you and

1013
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:30,639
me right and you we're I like to think

1014
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:32,879
of ourselves as conservationists right

1015
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:34,480
we're we're caretakers for these plants

1016
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:37,200
for these genetics that hopefully

1017
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:41,039
Generations will experience will consume

1018
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:43,960
we'll uh will get to take care of or or

1019
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:45,159
be exposed to so yeah I mean it all

1020
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,838
comes back to tissue culture is

1021
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:49,039
necessary I've said it a million times I

1022
00:38:46,838 --> 00:38:51,639
feel bad but you guys are just you you

1023
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:54,039
need it it's

1024
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:55,759
very you know like one of the few things

1025
00:38:54,039 --> 00:38:57,119
that I've seen and and I'd like to ask

1026
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,400
you how you would mitigate something

1027
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:03,440
like this early on when tis culture

1028
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:05,400
became like a buzzword uh maybe 10 years

1029
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,838
ago like in cannabis when people really

1030
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:10,400
started pushing it hard they were um

1031
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:12,480
selling Whole nurseries were selling

1032
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,880
like tissue culture and saying like yes

1033
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,679
we we'll we'll give you a thousand

1034
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:17,440
plants you can run them right now start

1035
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:19,719
it and then they'd run them and

1036
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:22,119
everything would have interex issues

1037
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:24,239
right away or or some kind of hormonal

1038
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:26,920
issues coming out of just tissue culture

1039
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:29,000
running the plantlets straight in um how

1040
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:31,039
do you m stuff like that how do you

1041
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,960
mitigate that from happening that's a

1042
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:37,759
great question so first and foremost

1043
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:40,358
testing right at its at its finest we're

1044
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,520
using the same testing devices that they

1045
00:39:40,358 --> 00:39:44,559
use to test for covid yeah that we're

1046
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:47,559
using to test for hops L vroid

1047
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:50,239
thermocyclers PCR machines uh

1048
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:53,039
fortunately as the the need for these

1049
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:56,000
devices has increased the price has gone

1050
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:57,920
down so Supply demand you know it might

1051
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,679
it might have cost you 10 15,00

1052
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:04,720
to get access to a a proper PCR machine

1053
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:07,039
that could run for hops slate and bywood

1054
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:09,879
um now you might be able to get one for

1055
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:13,119
cheaper maybe not 15,000 maybe five six

1056
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:15,358
7,000 but yeah I think when tissue

1057
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:18,160
culture first started becoming a

1058
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:20,759
buzzword people well I can't speak for

1059
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:23,239
everyone but a small percentage of that

1060
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:25,560
industry use that buzzword to sell and

1061
00:40:23,239 --> 00:40:27,318
make quick money as we know this

1062
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:29,519
industry is actually a lot smaller than

1063
00:40:27,318 --> 00:40:32,679
people give it credit for and you know

1064
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:34,679
your reputation is everything so uh

1065
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:37,799
hurting people and and taking advantage

1066
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:41,480
of them is is an easy way to go bankrupt

1067
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:43,800
quick as a business um so testing

1068
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:46,199
products I I would say is is the easiest

1069
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,960
way to avoid any of these issues right

1070
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:50,919
you can do gender screening and gender

1071
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:53,079
testing uh mini PCR is a great company I

1072
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:55,280
think their device is like $1,500

1073
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:58,039
there's only six Wells so yeah it'll

1074
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:00,319
take you a little while but you can you

1075
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:02,239
can run gender screening on that device

1076
00:41:00,318 --> 00:41:05,159
um for hops late and vroid there's some

1077
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:06,559
great companies Tumi genomics has a

1078
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:10,519
you've interviewed Tumi they're great

1079
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:11,759
yeah Tumi has a great device um that's

1080
00:41:10,519 --> 00:41:12,920
it's awesome yeah you can test for hops

1081
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,560
slate and vroid I'd say the only

1082
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,400
challenge with the device as of now is

1083
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:19,719
it doesn't tell you viral load it'll

1084
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:21,960
just tell you positive or negative so

1085
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:23,719
major factor yeah it can be especially

1086
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:26,039
if you're you're trying to determine how

1087
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:28,318
bad the plan is affected how many how

1088
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:31,159
many remediation Cycles do we need to go

1089
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:32,960
through that's a good thing to know but

1090
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:34,719
again again Tumi also has a lab you can

1091
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,838
send them plants directly and they can

1092
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:40,838
run tests in lab AGD is another great

1093
00:41:36,838 --> 00:41:42,639
one they have their device I think I

1094
00:41:40,838 --> 00:41:44,159
don't think it also tells viral load but

1095
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:46,679
it will tell you a positive or negative

1096
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:48,838
I have to confirm so don't hold me to it

1097
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:50,078
sorry AGD if I got that wrong uh but

1098
00:41:48,838 --> 00:41:51,519
they're great you know they lent us a

1099
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:53,599
device that we were using for our master

1100
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:55,400
classes for a good year actually and

1101
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:58,519
that thing was probably 10

1102
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:00,039
12,000 we ran a number of hops slate and

1103
00:41:58,519 --> 00:42:02,559
viroid tests fortunately none of the

1104
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:04,159
cuting and plants we brought in had it

1105
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:06,599
uh fortunately or unfortunately because

1106
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:09,480
I think it's also good to experiment

1107
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:12,200
with it but we also just popsa and vroid

1108
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:14,079
is a vroid that can transfer not only

1109
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:16,559
from Cannabis to to other crops so we

1110
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:19,000
gotta be careful um especially in our

1111
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:21,799
lab but yeah we we luckily didn't bring

1112
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,920
anything home so the simple answer to

1113
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,359
your question is making sure you're

1114
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,920
checking all the boxes right they're

1115
00:42:25,358 --> 00:42:27,639
doing tissue culture okay what does that

1116
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,920
mean

1117
00:42:27,639 --> 00:42:32,358
are they doing not culture are they

1118
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,760
rooting in vitro or X vitro so in the

1119
00:42:32,358 --> 00:42:36,358
test tube or out of the test tube what's

1120
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,920
What stages are they running through in

1121
00:42:36,358 --> 00:42:39,440
tissue culture versus out of tissue

1122
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,358
culture are they actually running

1123
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:43,679
testing or are they just taking plants

1124
00:42:42,358 --> 00:42:46,119
putting in tissue culture and hoping for

1125
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:48,639
the best I think a lot of people are

1126
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:51,480
doing the ladder

1127
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:53,558
because because test cost money and yeah

1128
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:57,240
test cost money it's like $40 $50 a test

1129
00:42:53,559 --> 00:43:00,240
it's not cheap yeah however

1130
00:42:57,239 --> 00:43:01,759
as a commercial business if that is your

1131
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:03,039
if if that's your business if that's

1132
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,160
your welfare I highly recommend

1133
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:07,239
investing in those tests I recommend

1134
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:08,920
absolutely allocating part of your

1135
00:43:07,239 --> 00:43:11,039
budget towards the due diligence

1136
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:13,760
required to keep your actual product

1137
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:16,239
clean yeah and uh that's the missing

1138
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,160
link so the testing companies combining

1139
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:22,479
with the tissue culture knowledge gives

1140
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:25,239
us that full 360 perspective of are my

1141
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:28,199
plants male or female what are the tpine

1142
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:29,558
profiles THC profiles everything else

1143
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:31,000
when it comes to testing for heavy

1144
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:33,880
metals testing for preservatives and

1145
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,679
then also does this plant have hops does

1146
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:38,800
this plant have ferium does this plant

1147
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:41,480
have any of the other pathogens viroids

1148
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,280
and viruses that plague this industry

1149
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:46,000
and so we have the knowledge we have the

1150
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:49,040
machinery and the skills to do it it's

1151
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:52,159
just about I guess helping people and

1152
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:54,800
teaching them so in our class we we do

1153
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:57,598
spend at least half a day to a day on

1154
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:59,760
testing because testing is not easy

1155
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:02,119
um it's not as simple as you know

1156
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:04,359
putting a plant in a test tube and you

1157
00:44:02,119 --> 00:44:06,160
know there there are steps and it's it's

1158
00:44:04,358 --> 00:44:08,318
kind of like cooking but I'd say it's

1159
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:09,920
more like baking where you got to use

1160
00:44:08,318 --> 00:44:11,679
the exact amount of flour and you got to

1161
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:14,440
use the exact amount of eggs otherwise

1162
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:16,879
it's gonna overcook or undercook so same

1163
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:19,880
goes with using a qpcr machine using a

1164
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,519
thermocycler using some of those devices

1165
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,880
uh but with anything practice makes

1166
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:26,838
perfect and so the education the

1167
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:27,720
opportunity to learn it's all there um

1168
00:44:26,838 --> 00:44:29,799
but

1169
00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:31,480
I think as a grower as a breeder as

1170
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:33,240
somebody that's working in the

1171
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:35,280
commercial side of the space you have to

1172
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:36,879
make that decision right from a budget

1173
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,040
standpoint does it make more sense to do

1174
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,880
this in house does it make more sense to

1175
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:42,800
send it out and and send it out to Labs

1176
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:46,039
that do testing uh that really comes

1177
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:48,079
down to your budget your patience your

1178
00:44:46,039 --> 00:44:49,880
um commitment to investing in the

1179
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:51,920
equipment and the protocols and the

1180
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:53,318
people right the labor to be able to do

1181
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,318
it that's that's just a whole another

1182
00:44:53,318 --> 00:44:57,599
component right everybody you hire in

1183
00:44:55,318 --> 00:45:00,199
the in the facility likely already has a

1184
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:02,318
job so who who's going to take over uh

1185
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:03,558
for who's going to do testing so that's

1186
00:45:02,318 --> 00:45:06,079
that's a that's a question that really

1187
00:45:03,559 --> 00:45:08,720
comes down to your business plan your

1188
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:10,559
needs and your budget um so something I

1189
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:14,879
I do recommend Growers take seriously

1190
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:16,400
and and consider but um still it's it's

1191
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,720
very important because again tissue

1192
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,760
culture needs to be coupled with the

1193
00:45:17,719 --> 00:45:22,439
testing otherwise you're really kind of

1194
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:24,319
shooting in the dark here yeah yeah that

1195
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,358
makes sense I mean it's that way with

1196
00:45:24,318 --> 00:45:29,400
breeding

1197
00:45:25,358 --> 00:45:31,639
even I believe it yeah uh if you don't

1198
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:33,440
if you don't eventually test in some way

1199
00:45:31,639 --> 00:45:35,358
have someone even even if it's down to

1200
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,559
having someone smoke it and having a

1201
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:38,880
group of people smoking it you're not

1202
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:41,319
getting any kind of feedback and it's

1203
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:44,280
all shooting in the dark I mean yeah or

1204
00:45:41,318 --> 00:45:45,838
or you're just losing time right yes yes

1205
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:49,000
and if you're doing real breeding it's

1206
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:52,000
time and time is money time is money

1207
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,880
time is money and it's all we have

1208
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,159
exactly something you don't get back so

1209
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:57,680
if we can cut that cycle in half right

1210
00:45:56,159 --> 00:45:59,358
you don't have to grow it out to a

1211
00:45:57,679 --> 00:46:00,919
certain point or you already know what

1212
00:45:59,358 --> 00:46:03,400
the problem is and you can mitigate that

1213
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:06,000
problem that saves you money a lot of

1214
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:07,639
money um especially in the long run I

1215
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,800
think people are thinking very short

1216
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:11,519
term when it comes to these businesses

1217
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:14,318
and I get it right cannabis is

1218
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:16,358
incredibly competitive very Cutthroat

1219
00:46:14,318 --> 00:46:17,920
very hard to succeed I think people

1220
00:46:16,358 --> 00:46:20,078
outside the industry think it's like

1221
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:24,079
this you know everybody's making cash

1222
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:26,440
hand overhand notm no the margins are

1223
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:28,280
tight I know I get it I've spoken to

1224
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:30,480
hundreds of Growers and I I empathize

1225
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:33,480
with you guys guys and girls it's it's

1226
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:35,838
it's hard and We Know It And so we're

1227
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:37,800
just trying to find ways through the

1228
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:41,000
technology that we're you know applying

1229
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:42,680
to every other plant species alive how

1230
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,480
can we also use this or cannabis how can

1231
00:46:42,679 --> 00:46:45,838
we also optimize this process and give

1232
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,679
you more time back or give you more

1233
00:46:45,838 --> 00:46:50,719
space back or you know save a little bit

1234
00:46:48,679 --> 00:46:53,118
of room in your budget

1235
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:55,598
for you know keeping your genetics alive

1236
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:58,160
for another couple years or yeah forever

1237
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:00,280
right um

1238
00:46:58,159 --> 00:47:02,519
yeah it's it's it is funny how it really

1239
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:04,000
started with orchids though yeah it

1240
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:05,960
doesn't surprise me like I I used to

1241
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,519
collect orchids quite a bit yeah it's

1242
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:09,318
like a three billion dollar industry

1243
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:11,519
it's huge yeah I just thought they were

1244
00:47:09,318 --> 00:47:13,159
beautiful and as I was learning I was

1245
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:14,599
like well you know what's a kiki what's

1246
00:47:13,159 --> 00:47:17,000
that you know and then starting to learn

1247
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:19,119
how people how people you know you can't

1248
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,239
just pop seeds of orchids it's not like

1249
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:22,720
cannabis and yeah it blew my mind that

1250
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:25,279
you just couldn't go pop seeds of this

1251
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:26,639
stuff why can't I just go get seeds yeah

1252
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,359
they're dust the seeds are literally

1253
00:47:26,639 --> 00:47:29,558
dust

1254
00:47:27,358 --> 00:47:31,078
and you have to spread them out in Jael

1255
00:47:29,559 --> 00:47:33,839
media for them to actually start to

1256
00:47:31,079 --> 00:47:35,880
germinate but um what's cool about the

1257
00:47:33,838 --> 00:47:39,719
Cannabis space is I I

1258
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:42,000
think because of the passion and love

1259
00:47:39,719 --> 00:47:45,838
and variety that exists and just

1260
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:48,719
biodiversity within the Cannabis plan

1261
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:50,358
itself this is I mean this this could be

1262
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:52,799
one of the best mechanisms of getting

1263
00:47:50,358 --> 00:47:54,358
people into genetics right oh human

1264
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,200
genetics can benefit from this

1265
00:47:54,358 --> 00:47:58,199
inevitably if we train hundreds of

1266
00:47:56,199 --> 00:48:00,439
thousands of tech technicians that know

1267
00:47:58,199 --> 00:48:02,838
how to isolate a merem that know how to

1268
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:04,440
work with cell culture whether you know

1269
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:06,159
working with certain hormones whether

1270
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:08,519
you're telling a plant to to produce

1271
00:48:06,159 --> 00:48:09,879
chotes or roots or callus I mean all

1272
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:12,559
these skills will eventually be

1273
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:15,000
translated or translatable into animal

1274
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:16,280
culture into cell culture into human

1275
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,400
cell culture

1276
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:20,440
so you know we're just we're just

1277
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,680
scratching the surface with plants and

1278
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:25,000
the beauty is cannabis is a mechanism

1279
00:48:22,679 --> 00:48:26,879
for this industry to grow because people

1280
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,838
love that plant more than anything else

1281
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:31,318
can imagine I mean orchids are probably

1282
00:48:28,838 --> 00:48:33,920
the second most popular or second or

1283
00:48:31,318 --> 00:48:36,960
first most popular you know maybe

1284
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:38,880
irrational love um even though they're

1285
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,960
incredible plants I love orchids nothing

1286
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:43,039
against orchids but because of the

1287
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,679
biodiversity and the genetic you know

1288
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:47,239
the uniqueness of genetics with cannabis

1289
00:48:45,679 --> 00:48:49,639
people are going to be diving into this

1290
00:48:47,239 --> 00:48:52,039
and I think this industry and this this

1291
00:48:49,639 --> 00:48:54,679
science is only going to grow from here

1292
00:48:52,039 --> 00:48:56,039
I think so yeah it's similar I like to

1293
00:48:54,679 --> 00:48:58,279
say it's how the adult entertainment

1294
00:48:56,039 --> 00:49:01,199
industry develop the internet right

1295
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:05,440
really started off with you know webcam

1296
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:07,399
girls and chats and and really footage

1297
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:09,599
but that you know created this explosion

1298
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:11,480
with programmers and people that were so

1299
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:14,440
interested in this space so you know

1300
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:17,000
sometimes devices lead us into uh the

1301
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:20,039
bigger picture but

1302
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:23,599
um you know it's there's a there's a

1303
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:25,679
long way to go uh there's still a lot of

1304
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:28,880
applications that we need to find out

1305
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:30,679
and Growers need to take the time to

1306
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,318
figure out how it works for them right

1307
00:49:30,679 --> 00:49:33,719
I'm not going to tell you that tissue

1308
00:49:32,318 --> 00:49:35,358
culture can replace the way that you

1309
00:49:33,719 --> 00:49:37,759
grow today it's not gonna replace the

1310
00:49:35,358 --> 00:49:39,078
way you grow today we're not trying to

1311
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,280
get rid of

1312
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:42,280
your um I mean we are trying to get rid

1313
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,839
of your mother room but we're not we're

1314
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:46,040
not trying to get rid of everything

1315
00:49:43,838 --> 00:49:48,078
right what we're trying to do is say hey

1316
00:49:46,039 --> 00:49:48,960
here's a new tool that you can use yeah

1317
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:51,000
right you've been trying to use a

1318
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,760
screwdriver but it's not exact it's not

1319
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,400
you know the grooves aren't aligning

1320
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:58,040
quite right so this this is a a new tool

1321
00:49:55,400 --> 00:50:02,599
that you can add that can help you with

1322
00:49:58,039 --> 00:50:04,400
XYZ um and yeah it's it's all it's all

1323
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:07,318
part of the process and I have a

1324
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:09,240
question for you is is is pheno hunting

1325
00:50:07,318 --> 00:50:11,798
like as a as somebody that's into seeds

1326
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:14,558
and breeding is is pheno hunting

1327
00:50:11,798 --> 00:50:15,960
expensive it right to do it right to do

1328
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:19,079
it correctly I mean when you're talking

1329
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:21,400
about feno hunting like is it are you

1330
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:22,680
going and getting something from another

1331
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,880
country and are you trying to have it

1332
00:50:22,679 --> 00:50:26,919
express the same way it Expresses in

1333
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:28,720
that country at that point it's it's

1334
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:31,039
it's a crapshoot like trying to get it

1335
00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:33,039
done and to do it very expensive popping

1336
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:35,759
thousands trying to replicate the soil

1337
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:38,440
density paracity what's what's what's

1338
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:40,400
its makeup is you know um but when it

1339
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:43,679
comes down to like let's say I want to

1340
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:45,240
select blueberry from something um it's

1341
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:48,118
a lot easier because there's so much

1342
00:50:45,239 --> 00:50:49,679
work that's been laid out before it just

1343
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:52,079
having enough experience to know what

1344
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:54,838
direction and why but feno hunting is is

1345
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:56,880
everything if you're a breeder um seed

1346
00:50:54,838 --> 00:50:58,798
make if you're just a seed maker I'd say

1347
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,160
it's more of a

1348
00:50:58,798 --> 00:51:03,358
marketing thing like hey you can get all

1349
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:04,719
these fenos from this plant when ideally

1350
00:51:03,358 --> 00:51:07,279
when you're breeding you don't want to

1351
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:10,000
have a bunch of Expressions a wide swap

1352
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:12,359
of Expressions you would more likely

1353
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,798
want a minimal amount of Expressions so

1354
00:51:12,358 --> 00:51:19,000
people can get a proven plant from a set

1355
00:51:15,798 --> 00:51:20,759
of seeds ideally and and for for you or

1356
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,440
for some Growers obviously you know I'm

1357
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:24,839
sure the timeline varies but what what

1358
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:27,838
would you say is the average time from a

1359
00:51:24,838 --> 00:51:29,358
grower to feno hunt find traits and

1360
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:32,838
expressions that they like and then

1361
00:51:29,358 --> 00:51:35,679
actually produce that plant at scale

1362
00:51:32,838 --> 00:51:38,119
three years I'd say would years three

1363
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:40,639
years yeah to do it correctly to to pop

1364
00:51:38,119 --> 00:51:42,358
seeds do proper feno hunts run it once

1365
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:44,558
run it twice run it three times to make

1366
00:51:42,358 --> 00:51:45,920
sure that it's going to be replicating

1367
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:48,280
the same Expressions you saw the first

1368
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,639
time and then yeah then if you want to

1369
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:51,920
take it and breed it I would say like

1370
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:55,000
you would feminize the seed to to speed

1371
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:57,798
up the process selfit and go from there

1372
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,880
maybe self it a few times yeah in that

1373
00:51:57,798 --> 00:52:01,679
case it would be seven eight years I

1374
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:05,039
would hate to lose three to 10 years

1375
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:07,039
worth of work yeah because some some

1376
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:08,079
technician brought in a bug and killed

1377
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:11,358
my my

1378
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:15,000
plants that's just it's insane yeah to

1379
00:52:11,358 --> 00:52:16,920
think and yeah I mean people that do

1380
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:19,039
spend the time and have the skills to do

1381
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:20,159
that I mean I can imagine you get tired

1382
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:21,960
after you lose a certain amount of

1383
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:24,480
genetics and so we we need these guys to

1384
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:26,358
keep going uh guys and girls you know

1385
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,519
whoever however they identify to keep

1386
00:52:26,358 --> 00:52:30,480
going going because yeah no it's a lot

1387
00:52:28,519 --> 00:52:32,519
of work it's time intensive and so use

1388
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:35,838
tissue cure please back up your genetics

1389
00:52:32,519 --> 00:52:39,000
please please you know help us help us

1390
00:52:35,838 --> 00:52:41,318
help you I've lost whole collections at

1391
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,639
certain points and then eventually like

1392
00:52:41,318 --> 00:52:45,759
three years ago I was like [ __ ] this no

1393
00:52:43,639 --> 00:52:47,239
more mom room nothing gave all of my

1394
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:49,160
moms to everyone else and just started

1395
00:52:47,239 --> 00:52:51,759
working on my stuff from seed but now

1396
00:52:49,159 --> 00:52:53,118
that I'm getting back to um because I I

1397
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:56,200
I literally stuck my head in the

1398
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:57,640
blueberry genetics and until I have was

1399
00:52:56,199 --> 00:53:00,879
prod proding a perfect blueberry

1400
00:52:57,639 --> 00:53:02,358
smelling tasting plant reliably ined but

1401
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:05,000
now I've got like oh man I need to go

1402
00:53:02,358 --> 00:53:06,759
get my mom's again [ __ ] yeah you know

1403
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,639
and now I'm I'm like man do I really

1404
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:13,040
want to like 18 years of a mom room

1405
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:16,078
sucks like running a big math I mean we

1406
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:19,480
were we were running between 100 I don't

1407
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:22,079
know at some points 180 moms to down to

1408
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:24,440
30 to 40 but when people don't realize

1409
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:26,559
like that's a lot of of moms you're

1410
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:28,119
constantly cycling clone cycling clone

1411
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:29,920
we weren't doing tissue culture so

1412
00:53:28,119 --> 00:53:31,640
you've got seven or eight clones of one

1413
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:33,480
thing just to hope you don't miss you

1414
00:53:31,639 --> 00:53:36,279
know and and there's only a few of us

1415
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:38,318
still doing that in the world and

1416
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:39,599
they're not in major corporations they

1417
00:53:38,318 --> 00:53:41,920
don't even interact with them because

1418
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:45,318
they won't you know and and what what

1419
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:46,480
part of our job like I feel like or or

1420
00:53:45,318 --> 00:53:48,719
what we're doing with the breeder

1421
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:51,280
Syndicate is trying to in trying to

1422
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:53,279
break the the mold between what's going

1423
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:55,280
on with the legal Market what's going on

1424
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:58,640
with the traditional Market which is

1425
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:01,240
where we're at and talking to people in

1426
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:02,598
Academia and in science and trying to

1427
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:04,598
link all those because like a lot of

1428
00:54:02,599 --> 00:54:06,359
people in Academia don't understand that

1429
00:54:04,599 --> 00:54:08,680
there's only a few historians in

1430
00:54:06,358 --> 00:54:10,279
cannabis that understand how everything

1431
00:54:08,679 --> 00:54:12,838
came to be and could put that together

1432
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:14,519
because it's a really closed circuit of

1433
00:54:12,838 --> 00:54:16,078
people and everybody really deeply knows

1434
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:18,079
each other and then getting those people

1435
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:20,000
to talk to those people and linking it

1436
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:23,000
all around so nobody ends up getting

1437
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:25,679
screwed by the marketers in between it's

1438
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,880
hard inevitably yeah yeah like I said I

1439
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:30,159
still got screwed it going to the the

1440
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:32,160
tissue culture market like and I thought

1441
00:54:30,159 --> 00:54:34,199
I I thought I thought I could be totally

1442
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:36,759
competent I know cannabis blah blah blah

1443
00:54:34,199 --> 00:54:38,679
and still got worked so you know it's

1444
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:41,280
it's it's slightly different and and you

1445
00:54:38,679 --> 00:54:42,759
know cannabis expresses itself a little

1446
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,519
differently and in tissue culture you're

1447
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:46,520
you're inducing stress this plant is

1448
00:54:44,519 --> 00:54:49,318
under stress this is not its normal

1449
00:54:46,519 --> 00:54:51,199
growth environment right so it will have

1450
00:54:49,318 --> 00:54:53,599
interesting Expressions right if you use

1451
00:54:51,199 --> 00:54:55,639
too many hormones it won't grow well

1452
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:57,079
yeah there is a right and wrong way of

1453
00:54:55,639 --> 00:54:58,879
doing it and

1454
00:54:57,079 --> 00:55:01,240
um with people what I like to say is

1455
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:03,559
just start basic don't don't play around

1456
00:55:01,239 --> 00:55:06,439
too much with hormones and this and that

1457
00:55:03,559 --> 00:55:08,839
just just be simple try it at its

1458
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:11,400
simplest and uh we we do have like some

1459
00:55:08,838 --> 00:55:13,358
base protocols to use but um really

1460
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:15,798
start there uh and then eventually you

1461
00:55:13,358 --> 00:55:17,199
can run your R&amp;D and of course strains

1462
00:55:15,798 --> 00:55:19,119
will respond differently that's the

1463
00:55:17,199 --> 00:55:21,519
that's the craziest part is the genetic

1464
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:23,358
diversity will cause you know whether

1465
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:25,318
it's due to the Turpin or the THC or the

1466
00:55:23,358 --> 00:55:27,759
CBD or you know a variety of other

1467
00:55:25,318 --> 00:55:29,358
factors one plant might not grow as well

1468
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,839
in the same media as another plant

1469
00:55:29,358 --> 00:55:33,119
absolutely so this is this is why we're

1470
00:55:30,838 --> 00:55:36,159
still very much in that development

1471
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:38,400
phase in figuring out how Growers can

1472
00:55:36,159 --> 00:55:40,920
commercialize this and with our formula

1473
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:43,119
we've seen I mean the formula works for

1474
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:45,000
I don't know maybe 90 95% of strains but

1475
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:46,640
there are some outliers right and that's

1476
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,440
that's where continued R&amp;D comes in so

1477
00:55:46,639 --> 00:55:50,598
we're never we're never done researching

1478
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:52,599
we're never fully satisfied with our

1479
00:55:50,599 --> 00:55:54,240
products maybe PPM is the one product

1480
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:57,200
that we really can't improve because it

1481
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:59,479
it it works um but with Medias and

1482
00:55:57,199 --> 00:56:02,639
protocol there's always going to be new

1483
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:04,318
things to improve on and so I know we're

1484
00:56:02,639 --> 00:56:06,239
we're coming close on the hour here but

1485
00:56:04,318 --> 00:56:08,358
one thing I wanted to mention that we

1486
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:10,239
didn't talk about briefly is synthetic

1487
00:56:08,358 --> 00:56:12,719
seeds yeah are you familiar with

1488
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:16,279
synthetic seeds oh yeah yeah um Dutch

1489
00:56:12,719 --> 00:56:19,838
Passion uh uh one of the uh Dutch

1490
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:22,240
companies I think 15 years ago did a

1491
00:56:19,838 --> 00:56:23,759
small release of them and realized that

1492
00:56:22,239 --> 00:56:25,919
most people didn't know what to do with

1493
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:28,280
them once they got them but it was a

1494
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,920
great it was cool to see it but yeah

1495
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:32,119
that's it that was the first time I'd

1496
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,880
seen it brought to the Cannabis Market

1497
00:56:32,119 --> 00:56:36,280
on any scale and it was small it was

1498
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:38,400
small scale that that's where the biocup

1499
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:41,880
comes in so we found that there's really

1500
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:43,920
two ways of germinating synthetic seeds

1501
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:45,519
one is temporary immersion which is very

1502
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:47,200
effective and then the second is

1503
00:56:45,519 --> 00:56:50,000
actually breaking that you know seed

1504
00:56:47,199 --> 00:56:53,000
coat like the the little gel coat and

1505
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:56,079
placing that plant in media in Rich

1506
00:56:53,000 --> 00:57:00,519
culture media um but the implications of

1507
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:01,839
this this are huge because not only are

1508
00:57:00,519 --> 00:57:04,400
transporting

1509
00:57:01,838 --> 00:57:08,558
plants problematic because they die or

1510
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:10,798
they get contaminated but um now you can

1511
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:13,640
get you can probably fit two

1512
00:57:10,798 --> 00:57:15,280
300 little plantlets we call them

1513
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:18,558
synthetic seeds but they're actually

1514
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:20,200
just they're they're little nodes from

1515
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:22,760
the plant that'll eventually grow to be

1516
00:57:20,199 --> 00:57:24,000
big um you can fit two 300 in one test

1517
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:25,839
tube and you can travel with it

1518
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:29,159
everywhere I mean because they're not

1519
00:57:25,838 --> 00:57:31,199
seeds amazing encapsulated little

1520
00:57:29,159 --> 00:57:33,519
tapioca balls if you know if you look at

1521
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:35,078
it but how does that work legally like

1522
00:57:33,519 --> 00:57:37,960
since they aren't quite seeds and they

1523
00:57:35,079 --> 00:57:39,359
aren't quite well I plead the fifth yeah

1524
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:43,838
I like it's one of those things like I

1525
00:57:39,358 --> 00:57:45,719
just don't know that yeah I don't yeah I

1526
00:57:43,838 --> 00:57:47,880
don't I won't speak on the legal

1527
00:57:45,719 --> 00:57:49,719
implication not a lawyer and I won't

1528
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:53,000
recommend one thing or another because

1529
00:57:49,719 --> 00:57:54,558
again not a lawyer uh we just we just we

1530
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,760
just know the technology and how it's

1531
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:59,280
used for different plants different

1532
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:02,760
flowers spicy Tomatoes if you will um

1533
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:05,720
but the the the biggest thing that your

1534
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:08,520
Customs officers are looking for is soil

1535
00:58:05,719 --> 00:58:11,318
yeah right dirt brings bugs dirt brings

1536
00:58:08,519 --> 00:58:14,679
fungus dirt brings contaminants that are

1537
00:58:11,318 --> 00:58:16,838
foreign to wherever you're going so

1538
00:58:14,679 --> 00:58:18,759
that's the big problem but with a

1539
00:58:16,838 --> 00:58:21,480
phytosanitary certificate this is

1540
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:23,720
certified sterile yeah this has been

1541
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:25,440
fully sterilized you know this one isn't

1542
00:58:23,719 --> 00:58:28,759
but usually you know wrapped covered

1543
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:31,798
sealed so so there is no risk of this

1544
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:35,880
specific test tube infecting our our

1545
00:58:31,798 --> 00:58:37,759
food system or or animals or yeah so

1546
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:40,760
this this eliminates one of the biggest

1547
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:43,000
risks within transporting um and then

1548
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:45,599
secondly just the mode of transporting I

1549
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,798
mean it's so much easier imagine if

1550
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:49,519
you're a grower instead of having to buy

1551
00:58:47,798 --> 00:58:51,358
a truck and you know putting these

1552
00:58:49,519 --> 00:58:53,679
mothers in a huge truck you can put

1553
00:58:51,358 --> 00:58:56,279
little pest tubes in a vial and send

1554
00:58:53,679 --> 00:58:58,919
them or drive them over I mean it it's

1555
00:58:56,280 --> 00:59:01,160
in the game changer with how much space

1556
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:03,838
you can you can save and how much

1557
00:59:01,159 --> 00:59:05,199
efficiency you can take advantage of um

1558
00:59:03,838 --> 00:59:07,920
and it's just yeah it's just it's

1559
00:59:05,199 --> 00:59:10,639
another toolkit that people can use that

1560
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:13,400
we're working on developing further so

1561
00:59:10,639 --> 00:59:15,519
first how long can these synthetic seeds

1562
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:17,720
survive um so we're doing research on

1563
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:19,719
that second is what are the best

1564
00:59:17,719 --> 00:59:21,358
mechanisms of germinating the synthetic

1565
00:59:19,719 --> 00:59:23,480
seeds and then third what are the best

1566
00:59:21,358 --> 00:59:25,239
formulas for those synthetic seeds right

1567
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:27,480
to keep them alive to keep them

1568
00:59:25,239 --> 00:59:30,759
contamination free and to keep them

1569
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:32,679
sterile so all of these points in

1570
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:34,319
research are you know in progress are

1571
00:59:32,679 --> 00:59:35,719
being developed and you know stuff that

1572
00:59:34,318 --> 00:59:38,358
we will share with the community of

1573
00:59:35,719 --> 00:59:41,919
course uh whether it's via products via

1574
00:59:38,358 --> 00:59:44,440
protocols or just via training in our in

1575
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:47,280
our classes but we want Growers to to

1576
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:49,000
use all these tools accessible to them

1577
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:50,599
to improve their operations right how

1578
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,679
can you save money here how can you save

1579
00:59:50,599 --> 00:59:55,280
time here how can you create more space

1580
00:59:52,679 --> 00:59:56,960
efficiency here um at the end of the day

1581
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,798
that's that's what this is it's it's

1582
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:00,440
we're

1583
00:59:57,798 --> 01:00:01,798
optimizing the way that we grow yeah

1584
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:04,159
whether it's cannabis whether it's

1585
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:06,199
orchids whether it's pineapples um

1586
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:10,558
they're all plants and they all require

1587
01:00:06,199 --> 01:00:14,358
the same thing light nutrients water

1588
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:17,519
oxygen um and that's what we're doing

1589
01:00:14,358 --> 01:00:19,400
and it's it's a beautiful thing and like

1590
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:21,079
I said second inning man still a ball

1591
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:23,519
game we have a lot to learn and a lot to

1592
01:00:21,079 --> 01:00:25,640
do and you know we haven't even

1593
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:28,119
scratched the surface at what point in

1594
01:00:25,639 --> 01:00:30,199
your life did you get into the Cannabis

1595
01:00:28,119 --> 01:00:33,680
sphere of this uh business you said it

1596
01:00:30,199 --> 01:00:35,798
was a family business right yeah so I

1597
01:00:33,679 --> 01:00:38,558
would say right around the time the

1598
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:40,798
hempa was passed is when we started

1599
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:43,839
really trying to better understand the

1600
01:00:40,798 --> 01:00:45,358
Cannabis space um because like I said

1601
01:00:43,838 --> 01:00:48,639
earlier you know Bill Graham is probably

1602
01:00:45,358 --> 01:00:51,480
the first and only Public public person

1603
01:00:48,639 --> 01:00:54,279
yeah he's amazing to really work with

1604
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:55,960
cannabis and to publicize it right there

1605
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:59,160
were you know University of Miss

1606
01:00:55,960 --> 01:01:00,519
Missippi has been I guess they had some

1607
01:00:59,159 --> 01:01:02,598
some

1608
01:01:00,519 --> 01:01:05,239
deal yeah

1609
01:01:02,599 --> 01:01:07,240
yeah University of gu I mean there are

1610
01:01:05,239 --> 01:01:09,199
these large institutions amazing

1611
01:01:07,239 --> 01:01:12,279
institutions with unbelievable you know

1612
01:01:09,199 --> 01:01:13,960
s zabya droya and people who've been in

1613
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:17,920
this space who know the plant left and

1614
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:20,798
right um but it was really hidden for 15

1615
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:22,920
years 20 years maybe so I think people

1616
01:01:20,798 --> 01:01:24,239
really we we started getting into it

1617
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:27,119
2017

1618
01:01:24,239 --> 01:01:29,038
2018 um and connecting within our

1619
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:30,680
network of customers because we we do

1620
01:01:29,039 --> 01:01:33,359
sell products you know a lot of these

1621
01:01:30,679 --> 01:01:35,038
universities University of goare these

1622
01:01:33,358 --> 01:01:37,038
these large companies already use our

1623
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:38,920
products they already know us um so it's

1624
01:01:37,039 --> 01:01:40,559
just about you know sharing data or

1625
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:41,838
sharing research we want to better

1626
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:44,160
understand what you're working on why is

1627
01:01:41,838 --> 01:01:45,880
it important what are the implications

1628
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:48,798
and then going to conferences like we

1629
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:50,200
went to canmed and I learned a lot about

1630
01:01:48,798 --> 01:01:54,239
you know how to test for some of these

1631
01:01:50,199 --> 01:01:56,118
virus viruses and viroids how to um use

1632
01:01:54,239 --> 01:01:59,159
testing technology to better understand

1633
01:01:56,119 --> 01:02:02,079
understand uh or to better integrate uh

1634
01:01:59,159 --> 01:02:04,358
tissue culture and Commercial operations

1635
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:06,200
with testing so there are more and more

1636
01:02:04,358 --> 01:02:08,480
resources now than there ever were

1637
01:02:06,199 --> 01:02:10,480
before what I tell you is five six years

1638
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:12,278
ago I guess before we started on YouTube

1639
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:13,920
you might have found somebody with an

1640
01:02:12,278 --> 01:02:16,599
accent on a w on a whiteboard or a

1641
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:18,559
chalkboard yeah drawing you know stage

1642
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:20,838
one tissue culture stage two tissue

1643
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:22,559
culture writing out scientific terms

1644
01:02:20,838 --> 01:02:25,318
trying to explain it

1645
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:28,440
but you know I appreciate the effort but

1646
01:02:25,318 --> 01:02:31,119
it didn't do it yeah right so we started

1647
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:33,679
making videos so that I I myself could

1648
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:36,240
better understand the process you know

1649
01:02:33,679 --> 01:02:37,159
I'm a visual learner I want to see it I

1650
01:02:36,239 --> 01:02:40,358
want

1651
01:02:37,159 --> 01:02:43,639
to um as I'm reading see what they're

1652
01:02:40,358 --> 01:02:45,639
actually doing um and so there are a few

1653
01:02:43,639 --> 01:02:48,440
amazing books like one's called uh

1654
01:02:45,639 --> 01:02:49,278
plants from test tubes brid and a few

1655
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:52,400
other

1656
01:02:49,278 --> 01:02:54,679
authors amazing book very just

1657
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:56,680
insightful easy way to learn but yeah I

1658
01:02:54,679 --> 01:02:58,919
mean hannabis Kemp

1659
01:02:56,679 --> 01:03:02,519
Canabis Camp cannabis had really I think

1660
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:04,200
started seven six five six years ago and

1661
01:03:02,519 --> 01:03:06,318
now it's really kind of grown to his

1662
01:03:04,199 --> 01:03:08,639
life to a life of its own and really

1663
01:03:06,318 --> 01:03:10,159
helping support us and some of the R&amp;D

1664
01:03:08,639 --> 01:03:12,480
that we're doing or answering questions

1665
01:03:10,159 --> 01:03:14,440
and you know we're getting questions

1666
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:16,519
that we never thought of that we can now

1667
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:18,679
pursue because people want to figure out

1668
01:03:16,519 --> 01:03:20,038
how they can utilize this or or how this

1669
01:03:18,679 --> 01:03:23,078
can be efficient for the way that they

1670
01:03:20,039 --> 01:03:24,799
grow so it's it's really something a

1671
01:03:23,079 --> 01:03:26,278
gift that keeps on giving right because

1672
01:03:24,798 --> 01:03:29,920
Growers have

1673
01:03:26,278 --> 01:03:32,239
non-stop questions unlimited curiosity

1674
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:34,680
and desire to see their plants healthy

1675
01:03:32,239 --> 01:03:37,919
desire to see their plants grow and and

1676
01:03:34,679 --> 01:03:39,960
and Thrive so um we're learning as much

1677
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:42,440
as they are along the way and it's it's

1678
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:43,519
it's beautiful right we're and and all

1679
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:46,440
that information or a lot of that

1680
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:48,038
information is public yeah i' love take

1681
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:51,039
you to one of our parties where a bunch

1682
01:03:48,039 --> 01:03:53,920
of these old yeah old reclusive breeders

1683
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:55,799
go and meet up and hang out could you

1684
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:56,798
could talk to the to the guys that were

1685
01:03:55,798 --> 01:03:59,440
involved in doing this from the

1686
01:03:56,798 --> 01:04:02,318
beginning and

1687
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:05,039
getting I mean we went to MJ last year

1688
01:04:02,318 --> 01:04:07,400
and MJ biscon and we set up at Flo Hood

1689
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:08,799
just in the middle of a party I mean

1690
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:12,400
there was so much smoke you could barely

1691
01:04:08,798 --> 01:04:14,278
see but we showed people what we were

1692
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:16,240
doing right this is tissue culture this

1693
01:04:14,278 --> 01:04:19,119
you know big buzzword that you know you

1694
01:04:16,239 --> 01:04:21,439
thought would cost you $50,000 or $2

1695
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:24,960
million no it's just a Flo Hood some

1696
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:26,639
equipment and a protocol right yeah and

1697
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,720
showing people getting them under the

1698
01:04:26,639 --> 01:04:29,960
hood giving them the tools like once

1699
01:04:28,719 --> 01:04:33,798
they

1700
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:36,159
really simplify it and you know see it

1701
01:04:33,798 --> 01:04:38,559
for themselves it's not as scary as as

1702
01:04:36,159 --> 01:04:39,920
it sounds right yeah it is it is

1703
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:44,160
something to learn but it's not as

1704
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:46,000
complicated as uh requiring a PhD for

1705
01:04:44,159 --> 01:04:47,879
the very Basics right obviously you want

1706
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,798
to run research you want to run the lab

1707
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:51,680
sure you should have the the education

1708
01:04:49,798 --> 01:04:53,038
and we we recommend that but again if

1709
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:54,759
you want to work in that lab if you want

1710
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:56,799
to have the skills to to work under

1711
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:59,200
somebody that has knowledge they can

1712
01:04:56,798 --> 01:05:01,639
share with you you know we can teach you

1713
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:04,000
and there's resources online to to learn

1714
01:05:01,639 --> 01:05:06,239
and we classes are are a decent price

1715
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:09,318
too like they're they're not super

1716
01:05:06,239 --> 01:05:11,078
expensive or unaffordable at all I

1717
01:05:09,318 --> 01:05:13,239
thought that was really awesome like

1718
01:05:11,079 --> 01:05:13,240
yeah

1719
01:05:13,278 --> 01:05:20,559
Ian pack of seeds though like so like

1720
01:05:17,159 --> 01:05:22,719
you know $400 on a on a basic you know

1721
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:24,240
entrance thing is isn't bad at all

1722
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:27,159
that's two packs of seeds for most

1723
01:05:24,239 --> 01:05:29,798
people a fish right you you can spend

1724
01:05:27,159 --> 01:05:31,960
four or $500 every couple months or

1725
01:05:29,798 --> 01:05:34,318
couple years on seeds or spend your time

1726
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:36,240
and money on feno hunting or spend the

1727
01:05:34,318 --> 01:05:38,400
time and effort of cleaning up a problem

1728
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:40,358
or you can invest in the knowledge and

1729
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:42,599
let that knowledge pay for itself

1730
01:05:40,358 --> 01:05:45,239
knowledge is the most valuable thing and

1731
01:05:42,599 --> 01:05:46,920
especially with tissue culture knowledge

1732
01:05:45,239 --> 01:05:48,798
the companies that employ it have a

1733
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:50,960
cutting edge now yeah they have the

1734
01:05:48,798 --> 01:05:53,358
first movers Advantage because they're

1735
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:55,920
optimizing the way they grow which is

1736
01:05:53,358 --> 01:05:58,038
enabling them to invest more in better

1737
01:05:55,920 --> 01:06:00,599
equipment better processes better

1738
01:05:58,039 --> 01:06:02,200
products um so use it as an advantage

1739
01:06:00,599 --> 01:06:03,880
take advantage of the fact that the

1740
01:06:02,199 --> 01:06:06,798
information is out there now there's no

1741
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:09,720
excuse whether it's our classes videos

1742
01:06:06,798 --> 01:06:12,239
online tons of Education there's blogs

1743
01:06:09,719 --> 01:06:15,278
there's there's an unlimited wealth of

1744
01:06:12,239 --> 01:06:17,479
resources and yeah start looking right

1745
01:06:15,278 --> 01:06:19,880
start reading start asking questions you

1746
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:22,000
can reach out to us come to one of our

1747
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:24,640
classes uh hopefully we'll do some more

1748
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:27,639
shows in the next couple months or years

1749
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:29,159
we're not going to MJS this year but um

1750
01:06:27,639 --> 01:06:33,038
I'd say we we'll probably end up at

1751
01:06:29,159 --> 01:06:35,239
spannabis I Lov spannabis oh yeah

1752
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:37,319
yeah yeah there it sounds like a blast

1753
01:06:35,239 --> 01:06:39,399
out there I mean we set up the flo Hood

1754
01:06:37,318 --> 01:06:41,838
we were doing synthetic seeds we were

1755
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:43,358
doing demos people were doing it

1756
01:06:41,838 --> 01:06:46,038
themselves I mean they loved it people

1757
01:06:43,358 --> 01:06:48,159
ate it up and then we also go to Orchid

1758
01:06:46,039 --> 01:06:50,000
shows we go to flower shows we're we're

1759
01:06:48,159 --> 01:06:53,399
involved in you know other Industries as

1760
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:56,239
well of course um so yeah don't be shy

1761
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:59,240
to to reach out and if we can help you

1762
01:06:56,239 --> 01:07:00,558
we're here to do it that's our goal you

1763
01:06:59,239 --> 01:07:02,519
know what's funny is like most of our

1764
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:07,240
audience probably would never go to MJ

1765
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:08,880
biscon or or I mean because the the the

1766
01:07:07,239 --> 01:07:10,558
corporate Market kind of shook out all

1767
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:12,480
of the traditional Market already

1768
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:15,079
they've already run through the guys and

1769
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:16,960
used them got the whatever they needed

1770
01:07:15,079 --> 01:07:19,599
whether it was you know learning how to

1771
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:21,559
do this and that or using them for their

1772
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:23,000
connections or whatever so most people

1773
01:07:21,559 --> 01:07:26,119
don't even go to that anymore we used to

1774
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,599
all go to um the emerald cup each year

1775
01:07:26,119 --> 01:07:29,640
yeah I've heard a lot about the emerald

1776
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:31,599
cup it used to be the wild west where

1777
01:07:29,639 --> 01:07:34,118
like you know like we'd go and make a

1778
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:36,440
Year's worth of sales in a night or a

1779
01:07:34,119 --> 01:07:38,440
weekend you know it was wild it was

1780
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:40,480
awesome and then eventually they're like

1781
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:42,358
all of you need licenses and then all of

1782
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:44,880
us were like ah crap and so then there

1783
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:47,000
was like one seed bank there that was

1784
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:48,400
borrowing someone's license that sold

1785
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:51,000
one year and then after that it was just

1786
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:52,559
done like it's a shame because there's

1787
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,960
not there's nothing else

1788
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:57,440
commercialization yeah it's it's a

1789
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:59,838
realist thing that's gonna happen we

1790
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:02,240
always knew it was G to happen but um

1791
01:07:59,838 --> 01:08:04,759
watching watching how it's changed and

1792
01:08:02,239 --> 01:08:07,479
and who the big players are and the

1793
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:09,079
passion that they didn't come with for

1794
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:11,559
the most part I mean I'm sure there are

1795
01:08:09,079 --> 01:08:13,480
is one or two but like I don't know like

1796
01:08:11,559 --> 01:08:15,920
not without naming anyone there's a lot

1797
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:17,560
of major the the major cannabis

1798
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:20,560
corporations and it's like just been one

1799
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:23,199
major push back like you're killing all

1800
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:25,120
of the genetics and every everyone's

1801
01:08:23,198 --> 01:08:27,358
passion for breeding by constantly

1802
01:08:25,119 --> 01:08:28,559
letting the the the market forc cookies

1803
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:30,679
down our throat under a thousand

1804
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:32,239
different names and that's what that's

1805
01:08:30,679 --> 01:08:36,239
kind of where I'm at with it like when I

1806
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:38,519
see anything runch gelato cookies sherb

1807
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:40,399
it's all like the same expressions of

1808
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:42,359
everything melded with different names

1809
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:44,358
and and that's kind of where breeding's

1810
01:08:42,359 --> 01:08:47,440
gone so yeah a lot of our our mission

1811
01:08:44,359 --> 01:08:50,120
has been to get people interested in

1812
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:53,519
other stuff that isn't like talked about

1813
01:08:50,119 --> 01:08:55,119
by rappers per se you know or like yeah

1814
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:58,159
but it's hard it's hard it's it's it's

1815
01:08:55,119 --> 01:09:00,559
hard because we don't have the U the

1816
01:08:58,158 --> 01:09:03,158
marketing expense that like hey give

1817
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:05,440
this rapper $75,000 to rap about this

1818
01:09:03,158 --> 01:09:07,838
this strain you know yeah and that's the

1819
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:09,479
real way to do it but yeah it's it's

1820
01:09:07,838 --> 01:09:10,719
it's marrying a lot of different worlds

1821
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:13,158
that probably never would have

1822
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:15,640
originally met and nobody expected to

1823
01:09:13,158 --> 01:09:17,679
meet you know I mean what I'd say to

1824
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:19,239
that too though is what sets you apart

1825
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:22,079
from those big commercial grows it's

1826
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:23,759
it's your genetics right yeah you you

1827
01:09:22,079 --> 01:09:25,759
have Budweiser but you still have micro

1828
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:27,238
breweries yeah micr breweries anything

1829
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:30,479
have continued to grow and I think

1830
01:09:27,238 --> 01:09:32,318
eventually maybe not but my hunch is

1831
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:35,439
that you'll have these big Growers that

1832
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:38,319
sell kind of dirt weed and you know

1833
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:41,919
lowquality product and then you'll have

1834
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:44,199
you know very Niche and unique strains

1835
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:46,158
that can only be obtained from some of

1836
01:09:44,198 --> 01:09:47,759
the best breeders so to those breeders

1837
01:09:46,158 --> 01:09:49,719
and and to the world that is getting

1838
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:52,000
pushed out via commercialization those

1839
01:09:49,719 --> 01:09:54,640
genetics that's that's your that's your

1840
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:57,679
ticket yeah and you know your library

1841
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:59,199
your your passion for finding the you

1842
01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:00,880
know unique Expressions I think that's

1843
01:09:59,198 --> 01:10:02,079
how you can differentiate because a lot

1844
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:04,039
of these guys that are entering the

1845
01:10:02,079 --> 01:10:05,238
space that are large commercial they're

1846
01:10:04,039 --> 01:10:08,079
buying out they don't they don't know

1847
01:10:05,238 --> 01:10:10,279
what they're talking about no and is a

1848
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:11,920
quick turnover for money usually in most

1849
01:10:10,279 --> 01:10:14,439
of these things they want to get in get

1850
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:16,640
out make money get out so protect your

1851
01:10:14,439 --> 01:10:18,759
genetics is is is the is the moral of

1852
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:21,119
the story is the moral of interiew

1853
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:22,440
exactly please please please make sure

1854
01:10:21,119 --> 01:10:24,079
your genetics stay alive because you

1855
01:10:22,439 --> 01:10:26,359
spent time you spent money you spent

1856
01:10:24,079 --> 01:10:29,399
years or months

1857
01:10:26,359 --> 01:10:32,000
um investing in in identifying them and

1858
01:10:29,399 --> 01:10:33,879
growing them so keep them safe and use

1859
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:36,119
tissue culture to keep them safe you

1860
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:37,560
know after this interview um SS I'm sure

1861
01:10:36,119 --> 01:10:39,039
I'm gonna have a lot more questions I

1862
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:42,120
have some here butt they would they

1863
01:10:39,039 --> 01:10:43,920
would run us into like two hours so uh

1864
01:10:42,119 --> 01:10:45,920
sure I'll probably bother you again for

1865
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:46,960
some more time so we can run through

1866
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:49,158
this and like yeah because there's

1867
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:50,960
questions about Floy and all all this

1868
01:10:49,158 --> 01:10:53,679
other stuff that people want to know

1869
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:55,960
using and assessing it absolutely let's

1870
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:58,319
do it yeah yeah dude uh this has been an

1871
01:10:55,960 --> 01:11:00,640
absolute pleasure and and it's it's data

1872
01:10:58,319 --> 01:11:02,198
heavy but that's what I wanted so that's

1873
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:04,119
what that's what people need and I think

1874
01:11:02,198 --> 01:11:06,639
that's want and they'll be able to watch

1875
01:11:04,119 --> 01:11:08,279
this over and over and over that's the

1876
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:10,480
hope and we're just gonna continue the

1877
01:11:08,279 --> 01:11:13,238
conversation so questions are are

1878
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:15,839
encouraged um as I said there's plenty

1879
