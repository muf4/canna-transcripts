[Music]

5
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,640
welcome to breeder syndicate

6
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:39,039
what's up everybody how's everybody

7
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,320
doing welcome to uh breeder syndicate

8
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,079
today we're gonna go

9
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,320
and talk about the

10
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,359
sequel to what we were discussing last

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,520
uh episode which was the early years of

12
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:52,640
the dutch seed banks

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,199
yep so i mean kind of last year we uh

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,359
or last last time so to speak we chatted

15
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,358
a lot about how they got started we

16
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:00,479
chatted about neville and all that and

17
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,640
we kind of

18
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,158
um we kind of took us took everybody

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,198
through like the first three or four

20
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,359
years

21
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:09,039
um you know i see that there's a bunch

22
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:11,200
of cool questions this week that have

23
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,560
already popped up so we'll get to that

24
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,159
in a little bit but we're going to kind

25
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,040
of start on

26
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,560
um

27
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,320
we're going to kind of start and take

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,920
you guys through like

29
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:23,199
um the last say like 10 years or so of

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,040
uh

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,040
of neville's influence and kind of his

32
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,118
history so

33
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,799
uh you know we got a bunch of notes and

34
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:32,478
things like that we'll hold up some

35
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,759
stuff on occasion to give you guys some

36
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:36,239
ideas

37
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,359
all that all that type of stuff so

38
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:39,920
um

39
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:41,759
you know uh probably the the easiest way

40
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,680
to start is to say that

41
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:48,239
in uh in 1990 in 1988

42
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,720
um that was kind of when neville had

43
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,239
been in business like three years or so

44
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:55,200
and that's when he kind of

45
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:57,839
started to sort out like favorites among

46
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,000
amongst what's he what he had he had had

47
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,079
to uh he'd collected a number of

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,200
cuttings from america by then he dealt

49
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:07,359
with a bunch of breeders by then he had

50
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,520
um bread with a number of these things

51
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:12,400
for three or four years in some cases at

52
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,879
this point and that's where his uh

53
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,920
collection started to go from sort of a

54
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:20,878
a hodgepodge grab bag of things

55
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:22,719
to more of the famous stuff that we all

56
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:25,120
became familiar with when we started

57
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:27,520
getting into weed history uh northern

58
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,039
lights one northern lights two

59
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,840
uh g13 you know hash plant

60
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:35,120
nl you know nl hazes and stuff like that

61
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,120
so

62
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,080
um 88 to 90 is kind of really when

63
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,800
um

64
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,920
people are probably like more familiar

65
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,840
with that stuff yeah um because he you

66
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:50,079
know he's he'd sort of settled on what

67
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,080
worked for him yeah right where before

68
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,440
he'd been just kind of playing around

69
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,640
with everything he really didn't know

70
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,719
what he'd had

71
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:59,679
uh people had sent him stuff people had

72
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,878
he'd bought things off various folks

73
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,640
and he

74
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:03,919
you know but these are just names to him

75
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,238
to us

76
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:08,000
you get nl you get maple leaf you get

77
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,759
haze that all means something because

78
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,120
there's a lot of history behind it but

79
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:12,878
probably

80
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,439
there was just a lot of they were just

81
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:17,679
literally names from dudes well early on

82
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:19,359
he was sourcing a lot of seeds and later

83
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,680
on and over those three years he became

84
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,680
a breeder as opposed to just sourcing

85
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,760
and passing on genetics he actually

86
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,080
started working lines which is which is

87
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:30,158
where these amazing lines come from

88
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,760
yeah and he he and he had done a bunch

89
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:33,840
of breeding and he sort of figured out

90
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:36,079
what was an inconsistent pain in the ass

91
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,280
for lack of a better term and what was

92
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,840
consistent

93
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,919
um you know neville was always

94
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,280
um he was always sensitive to what

95
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,199
people wanted

96
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,878
uh you know he wanted to sell seeds he

97
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:47,919
wanted to make people happy

98
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:50,639
and so

99
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,878
people weren't happy a lot of times with

100
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:55,279
incredibly variable stuff

101
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:56,719
that didn't perform well and so

102
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,400
he uh

103
00:03:56,719 --> 00:04:01,438
you know he had started to figure out

104
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:05,200
what males were good to use repeatedly

105
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:06,878
um what females were champs and red well

106
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:08,479
with lots of different stuff

107
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:09,438
and so we're gonna we're gonna start

108
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:11,598
kind of

109
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:13,438
you know walking through some of that

110
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:14,878
type of thing okay which one you want to

111
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:16,798
start with first

112
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:18,560
um

113
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,238
maybe we should start with we we kind of

114
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,560
talked a lot about

115
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,679
uh northern lights last time that was

116
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,160
probably one of the things that we

117
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,120
expounded upon the most yeah so maybe we

118
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,520
could chat about because 1988 is when

119
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,800
things dramatically changed yeah uh in

120
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:35,519
that regard

121
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,520
from 85 to 87 he just sort of sold a

122
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:38,399
variety of weird hybrids of northern

123
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:39,839
lights

124
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:40,879
and you kind of got you just bought

125
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,359
straight

126
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:45,918
nl northern lights it was a grab bag of

127
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,759
all the different types yeah well by

128
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:50,639
by 88

129
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:53,280
he had decided that there was two lines

130
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,280
that really made the most sense nl1 and

131
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:58,239
l2 yeah

132
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:59,359
nl1 was sort of like a broad-leafed

133
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,519
afghan

134
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,479
um possibly you could call it a bubba

135
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:07,359
type you know widely frosty

136
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:09,839
golf ball type uh you know nugs almost

137
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,360
maybe slightly yellowish

138
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:14,079
and that was probably one of his most

139
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,840
consistent lines he had uh because he

140
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,120
took all the northern lights and he bred

141
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:18,079
them together

142
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,439
right

143
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:24,639
independently and so in 88 he offered

144
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:27,439
what was called nl1f3

145
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,800
yeah and nl2 f3

146
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:30,079
i wish i could put these up on the

147
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,400
screen but i can't because i don't have

148
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:34,719
the controls yes we'll just have to read

149
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,399
it we'll just have to read it so so

150
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,600
basically um

151
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:39,198
you know

152
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,039
those two things

153
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,560
they became and we'll talk about a

154
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:44,800
little bit more later but these kind of

155
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,519
became like mainstays

156
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,400
in cannabis for quite some time they

157
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:52,719
became permanent editions right yeah

158
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:55,758
as well as that as well as offering them

159
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,080
pure so let's figure he gets him an 84.

160
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,680
he starts messing around with them in

161
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:01,439
85-ish

162
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,680
by 88

163
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:06,560
he'd had you know three years of having

164
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,038
them he'd taken them to f3

165
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,199
right and he was releasing them as a

166
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:13,918
more consistent variety yeah and so

167
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,160
that's the 88 is the first is the first

168
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:17,038
year that those two things pop up

169
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,560
right

170
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:20,879
and it's also the first year that you

171
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,399
start seeing so in addition to offering

172
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:23,600
both of those strains

173
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:26,799
as

174
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:30,479
straight itself you start seeing nl2 and

175
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:33,439
nl1 being used as breeding males

176
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:36,879
and all kinds of stuff that he had

177
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:38,879
right um nl1 there's probably nothing

178
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,560
that he used as much as a breeding male

179
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,399
as nl1

180
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,560
is that the the biggest one biggest

181
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:46,879
focus on the company is a male overall

182
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,759
looking back yeah i would say so i mean

183
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:50,319
you can

184
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,598
you can look at stuff and um

185
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,199
you know he

186
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:55,199
a lot of the

187
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,879
you know a lot of the stuff that he had

188
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,478
you know that he got his cuttings for

189
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:03,199
instance um like hash plant um

190
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:05,598
he first offered his hash plant by no1

191
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:09,199
yeah he gets big butt as a cutting he

192
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:11,439
offers it as big bud by nl1 yeah um you

193
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,720
know he gets uh he gets a variety of

194
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:17,120
things and he starts crossing it by nl1

195
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,400
88 is interesting too because you know

196
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,720
he had gotten

197
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:24,799
these old haze seeds from sam skunk man

198
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,919
and uh in addition to some other people

199
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,240
in holland

200
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:31,519
and 88 is the first year that any kind

201
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,918
of haze hybrid pops up and it's one that

202
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:34,959
maybe a lot of people haven't heard of

203
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:40,318
right yeah

204
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:41,439
it's very weird it's haze by nl1

205
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,479
and

206
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:45,120
so

207
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:46,959
it was only offered for one year

208
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,360
but what's unique about it

209
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:51,758
is that all the other haze hybrids he

210
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,759
offered used haze as a male

211
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,840
yeah this actually was a female that he

212
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,639
found that he called hayes b

213
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:01,198
yes right so there's this one year

214
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,000
where all of a sudden you could get haze

215
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,560
b

216
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,279
by nl one and of all things it was no

217
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,079
one root or owls yeah

218
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:10,159
so

219
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:12,959
uh that's the first time that hayes pops

220
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,960
up that i'm aware of in a catalog

221
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,839
in holland

222
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:18,878
okay

223
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:21,038
i think so yeah you know that that's i

224
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,120
do think you're right

225
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:25,439
um and it was because he hadn't settled

226
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,199
on he hadn't you know he he was still

227
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:29,519
experimenting a little bit but he'd

228
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,478
figured out some things yeah right he'd

229
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:32,958
also

230
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:35,918
um he'd gone to america

231
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:38,879
and he had acquired through jorge

232
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:41,918
cervantes connections in the pacific

233
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:44,240
northwest uh in the oregon washington

234
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:45,759
area uh jorge had hooked him up with

235
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,360
some unknown

236
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:51,120
uh growers

237
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:53,278
and those unknown growers gave him g13

238
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,120
and what became known as the pacific

239
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:57,200
northwest hash plan

240
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,159
uh both of those things ended up getting

241
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,600
used pretty extensively in future years

242
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,480
yeah right

243
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,839
so

244
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,000
um

245
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,240
you know he he also i don't know if i

246
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,039
don't know if matt can show it or not

247
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,600
but

248
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:13,439
he the 87 update

249
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,519
i don't know i can't do it

250
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,440
you know you can't do it so yeah and he

251
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,200
he offered this 87 update one of the

252
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,160
things that was cool about naval is that

253
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,240
he

254
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,958
he gave a lot more data on what the hell

255
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,278
he was doing versus most other breeders

256
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:29,439
it was extensive especially in that 87

257
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:30,799
update that's really like more data than

258
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,200
most growers back then would have even

259
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:36,958
given a [ __ ] i'm glad he did

260
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,560
he he lays it out right so um

261
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,319
you know he uh

262
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,799
he starts talking about it and he talks

263
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:47,278
about basically both the hash plant and

264
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:50,079
the big bud that he crossed to nl1 yes

265
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:51,200
and then he took that and he back

266
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,160
crossed it

267
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,000
uh males of that back to the original

268
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:58,159
and so that's how he became that's how

269
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,639
big bud and hash plant actually got

270
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:02,799
offered is as separate strains yeah

271
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:07,199
because he used nl1

272
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:08,479
um to bx them for uh you know he so

273
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,879
so they're actually

274
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,079
um you know he never had seed lines of

275
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:14,159
those

276
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:16,000
right so and he lays out in like

277
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:17,360
extensive detail i can't show it to you

278
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,600
on the screen right now but he kind of

279
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,440
lays out like his like step by step how

280
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,800
he figured it out yeah what kind of he

281
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,000
knows we're gonna be in it what you

282
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:26,399
could look for

283
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
um all that type of stuff

284
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,360
and so that's when

285
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,720
88 is when a lot of uh

286
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,039
that's when a lot of the famous stuff

287
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,278
that we all know of really pops up

288
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:38,559
the g13 hash plant i think pops up that

289
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:40,879
year

290
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:42,000
i think it you know it does and then

291
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:42,799
you know he

292
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,278
you know

293
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:47,679
he found some of these some of these

294
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:49,919
indica strains these you know he

295
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,519
um some of these indica strains were a

296
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:53,039
lot more consistent than what he was

297
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,440
working with and so once you find

298
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:57,278
consistency you start crossing them to

299
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,279
different things and

300
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:00,639
um you start

301
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:03,679
you know you start getting these various

302
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:05,360
hybrids sure of such so

303
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:08,479
uh

304
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,839
you know i don't know um and then 89.90

305
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,800
is really when like he solidified

306
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,200
the

307
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:17,759
sort of the lineup as it were

308
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,959
and that lineup ended up staying pretty

309
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:20,559
consistent

310
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,439
um

311
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:23,359
in

312
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,600
in in the seed bag catalog and even

313
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,079
going into scentsy um a lot of that

314
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:31,120
stuff ended up gets getting ported over

315
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:33,519
yeah so you could kind of look at it and

316
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,278
if you're thinking about it in that way

317
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,078
i would say probably

318
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:39,838
by the late 80s

319
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:44,239
probably the three most consistent

320
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:46,480
females that he used were um

321
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,159
nl5

322
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,959
uh g13

323
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:50,879
yep

324
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,799
and hash plan

325
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:54,480
yeah those those were sort of the three

326
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:56,799
most common indicas

327
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,159
that he would use as as as standard

328
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,479
females

329
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:02,480
the hash plant this is the pnw hash

330
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,720
plant cutting

331
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,000
still looks very similar too

332
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,120
after all these years it still looks

333
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,839
similar

334
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,200
kind of ugly

335
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,920
very to be up to be perfectly honest

336
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,639
about it not the by modern standards not

337
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:19,519
particularly pretty nuts um

338
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,919
and then as far as males go

339
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,560
by 89.90

340
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:26,479
you would say that the the most common

341
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:28,559
males he used was like i said before was

342
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,680
certainly nl1

343
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:36,159
he also used nl2 a bunch yeah

344
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:38,159
um you know and you know he you had um

345
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:39,439
northern lights five by northern lights

346
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:42,480
two

347
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,760
you had g13 by nl2

348
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,000
yeah um

349
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:47,278
northern you had all kinds of stuff by

350
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,399
nl1

351
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:51,039
yeah

352
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:54,399
hawaiian indica was by nl1 big bud was

353
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:58,159
by nl1 hash plant was by nl1

354
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,679
uh that haze i spoke about was by nl1

355
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:00,799
hawaiian yeah

356
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:03,359
all that stuff

357
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:05,278
i'll answer one quick question i see it

358
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,320
coming on the thing people talk about

359
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:12,559
the airborne and the pacific g13 cuts

360
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:15,760
uh those are a little uh hazy but

361
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:19,679
it's most likely they're not pure g13

362
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:20,559
they're most likely a g13 by an l2 like

363
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:22,799
that

364
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:24,879
like that would be uh fino popping out

365
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:27,759
of the seeds that airborne popped from

366
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:30,000
pacific is a lot different um

367
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:31,120
that one that one is a lot has a lot

368
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,639
more of a

369
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,078
cloudy history

370
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,759
we know the breeders that offered it and

371
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:38,958
stuff but it never quite panned out the

372
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:43,120
same as airborne as far as uh producing

373
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:44,879
quality and and stuff similar to g13

374
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:49,039
so yeah so and then

375
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:51,120
um aside from nl1 and nl2 uh the other

376
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:52,240
probably two most common males that he

377
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,480
used by

378
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,600
you know 89 90 would have been the haze

379
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,000
male

380
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,920
uh and skunk one

381
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,159
which has no

382
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:03,278
the c hey c

383
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:04,719
a c

384
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:06,639
um he

385
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,240
you know the haze story it's probably we

386
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,720
could probably talk about it a little

387
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,519
bit yeah if we could brush up on it

388
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,040
brush on it we could brush on it so

389
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,399
um so

390
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:20,399
sam's got man uh flees america and he

391
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,399
comes over to

392
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,958
your he comes over to europe and he's

393
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,919
trying to get set up and he has

394
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:28,479
um

395
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:30,559
skunk one and hayes seeds

396
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,360
and then from mel frank he has durbin

397
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:35,439
poison and afghani one seeds and he has

398
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,600
a couple other uh seed lines that he

399
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,680
collected in the orange right california

400
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,320
orange i think that was from rob clark

401
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:44,958
oh was that for rob okay i believe so um

402
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,399
he had a number of things um

403
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,319
uh polly you know he had a number of

404
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,120
things from rob rob followed him out

405
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,320
later early pearl early girl

406
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,919
yeah

407
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,040
the early girl

408
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:59,919
the um you know the pearl stuff early

409
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:02,000
pearl uh some of some of the mexicans

410
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:05,439
that that neville offered

411
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,958
uh those were from sam initially yeah

412
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:11,040
but they were from um

413
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:13,119
but they were from rob yeah you know so

414
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:16,159
sam ended up coming over

415
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,879
sam ended up coming over to um

416
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:22,639
to europe first yeah he kind of brought

417
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:24,720
a hodgepodge of various uh collectors

418
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,198
and and people's lines

419
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,399
right yeah um

420
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:29,838
and so

421
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,240
uh

422
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,839
so you know there's there's a there's a

423
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,440
debate between

424
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,440
um well it's not a debate anymore

425
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,759
because neville's passed unfortunately

426
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:43,279
but there was a long debate that was

427
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:45,759
likely never to be solved where um sam

428
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:47,600
has a number of stories about the early

429
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,278
haze and how it happened

430
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,839
neville has his own stories that could

431
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:54,639
be an entire podcast in itself

432
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,920
but suffice to say that when sam came

433
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,360
over to

434
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:00,078
uh europe

435
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,440
he sold some haze seeds to

436
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:04,879
neville

437
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:07,759
uh he sold some haze seeds to uh the

438
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:11,360
founder of sssc

439
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:13,199
he gave some to the uh owner of uh

440
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,440
positronics

441
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:17,039
um and maybe someone else

442
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,560
maybe um

443
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:19,919
there was a few people at least at least

444
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:22,719
three people

445
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:24,799
are documented to have gotten um stuff

446
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,560
from some from sam right when he came

447
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:27,679
over right yeah i think that's been

448
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:29,679
pretty well done

449
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:30,719
yeah with the haze

450
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:32,319
so

451
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,600
uh sam

452
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,600
so neville

453
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,759
neville neville's story just real quick

454
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,560
is there a bunch of old seeds

455
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:43,039
he cracked a bunch of them uh most of

456
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:46,159
them did not pop

457
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:48,480
and he the first female he got

458
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:50,240
he unfortunately killed because it never

459
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,000
finished flowering it took forever it

460
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,079
was a huge pain in the ass

461
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,799
he got another female which is the bee

462
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:58,399
which i spoke about

463
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:00,399
which i spoke about earlier as being the

464
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:04,318
first actual release

465
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:07,599
and he got two males uh a and c they

466
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:10,399
both ended up uh becoming kind of famous

467
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:13,359
c much more so and he

468
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,439
he he crossed he crossed the a to

469
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,639
basically everything every good indica

470
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,480
he had

471
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,919
uh and he made a mistake with his

472
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:25,919
workers in 89 and he lost the mail

473
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:28,079
early so yeah ever he never sold

474
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,919
he never sold any commercial

475
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:30,798
uh he never sold the commercial seed of

476
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,840
a

477
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:36,000
so everybody everybody that um that gets

478
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:38,959
nl5 haze or any of that other kind of

479
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,798
haze crosses silver haze all that it's

480
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,240
all using the cmail because that's the

481
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:43,759
one that survived

482
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,359
yeah right

483
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:49,519
uh and strangely um it seems like

484
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:51,759
neville had more success

485
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:53,839
finding fire

486
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:55,359
in the haze seeds that he got than other

487
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:56,720
people did

488
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:58,159
yeah that's what it sounds like that's

489
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,720
what it sounds like i mean and it sounds

490
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,880
like he had 10 seeds total is what it

491
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,279
sounds like so he so there's debate in

492
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,640
that and there's yeah camp that believes

493
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:08,720
that he got

494
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,480
similar things to everyone else

495
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,558
yeah and he just had better indicas to

496
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,558
cross them to than anybody else

497
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:18,079
yeah there's another

498
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:19,918
camp that thinks that um neville claimed

499
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:21,759
that sam sold him

500
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,038
old seeds

501
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:25,200
that he said would have a low

502
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:26,319
germination rate that were from 69 to

503
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,798
70.

504
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:31,519
and maybe sam and that maybe sam when he

505
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:33,599
first got there sold some original stuff

506
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:34,558
before he did his open pollinations in

507
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,558
holland

508
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:39,038
and the people that got a hold of that

509
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:40,558
original first batch of haze that he

510
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:42,879
brought over with him

511
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:45,119
got better quality haze than people did

512
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,360
later on yeah

513
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:48,399
uh it's not really a debate that we can

514
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:52,240
solve

515
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,519
being that it's two dudes from 1984 1985

516
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,279
yeah right

517
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:58,240
and they disagree

518
00:18:55,279 --> 00:19:01,038
um you know but we do have you know all

519
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:04,720
three guys that he that well neville

520
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:07,440
and the the you know the guy from sssc

521
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,279
and the positronics gentlemen they all

522
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,558
agreed that they got

523
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:15,599
his seed from sam at the same time

524
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:17,359
at the same time same year same time

525
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:19,439
came back everything

526
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:21,038
all that kind of stuff and so we know

527
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,279
you know we have we have we have

528
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:25,599
documentation from others that it

529
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:26,639
certainly happened yeah

530
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:28,719
right

531
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,759
and so that's when

532
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,279
um by 80 by 89 90

533
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:35,279
that's when all the famous stuff you

534
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:39,200
start hearing about which is

535
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:41,519
nl5 by skunk one and a 5x2

536
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:45,360
g13 by nl2

537
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:46,798
um you know nl5 by i think nl5 by haze

538
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:50,639
was actually

539
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:52,720
released via catalog not until 1889 90.

540
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,120
here's a pretty picture and i was just

541
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,880
looking earlier and it's nl5 it's a i

542
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:58,719
think it's a much prettier picture than

543
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,120
on the back of a lot of the catalogs

544
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:04,319
that they show where it's just like

545
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:06,639
a jumbled up close shot of some

546
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:08,639
kind of frosty leaves this one is a much

547
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,559
better i think it gives a much better

548
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,280
picture of the bud structure

549
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:15,678
overall growth patterns and whatnot

550
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:17,279
so that's really interesting uh because

551
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,880
that's the famous

552
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,720
nl5 cutting

553
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,799
yeah um

554
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,159
a uh i'll answer a quick question just

555
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:26,158
because i was talking about it somebody

556
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,880
just asked where's tom hill's haze fits

557
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,480
in

558
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:33,039
yeah and uh you know i would say that uh

559
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,679
matt knows a bit more about that than i

560
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:38,640
but i believe that tom hill got his

561
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,320
haystack from positronics yeah it's the

562
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,400
old positronics haze i don't know if i

563
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,759
think it's the old positronics haze 19

564
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,360
based on all that

565
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:49,279
so that that's where

566
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:51,279
um tom hill's haze comes from one of the

567
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:53,200
uh you know one of the one of the first

568
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:54,639
people that gave

569
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,519
and gave hayes to

570
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,919
um

571
00:20:55,519 --> 00:21:00,000
positrons um

572
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,720
and

573
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,159
let's see here so lost my train of

574
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,480
thought for a second answering that

575
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,640
question but the nl5 that he was just

576
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,120
holding up maybe we can talk about that

577
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,280
for a second because it's interesting

578
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:15,519
so neville that there's we're talking

579
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:19,678
about in the previous podcast how there

580
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:22,558
was always two famous cuttings of nl5

581
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:25,600
um on the interview that matt did with

582
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:29,038
uh greg seattle greg of northern lights

583
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:32,399
fame he said that he got a cutting of

584
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:35,119
nl5 and it was from his friend herbie

585
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,600
steve murphy's afghan and crossed it to

586
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:39,359
a colombian mexican yeah

587
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:41,599
and that was the cutting that he sent

588
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:43,119
neville neville claims he got that cut

589
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:46,399
and he didn't like it very much compared

590
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:49,678
to the cut that he found never story is

591
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,960
that he popped a bunch of nl5 seed lines

592
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,000
because that's one of the lines he got

593
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,159
from greg

594
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,480
and most of it was an indica sativa

595
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:59,440
hybrid mess yeah it was particularly

596
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,360
useful but he got this one plant that

597
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,000
was what he called the throwback plant

598
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:06,479
that looked pure afghan and had no

599
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,119
influence of sativa whatsoever and as

600
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:14,079
you see this short stucky dense butted

601
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:16,239
frosty yeah that picture i would say

602
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:18,558
leads up to um

603
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,038
to neville's you know neville's story

604
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:22,639
being correct yeah um and probably

605
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:24,158
having some truth to it because i would

606
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,840
look at that thing and i would not say

607
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,840
it had any colombian or mexican

608
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:29,839
influence yes i would instantly say that

609
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:33,359
looks pure afghani it would look like a

610
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:35,839
pure afghan yeah to me at least

611
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:38,079
so um

612
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:40,240
you know and uh

613
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:43,439
so yeah i mean that right there that's

614
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:46,079
the famous nl5 haze that's the famous

615
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,159
cutting that got across the haze that

616
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:50,399
got crossed the skunk one that got

617
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:53,280
crossed in northern lights too

618
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,120
um and it's really you know we mentioned

619
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:58,240
it before but there was never a pure

620
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:59,519
seed line of nl5 offered there was

621
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,960
hybrids

622
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:03,519
correct

623
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,519
right there was only hybrids offered so

624
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:07,519
um

625
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:09,440
you know uh

626
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:11,359
that's the cutting

627
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,038
there we go that's disgusting nl5 do you

628
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:15,519
want to go into

629
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:17,599
maple leaf indica the big bud stuff like

630
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:19,599
that did we cover that i don't think we

631
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:22,879
covered that too too much basically once

632
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:24,558
he once he found that nl5 cutting

633
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,400
um like i said before that's when he

634
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:30,480
started crossing it it became one of his

635
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:33,519
standards yeah no in in in the situation

636
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,919
um and you know he

637
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:36,720
had you know like he crossed it to skunk

638
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,360
one

639
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,880
that became an extremely famous strain

640
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:46,558
uh f5 by skunk one nl5 hayes is probably

641
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,559
the most famous line he did yeah 5x2

642
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:50,879
is also super famous

643
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:54,480
and uh so

644
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:57,039
you know he nl5 g13 hash plant those

645
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:00,720
became sort of his standard indicates

646
00:23:57,038 --> 00:24:03,759
yeah his his best producing females

647
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:07,120
uh skunk one hayes

648
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:08,720
nl2 and nl1 became his most common

649
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:09,678
um

650
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,159
males

651
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:14,960
yeah that he used and he offered

652
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,720
obviously he never offered a pure nl5

653
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:20,079
line or a pure

654
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:22,720
uh hazeline but he did offer pure nl1

655
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:24,000
pure l2 pure skunk one

656
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,679
um

657
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,400
you know that type of thing

658
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:30,080
you know i never got to ask him why

659
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,360
the why of that why didn't you ever

660
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:35,038
offer his ace pier or nl5 pure

661
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:37,119
you know i think i think part of the

662
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:39,599
reason why he never offered uh hayes

663
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:40,319
pure is because he he screwed up early

664
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:42,879
on

665
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:46,158
and he lost too much of it yeah he

666
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,919
talked about later on wishing that he

667
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:51,278
could um

668
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,880
that he could cross the uh

669
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:54,240
that he would have been able to cross

670
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,120
the b

671
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,319
to

672
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:57,439
the a

673
00:24:56,319 --> 00:25:00,079
yeah

674
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,120
and he you know but he he lost the b

675
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:03,678
early

676
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:06,000
um because he didn't realize what he had

677
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:08,480
he lost the a on her accident

678
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,640
and so he sort of ended up with

679
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,960
uh he sort of ended up with not very

680
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,440
much you know the c was like his most

681
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,278
consistent yeah what do you have what he

682
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,919
had left yeah

683
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:21,599
um you know and then strangely

684
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,919
it seems like for whatever reason all

685
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:25,439
the other people that got a's

686
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,038
nothing much came us

687
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,960
yeah no matter how much breeding or

688
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:31,359
crossing they did nothing became famous

689
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,440
like the later neville hazes so like

690
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:34,959
when i was going to when i was going to

691
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,120
coffee shops

692
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,679
uh coffee shops were

693
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:42,399
um you know they were full of

694
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,320
of c5 which is

695
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,278
uh nl5 ac

696
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:51,599
a5 which is nl5 haze a

697
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:54,558
uh a g13 which is g13 heisei they als

698
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:57,278
they also had uh g13 ac

699
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:59,440
yeah they were full of neville work yeah

700
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:02,000
um they didn't really carry much posi

701
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,400
work they didn't carry any sam work they

702
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,640
didn't carry any of those things

703
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,960
um you know even though they were easily

704
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,120
accessible yeah those were standard

705
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,720
people in holland so

706
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:14,639
uh there must have been a significant

707
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,360
quality difference yeah

708
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,720
had to have been um and you know i think

709
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:22,558
even today

710
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:25,519
is there is there a famous sam cut

711
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:27,599
is there a famous pot you know it's all

712
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:29,359
the stuff that they do is

713
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:31,918
not really

714
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:33,678
all the stuff that they do is is all the

715
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,640
stuff that's hoarded over there

716
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,000
yeah

717
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,360
is um

718
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,119
you know is

719
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:41,918
uh what you might call it

720
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:43,439
neville cuts yeah and and right now i

721
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,840
just want to take the time if any of you

722
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,320
older gentlemen are watching this and

723
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:50,399
have all these cuts

724
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:51,918
give me a give me a ring

725
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,200
i'd love to just to be able to chat

726
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:54,880
about them and get and get further

727
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,200
histories on a lot of these

728
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,240
yeah i mean a lot of this stuff

729
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,840
you know one thing that should be

730
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,919
mentioned about this

731
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:03,599
is uh all this stuff happened on a

732
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:07,038
different continent

733
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:08,719
and you know what uh the story sounds

734
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:09,519
pretty straightforward and simple right

735
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,240
now

736
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:14,400
but the amount of talking and time and

737
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,400
energy and interviewing people

738
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,720
and trying to make sure that like it's

739
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:21,120
not just one person's opinion and we can

740
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:24,960
get other people to back up opinions on

741
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:26,639
this stuff it takes a long time yeah

742
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,079
i mean me and you've been working steady

743
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,960
on this for i want to say three years

744
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:33,038
now just me and you together and we've

745
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,038
done our work on our own obviously but

746
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:36,640
like we have been pushing hard on this

747
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:38,079
so it's taken a long time to even get up

748
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,759
to this point to be able to say any of

749
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:41,839
these things positively

750
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:44,319
yeah and i mean when we say them

751
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:46,558
positively most of what we're saying is

752
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:48,240
generally accepted generally except in

753
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:50,319
fact for now like you said if there's

754
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,079
some old-timers or whatever with some

755
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:53,200
secret information out there that's not

756
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:55,199
well known

757
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,038
most of this history is oral

758
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,200
some of these old guys have beefs with

759
00:27:57,038 --> 00:28:01,519
one another some of them don't like one

760
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,600
another very much yeah have their own

761
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:05,359
egos and their own versions of of

762
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:08,719
history and events

763
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:10,079
um and so uh

764
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,000
see there's a guy right there that just

765
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:14,319
said is his 70 year old neighbor has had

766
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,440
nl2 since 93

767
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:19,678
um if that's the case

768
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,120
we would love to talk to you yeah

769
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,960
yeah right

770
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:25,359
because there could be pockets of these

771
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,840
things that survive

772
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:30,639
yeah the hard part now is that for a

773
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:33,759
long time nobody gave a [ __ ]

774
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:36,159
about these uh about these strains and

775
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:38,240
so the information was a little bit more

776
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,840
verifiable because there wasn't anybody

777
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,839
trying to claim rep

778
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:43,359
or trying to claim we have this joke we

779
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:46,158
call it pre-pre

780
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:47,599
um where now ancient old whatever has

781
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:50,159
come out of the woodwork

782
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:51,359
so it gets a lot harder to weed through

783
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,520
who has what

784
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:55,199
yeah and like i i was talking with

785
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:57,440
another gentleman that we were starting

786
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,960
an interview with um and he was very

787
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,640
important in the dutch seating and he

788
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,200
was talking about some of his old lines

789
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,520
possibly popping up in the us

790
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,519
and this is something that happens every

791
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:10,398
few years someone says i've got this

792
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:12,558
stash of xyz i've kept you know mason

793
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:15,278
jars full of every single one and done

794
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:17,359
reproduction since 80 something and it's

795
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:19,200
it's hard unless you have extensive

796
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:21,038
knowledge about these old lines and run

797
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,798
some how are you ever going to tell him

798
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:24,319
no that's not correct it's it's a hard

799
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:26,000
situation

800
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:28,240
yeah i mean there's a guy saying you you

801
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,159
know there's some old school growers

802
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,558
um there's pockets in america that

803
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:35,200
aren't on instagram that

804
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:38,639
aren't on on some of these never got on

805
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:41,120
the forums that live in police states um

806
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,240
that have kept their circles quite tight

807
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:44,479
um

808
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,558
they don't they might not even know how

809
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,919
rare or how cool

810
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:49,278
some of the stuff that's been within

811
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,759
their little circle that they've just

812
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:54,558
been growing and smoking on might be

813
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:56,879
you know so we still have hope every

814
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:58,639
time a [ __ ] artist comes up i'll

815
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,278
freely admit that there's a small part

816
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,520
of me that wishes it was true yeah right

817
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:05,919
i don't want it to be true i want all

818
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:08,558
the stories to be true i want every

819
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:11,440
ancient rare being imaginable

820
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:15,440
to be accessible yeah cuts and stuff

821
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:18,080
like yeah to pop up and be um

822
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,240
you know and be available to people

823
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:21,519
and sadly there's a lot of people out

824
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,880
there they're just trying to make a

825
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,759
quick buck

826
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,840
uh

827
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:27,278
and when you sell beans i mean think

828
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:28,319
about how many people have been selling

829
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:30,960
beans

830
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:33,918
of uh roadkill skunk for the last two or

831
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,480
three years now right yeah um but i

832
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:38,320
haven't seen any roadkill skunk flower

833
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,079
yeah it's hard it's hard to get finished

834
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:41,678
flower with roadkill skunk terps

835
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:43,199
everybody's figuring that out

836
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:45,440
you know and you can sell beans for

837
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,519
quite some time before nobody you know

838
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,360
and exactly take a while before they

839
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:51,759
realize that you're not finding roadkill

840
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:53,678
skunk exactly sell a lot of beans and

841
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:55,440
there's people that have dropped

842
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,840
thousands of dollars

843
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,240
of you know hopes and dreams

844
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:03,119
and spent months hunting and they get

845
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:05,839
some floral citrus skunk ones citrus

846
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:07,759
skunk one resold and skunk one

847
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:08,798
slight you know slight funk slight

848
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:13,519
whatever

849
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:16,879
not roadkill not clear skunk terps

850
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:19,359
so you know it's uh it's sad in that way

851
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,360
um you know people were asking some

852
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:23,839
other stuff and you know we got a lot to

853
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:25,199
cover so we'll we'll move on a bit but

854
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:30,000
to say

855
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:32,000
89 90 is when neville really established

856
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,679
most of the strains that kind of became

857
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,880
famous yes

858
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,798
yeah that's when they all started

859
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,480
popping up that's when they all started

860
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:40,639
popping up that's when he sort of

861
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,880
figured out what he had

862
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:46,640
what was consistent to breed with what

863
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:48,399
made sense what lines people liked um

864
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,840
you know he's have this running joke

865
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:52,319
that people would ask for the highest

866
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:54,240
level of quality imaginable and if he

867
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:55,839
sold them an awesome indica that was a

868
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,839
hybrid of two pure indicas and it

869
00:31:55,839 --> 00:32:00,240
yielded like [ __ ] they'd [ __ ] and [ __ ]

870
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:02,398
and moan and whine and complain because

871
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,880
they wanted the best possible and they

872
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:06,879
also wanted to crush yields yes so

873
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,799
that's always been a difficulty in in

874
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,320
cannabis

875
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:12,319
you know people want the best people

876
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:13,759
want the greatest terps

877
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:15,200
there's lots of people out there in

878
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:16,720
commercial world that don't want to grow

879
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,120
anything that takes longer than nine or

880
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,399
ten weeks yeah they don't be a pain to

881
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:22,798
trim

882
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:25,918
they want it to be larpy they don't want

883
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:28,960
to be finicky or a low heater

884
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:33,038
massive yielding frosty the highest

885
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:35,120
amount of chirps yeah everybody's 20 thc

886
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:36,879
i want the strongest most potent lead

887
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:38,879

00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:49,119
yeah but you know rarely does that occur

891
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:50,959
yeah same package sadly yeah

892
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:53,518
you know a lot of the a lot of the

893
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,319
famous strains that we all smoke

894
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:55,919
um

895
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:57,038
from a production standpoint are

896
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:59,919
annoying

897
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:02,000
yeah very much so especially in the last

898
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,159
decade or so it's gotten worse nobody

899
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,759
would ever pick to grow cookies no

900
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:07,600
nobody would ever pick the girl kush

901
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:10,158
where it's like ding ding ding ding ding

902
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:12,319
ding nugs here and there they don't hold

903
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,960
themselves up i mean if you were like a

904
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:17,038
commercial farmer in the real world

905
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,319
um you know they'd be looking for some

906
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:21,679
kind of like green crack blue dream

907
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:25,119
type structure

908
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:27,038
solid top to bottom buds easy to grow

909
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:28,798
fairly fast finishing

910
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:31,839
you know that's what from a production

911
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:34,480
standpoint uh and a happiness standpoint

912
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:37,119
that's what you want yeah but you know

913
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,960
um even sour diesel you know that yields

914
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:41,518
pretty well it takes a long time kind of

915
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,840
feathery makes a lot of bee buds if you

916
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,359
mess it up it can be really laffy

917
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:47,519
um you know

918
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:49,119
super tasty and it works really good

919
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:52,480
burns really nice

920
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:54,000
but it's not blue dream no it's not it's

921
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,599
not you know barry white or something

922
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,599
like that it's not something that that's

923
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:59,519
just covered in nubs

924
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:01,359
and so um

925
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,798
so yeah so uh

926
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:03,678
the uh

927
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:05,839
uh

928
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,038
maybe we should talk about so he created

929
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:08,878
all this stuff

930
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:10,079
neville was the largest there was really

931
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:11,440
only two

932
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:14,079
you know there's other people that will

933
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:16,240
claim to have seed banks yeah scentsy

934
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:18,399
seeds had a tiny seed bank

935
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:20,319
positronics had a small seedling there

936
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:22,159
was other seed banks in holland but

937
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,440
there was really only two seed and this

938
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,679
is really why we're spending so much

939
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,358
time talking about it is in the 80s

940
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,639
there was really only two seed banks

941
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:31,279
that were selling a lot of seed in

942
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,720
america in in amsterdam and it's selling

943
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,639
to america

944
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:36,878
and they were the first two

945
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,960
seed banks that really offered worldwide

946
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:41,279
sales to anybody that was willing to

947
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,159
come to holland and buy them or fill out

948
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,639
their

949
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:47,358
their mail order sheet and send them an

950
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:49,919
envelope with some money and a list yep

951
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:52,398
and that was super sativa seed club

952
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:54,719
uh and the seed bank which was neville

953
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:56,480
yes the tiva seed club uh started a

954
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:58,959
little bit after neville

955
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,800
um it had similar things to him it had

956
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,280
some of their own stuff

957
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,760
but neville was the he was the elephant

958
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,079
he was the big dog he was yeah

959
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,000
he was the he was the one selling the

960
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:12,240
vast majority of stuff that people in

961
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,559
america were buying from holland was

962
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:16,159
neville's yes and that really that's

963
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:18,078
really what makes him so important

964
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:20,078
because

965
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,920
the uh the seed game is super

966
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,800
diversified now

967
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,920
right

968
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,760
he basically almost had a monopoly yeah

969
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,440
and it's why all these strains that are

970
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,839
around today usually have something of

971
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,519
neville's in it if not both sides yeah

972
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:35,519
and so that there's a lot of there's a

973
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:38,079
lot of neville work in a lot of modern

974
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:39,920
strains yeah i'm simply because he was

975
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,200
the only game and he was one of the only

976
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,280
games in town

977
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:44,719
and tons and tons of people

978
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,720
got his stuff

979
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:49,358
and then they bred his stuff into stuff

980
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:51,919
they already had in america yeah and so

981
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:54,239
his stuff got blended in

982
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,639
and you know his stuff got super famous

983
00:35:54,239 --> 00:36:00,000
obviously the nl5 haze

984
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:01,679
became a phenomenon in new york

985
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,199
it started being great it started being

986
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:05,759
sold you know they call it the heist

987
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:08,559
haze you know the pith the church the

988
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,560
this the that the whatever it's kind of

989
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:14,078
a massive thing

990
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:17,599
um and the super skunk

993
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,119
um he's talked about how super skunk and

994
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:24,639

right yeah and that's sort of what uh

999
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:38,000

1000
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:40,639
is the final catalog of

1001
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,960
neville's ownership of the seed bank

1002
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:44,400
yeah i don't think i have that one here

1003
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,400

and he

1017
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:16,799
tried to breed the skunk out of it that

1018
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,000
is by his own quote

1019
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,480
right

1020
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,800
yes he did he has his own quote he was

1021
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,320
going for more of the citrus grapes

1022
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,400
sweet floral

1023
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,480
he liked those aromas he was going for

1024
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,838
bud structure and other things yeah he

1025
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:33,920
didn't like the rank skunk he tried to

1026
00:37:31,838 --> 00:37:36,078
uh this so i'll answer another question

1027
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,400
the silver pearl came out as a single

1028
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,599
strain i think in the last two years of

1029
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,200
the seed bank

1030

it's uh it's only pearl something

1034
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:57,920

1035
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:59,440
might be nl5 early pearl skunk one

1036

best pushes were kush iv and nl2

1091
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:46,320
do you know what year that one's in i

1092
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,119
was trying to show it but i can't find

1093
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,838
it

1094
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:51,760
i'm going to say that one's in here

1095
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:54,639
that one might be an 87.

1096
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,079
there's at least one of them in that 89

1097
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:58,400
talking about it i don't know how clear

1098
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,400
it is

1099
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,920
and he also offered skunk kush

1100
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,359
which was and so that's that's you know

1101
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,519
and then uh

1102
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:09,519
um

1103
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:11,440
so maybe

1104
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:12,318
are getting pretty in-depth here but

1105
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,200
yeah

1106
00:40:12,318 --> 00:40:15,679
maybe

1107
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:16,879
maybe we should talk about um

1108
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:19,199
his fame

1109
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,280
led to issues right yes let's get into

1110
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:23,759
that he's selling millions of dollars in

1111
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:25,680
seed to america yeah

1112
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,680
it's the reagan era and then the george

1113
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:28,719
bush era it's the height of the war on

1114
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:30,799
drugs

1115
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:32,078
large penalties weeds totally illegal

1116
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:36,079
everywhere

1117
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:39,519
um and there was a situation in which a

1118
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:41,920
hydro store got raided um from

1119
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:42,960
whatever reason some kind some kind of

1120
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,480
action

1121
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,800
and they discovered that this guy was

1122
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,119
supplying a bunch of gravel porsche

1123
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,680
and in that they found money

1124
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:54,720
and neville's catalog

1125
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:56,639
and they realized that uh

1126
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:58,480
they realized that he was selling

1127
00:40:56,639 --> 00:41:01,279
dollars in seed

1128
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,880
um to america and you notice in some of

1129
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,319
these back catalogs it always says that

1130
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,440
it's shipped from the u.s or like in the

1131
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:07,599
high times

1132
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,679
ads for devil's things that would always

1133
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:11,519
say ship from us

1134
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:13,358
well what's interesting about that is

1135
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:14,800
this isn't factual but i believe it to

1136
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:18,318
be true

1137
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,280
that neville i think had partners that

1138
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:22,880
he

1139
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:24,319
smuggled seeds into america yeah

1140
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,440
and then

1141
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:29,039
you would send neville money

1142
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,119
and then he would communicate what you

1143
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:33,279
needed and they would the seeds from

1144
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,640
within the u.s yeah i think he was

1145
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,240
pretty um

1146
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:37,598
he was transparent about that when it

1147
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:39,519
was going on

1148
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:41,280
and so as a result of that that meant

1149
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:43,838
that every seed batch didn't have to go

1150
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,160
through customs yes he just had to get

1151
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:47,679
it through customs occasionally

1152
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:49,920
and then he could sell it within the

1153
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:52,318
united states well you can imagine

1154
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:55,358
uh the dea and the government at the

1155
00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:57,759
time took a pretty uh poor view of that

1156
00:41:55,358 --> 00:41:59,199
aspect yeah right

1157
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,319
and so

1158
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:04,719
um operation green merchant happens

1159
00:42:02,318 --> 00:42:06,000
where they decide to raid

1160
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:07,118
um

1161
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,599
everyone

1162
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:11,838
every growth store in the united for the

1163
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:14,240
most part they rated the gross stores in

1164
00:42:11,838 --> 00:42:15,199
the united states they did a big push

1165
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:17,838
right

1166
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:19,759
and uh neville gets caught i believe in

1167
00:42:17,838 --> 00:42:22,239
australia yeah

1168
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,119
and he gets busted

1169
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:26,239
okay

1170
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:27,920
uh and he ends up spending it a good

1171
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:30,639
amount of time in jail

1172
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,400
better part of the year yeah

1173
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:35,118
um and so

1174
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,639
that you know we're not gonna this this

1175
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,960
this particular episode we're not gonna

1176
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:41,039
talk very much about sssc yeah we're

1177
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,280
gonna save that for a different time

1178
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:44,800
um but what that did

1179
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,920
is that sort of

1180
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,839
uh

1181
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:50,318
um

1182
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:52,639
led to a domino effect of sorts it had a

1183
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:56,000
domino effect of sorts uh

1184
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:56,879
super sativa seed club decided to stop

1185
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,880
um

1186
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,960
because they saw what was going on with

1187
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,960
neville and it was pretty serious

1188
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,559
neville was already in was obviously in

1189
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,000
jail

1190
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:08,480
and uh

1191
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,880
this gave an opportunity for others yeah

1192
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,800
who had seen how how

1193
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,920
neville and the super sativa seed club

1194
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,119
were doing

1195
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:19,599
right it left a void in amsterdam

1196
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:21,680
uh in holland it was still it was legal

1197
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:22,880
at that time obviously to produce seed

1198
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:24,159
for

1199
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,640
um

1200
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:28,719
to produce seed yeah they were the only

1201
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:30,799
places in in the world where it was

1202
00:43:28,719 --> 00:43:31,759
totally legal to produce cannabis seed

1203
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,560
yeah

1204
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,760
so

1205
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:37,599
uh neville was sitting in jail um he was

1206
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,599
fighting extradition

1207
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,720
they didn't want to extradite neville to

1208
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,920
america

1209
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:43,759
because

1210
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:46,079
um they wanted to put him in jail for

1211
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,079
life in prison yeah

1212
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:50,000
and australia and holland which he was a

1213
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:53,599
citizen of both didn't agree with him

1214
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,480
yeah so he was stuck in jail

1215
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:55,838
and

1216
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,159
he

1217
00:43:55,838 --> 00:43:58,159
um

1218
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,519
you know there was all of a sudden there

1219
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:04,160
was no seed banks yeah there was no

1220
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:06,480
speed banks left it caused a bunch

1221
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:09,039
it caused a bunch of ripple effects uh a

1222
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,159
whole bunch of growers in america got

1223
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:12,239
busted

1224
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:15,039
um due to their relationships with

1225
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:18,559
various uh hydro stores and stuff like

1226
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:20,480
that um you know uh greg seattle greg

1227
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:23,119
talked in his interview with matt

1228
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,358
about how by the late 80s in that era

1229
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:27,920
they had basically lost everything

1230
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:30,239
because of a series of rolling busts

1231
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:32,400
yeah uh their heavy presence they were

1232
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:33,838
really going after people electricity

1233
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,960
all this kind of stuff

1234
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:36,880
and so

1235
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:39,838
um

1236
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:42,800
sensi which was founded by ben and alan

1237
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:44,960
drunkers they saw an opportunity

1238
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,318
and they offered to bail neville out of

1239
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,119
jail

1240
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:49,039
and

1241
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:51,519
uh give him money to help him fight his

1242
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:54,239
situation as long as he sold him their

1243
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:56,880
company yes

1244
00:44:54,239 --> 00:44:57,838
and that was the invention of scentsy

1245
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,800
so

1246
00:44:57,838 --> 00:45:00,400
crazy

1247
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:04,079
that was the death

1248
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:06,079
of the seed bank speed bank yeah and

1249
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:08,640
scentsy uh

1250
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:11,599
since he absorbed him

1251
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:14,799
and all of a sudden went from a nobody

1252
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:18,880
to the biggest game in town that's right

1253
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:20,240
um and they bought uh they they bought

1254
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,240
his feedback

1255
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:24,159
right yeah so all of a sudden they start

1256
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:25,759
offering um

1257
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:28,480
you know and we actually

1258
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:30,560
the scentsy 91 seed bank catalog is one

1259
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:33,519
of the rarest catalogs

1260
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:35,199
um because it only was out for the

1261
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:38,960
filling out for one year and it shows

1262
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:41,279
the merger of the seed bank with scentsy

1263
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,318
and they have a much much more limited

1264
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,560
catalog

1265
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:46,079
than what they offered in the future and

1266
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:48,159
a much more limited one than neville was

1267
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,200
currently offering but by the time he

1268
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:50,159
split

1269
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:51,118
so

1270
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:54,639
um

1271
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:55,760
yeah and so as a result of that uh sadly

1272
00:45:54,639 --> 00:45:58,159
for neville

1273
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:00,480
neville went from being the owner of the

1274
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:02,000
largest most successful seed bank in the

1275
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:05,599
world

1276
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,599
to the head breeder

1277
00:46:05,838 --> 00:46:12,719
of scentsy yeah he lost his company

1278
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:16,480
he lost his self-control

1279
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:20,159
the government hated him yeah uh and he

1280
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:22,960
was trapped in holland for a long time

1281
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:25,598
because the the america wanted to come

1282
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:27,519
steal him yeah and guide him to america

1283
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:30,079
and have him face charges of life in

1284
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:32,639
prison for seed sales yes

1285
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:34,560
pollen refused to extradite him

1286
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:36,879
because since seed sales were legal and

1287
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:38,480
he was a citizen of holland

1288
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,000
they were not going to extradite one of

1289
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,559
their citizens for doing something that

1290
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,079
was legal in their own country yeah them

1291
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:45,679
to go to life in prison in some other

1292
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:47,039
country in some other country he is not

1293
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:49,440
a citizen out of it yeah and some other

1294
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:50,639
country he's not a citizen so

1295
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,159
he

1296
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:54,559
had his freedom

1297
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:58,000
but he was stuck in holland

1298
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:59,599
the dea interpol was after his ass yeah

1299
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,400
and he lost

1300
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:03,440
the biggest most most uh famous seed

1301
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,200
company

1302
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,679
and had to give it to ben and allen

1303
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:09,439
drunkers and work for them yeah and

1304
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:10,399

1305
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,519

someone that wasn't even close to the

1341
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,160
level

1342
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:40,879
he since he wasn't even close to where

1343
00:48:38,159 --> 00:48:43,358
super sativa seed club or the company

1344
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:45,838
they were noble compared to that

1345
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:47,759
and so you're sitting in jail

1346
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:49,119
and your options are keep sitting in

1347
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:52,240
jail

1348
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:53,599
or have these sort of uh greasy dutch

1349
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:56,078
businessmen

1350
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:58,079
uh offer to get you out and get you home

1351
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:00,000
and give you some money and buy your

1352
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:00,960
company yeah it sounds real good at the

1353
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,079
time

1354
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:06,159
sure you know he chose the get out of

1355
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:07,119
jail yeah

1356
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:08,879
you know

1357
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:12,240
uh card

1358
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,240
but then he lost control

1359
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:15,119
yeah

1360
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:17,119
so um

1361
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,880
you know that was sort of the start of

1362
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:21,200
you know by the time that

1363
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:23,039
uh matt matt can speak to this a little

1364
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:24,960
bit he got to communicate quite a bit

1365
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:25,920
with neville i i got to meet him a few

1366
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,240
times

1367
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:31,039
i've chatted with him a number of times

1368
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:33,598
matt had a much longer back and forth

1369
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:36,558
with him uh much later in his career

1370
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:38,160
that sounded super dirty and

1371
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:39,920
well i just mean that you know i know

1372
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:41,838
what you mean they communicated a lot

1373
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:44,720
more over a lot more months a lot more

1374
00:49:41,838 --> 00:49:46,400
directly yeah then you know i met him

1375
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:49,118
through other people i used to go to

1376
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:51,280
holland quite a bit to get seeds

1377
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:53,599
and i ended up meeting him a few times i

1378
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,800
was a young guy it's not like i had some

1379
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:57,760
kind of uh

1380
00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:00,720
you know massive uh information dumped

1381
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:02,559
from neville to myself you know

1382
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:04,318
i wasn't interviewing him or anything

1383
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:05,680
like that i was a little shell shocked

1384
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:08,159
uh

1385
00:50:05,679 --> 00:50:10,960
meeting somebody like that so

1386
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:12,558
um but you know matt can attest that uh

1387
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,920
that was sort of the start of neville's

1388
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:14,720
bitterness

1389
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,760
yeah

1390
00:50:14,719 --> 00:50:16,639
yeah uh

1391
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:19,839
you know

1392
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:20,879
things neville paid more of a price than

1393
00:50:19,838 --> 00:50:22,078
most

1394
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,200
yeah he did

1395
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,760
or

1396
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:28,480
uh spreading seeds for overgrowing the

1397
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:31,520
government for that kind of thing

1398
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:34,559
um and if you look like he was owed

1399
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:36,480
the most for doing this and so you know

1400
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:38,960
he felt like most people

1401
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:42,159
lived off the back of his work yeah and

1402
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:44,079
and it's not necessarily incorrect

1403
00:50:42,159 --> 00:50:47,039
and he he never

1404
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:49,280
yeah he never got um he never he never

1405
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:51,039
forgot to reap the benefits

1406
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,839
as much

1407
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:54,719
of

1408
00:50:51,838 --> 00:50:56,400
his work as other people did um his life

1409
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:57,838
got burned down on any number of

1410
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,000
different occasions

1411
00:50:57,838 --> 00:51:02,639
yeah to be said you know this is kind of

1412
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,400
a personal part not um

1413
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:05,679
not uh

1414
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,760
not the greatest thing to talk about

1415
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:08,399
with neville but he was a herald addict

1416
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,319
yeah

1417
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,639
that's actually the reason why he went

1418
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:15,599
from australia to holland

1419
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:18,318
was uh you know you know he was getting

1420
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:21,200
he was uh heavily addicted in the early

1421
00:51:18,318 --> 00:51:22,558
80s he was getting treatment

1422
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:23,358
and so i'm sure

1423
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:25,519
um

1424
00:51:23,358 --> 00:51:28,078
that some of his life issues were

1425
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:29,759
certainly self-inflicted sure

1426
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:31,519
because when you struggle with addiction

1427
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,720
like that your life is

1428
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:34,559
um

1429
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:36,799
i mean your life is tough

1430
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:39,680
tell me about it

1431
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:41,839
you you have ups and downs sure uh you

1432
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:43,598
have issues you know you

1433
00:51:41,838 --> 00:51:46,480
he probably wasn't the easiest person to

1434
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:49,280
deal with he probably had moods

1435
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:51,039
major mood swings sure major mood swings

1436
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:53,040
you know better days than others better

1437
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:54,079
months than others type of thing

1438
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:56,558
um

1439
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:58,079
you know and then on top of that like

1440
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:59,040
you know a lot of times really talented

1441
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:01,280
people

1442
00:51:59,039 --> 00:52:02,159
um sometimes they're pain in the ass

1443
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,240
yeah

1444
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:05,920
yeah intelligent people talented people

1445
00:52:04,239 --> 00:52:06,959
can be very hard to communicate with

1446
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,880
sure

1447
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:11,039
um but what i will say about neville

1448
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:14,318
that was different than most people

1449
00:52:11,039 --> 00:52:15,519
is that most dutch which is some which

1450
00:52:14,318 --> 00:52:16,960
is different than a little bit in

1451
00:52:15,519 --> 00:52:19,039
america certainly there's lots of people

1452
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:21,519
in america they're just like this yeah

1453
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:24,159
but um in

1454
00:52:21,519 --> 00:52:26,800
he was probably one of the only dutch

1455
00:52:24,159 --> 00:52:29,118
that really loved the plant

1456
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:31,519
and really did things as far as the

1457
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:34,318
famous dutch i'm not like a big general

1458
00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:36,480
statement about everybody but of course

1459
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:38,239
as far as like the you know

1460
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:41,039
the dutch are pretty famous for being

1461
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:42,719
extremely business oriented correct

1462
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:45,279
they'll tell you the truth as much as it

1463
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:46,639
helps their bottom line yeah and if it

1464
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,559
doesn't help their bottom line they

1465
00:52:46,639 --> 00:52:50,400
could give a [ __ ] yeah

1466
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:52,800
so neville was extremely open about

1467
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,639
lines and strains and what he used and

1468
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:57,039
how he did it what he did it with and

1469
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:58,960
where he got it from yeah there's nobody

1470
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:02,079
in the dutch scene that we know

1471
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:04,240
more about who he got strains from

1472
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:06,400
and what he did to create strains all

1473
00:53:04,239 --> 00:53:09,279
everything yeah a lot of other seed

1474
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:11,519
banks in holland it's a mystery

1475
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,559
they have zero interest in telling you

1476
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:14,639
yeah

1477
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:16,559
they've had decades to tell you

1478
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:19,118
they don't care yeah there are a few

1479
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:20,000
that might be popping up that that uh

1480
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:21,838
are

1481
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,239
are pretty interesting that's why i

1482
00:53:21,838 --> 00:53:26,960
wanted to make a qualifier because he's

1483
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:29,118
by no means is the only one yeah but

1484
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:31,760
there are plenty of you know and that's

1485
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:34,640
the sad thing is that um you know

1486
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:36,800
uh the drunkers are still alive correct

1487
00:53:34,639 --> 00:53:39,679
yeah but they're a terrible interview

1488
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:41,680
yeah and they don't care about history

1489
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:43,838
no that's not their interest at all they

1490
00:53:41,679 --> 00:53:46,159
will tell you to this day that they have

1491
00:53:43,838 --> 00:53:48,078
every original plant known to man

1492
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:49,679
they breed with all the same plants they

1493
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:52,079
still make their own seeds they still

1494
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:53,838
make their own seeds even been verified

1495
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:55,839
by any number of different sources that

1496
00:53:53,838 --> 00:53:57,599
they outsourced to spain some time ago

1497
00:53:55,838 --> 00:54:00,239
yes yeah

1498
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:03,200
and that they lost a lot of plants

1499
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:05,679
um but you can't get actual history out

1500
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:07,279
of them correct yeah

1501
00:54:05,679 --> 00:54:08,239
they don't it's hard

1502
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,559
neville

1503
00:54:08,239 --> 00:54:12,399
neville cared while he had the seed bank

1504
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:14,319
he gave a bunch of information he was

1505
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,838
honest about when he lost certain

1506
00:54:14,318 --> 00:54:18,800
strains

1507
00:54:15,838 --> 00:54:20,318
popped up on mr nice a long time later

1508
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,960
in like oh nine

1509
00:54:20,318 --> 00:54:26,000
uh 10 11 era he answered a lot of

1510
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:28,880
questions pretty directly yeah um the

1511
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,119
drunkers and scentsy are a black hole

1512
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:33,440
yeah they don't tell you [ __ ] major

1513
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:35,838
black hole they don't care and i don't

1514
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:37,358
know that they even know [ __ ] to tell um

1515
00:54:35,838 --> 00:54:38,798
i think there's some obviously they do

1516
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:40,400
and they were part of but i don't know

1517
00:54:38,798 --> 00:54:41,599
that they would have any kind of

1518
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,519
knowledge about any of the breeding

1519
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:45,838
going on at scentsy

1520
00:54:43,519 --> 00:54:47,679
and so you know this is um

1521
00:54:45,838 --> 00:54:50,078
so so that's kind of

1522
00:54:47,679 --> 00:54:51,519
i guess we kind of segued into scentsy

1523
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:53,760
yeah

1524
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:55,519
so headed into senti we're headed into

1525
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,680
scentsy so neville you know neville had

1526
00:54:55,519 --> 00:55:00,159
the seed bank most famous seed bank

1527
00:54:57,679 --> 00:55:02,159
created a lot of the most famous strains

1528
00:55:00,159 --> 00:55:04,318
gets busted spends much time in jail

1529
00:55:02,159 --> 00:55:05,920
gets bailed out loses his company now

1530
00:55:04,318 --> 00:55:06,719
he's head breeder

1531
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:08,880
yeah

1532
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:10,239
um and so it took some time to

1533
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,280
transition

1534
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:13,199
yeah so

1535
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:15,119
matt and i have spent a bunch of time

1536
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:17,838
analyzing this

1537
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:19,119
and um

1538
00:55:17,838 --> 00:55:20,400
i don't know the best way to put it but

1539
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:22,880
scentsy

1540
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,920
there was certain famous things like nl5

1541
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,960
haze

1542
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,480
and

1543
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,079
uh super skunk

1544
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:31,119
that they left alone

1545
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:32,798
because the game already had such great

1546
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:35,440
uh

1547
00:55:32,798 --> 00:55:37,039
that's that uh

1548
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,559
it had already been marketed under that

1549
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:40,880
name and was already so successful that

1550
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:42,240
they didn't have a need to change

1551
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:44,079
there's actually some pretty good

1552
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:46,479
comments happening i'll i'll get to them

1553
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:48,960
in a minute maybe we can even [ __ ] you

1554
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:50,960
can't see stuff so yeah um

1555
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,798
so anyway well

1556
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:54,480
this is this is super long-winded but it

1557
00:55:52,798 --> 00:55:55,920
is pretty important and the reason why

1558
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,960
it's so important

1559
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,680
is that

1560
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:01,599
the a lot a lot a lot of our famous

1561
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:03,358
strains and our named elite cuts from

1562
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:05,119
the 90s and a lot of the things that

1563
00:56:03,358 --> 00:56:06,480
went into the famous cuts that we all

1564
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:09,519
work with today

1565
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:11,920
came directly from neville's work yeah

1566
00:56:09,519 --> 00:56:16,880
because he was the biggest game in town

1567
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:19,280
um probably from 1985 to the late 90s

1568
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:21,200
he was the biggest force

1569
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:23,280
in cannabis

1570
00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:25,199
and so as a result of that

1571
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,880
the tons of people in america were

1572
00:56:25,199 --> 00:56:29,039
getting his seeds

1573
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,480
and um

1574
00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:32,079
and

1575
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,440
okay so there's there's stuff coming in

1576
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:35,599
that people are saying that's actually

1577
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:36,720
pretty cool so we'll start chatting

1578
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:37,519
about that

1579
00:56:36,719 --> 00:56:40,959
so

1580
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:43,679
uh so since he buys the seed bank

1581
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:45,280
and they in my opinion they wanted to

1582
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:47,279
obscure

1583
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:51,119
exactly how much

1584
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:52,960
of the seed bank they had taken yeah and

1585
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:54,798
they wanted to trade so like i said

1586
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:56,559
super skunk and l5 haze some of the

1587
00:56:54,798 --> 00:56:59,119
stuff that was super famous already they

1588
00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:01,359
left alone but they were the first

1589
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:02,480
company to start trademarking names in

1590
00:57:01,358 --> 00:57:05,358
cannabis

1591
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:07,760
which still goes on today and sucks yeah

1592
00:57:05,358 --> 00:57:10,838
there's still battles going on

1593
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:13,359
about about that and so

1594
00:57:10,838 --> 00:57:15,679
uh the i see some stuff people are

1595
00:57:13,358 --> 00:57:17,838
talking about early shiva shanti had

1596
00:57:15,679 --> 00:57:19,679
garlic butt in it anyone remember the

1597
00:57:17,838 --> 00:57:20,960
early shiva shanty that threw garlic

1598
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:22,719
phenos

1599
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,838
uh that type i have one of the catalogs

1600
00:57:22,719 --> 00:57:26,558
that actually talks about that

1601
00:57:23,838 --> 00:57:27,838
specifically that very first catalog

1602
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:29,839
remember i was just reading it to you

1603
00:57:27,838 --> 00:57:30,719
yeah so that's pretty funny in the sense

1604
00:57:29,838 --> 00:57:33,119
that

1605
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:34,399
my opinion is is that shiva shanti is

1606
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:35,200
garlic bud

1607
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,599
yeah

1608
00:57:35,199 --> 00:57:39,679
one of them is one of them at one point

1609
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:41,920
was garlic butter

1610
00:57:39,679 --> 00:57:43,679
and so i'll try not to get too deep into

1611
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:45,599
it because it's kind of a it's it's kind

1612
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:47,759
of a nerdy subject but

1613
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:50,240
if you look at the seed bank catalogs

1614
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:51,839
and you look at the scentsy catalogs

1615
00:57:50,239 --> 00:57:54,959
um

1616
00:57:51,838 --> 00:57:57,279
sensei ended up using a lot of

1617
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:59,358
neville's stock photos

1618
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:01,040
yes a lot of his verbiage and his

1619
00:57:59,358 --> 00:58:03,440
descriptions

1620
00:58:01,039 --> 00:58:05,679
just much shorter versions of them in

1621
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:07,599
his catalogue

1622
00:58:05,679 --> 00:58:11,039
so

1623
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:11,838
they she garlic bud disappears

1624
00:58:11,039 --> 00:58:14,079
yes

1625
00:58:11,838 --> 00:58:16,078
but it becomes shiva shanty she was

1626
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:18,640
chanting one and it sounds like a hybrid

1627
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:20,318
of becomes shivashanti too right and so

1628
00:58:18,639 --> 00:58:22,639
they use the same they use a lot of the

1629
00:58:20,318 --> 00:58:24,960
same verbiage in describing shiva shanti

1630
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:26,798
as neville's descriptions of garlic bud

1631
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:28,240
and the same picture they use the exact

1632
00:58:26,798 --> 00:58:29,039
same photo

1633
00:58:28,239 --> 00:58:30,078
okay

1634
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:31,920
um

1635
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:34,559
another one that we could talk about is

1636
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:38,400
nl5 skunk one

1637
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:40,640
becomes uh shiva skunk yep

1638
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:43,200
and that's actually the only one that

1639
00:58:40,639 --> 00:58:45,118
they change the name that in the scentsy

1640
00:58:43,199 --> 00:58:47,759
description they actually say it's

1641
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:49,760
actually nl5 skunk one yeah but they

1642
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,119
still leave that in the description it's

1643
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,880
literally in the description they took

1644
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:55,599
it from nl5 skunk one they called it

1645
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:57,119
shiva they called it shiva yeah this is

1646
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:59,680
something that people will probably find

1647
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:02,160
extremely interesting

1648
00:58:59,679 --> 00:59:03,199
um or maybe maybe not but

1649
00:59:02,159 --> 00:59:06,000
uh

1650
00:59:03,199 --> 00:59:08,239
neville's nl2 f3

1651
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,480
he always referred to going back early

1652
00:59:08,239 --> 00:59:12,479
as the nl2 any description you can find

1653
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,440
in the seed bank catalog of any hybrids

1654
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,119
he made

1655
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:19,838
not only does he call it nl2 but he

1656
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:23,119
always calls it a hindu kush type yeah

1657
00:59:19,838 --> 00:59:23,920
so when northern lights gets ported over

1658
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:25,200
from

1659
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:27,280
the seed bank

1660
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:30,239
northern lights

1661
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:31,280
one f3 be completely northern lights

1662
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:33,039
yeah

1663
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:35,920
right um

1664
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:38,558
and you can actually tell because they

1665
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:40,960
in the scentsy catalog they list

1666
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:41,839
northern lights as a three-time indica

1667
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,720
winner

1668
00:59:41,838 --> 00:59:44,880
yep

1669
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:48,078
88 89 90

1670
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:52,000
and you can look it up and nl1 was the

1671
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:52,798
indica winner in 88 89 90. yeah

1672
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,798
and

1673
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:57,759
a little tail

1674
00:59:54,798 --> 00:59:59,199
nl2 becomes hindu kush

1675
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:02,000
yes

1676
00:59:59,199 --> 01:00:04,239
so since he changed the name

1677
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:07,440
uh and

1678
01:00:04,239 --> 01:00:10,959
and nlt used the same picture they use

1679
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:13,599
similar descriptions you can go back um

1680
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:16,240
even even straight up in certain stuff

1681
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:18,240
like they they sold a skunk kush

1682
01:00:16,239 --> 01:00:21,118
yeah and they called it

1683
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:22,159
skunk one by their best hindu kush

1684
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:24,079
yeah

1685
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:25,759
neville sells the skunk kush at the seed

1686
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:28,880
bank and he calls it

1687
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:30,880
nl2 by skunk one yeah they called the

1688
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:33,119
same name they have the same description

1689
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:37,519
except for they just call it hindu kush

1690
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:39,680
yeah right so nl2 doesn't disappear

1691
01:00:37,519 --> 01:00:42,000
it just gets a different name yeah it's

1692
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:44,639
absorbed differently l2 is that there

1693
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,679
was another seed company that stole an

1694
01:00:44,639 --> 01:00:48,318
l2

1695
01:00:45,679 --> 01:00:50,078
and they sold nlp it was dutch passion

1696
01:00:48,318 --> 01:00:51,279
and they spent an l2 under the name

1697
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:54,720
oasis

1698
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:56,798
so nl2 sort of drops off as a name

1699
01:00:54,719 --> 01:00:58,959
but it lives on in other names and

1700
01:00:56,798 --> 01:01:00,559
that's sort of part of

1701
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:02,559
uh

1702
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:03,519
that's sort of the start of

1703
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:05,119
um

1704
01:01:03,519 --> 01:01:07,759
the rename game

1705
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:09,599
yeah this is all the real early rename

1706
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:11,040
game so i'll just read off some renames

1707
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:13,680
for you yeah you guys are listening here

1708
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:15,679
the renames uh i gotta look away at the

1709
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:17,919
camera so i can actually like see this

1710
01:01:15,679 --> 01:01:20,879
little chart i got going on but okay

1711
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:23,519
neville called it silver pearl by hayes

1712
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:24,880
uh scentsy calls it silver haze

1713
01:01:23,519 --> 01:01:27,920
yeah um

1714
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:30,798
garlic bud becomes shiva shanty

1715
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:33,838
uh like i just said nl1 becomes northern

1716
01:01:30,798 --> 01:01:35,039
lights and l2 becomes hindu kush

1717
01:01:33,838 --> 01:01:37,119
big skunk

1718
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:40,000
which was big bud by skunk one at the

1719
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:44,240
same time simply becomes scentsy skunk

1720
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:46,719
that's right hash plant by nl1 by swazi

1721
01:01:44,239 --> 01:01:48,959
becomes african queen

1722
01:01:46,719 --> 01:01:52,078
that's my other nickname that a lot of

1723
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:55,039
people call me african queen big bud by

1724
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:57,680
nl1 simply becomes big bud

1725
01:01:55,039 --> 01:02:00,960
hawaiian indica by nl1 simply becomes

1726
01:01:57,679 --> 01:02:03,759
hawaiian indica yep um it was really

1727
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:05,119
only a few of the most famous like skunk

1728
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:09,119
one

1729
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:10,240
uh you know nl5 haze super skunk

1730
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:12,480
that uh

1731
01:02:10,239 --> 01:02:15,038
that kept the name yeah they changed

1732
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:16,960
everything else but they left us clues

1733
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:18,880
because they were [ __ ] lazy yeah out

1734
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:21,199
of laziness pure laziness they use the

1735
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:24,160
same pictures and they use a lot of the

1736
01:02:21,199 --> 01:02:26,879
same verbiage yeah and they even kept

1737
01:02:24,159 --> 01:02:29,519
the same yields and harvest harvest

1738
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:31,280
times and other data that neville

1739
01:02:29,519 --> 01:02:33,599
included yeah

1740
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:35,200
um so they made it

1741
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:37,838
so they made it uh and then they

1742
01:02:35,199 --> 01:02:39,439
trademarked those things yes

1743
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:41,679
so then all of a sudden they own the

1744
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:43,679
trademarks yep

1745
01:02:41,679 --> 01:02:46,719
you know you're right so shiva like i

1746
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:48,558
said shivashanti it is garlic bud yeah

1747
01:02:46,719 --> 01:02:51,358
it uses the same verbiage in the

1748
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:53,280
description it uses the exact same photo

1749
01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:54,639
from neville catalogs

1750
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:56,640
it is

1751
01:02:54,639 --> 01:02:58,558
it is garlic but i had that pulled out

1752
01:02:56,639 --> 01:02:59,920
earlier just to show to the

1753
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:01,359
the tube side by side but i can't

1754
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:03,838
remember where i put it

1755
01:03:01,358 --> 01:03:04,798
it's yeah we don't i mean it's it's it's

1756
01:03:03,838 --> 01:03:06,639
we could

1757
01:03:04,798 --> 01:03:08,239
we could uh we could go we could go in

1758
01:03:06,639 --> 01:03:10,159
depth i'm trying to keep it relatively

1759
01:03:08,239 --> 01:03:11,358
brief but the point is

1760
01:03:10,159 --> 01:03:13,679
is that

1761
01:03:11,358 --> 01:03:15,759
scentsy was trying to obscure just how

1762
01:03:13,679 --> 01:03:18,399
much they went from a little company

1763
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:20,559
that had barely anything yeah to the

1764
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:22,318
biggest company

1765
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:24,240
um

1766
01:03:22,318 --> 01:03:26,719
the biggest company in holland

1767
01:03:24,239 --> 01:03:28,318
and um

1768
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:31,279
the timeline we're talking right now

1769
01:03:28,318 --> 01:03:34,239
this is 1991. yeah

1770
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:36,240
uh this is this is early to mid 90s mr

1771
01:03:34,239 --> 01:03:38,000
nicest i'm just answering a question mr

1772
01:03:36,239 --> 01:03:41,038
nice is way way later we probably won't

1773
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:43,760
even get to that part of cannabis today

1774
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:45,599
because that didn't start early 2000s

1775
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:48,000
yeah so

1776
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:49,838
neville's working as the head breeder

1777
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,920
for um

1778
01:03:49,838 --> 01:03:54,159
for scentsy and we're not going to talk

1779
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:56,000
about these companies very much but it's

1780
01:03:54,159 --> 01:03:57,038
probably good to mention

1781
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,000
that

1782
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:02,319
neville not only spawned scentsy seeds

1783
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:04,000
but everybody working for neville

1784
01:04:02,318 --> 01:04:06,639
got their own ideas

1785
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,440
and he spawned a lot yeah

1786
01:04:06,639 --> 01:04:09,118
so

1787
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:11,358
i don't know if uh

1788
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:13,680
um well yeah somebody just posted

1789
01:04:11,358 --> 01:04:16,159
shivashanti is not garlic now

1790
01:04:13,679 --> 01:04:18,719
uh it was sweet we'll get to why things

1791
01:04:16,159 --> 01:04:19,920
aren't the way they are anymore yeah

1792
01:04:18,719 --> 01:04:22,480
but

1793
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:23,440
adam dunn from th seeds

1794
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,240
um

1795
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:27,519
uh

1796
01:04:24,239 --> 01:04:30,000
how you pronounce his last name

1797
01:04:27,519 --> 01:04:33,838
adam adam from th seeds

1798
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:37,119
uh simon who is famous for serious seeds

1799
01:04:33,838 --> 01:04:41,038
yeah tony who ended up making sag martha

1800
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:41,838
they all worked at scentsy under neville

1801
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:43,039
yeah

1802
01:04:41,838 --> 01:04:44,400
and they

1803
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:47,680
after leaving

1804
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:51,280
uh tony and simon started cerebral seeds

1805
01:04:47,679 --> 01:04:53,038
in 1994 for one year and then split tony

1806
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:55,920
made sag martha

1807
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:58,079
simon made um sirius

1808
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:59,920
and um

1809
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:00,798
you know and uh

1810
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:03,920
uh

1811
01:05:00,798 --> 01:05:05,358
let's see and adam like i said made thc

1812
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:07,280
yeah

1813
01:05:05,358 --> 01:05:08,798
um you know so neville

1814
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:11,200
working with neville

1815
01:05:08,798 --> 01:05:13,358
you know neville sort of put

1816
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:15,598
all four of those companies on the map

1817
01:05:13,358 --> 01:05:17,759
yep those companies would have existed

1818
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:19,920
if they hadn't been able to work either

1819
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:23,039
for neville under neville

1820
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:24,159
uh scentsy bought neville um

1821
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:26,960
so

1822
01:05:24,159 --> 01:05:29,038
you know and i think that for most of

1823
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:30,720
neville's time at scentsy

1824
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:31,920
he was breeding and doing a bunch of

1825
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:34,318
projects

1826
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:36,559
but uh you look at the catalogs that

1827
01:05:34,318 --> 01:05:38,480
come out from those 90s in those early

1828
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:39,839
to mid 90s period

1829
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:42,400
and

1830
01:05:39,838 --> 01:05:44,078
it's basically the seed bank catalog

1831
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,280
yeah

1832
01:05:44,079 --> 01:05:46,640
basically

1833
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:48,880
you know there was a few things that

1834
01:05:46,639 --> 01:05:50,879
neville got rid of in at the later era

1835
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:52,480
of the seed bank like he didn't really

1836
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:55,440
like afghani one

1837
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:56,960
yeah he sold it for the first few years

1838
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:59,280
of the seed bank and then he and then he

1839
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:01,440
eliminated it since he brought it back

1840
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:03,519
um there was a couple other strains that

1841
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:04,720
uh that popped up here and there but for

1842
01:06:03,519 --> 01:06:05,679
the most part

1843
01:06:04,719 --> 01:06:09,038
um

1844
01:06:05,679 --> 01:06:11,279
scentsy was the seed bank continued

1845
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:13,839
and uh they

1846
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:15,359
they absorbed all of his history

1847
01:06:13,838 --> 01:06:18,000
you know they started claiming her from

1848
01:06:15,358 --> 01:06:20,400
85 they started oh yeah the originator

1849
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:22,880
of all these various strains they sort

1850
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:26,240
of like you know since they bought it

1851
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:27,760
they bought all the history too um

1852
01:06:26,239 --> 01:06:32,239
and all that

1853
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:33,760
and so neville was working for some uh

1854
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:36,879
some dutch businessmen that he didn't

1855
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:36,880
really like yeah

1856
01:06:37,199 --> 01:06:39,919
how it ends up

1857
01:06:40,159 --> 01:06:43,279
yeah so

1858
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:45,920
um

1859
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:47,680
so he worked for scentsy and we can

1860
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:49,519
since nothing much changed from the seed

1861
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:51,919
bank to scentsy

1862
01:06:49,519 --> 01:06:53,838
um we don't really have to talk a bunch

1863
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:56,240
about that except for

1864
01:06:53,838 --> 01:06:58,480
uh you know i started going to amsterdam

1865
01:06:56,239 --> 01:07:01,038
in uh 1994.

1866
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:02,559
there's some very famous people on ig

1867
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:05,440
and stuff that started going in the

1868
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:07,119
early 90s and mid 90s and stuff and

1869
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:09,358
scentsy was one of the primary places

1870
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:10,160
where we got things yeah

1871
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:12,960
so

1872
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:14,798
you know um scentsy was really

1873
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:16,480
neville yeah

1874
01:07:14,798 --> 01:07:18,559
it was all his stuff

1875
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:20,960
he was their head breeder still

1876
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:22,720
um and uh

1877
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:25,039
you know and so

1878
01:07:22,719 --> 01:07:27,919
you know neville from

1879
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:31,520
you know 85 to 90 at the seed bank and

1880
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:32,720
then from 91 to 95 at scentsy

1881
01:07:31,519 --> 01:07:36,079
um

1882
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:39,439
you know a massive amount of super skunk

1883
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:41,119
and nl5 haze all the nl5 haze you know

1884
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:43,920
of the cuban black

1885
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:47,280
the piff the heights haze the various

1886
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:50,798
the miami that all came from that era

1887
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:53,119
yeah of uh you know nl5 haze seed

1888
01:07:50,798 --> 01:07:56,000
um and he

1889
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:58,318
uh you know they lost the g13 cutting by

1890
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:00,079
neville's own admission in about 93 was

1891
01:07:58,318 --> 01:08:03,679
one of the ones that got sick and died

1892
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:05,039
early yeah lost the nl5 haze

1893
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:07,838
cutting

1894
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:09,760
their 94.95

1895
01:08:07,838 --> 01:08:13,199
it's one of the reasons why

1896
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:14,799
all the best phenos of nl5 hay

1897
01:08:13,199 --> 01:08:15,598
in uh

1898
01:08:14,798 --> 01:08:18,319
uh

1899
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:21,920
america were found sort of between 89

1900
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:24,798
and 95 yeah um and then once the once

1901
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:27,119
the mom was lost uh people didn't really

1902
01:08:24,798 --> 01:08:29,838
find the same quality i don't think i

1903
01:08:27,119 --> 01:08:31,358
think all the name deletes of nl5 hayes

1904
01:08:29,838 --> 01:08:33,679
of which there's probably eight or

1905
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:35,838
twelve yeah there's a lot

1906
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:36,880
they all come from that six year period

1907
01:08:35,838 --> 01:08:38,079
yeah

1908
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:39,440
i don't think there's any that come

1909
01:08:38,079 --> 01:08:41,119
later than that

1910
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:43,519
i doubt it yeah i haven't seen any good

1911
01:08:41,119 --> 01:08:46,479
nl5 haze cuttings in a long time

1912
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:47,920
they know that era and so

1913
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:49,678
um

1914
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:52,000
you know uh

1915
01:08:49,679 --> 01:08:53,920
so well maybe we'll tie a bow on the

1916
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,640
scentsy thing because we've we've kind

1917
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:57,679
of covered most of it yeah

1918
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:59,679
the

1919
01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:02,079
uh the last famous thing that never

1920
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:03,440
neville did there was he was working on

1921
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:04,318
this hybrid

1922
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:07,039
um

1923
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:10,319
which was nl5 haze

1924
01:09:07,039 --> 01:09:11,920
uh or people call it c5 now it's still

1925
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:13,920
alive he had this

1926
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:16,079
very famous mother cut that was sold in

1927
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:18,480
all the coffee shops it was one of the

1928
01:09:16,079 --> 01:09:21,278
two of his two favorite

1929
01:09:18,479 --> 01:09:23,358
c5 cuttings um

1930
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:24,960
and he was trying to play around and

1931
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:26,719
make a poly hybrid

1932
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:28,000
and he was playing with crossing it to

1933
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:29,439
skunk hayes

1934
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,279
yeah and he wasn't really happy with

1935
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:34,879
where it was yet

1936
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:37,120
but ben and alan drunkers being uh

1937
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:40,000
businessmen they had spent a bunch of

1938
01:09:37,119 --> 01:09:41,439
money and they were sponsoring the 95

1939
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,359
cannabis cup

1940
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:45,599
and the cannabis cup was all about jack

1941
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:46,960
herrera and it was all about his life

1942
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:50,079
and his history

1943
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:52,079
and his contributions to cannabis

1944
01:09:50,079 --> 01:09:54,158
and so ben went to

1945
01:09:52,079 --> 01:09:56,479
neville and said hey

1946
01:09:54,158 --> 01:09:59,439
we want to release a jack herrera

1947
01:09:56,479 --> 01:10:01,759
yep i have something that we drop at the

1948
01:09:59,439 --> 01:10:03,119
cannabis cup wouldn't that be a great

1949
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:05,600
marketing tool

1950
01:10:03,119 --> 01:10:07,760
yeah he's the number one

1951
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:10,480
sponsor of this cup we're spending a

1952
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:12,159
bunch of money it's all about jack yeah

1953
01:10:10,479 --> 01:10:13,039
so it was ready

1954
01:10:12,158 --> 01:10:15,599
um

1955
01:10:13,039 --> 01:10:16,960
as far as neville was concerned but he

1956
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:20,560
released

1957
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:23,119
nl5 haze by skunk haze and they called

1958
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:24,880
it jack herrer yeah i doubt we need to

1959
01:10:23,119 --> 01:10:26,399
spend very much time talking about jack

1960
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:28,960
herrera

1961
01:10:26,399 --> 01:10:28,960
because it's

1962
01:10:29,279 --> 01:10:31,920
super fast jack

1963
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:33,600
it's jack

1964
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:35,679
jack

1965
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:37,520
it led to cindy 99

1966
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:40,079
you know it led to

1967
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:42,400
a whole bunch it was big yielding it was

1968
01:10:40,079 --> 01:10:43,439
fast it was chunky it was a trimmer's

1969
01:10:42,399 --> 01:10:48,479
dream

1970
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:50,559
uh it was it smelled like uh terpenoline

1971
01:10:48,479 --> 01:10:53,839
uh it's

1972
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:57,199
people have a a love and hate a lot of

1973
01:10:53,840 --> 01:11:00,400
people have dislike for that aroma

1974
01:10:57,198 --> 01:11:01,359
the jack aroma became infamous

1975
01:11:00,399 --> 01:11:02,639
for

1976
01:11:01,359 --> 01:11:04,399
uh

1977
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:05,600
you know being something that repelled

1978
01:11:04,399 --> 01:11:07,119
people

1979
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:09,039
yep you know

1980
01:11:07,119 --> 01:11:11,198
and stuff like jack chirps and someone

1981
01:11:09,039 --> 01:11:13,439
said yup jack turps jack people not

1982
01:11:11,198 --> 01:11:15,039
genuinely know what genuinely speaking

1983
01:11:13,439 --> 01:11:16,639
know what uh they're generally speaking

1984
01:11:15,039 --> 01:11:18,719
know what jack terps are

1985
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:20,560
i i think the first time that people

1986
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:22,960
ever heard about the word terpetyline

1987
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:25,360
long before that terp was identified

1988
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:28,000
yeah people called it jack terps yep

1989
01:11:25,359 --> 01:11:30,960
jack turps back jack was a super high

1990
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:32,880
yielding uh you know strain a lot of

1991
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:34,640
people grew it and that was people's

1992
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:36,079
first experience with extreme

1993
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:39,840
terpenoline

1994
01:11:36,079 --> 01:11:41,119
um and it bred

1995
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:43,600
very

1996
01:11:41,119 --> 01:11:45,840
matt can talk about trying to get

1997
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:48,000
interesting phenos out of terpenoline

1998
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:50,079
dominant strains that don't give you

1999
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,479
terpenoline

2000
01:11:50,079 --> 01:11:54,079
it's pretty tough it is very tough to to

2001
01:11:52,479 --> 01:11:56,000
breed with terpenoline anything and try

2002
01:11:54,079 --> 01:11:58,640
to infuse that into your life

2003
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:01,198
jack terps trainwreck terps yeah

2004
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:03,039
a lot of breeders have have thrown their

2005
01:12:01,198 --> 01:12:05,039
hat in the ring and tried to breed with

2006
01:12:03,039 --> 01:12:07,600
a lot because it's such a vigorous

2007
01:12:05,039 --> 01:12:10,158
powerful high-yielding

2008
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:12,640
fun plant yeah and

2009
01:12:10,158 --> 01:12:14,879
it's real hard to find a non-terpenoline

2010
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:16,800
dominant pheno that works

2011
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:18,960
i think um in in modern times though

2012
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:20,400
people are finding out that terpenoline

2013
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:22,560
is actually really good in extracts it

2014
01:12:20,399 --> 01:12:24,000
makes them very flavorful so there's

2015
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:25,679
been a little bit of a renaissance for

2016
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,679
the terpenelene

2017
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:30,000
queens out there

2018
01:12:27,679 --> 01:12:32,000
so maybe um maybe since you can't see

2019
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,920
anything maybe we'll pause

2020
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:36,000
you want to answer some questions yeah

2021
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:37,440
you go ahead and figure out what uh

2022
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,079
questions we need to answer and let's do

2023
01:12:37,439 --> 01:12:39,919
it

2024
01:12:38,079 --> 01:12:41,760
so the number one voted thing and we

2025
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:43,920
talked about it a little was why was

2026
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:45,440
sam's never able to produce a haze to

2027
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:48,079
rival neville's

2028
01:12:45,439 --> 01:12:51,119
what was the outstanding difference

2029
01:12:48,079 --> 01:12:54,000
that's the number one biggest question

2030
01:12:51,119 --> 01:12:55,359
yeah i think i think you you you've uh

2031
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,359
answered this before when i was talking

2032
01:12:55,359 --> 01:12:59,519
with you about it so go ahead

2033
01:12:57,359 --> 01:13:02,000
um i actually think i mentioned it

2034
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,840
mostly a little earlier in the program

2035
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:06,079
but

2036
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:10,000
um we don't know why sam

2037
01:13:06,079 --> 01:13:11,679
you know sam sold hayes to positronics

2038
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:15,279
if you bought haze from the flying

2039
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:18,480
dutchman that was sam's haze he sold

2040
01:13:15,279 --> 01:13:21,198
clothes of wholesale seed to any number

2041
01:13:18,479 --> 01:13:23,039
of brokers in holland and then they sold

2042
01:13:21,198 --> 01:13:25,119
it through their seed banks

2043
01:13:23,039 --> 01:13:27,198
and for whatever reason

2044
01:13:25,119 --> 01:13:29,119
everybody in holland wanted neville's

2045
01:13:27,198 --> 01:13:31,519
haze hybrids

2046
01:13:29,119 --> 01:13:33,920
and nobody found anything that rivaled

2047
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:34,880
what neville was able to find

2048
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:36,480
um

2049
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:38,000
you know and a lot of times

2050
01:13:36,479 --> 01:13:41,519
uh

2051
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:43,039
caleb uh csi myself matt others we

2052
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:45,760
always talk about like the proof is in

2053
01:13:43,039 --> 01:13:47,198
the plants yeah you know people lie

2054
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:49,199
plants don't

2055
01:13:47,198 --> 01:13:50,479
uh and whatever reason maybe it was

2056
01:13:49,198 --> 01:13:53,359
sheer luck

2057
01:13:50,479 --> 01:13:56,559
uh maybe it was neville's story is true

2058
01:13:53,359 --> 01:13:59,439
and he did get earlier haze than than

2059
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:01,120
sam produced later maybe

2060
01:13:59,439 --> 01:14:04,559
has been open

2061
01:14:01,119 --> 01:14:06,000
which is something that i found um

2062
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:09,440
hard to believe to be honest as a

2063
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:11,359
breeder is he loves hayes

2064
01:14:09,439 --> 01:14:14,479
and uh

2065
01:14:11,359 --> 01:14:16,639
he never ever made any selections

2066
01:14:14,479 --> 01:14:18,959
and he just he just said all i did was

2067
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:20,320
open pollinated to keep it as wide as

2068
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:21,439
possible for

2069
01:14:20,319 --> 01:14:23,599
30 years

2070
01:14:21,439 --> 01:14:25,599
yeah he didn't do any selection work any

2071
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:28,159
line work on it i

2072
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:30,640
as a as a breeder

2073
01:14:28,158 --> 01:14:34,639
never ever playing around with your

2074
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:37,840
favorite finos from your favorite line

2075
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:39,840
seems really unusual to me yeah

2076
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:41,520
yeah it is odd it's like me never

2077
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:42,880
[ __ ] with blueberry

2078
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:45,120
you know yeah

2079
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:47,279
but that's what sam says yeah and it's

2080
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:49,119
also possible so we could talk about

2081
01:14:47,279 --> 01:14:51,039
this for a second sometimes when you

2082
01:14:49,119 --> 01:14:52,800
open pollinate that's great because you

2083
01:14:51,039 --> 01:14:54,560
open it up wider

2084
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:57,600
but that means it might be a hell of a

2085
01:14:54,560 --> 01:15:00,719
lot more effort to dig for every stuff

2086
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:02,880
that you want and so sam by repeatedly

2087
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:04,158
open pollinating it and never making any

2088
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:06,800
selections

2089
01:15:04,158 --> 01:15:07,920
um he might have open pollinated his way

2090
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:10,480
into

2091
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:12,158
jungle weed or hemp or

2092
01:15:10,479 --> 01:15:14,158
he might have lost a bunch of the

2093
01:15:12,158 --> 01:15:15,519
quality that led people to love hazel in

2094
01:15:14,158 --> 01:15:17,279
the first place

2095
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:18,480
well you look at um like tom hill's

2096
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:20,158
hayes

2097
01:15:18,479 --> 01:15:22,399
he would even say you need at least 10

2098
01:15:20,158 --> 01:15:23,759
packs you know 100 seeds to find a

2099
01:15:22,399 --> 01:15:24,559
single keeper

2100
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:27,360
so

2101
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:29,440
the the the repeatedly opening probably

2102
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:31,198
didn't help anything because obviously

2103
01:15:29,439 --> 01:15:33,198
there's so many phenotypes even in

2104
01:15:31,198 --> 01:15:34,559
positronics haze that's been worked

2105
01:15:33,198 --> 01:15:37,119
there's so many phenotypes that you need

2106
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:39,360
to pop a hundred to find a single one

2107
01:15:37,119 --> 01:15:41,359
yeah i mean samus claimed that everyone

2108
01:15:39,359 --> 01:15:43,039
got the exact same haze and no one got

2109
01:15:41,359 --> 01:15:45,198
any different yeah

2110
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:46,640
i find that a bit hard to believe

2111
01:15:45,198 --> 01:15:48,158
because there's lots of people that

2112
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:50,000
bought flying dutchman hayes there's

2113
01:15:48,158 --> 01:15:52,000
lots of people that bought pozzi haze

2114
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,679
there's tons of people that bought uh

2115
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,319
tom hill hayes

2116
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:59,440
uh hayes has been sold

2117
01:15:56,319 --> 01:16:01,279
for decades in a wide variety of places

2118
01:15:59,439 --> 01:16:04,000
and

2119
01:16:01,279 --> 01:16:07,359
all the elites that people hoard

2120
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:09,840
come from neville's stuff yeah

2121
01:16:07,359 --> 01:16:11,439
for whatever reason yeah and you would

2122
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:13,279
think that we have a lot of quality

2123
01:16:11,439 --> 01:16:16,000
afghans out there and you'd be able to

2124
01:16:13,279 --> 01:16:17,279
cross some pure haze to some other good

2125
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:21,119
afghans

2126
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:24,559
and get more results to neville um but

2127
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:26,079
the g13 haze and the nl5 haze and so on

2128
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:29,280
and so forth no one's been able to

2129
01:16:26,079 --> 01:16:31,679
replicate yep those ones are better

2130
01:16:29,279 --> 01:16:34,158
and never did also have the uh theory

2131
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:35,600
that he talked about much later on that

2132
01:16:34,158 --> 01:16:37,119
he only believed in breeding with hayes

2133
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:39,199
males

2134
01:16:37,119 --> 01:16:40,960
that that was the key to finding the the

2135
01:16:39,198 --> 01:16:42,960
the holy grail haze was through haze

2136
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:44,319
males breeding and not using them as

2137
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:46,000
females

2138
01:16:44,319 --> 01:16:48,880
you know some of that might be that he

2139
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:51,279
lost the two best phenos of females in

2140
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:52,719
the 80s could be some of it yeah

2141
01:16:51,279 --> 01:16:54,479
that's what he ended up doing i would

2142
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:57,119
also say too that

2143
01:16:54,479 --> 01:16:59,198
collecting pollen from some 18 or

2144
01:16:57,119 --> 01:17:01,119
20-week haze male

2145
01:16:59,198 --> 01:17:03,599
and then dusting it on

2146
01:17:01,119 --> 01:17:07,119
other plants when appropriate is

2147
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:10,000
probably a lot easier of a breeder

2148
01:17:07,119 --> 01:17:12,158
aspect than trying to wait for a 18 or

2149
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,719
20 week female to be the appropriate

2150
01:17:12,158 --> 01:17:16,158
time to pollinate it that's a good point

2151
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:17,760
so there's something to be said for the

2152
01:17:16,158 --> 01:17:18,799
fact that you could collect a bunch of

2153
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:21,039
pollen

2154
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:22,880
and then dump it on stuff later

2155
01:17:21,039 --> 01:17:24,399
and yeah be much harder to breed with

2156
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:26,640
the girls

2157
01:17:24,399 --> 01:17:28,799
yeah so

2158
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:30,560
there's another question

2159
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:32,400
me and jean recently mentioned that you

2160
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:33,920
and he have been doing some research and

2161
01:17:32,399 --> 01:17:36,000
it looked like hindu kush could most

2162
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:37,840
likely be a renamed nl

2163
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,520
i think we chatted about that already at

2164
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:42,159
length yep

2165
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:44,000
i i definitely believe that the hindu

2166
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:45,198
kush that was sold at scentsy is just

2167
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,520
nl2

2168
01:17:45,198 --> 01:17:50,158
yeah um

2169
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:52,000
if i had any dealings with gypsy

2170
01:17:50,158 --> 01:17:54,799
nope

2171
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:57,279
not i almost did and um

2172
01:17:54,800 --> 01:18:00,320
and it was just a really bad proposal

2173
01:17:57,279 --> 01:18:02,800
for me to front a bunch of seeds he said

2174
01:18:00,319 --> 01:18:03,599
that he would sit on the money

2175
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:05,920
for

2176
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:07,280
i want to say six months to a year

2177
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:09,920
at which point

2178
01:18:07,279 --> 01:18:10,840
he would pay you out mostly in credit

2179
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:13,679
store

2180
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:15,440
credit so you would wait like almost a

2181
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:17,440
year to be able to use anything from

2182
01:18:15,439 --> 01:18:19,599
anything it was stupid it was no way in

2183
01:18:17,439 --> 01:18:22,158
[ __ ] hell well we'll have podcasts

2184
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:24,719
that deal with gypsies era of sea bags

2185
01:18:22,158 --> 01:18:26,238
at some other time

2186
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:27,920
maybe not necessarily a ton of him

2187
01:18:26,238 --> 01:18:29,919
specifically but he's from a different

2188
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:32,319
era than we're discussing today sure

2189
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:34,000
sure um outside of the work that neville

2190
01:18:32,319 --> 01:18:36,238
brought to the world who outside the

2191
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,920
original big names contributed most new

2192
01:18:36,238 --> 01:18:39,439
strains worth something to the culture

2193
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:41,359
early on

2194
01:18:39,439 --> 01:18:44,000
that's a pretty good question see yeah

2195
01:18:41,359 --> 01:18:46,559
it is i've mentioned some of before

2196
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,679
um i'll just associate some names with

2197
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:50,000
strains

2198
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:52,399
uh sam skunk man brought

2199
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:56,319
hayes and skunk one

2200
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:58,639
to europe uh or popularized it to people

2201
01:18:56,319 --> 01:18:59,599
uh jim ortega who's a very mysterious

2202
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:02,800
character

2203
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:04,640
bra hawaiian indica garlic bud

2204
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:07,679
uh maple leaf indica

2205
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:09,920
and kush for to neville those were all

2206
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:12,800
used extensively in projects and so

2207
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:14,399
became very famous building blocks

2208
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:16,960
uh mel frank

2209
01:19:14,399 --> 01:19:19,759
uh who's still quite well known

2210
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:20,840
he contributed the afghani one and the

2211
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:23,679
durbin

2212
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:27,679
poison to things

2213
01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:29,199
uh i don't know jorge cervantes uh

2214
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:31,679
i don't think he directly contributed

2215
01:19:29,198 --> 01:19:34,960
anything but he did make the links he he

2216
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:36,800
certainly connected neville with

2217
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:38,960
growers in oregon and washington that

2218
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:40,560
led to the hash plant in g13 which

2219
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:42,560
obviously entered into a pretty

2220
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:46,560
legendary status

2221
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:48,400
um rob clark who wrote marijuana botany

2222
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:51,840
hashish and some other really important

2223
01:19:48,399 --> 01:19:54,238
cannabis books he contributed a bunch of

2224
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:57,199
you know california orange

2225
01:19:54,238 --> 01:19:59,198
various mexicans various sativa crosses

2226
01:19:57,198 --> 01:20:00,879
uh he's certainly brought early girl

2227
01:19:59,198 --> 01:20:03,759
early pearl yeah

2228
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:05,279
type of stuff that's all credited to him

2229
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:08,320
um

2230
01:20:05,279 --> 01:20:10,079
i'm trying to think of

2231
01:20:08,319 --> 01:20:11,359
you know that's sort of those that those

2232
01:20:10,079 --> 01:20:13,039
names right there are sort of the

2233
01:20:11,359 --> 01:20:14,880
backbone

2234
01:20:13,039 --> 01:20:17,519
and the nl guys yeah

2235
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:19,520
the seattle greg certainly yeah

2236
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:22,320
nl and the nl group from the pacific

2237
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:24,159
northwest they contributed obviously all

2238
01:20:22,319 --> 01:20:26,479
the nl lines

2239
01:20:24,158 --> 01:20:28,000
and so um there's a number of people we

2240
01:20:26,479 --> 01:20:29,359
don't know who they are

2241
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,880
but those guys are sort of the

2242
01:20:29,359 --> 01:20:33,439
foundational

2243
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:35,760
um people that brought a lot of stuff

2244
01:20:33,439 --> 01:20:37,439
that ended up not only getting brought

2245
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:38,159
over there but ended up getting used a

2246
01:20:37,439 --> 01:20:41,279
lot

2247
01:20:38,158 --> 01:20:42,638
yeah and into a lot and don downs for

2248
01:20:41,279 --> 01:20:45,759
nl2

2249
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:47,679
specifically i believe that was his yeah

2250
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:50,159
yeah i mean there was a guy named herbie

2251
01:20:47,679 --> 01:20:52,480
that contributed the nl5

2252
01:20:50,158 --> 01:20:54,960
um you know i'm sure behind all these

2253
01:20:52,479 --> 01:20:56,238
famous names are just like a lot of

2254
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:57,119
things there's probably a group of

2255
01:20:56,238 --> 01:20:58,959
people

2256
01:20:57,119 --> 01:21:00,559
uh or good friends and stuff that

2257
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:03,679
contributed various things that their

2258
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:04,960
names have been lost to time yeah

2259
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:05,679
you know

2260
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:09,439
if

2261
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:12,800
not so dog and matt could turn back time

2262
01:21:09,439 --> 01:21:12,799
what hack would you buy

2263
01:21:13,039 --> 01:21:17,039
well

2264
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:18,719
you know uh

2265
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:19,840
i would buy everything from the seed

2266
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:21,279
bank

2267
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:23,840
everything literally everything you

2268
01:21:21,279 --> 01:21:25,439
could i would buy hundreds of seeds of

2269
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:27,920
everything that i could all the durbin

2270
01:21:25,439 --> 01:21:30,238
all the skunk one all the nl5 haze the

2271
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:33,039
app the maple leaf mix

2272
01:21:30,238 --> 01:21:35,119
um a lot of these things we talk about

2273
01:21:33,039 --> 01:21:36,960
um but you know neville was one of the

2274
01:21:35,119 --> 01:21:39,279
few people that got to run through

2275
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:41,600
hundreds or thousands of even

2276
01:21:39,279 --> 01:21:42,960
of these seeds and really see what was

2277
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:46,880
in there

2278
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:48,319
we talked about the famous phenos but um

2279
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:50,239
you know

2280
01:21:48,319 --> 01:21:52,719
uh we were really young

2281
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:55,759
when these things were out there

2282
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:57,600
i was like six

2283
01:21:55,760 --> 01:22:00,639
a little older than you but even still

2284
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:02,880
like i said i was i was only 18 in 1994

2285
01:22:00,639 --> 01:22:04,639
when i started going so i was even sort

2286
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:07,359
of catching the tail end of certain

2287
01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:09,920
things yeah

2288
01:22:07,359 --> 01:22:10,799
let's see the next question was afghan

2289
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:12,639
tea

2290
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:14,239
what's known about it the strains it was

2291
01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:16,400
used in

2292
01:22:14,238 --> 01:22:19,039
geographically what part of afghanistan

2293
01:22:16,399 --> 01:22:20,079
did it come from via who et cetera et

2294
01:22:19,039 --> 01:22:21,198
cetera

2295
01:22:20,079 --> 01:22:23,359
we don't know where it came i'm gonna

2296
01:22:21,198 --> 01:22:25,198
preface this i'm gonna preface this all

2297
01:22:23,359 --> 01:22:27,198
these people

2298
01:22:25,198 --> 01:22:28,960
all these people talking about roadkill

2299
01:22:27,198 --> 01:22:31,119
skunk and all the other stuff i

2300
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:34,000
sincerely believe in and just from the

2301
01:22:31,119 --> 01:22:37,279
work with uh even the heirloom afghani

2302
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:39,279
the uh later sours the [ __ ] super

2303
01:22:37,279 --> 01:22:40,639
skunk and diesel all that i sincerely

2304
01:22:39,279 --> 01:22:41,840
believe that's the direction to work

2305
01:22:40,639 --> 01:22:43,840
there are all these people chasing

2306
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:46,159
different directions i think it's fair

2307
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:47,600
to to put it out there so everybody's on

2308
01:22:46,158 --> 01:22:49,198
even playing field that's probably the

2309
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:51,199
direction i'd look

2310
01:22:49,198 --> 01:22:53,919
so um

2311
01:22:51,198 --> 01:22:56,000
you know uh the maple leaf we don't we

2312
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:58,000
don't know anything about jim ortega we

2313
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:00,000
don't know where any of the strains that

2314
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:02,880
he got came from

2315
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:05,840
zero documented anything about he's

2316
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:09,600
still alive yeah so it's possible that

2317
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:12,000
he could um come out and tell some stuff

2318
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:14,159
but it is a mystery we know

2319
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,800
we'd love to have him on we know we know

2320
01:23:14,158 --> 01:23:19,359
the story of his work basically as soon

2321
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:21,279
as he started trading the neville yeah

2322
01:23:19,359 --> 01:23:22,158
that's when he pops up

2323
01:23:21,279 --> 01:23:23,519
and

2324
01:23:22,158 --> 01:23:25,279
you know the

2325
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:26,480
um we can talk a little bit about the

2326
01:23:25,279 --> 01:23:28,399
maple leaf

2327
01:23:26,479 --> 01:23:30,158
so the maple leaf neville's talked about

2328
01:23:28,399 --> 01:23:31,759
extensively

2329
01:23:30,158 --> 01:23:33,519
uh when he first started growing it out

2330
01:23:31,760 --> 01:23:35,520
he started getting some sweet big bud

2331
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:38,159
types

2332
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:39,920
and then he started growing more of it

2333
01:23:38,158 --> 01:23:43,359
out and then he found some more like

2334
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:46,960
hash plant types some dark hashy

2335
01:23:43,359 --> 01:23:49,119
thick types he called those types ortega

2336
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:50,399
and then he started growing more out and

2337
01:23:49,119 --> 01:23:52,719
then he eventually found what he

2338
01:23:50,399 --> 01:23:55,439
considered two skunk archetypes

2339
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:56,800
which he called afghan tea and afghan s

2340
01:23:55,439 --> 01:23:58,238
and and it's important again because

2341
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:00,000
when most people hear skunk they think

2342
01:23:58,238 --> 01:24:02,879
skunk one he wasn't referring to skunk

2343
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,399
one types in this afghani no he was kind

2344
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:06,560
of a little bit of the structure a

2345
01:24:04,399 --> 01:24:08,479
little bit of the nose bit of the look

2346
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:10,080
that type of thing and what he said

2347
01:24:08,479 --> 01:24:11,919
about it is that

2348
01:24:10,079 --> 01:24:14,158
so obviously the

2349
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:16,079
the maple leaf was kind of a

2350
01:24:14,158 --> 01:24:18,638
hodgepodge of different phenos that

2351
01:24:16,079 --> 01:24:20,238
popped out of indica but what he found

2352
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:22,960
is if you took a big bud type and you

2353
01:24:20,238 --> 01:24:25,359
bred with it the maple leaf big bud type

2354
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:27,600
bred big bud like yeah you took an

2355
01:24:25,359 --> 01:24:29,679
ortega type the hash plant type and you

2356
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:31,440
bred with it it sort of ended up being

2357
01:24:29,679 --> 01:24:34,079
hash plants so they kind of bred true to

2358
01:24:31,439 --> 01:24:37,678
type yeah when they popped up if you

2359
01:24:34,079 --> 01:24:40,158
bred with the afghan tea or afghan s it

2360
01:24:37,679 --> 01:24:41,840
also breeded true so the t

2361
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:44,799
is pretty famous

2362
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:46,480
uh in the sense that it is the mom

2363
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:48,960
of super skunk

2364
01:24:46,479 --> 01:24:50,479
uh he claims it's what put the funk in

2365
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:52,880
super skunk

2366
01:24:50,479 --> 01:24:54,638
it's what crossing it back to its asking

2367
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:58,000
you know to an afghan

2368
01:24:54,639 --> 01:25:00,319
the afghan t brought out the the rank

2369
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:03,039
yeah it took a it took a kind of a sweet

2370
01:25:00,319 --> 01:25:04,399
floral skunk and made it wreak

2371
01:25:03,039 --> 01:25:06,880
yeah

2372
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:08,238
and so uh afghan tea is incredibly

2373
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:09,119
famous

2374
01:25:08,238 --> 01:25:11,039
um

2375
01:25:09,119 --> 01:25:12,880
but it's probably the least well known

2376
01:25:11,039 --> 01:25:15,198
thing we're going to talk about tonight

2377
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:17,359
as well as being incredibly famous it's

2378
01:25:15,198 --> 01:25:19,119
the least well-known but it's the mother

2379
01:25:17,359 --> 01:25:21,519
of one of the most famous strains out

2380
01:25:19,119 --> 01:25:23,279
there and possibly

2381
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:24,880
the reason why that strain was so hunted

2382
01:25:23,279 --> 01:25:26,639
nowadays

2383
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:28,960
yeah super skunk is probably one of the

2384
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:30,079
most well-known cannabis strains in the

2385
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:33,439
world

2386
01:25:30,079 --> 01:25:34,559
uh and he says that that's what made it

2387
01:25:33,439 --> 01:25:35,359
super

2388
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:38,719
yep

2389
01:25:35,359 --> 01:25:40,960
reading the afghan tea um afghan tea

2390
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:44,158
also crossed well with haze

2391
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:46,960
and there's a thing called afghan haze

2392
01:25:44,158 --> 01:25:48,799
and uh that's supposed to be

2393
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:53,119
a uh

2394
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:53,119
a half a maple leaf by hay c

2395
01:25:53,359 --> 01:25:58,238
hard to verify obviously if that's the

2396
01:25:55,600 --> 01:26:00,480
case but uh we have documentation from

2397
01:25:58,238 --> 01:26:04,000
neville that made super strong and it

2398
01:26:00,479 --> 01:26:05,119
and it crossed great with hasty yeah

2399
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,119
um

2400
01:26:05,119 --> 01:26:09,920
so that's kind of that

2401
01:26:07,119 --> 01:26:11,920
um there's some other stuff

2402
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:13,520
that i just answered the jim ortega

2403
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:15,440
question on a different one there's some

2404
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:16,719
mendo perp stuff

2405
01:26:15,439 --> 01:26:18,479
i don't know if

2406
01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:20,800
it's pretty wide ranging

2407
01:26:18,479 --> 01:26:23,678
we discussed garlic bud pretty good

2408
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:25,600
we discussed hindu kush the friesland

2409
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:28,158
and scentsy star and stuff like that

2410
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:30,639
we'll get to on a different episode uh

2411
01:26:28,158 --> 01:26:32,079
we'll certainly talk about those a

2412
01:26:30,639 --> 01:26:33,840
little bit more

2413
01:26:32,079 --> 01:26:34,960
um

2414
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:36,960
you know

2415
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:39,198
uh where they like to have been coming

2416
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:40,560

89 there was not no uh there was a

2420
01:26:47,359 --> 01:26:54,399
scentsy didn't have nl5 because in 89

2421
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:56,639
the seed bank was still owned by neville

2422
01:26:54,399 --> 01:26:58,879
and there was never a pure nl5 line

2423
01:26:56,639 --> 01:27:02,560
offered as far as i know and there also

2424
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:03,840

uh like i said jim ortega is still alive

2439
01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:41,679
he could maybe one day expound upon that

2440
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:43,760
if he likes yeah a lot of rumor about it

2441
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:46,399
there's rumor that the clone might exist

2442
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:49,039
there's rumor that the clone is uh

2443
01:27:46,399 --> 01:27:52,079
is not it and it's uh it's ignite pure

2444

kush it's a cure a pure kush variant

2445
01:27:52,079 --> 01:27:56,238
yeah a bubba it's an l2 type variant

2446
01:27:55,198 --> 01:27:57,759
yeah

2447
01:27:56,238 --> 01:27:58,718
on that level

2448
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:00,800
um

2449
01:27:58,719 --> 01:28:03,039
i got this guy said i got to try a maple

2450
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:05,279
leaf from an old timer in george georgia

2451
01:28:03,039 --> 01:28:08,560
unbelievable flavor almost like dr

2452
01:28:05,279 --> 01:28:08,559
pepper meets roadkill

2453
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:14,639
that sounds

2454
01:28:11,198 --> 01:28:17,119
good yeah that sounds delicious um

2455
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:18,319
when did the silver pearl that pip works

2456
01:28:17,119 --> 01:28:19,359
come out

2457
01:28:18,319 --> 01:28:21,679
um

2458
01:28:19,359 --> 01:28:23,920
i think we talked here earlier

2459
01:28:21,679 --> 01:28:27,840
the silver pearl started being offered

2460
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:31,279
by neville at the seed bank around 88 89

2461
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:32,960
it was offered 88 89 90.

2462
01:28:31,279 --> 01:28:35,920
it was one of the strains that got

2463
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:37,760
offered at scentsy later on as well

2464
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:39,679
so it popped up

2465
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:42,320
um

2466
01:28:39,679 --> 01:28:44,960

yeah

2472
01:28:54,079 --> 01:28:58,559
that's a whole subject could be a whole

2473
01:28:56,158 --> 01:29:01,039
podcast in itself so to speak with all

2474
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:02,480
the rumors and accusations and there's a

2475
01:29:01,039 --> 01:29:03,600
lot of people that believe one way

2476
01:29:02,479 --> 01:29:04,879
there's a lot of people that believe

2477
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:08,960
another way

2478
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:10,800
um that's a pretty in-depth one

2479
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:12,399
as far as sam goes a lot of people do

2480
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:14,400
say that there is something to do with

2481
01:29:12,399 --> 01:29:16,399
federal informants and stuff i've looked

2482
01:29:14,399 --> 01:29:18,719
up extensively i've never seen a damn

2483
01:29:16,399 --> 01:29:20,638
thing come to life for any proof of any

2484
01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:22,560
of that but i will say neville told me

2485
01:29:20,639 --> 01:29:24,800
specifically that he said yes everybody

2486
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:27,440
knew sam and everybody knew his dea

2487
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:29,199
handler that walked around with them but

2488
01:29:27,439 --> 01:29:30,638
neville also

2489
01:29:29,198 --> 01:29:32,319
during that time neville was telling me

2490
01:29:30,639 --> 01:29:34,239
that him and sam were [ __ ] making

2491
01:29:32,319 --> 01:29:36,559
video games back and forth at each other

2492
01:29:34,238 --> 01:29:39,599
so i don't know how uh reliable that

2493
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:41,520
information is yeah uh sam and neville

2494
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:43,760
had famous beef

2495
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:45,280
coming from neville's bust dude those

2496
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:46,800
kung fu

2497
01:29:45,279 --> 01:29:48,399
dub over

2498
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:50,960
video memes that they would send back

2499
01:29:48,399 --> 01:29:52,879
and forth at each other in 2009 2010

2500
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:55,600
they were i wish someone still had them

2501
01:29:52,880 --> 01:30:00,239
they were [ __ ] hilarious

2502
01:29:55,600 --> 01:30:02,560
um so uh you know there was um

2503
01:30:00,238 --> 01:30:04,319
there was uh

2504
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:06,400
yeah um

2505
01:30:04,319 --> 01:30:08,639
so there's a friend of ours that

2506
01:30:06,399 --> 01:30:11,759
mentioned black domina we can touch on

2507
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:12,639
that real quick sure um

2508
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:15,199
so

2509
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:18,239
black domino was something that you know

2510
01:30:15,198 --> 01:30:19,919
in in neville's neville seed bank era

2511
01:30:18,238 --> 01:30:22,158
the vast majority of the stuff that we

2512
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:23,760
were talking about in the 80s

2513
01:30:22,158 --> 01:30:25,519
and uh and this is kind of this is kind

2514
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:28,639
of the same with the super saiyan to eva

2515
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:31,120
seed club is they were basically all f1s

2516
01:30:28,639 --> 01:30:32,480
or very simple hybrids yeah

2517
01:30:31,119 --> 01:30:34,000
uh that's kind of what they were doing

2518
01:30:32,479 --> 01:30:35,439
they were they were crossing pure

2519
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,359
strains together

2520
01:30:35,439 --> 01:30:39,039
they were releasing lines of pure

2521
01:30:37,359 --> 01:30:40,799
strains they had gotten

2522
01:30:39,039 --> 01:30:43,279
and they were taking these pure strains

2523
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:45,440
like skunk and northern lights or haze

2524
01:30:43,279 --> 01:30:47,039
and skunk or you know and northern

2525
01:30:45,439 --> 01:30:50,719
lights and haze and they were crossing

2526
01:30:47,039 --> 01:30:52,399
them yeah the 90s uh the the poly hybrid

2527
01:30:50,719 --> 01:30:54,319
terms started to pop

2528
01:30:52,399 --> 01:30:55,759
where you started getting more complex

2529
01:30:54,319 --> 01:30:56,799
breeding coming in

2530
01:30:55,760 --> 01:31:01,199
so

2531
01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:03,039
black domina was a cross of four indicas

2532
01:31:01,198 --> 01:31:05,439
uh that neville that they released that

2533
01:31:03,039 --> 01:31:07,920
neville bred while he was at scentsy and

2534
01:31:05,439 --> 01:31:08,879
the mother was consistent the mother was

2535
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:11,600
a

2536
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:13,920
one of his favorite cuts it was uh nl1

2537
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:16,400
by hash plant

2538
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:17,119
by nl1 to say it correctly actually

2539
01:31:16,399 --> 01:31:20,559
because

2540
01:31:17,119 --> 01:31:23,119
uh the nl1 was the dad that was the mom

2541
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:24,080
and released three versions of it

2542
01:31:23,119 --> 01:31:25,840
um

2543
01:31:24,079 --> 01:31:30,158
depending on the year

2544
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:33,840
and one of the dads was um

2545
01:31:30,158 --> 01:31:36,638
i believe afghani won by nl2

2546
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:39,360
there was another dad that was uh

2547
01:31:36,639 --> 01:31:41,760
afghani one by ortega which is maple

2548
01:31:39,359 --> 01:31:43,679
leaf and there was the third and final

2549
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:45,360
dad which i believe was the vast

2550
01:31:43,679 --> 01:31:46,560
majority of the seeds but it's kind of

2551
01:31:45,359 --> 01:31:47,759
hard to say

2552
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:49,840
people wanted

2553
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:52,480
uh with all these pure indicas being

2554
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:54,000
crossed together people wanted a larger

2555
01:31:52,479 --> 01:31:57,439
yielding thing

2556
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:58,960
and so he crossed that hash plant by nl1

2557
01:31:57,439 --> 01:32:02,238
to a

2558
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:05,119
garlic bud by nl2

2559
01:32:02,238 --> 01:32:08,399
um so black domina

2560
01:32:05,119 --> 01:32:09,920
uh had three versions yeah many forms

2561
01:32:08,399 --> 01:32:13,599
yeah three forms

2562
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:15,760
uh mom was always the same uh dad buried

2563
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:16,639
as they played around with what to do

2564
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:18,159
yeah

2565
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:20,159
it was just a really good name so they

2566
01:32:18,158 --> 01:32:22,000
just [ __ ] went with it yeah it's a

2567
01:32:20,158 --> 01:32:24,960
great name i

2568
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:26,399
i will say that um of all my trips to

2569
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:29,520
europe

2570
01:32:26,399 --> 01:32:32,238
i lost it sadly but a black domino

2571
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:33,920
fino i found was one of the best things

2572
01:32:32,238 --> 01:32:35,039
i ever got

2573
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:38,079
out of europe

2574
01:32:35,039 --> 01:32:40,479
um i had a great great great variety of

2575
01:32:38,079 --> 01:32:43,198
it it tasted peppery it was extremely

2576
01:32:40,479 --> 01:32:44,718
frosty yielded pretty nicely

2577
01:32:43,198 --> 01:32:48,238
uh it was dark

2578
01:32:44,719 --> 01:32:50,399
uh dark afghan not too leafy really fast

2579
01:32:48,238 --> 01:32:50,399
too

2580
01:32:50,719 --> 01:32:53,679
it was a great cut i wish i still had it

2581
01:32:52,399 --> 01:32:55,198
it's one of my like

2582
01:32:53,679 --> 01:32:58,000
duper regrets

2583
01:32:55,198 --> 01:33:00,960
uh we have some good friends um that

2584
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:03,359
there was a rare 12-week fino

2585
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:04,319
that was likely a recessive garlic bud

2586
01:33:03,359 --> 01:33:05,920
type

2587
01:33:04,319 --> 01:33:07,439
that people really liked they called the

2588
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:10,079
lady fino

2589
01:33:07,439 --> 01:33:13,359
there was a lot of good black domina

2590
01:33:10,079 --> 01:33:14,800
black dump hopped um it was probably one

2591
01:33:13,359 --> 01:33:16,960
of the best

2592
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:18,400
later things that neville did

2593
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:19,279
yeah

2594
01:33:18,399 --> 01:33:20,479
uh

2595
01:33:19,279 --> 01:33:21,599
and

2596
01:33:20,479 --> 01:33:24,319
so

2597
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:25,760
i don't know we can um

2598
01:33:24,319 --> 01:33:27,119
so we've probably been talking for a

2599
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:29,520
long time i don't know how long it's

2600
01:33:27,119 --> 01:33:32,000
been going but we'll we'll have an hour

2601
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:32,960
and a half we'll tie it off with

2602
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:35,600
um

2603
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:38,399
we'll tie off neville at least with sort

2604
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:40,480
of um the last phase of what he did and

2605
01:33:38,399 --> 01:33:43,039
why that's important maybe and then

2606
01:33:40,479 --> 01:33:44,718
we'll call it good uh we didn't get to

2607
01:33:43,039 --> 01:33:46,800
everybody's questions it'll be hard to

2608
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:48,239
get to everybody's questions and one

2609
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:50,320
person said can you describe the

2610
01:33:48,238 --> 01:33:53,039
different growth structures flower times

2611
01:33:50,319 --> 01:33:55,679
yields flavor effects pros and cons of

2612
01:33:53,039 --> 01:33:57,760
the different chem cuts chem d chem 91

2613
01:33:55,679 --> 01:33:59,039
chem sis chem four and we'll do a chem

2614
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:00,000
dog episode

2615
01:33:59,039 --> 01:34:02,719
won't

2616
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:05,279
touch that one tonight uh i have a long

2617
01:34:02,719 --> 01:34:07,198
history with kem uh i got blessed and i

2618
01:34:05,279 --> 01:34:09,759
got to be one of the earlier people that

2619
01:34:07,198 --> 01:34:12,960
got a hold of the chem 91

2620
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:14,880
i've had the chem d since o6 i've had

2621
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:17,039
the chem 4 for a long time i have a lot

2622
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:19,600
of experience with them we could do a

2623
01:34:17,039 --> 01:34:21,039
long talk about that i promise you

2624
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:22,480
you'll hear more

2625
01:34:21,039 --> 01:34:24,560
about the chem

2626
01:34:22,479 --> 01:34:27,439
the most political episode we will ever

2627
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:28,880
do probably i don't know that one i mean

2628
01:34:27,439 --> 01:34:31,439
there's there's other ones i think that

2629
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:33,119
could cost him fire but yeah but we will

2630
01:34:31,439 --> 01:34:35,439
i promise you we will we will talk

2631
01:34:33,119 --> 01:34:37,439
extensively about kem uh we'll we'll be

2632
01:34:35,439 --> 01:34:40,238
popping out these episodes pretty often

2633
01:34:37,439 --> 01:34:42,479
so uh you'll hear about it in the future

2634
01:34:40,238 --> 01:34:45,039
um so to tie off the neville bit after

2635
01:34:42,479 --> 01:34:46,799
answering questions is

2636
01:34:45,039 --> 01:34:49,519
neville was ticked off

2637
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:52,960
about uh working under ben and alan

2638
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:54,480
drunkers he wasn't into it uh anymore

2639
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:57,600
and so he left

2640
01:34:54,479 --> 01:34:59,678
in 95 96

2641
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:01,520
and he partnered with a younger cat

2642
01:34:59,679 --> 01:35:03,440
named shanti

2643
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:04,880
shanti baba we won't talk about him

2644
01:35:03,439 --> 01:35:07,839
extensively

2645
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:09,480
but he came to europe in the early 90s

2646
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:12,960
and he

2647
01:35:09,479 --> 01:35:15,439
popularized white widow

2648
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:17,279
great white shark white rhino

2649
01:35:15,439 --> 01:35:20,000
uh things of that nature

2650
01:35:17,279 --> 01:35:23,118
um he was also from australia he's a bit

2651
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:25,920
younger than shanti he's sort of um and

2652
01:35:23,118 --> 01:35:27,118
so when neville left

2653
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:30,239
scentsy

2654
01:35:27,118 --> 01:35:31,679
uh shanti neville and this gentleman

2655
01:35:30,238 --> 01:35:34,399
named arjun

2656
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:35,279
partnered at the greenhouse uh coffee

2657
01:35:34,399 --> 01:35:36,638
shop

2658
01:35:35,279 --> 01:35:38,639
which should be pretty familiar to

2659
01:35:36,639 --> 01:35:40,719
everybody that has even a rudimentary

2660
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:42,639
knowledge of that um

2661
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:46,719
usually the first seeds everyone buys

2662
01:35:42,639 --> 01:35:48,480
post 2005 yeah they they they had a very

2663
01:35:46,719 --> 01:35:51,039
successful seed bank

2664
01:35:48,479 --> 01:35:52,399
and they had a very successful series of

2665
01:35:51,039 --> 01:35:53,679
coffee shops

2666
01:35:52,399 --> 01:35:57,359
in holland

2667
01:35:53,679 --> 01:36:00,000
um i went to them a bunch yeah and so

2668
01:35:57,359 --> 01:36:02,319
um basically at that point in neville's

2669
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,920
career he wasn't as interested in

2670
01:36:02,319 --> 01:36:05,759
breeding with a bunch of afghans and

2671
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:07,840
stuff anymore what he was really

2672
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:09,600
interested in is continuing his haze

2673
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:11,520
work because that's that's what

2674
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:13,280
interested him so

2675
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:15,199
like i said earlier about the jack

2676
01:36:13,279 --> 01:36:17,759
herrera

2677
01:36:15,198 --> 01:36:18,799
um neville didn't consider that line

2678
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:20,880
finished

2679
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:23,279
he just released it under pressure from

2680
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:26,159
ben and alan drunkers to coincide with

2681
01:36:23,279 --> 01:36:28,800
seed with the uh the cannabis cup

2682
01:36:26,158 --> 01:36:30,238
so after he left scentsy him and shanti

2683
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:32,320
partnered together

2684
01:36:30,238 --> 01:36:35,198
and they started taking they already

2685
01:36:32,319 --> 01:36:37,439
knew what strains they had they had two

2686
01:36:35,198 --> 01:36:39,198
nl5 hazes one of them was called one of

2687
01:36:37,439 --> 01:36:40,719
them we call c5

2688
01:36:39,198 --> 01:36:42,399
uh which has been spreading around a

2689
01:36:40,719 --> 01:36:43,679
little bit in america now and there's

2690
01:36:42,399 --> 01:36:45,599
some people that are selling seed

2691
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:47,520
hybrids of it and stuff it's finally

2692
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:48,480
popped out on our side of the of the

2693
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:51,119
world

2694
01:36:48,479 --> 01:36:52,879
and another one was called the 122 or

2695
01:36:51,118 --> 01:36:53,839
the mango

2696
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:56,639
right

2697
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:58,960
and they were trying to work out a poly

2698
01:36:56,639 --> 01:37:01,920
hybrid using skunk haze

2699
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:04,000
that would reflect the qualities of both

2700
01:37:01,920 --> 01:37:05,440
so they were parallel brief and

2701
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:07,118
basically what they were doing is

2702
01:37:05,439 --> 01:37:08,238
old-school breeding that's a huge pain

2703
01:37:07,118 --> 01:37:09,839
in the ass

2704
01:37:08,238 --> 01:37:12,238
in which they were taking different

2705
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:13,679
skunk cases and they were crossing it to

2706
01:37:12,238 --> 01:37:16,079
these things and they were growing out

2707
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:18,560
the kids and seeing if the dad threw the

2708
01:37:16,079 --> 01:37:21,039
traits they wanted yeah

2709
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:23,119
so uh most people don't do that anymore

2710
01:37:21,039 --> 01:37:24,960
as matt gonna test that's a super

2711
01:37:23,118 --> 01:37:27,039
time-consuming

2712
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:27,760
pain in the ass the market doesn't let

2713
01:37:27,039 --> 01:37:29,439
you

2714
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:30,960
have a strain and six years later

2715
01:37:29,439 --> 01:37:32,799
release it you know what i mean like you

2716
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:35,600
can't do it it doesn't it doesn't work

2717
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:37,279
in today's world but they

2718
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:39,840
he had been working on that for a number

2719
01:37:37,279 --> 01:37:42,639
of years he kept working on it and

2720
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:44,639
eventually they found a skunk hayes dad

2721
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:47,359
that meet their criteria

2722
01:37:44,639 --> 01:37:48,400
neville preferred the line that uc5 is

2723
01:37:47,359 --> 01:37:50,158
the mom

2724
01:37:48,399 --> 01:37:51,599
and that line became known as super

2725
01:37:50,158 --> 01:37:54,399
silver hayes

2726
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:56,639
uh won three cups in the late 90s

2727
01:37:54,399 --> 01:37:57,839
probably everybody knows about it it's

2728
01:37:56,639 --> 01:38:01,679
very famous

2729
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:05,119
yeah dante preferred the skunk haze dad

2730
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:07,199
crossed to the 122 or the mango

2731
01:38:05,118 --> 01:38:10,479
my preference that one got named the

2732
01:38:07,198 --> 01:38:12,960
mango haze that's also my preference

2733
01:38:10,479 --> 01:38:16,479
i would actually the the 122 is sadly

2734
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:18,960
not in america yet it is the nicest nl5

2735
01:38:16,479 --> 01:38:22,238
haze i've smoked yeah i'd love to smoke

2736
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:24,079
that my personal favorite out of the a5s

2737
01:38:22,238 --> 01:38:25,839
the c5s whatever

2738
01:38:24,079 --> 01:38:27,760
not that i'm an expert on all of them or

2739
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:29,440
anything but i have in coffee shops and

2740
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:30,480
getting to know people over there smoked

2741
01:38:29,439 --> 01:38:32,319
most of it

2742
01:38:30,479 --> 01:38:34,519
that one's amazing

2743
01:38:32,319 --> 01:38:38,319
yeah and i wish i had it

2744
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:42,320
um but it lives and you can buy it from

2745
01:38:38,319 --> 01:38:44,479
shanti still um as the 122.

2746
01:38:42,319 --> 01:38:46,000
it's 122 by scott hayes it's called

2747
01:38:44,479 --> 01:38:48,399
mango hayes

2748
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:50,800
and then he also released something

2749
01:38:48,399 --> 01:38:53,359
that was the start of his holy grail

2750
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:55,760
project his holy grail project was

2751
01:38:53,359 --> 01:38:59,118
trying to recapture the magic of haze in

2752
01:38:55,760 --> 01:39:01,520
an actual line and notch f1

2753
01:38:59,118 --> 01:39:03,519
uh neville talked extensively about how

2754
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:04,639
he didn't like most of the poly hybrid

2755
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:07,600
hazes

2756
01:39:04,639 --> 01:39:09,679
nearly as much as the f1s yeah so he was

2757
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:11,199
trying to figure out a way to do that

2758
01:39:09,679 --> 01:39:13,760
and so what he did

2759
01:39:11,198 --> 01:39:15,118
is he took a5

2760
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:16,800
a52

2761
01:39:15,118 --> 01:39:19,279
which is on the cover i don't know if

2762
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:21,679
matt wants to show it but the a52 is on

2763
01:39:19,279 --> 01:39:23,279
the cover of the seed bank 89 and 90

2764
01:39:21,679 --> 01:39:26,800
catalog bolts

2765
01:39:23,279 --> 01:39:29,039
he took the a52 this ugly beast

2766
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:32,960
he took the a52 that one

2767
01:39:29,039 --> 01:39:35,198
and he crossed it to haze c

2768
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:38,000
and which is the famous dad that that

2769
01:39:35,198 --> 01:39:38,960
was used in almost all the haze releases

2770
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,800
so

2771
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:42,960
um that was the first time that the a

2772
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:46,159
dad and the c-dad was crossed in the

2773
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:48,319
same line so it was 75 percent haze and

2774
01:39:46,158 --> 01:39:50,079
25 northern lights

2775
01:39:48,319 --> 01:39:52,238
and they initially

2776
01:39:50,079 --> 01:39:54,880
crossed it just to be a personal

2777
01:39:52,238 --> 01:39:56,799
breeding project as their haze grail

2778
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:59,039
but they found so much killer stuff in

2779
01:39:56,800 --> 01:40:01,360
it they decided to release it and yeah

2780
01:39:59,039 --> 01:40:04,719
neville's haze

2781
01:40:01,359 --> 01:40:06,079
there is still a cut of that first find

2782
01:40:04,719 --> 01:40:08,960
in holland

2783
01:40:06,079 --> 01:40:12,238
it is the strongest sativa i know of

2784
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:14,480
it's almost like a

2785
01:40:12,238 --> 01:40:14,479
uh

2786
01:40:15,039 --> 01:40:19,760
maybe the best way to put it is all

2787
01:40:17,039 --> 01:40:22,800
those old-school stories of psychedelic

2788
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:24,800
trippy hold on to your seat sativas

2789
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:27,360
that make you see tracers in the corner

2790
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:29,279
of your vision and make it like

2791
01:40:27,359 --> 01:40:32,000
something's talking to you

2792
01:40:29,279 --> 01:40:34,238
um i kind of believe that was [ __ ]

2793
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:36,079
and then i smoked neville's haze

2794
01:40:34,238 --> 01:40:37,759
that pheno that they found that became

2795
01:40:36,079 --> 01:40:40,399
famous and it literally felt like the

2796
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:43,039
top of my head blew off

2797
01:40:40,399 --> 01:40:44,158
i'm dead serious i shared a joint

2798
01:40:43,039 --> 01:40:46,079
i did i

2799
01:40:44,158 --> 01:40:49,118
at that point i had

2800
01:40:46,079 --> 01:40:51,039
i had the chem 91 i had super skunk i

2801
01:40:49,118 --> 01:40:53,519
had a whole bunch of

2802
01:40:51,039 --> 01:40:56,079
pretty potent nice quality stuff

2803
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:58,480
i felt like the stuff we had in america

2804
01:40:56,079 --> 01:40:59,519
was mostly superior to what europe had

2805
01:40:58,479 --> 01:41:02,158
to offer

2806
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:03,760
i went over there i met a gentleman

2807
01:41:02,158 --> 01:41:04,638
who used to work with neville became

2808
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:07,199
friends

2809
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:09,760
i smoked a small joint with two friends

2810
01:41:07,198 --> 01:41:11,359
of the neville's haze

2811
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:13,360
and

2812
01:41:11,359 --> 01:41:15,839
it blew my head off i mean it literally

2813
01:41:13,359 --> 01:41:18,479
felt like like air was rushing over the

2814
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:21,039
top of my skull yeah i remember holding

2815
01:41:18,479 --> 01:41:23,519
on to the railing as i walked down the

2816
01:41:21,039 --> 01:41:26,238
steps of the dude's house

2817
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:27,679
i remember feeling anxious

2818
01:41:26,238 --> 01:41:29,519
stoned

2819
01:41:27,679 --> 01:41:31,920
trace rushing

2820
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:34,560
uh definitely feelings that i'm not used

2821
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:37,039
to in cannabis yeah and so at that point

2822
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:38,159
i realized that some of those old sativa

2823
01:41:37,039 --> 01:41:40,238
stories

2824
01:41:38,158 --> 01:41:42,879
had the that were true

2825
01:41:40,238 --> 01:41:44,319
that some people did get a psychedelic

2826
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:46,960
energetic

2827
01:41:44,319 --> 01:41:49,279
almost disassociative type of potent

2828
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:51,760
feeling i don't care how use you are to

2829
01:41:49,279 --> 01:41:53,279
smoking whatever afghans you're used to

2830
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:55,440
yeah if you have a tolerance to

2831
01:41:53,279 --> 01:41:57,679
neville's haze and you smoke some you'll

2832
01:41:55,439 --> 01:41:59,919
probably get knocked off your feet

2833
01:41:57,679 --> 01:42:01,039
you know there is a person in the u.s

2834
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:02,880
and and me and this guy don't

2835
01:42:01,039 --> 01:42:03,679
necessarily get along the best now but

2836
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:05,359
um

2837
01:42:03,679 --> 01:42:07,118
in all reality the best novels haze i've

2838
01:42:05,359 --> 01:42:09,198
ever smoked has come from snow high he

2839
01:42:07,118 --> 01:42:10,960
had an amazing selection of it and i

2840
01:42:09,198 --> 01:42:12,399
think he used it in some breeding work

2841
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:14,639
but it was uh

2842
01:42:12,399 --> 01:42:17,279
every spice you could imagine in a

2843
01:42:14,639 --> 01:42:19,760
kitchen cabinet all in one and it was

2844
01:42:17,279 --> 01:42:21,519
just it was just so speedy it was crazy

2845
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:24,079
[ __ ] it was really good though it was

2846
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:26,719
unique i don't recommend this but

2847
01:42:24,079 --> 01:42:29,118
if you smoke too much neville's haze

2848
01:42:26,719 --> 01:42:30,239
it feels kind of like psychedelic

2849
01:42:29,118 --> 01:42:31,118
cocaine

2850
01:42:30,238 --> 01:42:34,319
oh

2851
01:42:31,118 --> 01:42:36,000
oh let's just go do it it feels

2852
01:42:34,319 --> 01:42:39,039
i mean but some people some people feel

2853
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:40,880
like uncomfortable yeah out of your skin

2854
01:42:39,039 --> 01:42:42,960
yeah in a corner

2855
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:45,118
um you know i get that from afghanis

2856
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:48,079
which is really weird a lot of them well

2857
01:42:45,118 --> 01:42:49,519
it really it really uh it really has a

2858
01:42:48,079 --> 01:42:51,039
strange feeling

2859
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:53,119
um

2860
01:42:51,039 --> 01:42:54,800
i looked for that fino in neville's haze

2861
01:42:53,118 --> 01:42:56,559
i bought quite a bit of seeds i never

2862
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:58,960
found it

2863
01:42:56,560 --> 01:43:01,039
luckily that pheno still exists it's

2864
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:03,118
still sold in coffee shops over there

2865
01:43:01,039 --> 01:43:04,800
there's still people that hold it on

2866
01:43:03,118 --> 01:43:07,118
that side of the pond

2867
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:10,000
um yeah panic attacks

2868
01:43:07,118 --> 01:43:10,960
uh it it was uh certain people don't

2869
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,560
like it

2870
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:13,840
yeah i [ __ ] hate roller coaster weed

2871
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:16,159
that shit's

2872
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:18,239
don't but it is

2873
01:43:16,158 --> 01:43:19,920
it's it's very tasty it's extremely

2874
01:43:18,238 --> 01:43:22,238
potent it hits you

2875
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:25,118
extremely differently than most things

2876
01:43:22,238 --> 01:43:26,799
and it certainly was factual and i'm

2877
01:43:25,118 --> 01:43:28,399
like okay some of these people that are

2878
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:30,159
making these stories about ties and

2879
01:43:28,399 --> 01:43:31,679
columbians and how it made them feel a

2880
01:43:30,158 --> 01:43:33,198
long time ago

2881
01:43:31,679 --> 01:43:35,840
um are true

2882
01:43:33,198 --> 01:43:37,039
yeah because that that that cut has it

2883
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:40,880
in spades

2884
01:43:37,039 --> 01:43:42,960
yeah uh it's 75 percent haze 25 northern

2885
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:46,159
lights it's the first thing that crosses

2886
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:47,600
both hays dads a and c in the same line

2887
01:43:46,158 --> 01:43:49,198
it's nuts

2888
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:50,400
uh i've been it's one of my white

2889
01:43:49,198 --> 01:43:52,238
rabbits

2890
01:43:50,399 --> 01:43:53,519
i've been searching for it since the

2891
01:43:52,238 --> 01:43:55,279
late 90s

2892
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:58,480
i know where it exists

2893
01:43:55,279 --> 01:44:00,079
i haven't gotten it yet i hope i get it

2894
01:43:58,479 --> 01:44:01,759
hopefully after this we'll have i don't

2895
01:44:00,079 --> 01:44:04,000
know nine or ten companies making

2896
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:05,840
crosses with it from the us

2897
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,800
yeah i mean now that we've mentioned it

2898
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:08,800
everybody's gonna have it all of a

2899
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:12,000
sudden so here's the quick right is that

2900
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:14,320
thing takes like 16 weeks yeah so it's a

2901
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:16,158
super long runner but it literally

2902
01:44:14,319 --> 01:44:17,519
yields like three and a half pounds of

2903
01:44:16,158 --> 01:44:19,679
light

2904
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:21,440
yeah that's insane so even if even if

2905
01:44:19,679 --> 01:44:23,600
you even if you were to take that 16

2906
01:44:21,439 --> 01:44:25,519
weeks and turn it into eight weeks

2907
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:28,000
basically like growing an eight week

2908
01:44:25,520 --> 01:44:31,280
pound and a half a light strain yeah but

2909
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:35,279
it takes twice as long yeah um

2910
01:44:31,279 --> 01:44:37,759
you know i i saw i saw a room in holland

2911
01:44:35,279 --> 01:44:40,719
i'll tell this story uh before it gets

2912
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:43,520
too late but sure i walked into a room i

2913
01:44:40,719 --> 01:44:46,319
i saw a room in holland that was all uh

2914
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:47,679
nl5 haze and neville's haze and it was

2915
01:44:46,319 --> 01:44:49,439
one of the craziest things i've ever

2916
01:44:47,679 --> 01:44:50,960
seen they were growing on a slanted

2917
01:44:49,439 --> 01:44:53,359
floor with drains

2918
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:54,079
they were growing in rockwool croutons

2919
01:44:53,359 --> 01:44:56,319
yeah

2920
01:44:54,079 --> 01:44:58,960
rockwell's very popular in europe yeah

2921
01:44:56,319 --> 01:45:00,079
um they were growing in one gallon pots

2922
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:00,960
there was

2923
01:45:00,079 --> 01:45:03,039
thick

2924
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:05,279
thick stems growing out of these one

2925
01:45:03,039 --> 01:45:07,359
gallon pots they were crazy they were on

2926
01:45:05,279 --> 01:45:09,439
constant drip slow

2927
01:45:07,359 --> 01:45:10,319
and drip right draining out onto the

2928
01:45:09,439 --> 01:45:12,960
floor

2929
01:45:10,319 --> 01:45:15,198
and these stems went trimmed up about

2930
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:17,520
six i'm six foot three

2931
01:45:15,198 --> 01:45:20,799
they went up over my head the netting

2932
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:22,560
was about six and a half feet tall

2933
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:25,440
three feet from about six and a half

2934
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:28,639
feet to about nine or ten feet there was

2935
01:45:25,439 --> 01:45:31,839
a mass jungle of buds everywhere and

2936
01:45:28,639 --> 01:45:33,679
then six 600s all over the place yeah

2937
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:35,440
it was one of the more unusual grow

2938
01:45:33,679 --> 01:45:38,000
rooms i've ever seen was it all like

2939
01:45:35,439 --> 01:45:40,399
vertical bulbs hanging in there no they

2940
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:42,000
were just way up high oh okay i got you

2941
01:45:40,399 --> 01:45:43,359
but it's like so you look at the ground

2942
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,479
and there's these tiny little one

2943
01:45:43,359 --> 01:45:47,599
gallons

2944
01:45:44,479 --> 01:45:49,599
of rockwell croutons with these big

2945
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:51,440
thick stems coming out of the base that

2946
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:54,000
went up better than me and then right

2947
01:45:51,439 --> 01:45:57,039
above my head it just branched into

2948
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:59,118
crazy sativa arms

2949
01:45:57,039 --> 01:46:00,639
everywhere and that is

2950
01:45:59,118 --> 01:46:02,158
for the coffee shops

2951
01:46:00,639 --> 01:46:04,079
um

2952
01:46:02,158 --> 01:46:05,759
so

2953
01:46:04,079 --> 01:46:07,439
that these last two episodes we

2954
01:46:05,760 --> 01:46:10,159
basically sort of walked you through

2955
01:46:07,439 --> 01:46:13,279
neville's main breeding era which was 85

2956
01:46:10,158 --> 01:46:15,519
to 97 97.98

2957
01:46:13,279 --> 01:46:17,679
that still super silver hayes won three

2958
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:20,560
cannabis cups in a row

2959
01:46:17,679 --> 01:46:22,399
uh 97 98 99

2960
01:46:20,560 --> 01:46:24,080
most people have heard of neville's haze

2961
01:46:22,399 --> 01:46:27,279
super silver haze

2962
01:46:24,079 --> 01:46:28,880
mango haze and sort of the last major

2963
01:46:27,279 --> 01:46:31,039
breeding that neville not that neville

2964
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:32,880
stopped breeding but he did some much

2965
01:46:31,039 --> 01:46:35,840
smaller projects and

2966
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:37,920
collabs more with other people and was a

2967
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:40,880
bit more about that than i do

2968
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:43,279
but um you know neville probably had a

2969
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:46,480
17-year run

2970
01:46:43,279 --> 01:46:47,599
yeah it's a good run in this industry of

2971
01:46:46,479 --> 01:46:50,559
really

2972
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:51,360
great cannabis yeah it went through seed

2973
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:53,679
bank

2974
01:46:51,359 --> 01:46:55,198
it went through scentsy it went through

2975
01:46:53,679 --> 01:46:57,279
the greenhouse

2976
01:46:55,198 --> 01:46:58,719
uh you know he sold a bunch of we're not

2977
01:46:57,279 --> 01:47:00,800
going to talk about that

2978
01:46:58,719 --> 01:47:02,639
this episode but he sold a bunch of his

2979
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:03,679
stuff and gave a bunch of his cuts to

2980
01:47:02,639 --> 01:47:06,000
shanti

2981
01:47:03,679 --> 01:47:07,520
and then it continued at mr nice seeds

that's the housekeeping details i think

3022

um i mean the other thing we could say

3023
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:29,359
is we say this every time we have a

3024
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:31,520
discord server that's breeder syndicate

3025

also be doing some shorts soon not every

3029
01:48:40,158 --> 01:48:45,039
subject requires an hour and a half or

3030
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:46,719
something like that to discuss

3031

question might not get talked about but

3035
01:48:54,719 --> 01:48:58,800
