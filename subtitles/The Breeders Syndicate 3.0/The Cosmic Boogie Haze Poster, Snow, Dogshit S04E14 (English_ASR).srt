00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,919
welcome to breeder syndicate where we

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,359
explore the history of a clandestine

4
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:15,839
scene through the eyes of the folks who

5
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:18,320
live here i'm matthew owner of riot

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,719
seeds i'll occasionally be joined by my

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,240
co-host not-so-dog breeder and grower

8
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:25,759
from mendocino

9
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:25,759
welcome to the underground

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,480
we should talk about haze sure

11
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:31,839
okay let me let me flip this around so

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,520
it's not gonna be my face it's gonna be

13
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:35,759
the haze poster and i'll try to get it

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,680
so it's um

15
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:41,519
uh nice and bright and illuminated and

16
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:42,719
clear so let's see if that works let's

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,120
see

18
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,280
i'm gonna aim this little light thing

19
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,679
down more there we go

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,679
all right

21
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,198
so here we start the original haze

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,359
poster now this is

23
00:00:55,198 --> 00:01:00,479
my pride and joy

24
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:00,479
willing it to not so

25
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:06,478
this was the cosmic also referred to as

26
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:08,798
a cosmic boogie poster from 1976.

27
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:08,798
um

28
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,040
uh rl

29
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:14,478
and

30
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,159
crk

31
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:16,879
supposedly and the hayes brothers are

32
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,400
all

33
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:20,478
uh

34
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,799
revolve around this so talk about some

35
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:22,798
names

36
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,719
there you are okay

37
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,519
i mean where do you want to start with

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,519
it

39
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:37,920
uh let's start let's start with what

40
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:40,158
what do you think hayes c

41
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,759
jesse do you want to start with hayes

42
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,000
males do you want to start with the

43
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,159
original breeding of haze so like

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,359
probably like the

45
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,399
the the most realistic starting point

46
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,560
is

47
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,840
the mid-80s

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,359
right yep that's probably so

49
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,439
you know there's all this stuff about

50
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,438
haze and obviously haze existed in

51
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:02,319
california in the 70s

52
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:05,039
uh

53
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:07,199
possibly late 60s

54
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,399
and there's not a lot of excellent

55
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,280
sourcing

56
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,840
on

57
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,520
that aspect of hayes there's a few

58
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,878
people

59
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,640
that uh

60
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,318
that know a bit and they don't really

61
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:21,039
agree

62
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:23,359
necessarily so

63
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:26,079
kind of what happened is it seems like

64
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,599
it was a you know if you believe sam

65
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,360
skunk man um it was a colombian by

66
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,280
colombian cross

67
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,800
uh and it seems like because people

68
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,560
didn't understand breeding very well

69
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,719
back then

70
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,759
the first initial crosses and hybrids

71
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,000
they made

72
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:44,079
over the years were the best and you if

73
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,800
you look at his poster right there you

74
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,519
could see silver haze on one side you

75
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,200
could see magenta gold on another

76
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,239
you could see different things these are

77
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:55,039
all

78
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,560
named phenos that would pop up out of

79
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:58,878
their seed line

80
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,280
right but if you think back to the early

81
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,560
70s people's idea of breeding was pretty

82
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,959
rudimentary

83
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,800
and so um

84
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,920
you know it went through some processes

85
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,879
people didn't really know what they were

86
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:09,839
doing

87
00:03:08,878 --> 00:03:11,919
um

88
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,200
and it's kind of like a mystery exactly

89
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,598
who the what the wh

90
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:18,799
why and where in the 70s

91
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:21,439
and then the story picks up

92
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,400
when sam skunk man got himself into some

93
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:24,878
trouble

94
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,360
in america a couple of times and it

95
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:28,560
appears that he took a bunch of seeds of

96
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,319
skunk

97
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,560
and uh

98
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:35,199
haze and then he gathered up a bunch of

99
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,199
other breeders work like mel mel frank

100
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,719
and some other people stuff and he went

101
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,719
to amsterdam

102
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:43,039
and when he went to amsterdam he ended

103
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:44,959
up uh hooking up with

104
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:47,919
a number of folks one of them was

105
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,640
neville and this is where

106
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:53,199
uh this is where the story diverges

107
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,399
um so if you believe neville's side of

108
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,000
the story

109
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,680
um

110
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,120
neville bought a bunch of very old seed

111
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,438
from sam

112
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,360
is dated from the late 60s to the early

113
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:07,280
70s

114
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,519
and

115
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,519
he

116
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:16,000
he barely got any of them to pop

117
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,639
if you believe sam's side of the story

118
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,478
uh he sold neville the exact same seed

119
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,519
that he sold everybody else

120
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:27,039
was reproductions that he made in

121
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:28,879
in amsterdam after he landed there

122
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,400
and he claims that neville never got

123
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:32,800
anything special

124
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:35,198
um there's a lot more to it than that

125
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,000
the neville story has never really

126
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,400
changed the sam story has certainly

127
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,199
changed from the various forums like

128
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:44,159
overgrow and cannabis world to

129
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,199
uh

130
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,639
um what's the one that came after that

131
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,639
after what

132
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:56,160
after cannabis world and overgrow um the

133
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,759
various forums sam is

134
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,520
i don't think his story has stayed

135
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,759
consistent over time

136
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,159
um he's claimed to have given neville

137
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:07,199
only clones he's claimed to have given

138
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,680
him old seed new seed this that whatever

139
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,919
but regardless of all that uh neville

140
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,160
claims he sprouted he tried to sprout a

141
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:15,439
bunch most of them failed i see mag

142
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,120
there you go

143
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:19,199
um

144
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,720
i see mag and so

145
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:25,038
um after uh

146
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,000
after after neville tried to pop a bunch

147
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:28,159
of them

148
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,839
and almost none of them came up

149
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,960
and he got a girl that he thought was a

150
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,758
piece of [ __ ]

151
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:35,439
uh and he grew it and he didn't realize

152
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,240
it was any good until after he'd already

153
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:41,759
killed it and he ended up with two boys

154
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,800
which everybody knows as a and c

155
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,479
um

156
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,319
so

157
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:48,240
that's where the story gets famous

158
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:49,680
because the vast majority of what people

159
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,759
know is haze

160
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,879
and the whole haze story

161
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,800
comes from those those two dads for lack

162
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:57,918
of a better term right

163
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,120
so

164
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:00,879
uh

165
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,918
everything that neville commercially

166
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:04,560
sold

167
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:06,879
nl5 haze

168
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,639
silver haze all that type of stuff that

169
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:09,439
was all haze c

170
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,400
right

171
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:15,519
um and he had haze a

172
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:17,120
he made a ton of crosses in 88 and 89

173
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:20,159
with haze a

174
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,879
um and then one of his workers didn't

175
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,639
keep a dad and bloomed everything on his

176
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,639
last main seed run

177
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,720
and so he had a bunch of seed and he had

178
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,560
a bunch of hybrids but he never sold

179
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,600
commercial stock of it

180
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,759
right

181
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,680
um and so

182
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,919
you know sam

183
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,439
sold a bunch of his haze seed he used to

184
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:41,359
be able to buy

185
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:42,399
from the flying dutchman

186
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,240
um

187
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:46,959
and you i believe he used to be able to

188
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,439
buy it from positronics too um used to

189
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:50,719
be able to buy sam's open pollination

190
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,360
haze

191
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,440
uh the different thing is that nobody

192
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,520
seems to have ever found jack [ __ ] out

193
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:59,759
of sam's haze lines

194
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:59,758
and

195
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,280
the uh the stuff that he gave neville

196
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:07,038
that seems to be where all the quality

197
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:08,079
came from

198
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:09,279
so

199
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:11,359
um

200
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:13,038
you know you're talking about two dudes

201
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,120
who don't get along

202
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:16,560
don't see eye to eye

203
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,000
didn't like each other

204
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,199
and they both had very different

205
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
versions of what happened in the mid 80s

206
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,919
uh

207
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,720
in a dope field that they had

208
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:28,560
so it becomes sort of a mission of like

209
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,080
who do you choose to believe

210
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,918
and what part of their story do you

211
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:32,800
choose to believe

212
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,719
uh

213
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,478
but what's undoubtable

214
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,280
is that all the [ __ ] that people know

215
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:40,240
about the pif the church the cuban black

216
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:43,119
haze

217
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,439
the a5 the c5

218
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,840
super silver haze mango

219
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:50,079
all those different the soma work

220
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:53,038
all that different stuff it all came

221
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:53,839
from hybrids that neville made

222
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:57,439
right

223
00:07:53,839 --> 00:08:00,079
uh that that's undisputable you know it

224
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,598
all came from them and so

225
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,969
uh

226
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:04,800
you know it um

227
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:06,319
[Music]

228
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,439
you know like like a lot of things in

229
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,319
cannabis

230
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:10,319
um

231
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,120
uh people involved aren't the most

232
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,840
honest folk

233
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,319
and

234
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:18,478
no matter what era you're in

235
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,560
uh you know we seem to attract some

236
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,639
shady hustling and some lying and some

237
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,038
fibbing and some like polishing of your

238
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,360
story and all that other stuff so

239
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:30,079
um

240
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,439
it uh i don't know you know we uh

241
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:33,278
i you know

242
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:34,639
king cultivars i tend to believe

243
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:36,399
neville's story

244
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,939
mostly because

245
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,158
um

246
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,240
[Music]

247
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:41,200
all this fire came out of neville's

248
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,158
lines

249
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,920
and not very much fire came out of sam's

250
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:48,159
that you can really you can really

251
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:50,958
ascertain any bunch

252
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:53,360
i think northern lights five haze

253
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:56,639
probably has more elite cuts named after

254
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:59,200
it that still exists that are 25 to 30

255
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:01,360
years old than any other line that's

256
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,278
ever been made by anybody

257
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,759
uh yeah that's the goat it's the [ __ ]

258
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:08,240
goat it really it really is you know i

259
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:11,838
mean they're both on the atlantic you

260
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:15,759
know on the usa side and on the european

261
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:18,399
side it seems like from 88 to 95

262
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:20,080
people found white hot fire in that line

263
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,639
it's probably the most successful

264
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,839
cannabis hybrid of all time

265
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:26,559
uh

266
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:29,279
you know um whether he got lucky

267
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:31,599
whether he you know i mean all that you

268
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:34,159
can you know but that f1

269
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,519
was um you know it's got rare power and

270
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:40,159
people to this day honestly the reason

271
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,399
why on the west coast people don't like

272
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:44,559
haze is because the haze they know is

273
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,080
jack or super silver haze or some of the

274
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:48,239
poly hybrids

275
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,519
all of the best f1s have been hoarded

276
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,919
forever

277
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,919
uh they were hoarded in europe

278
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:56,000
uh in america the cubans and the

279
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,039
dominicans hoarded the [ __ ] out of their

280
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,360
cuts

281
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:01,519
and didn't allow it to get spread out

282
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,839
and so it's kind of amazing actually for

283
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,839
as long as it's been out most of the

284
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,079
other elites have leaked

285
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,600
and snuck out and a lot of people have

286
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:11,039
gotten a hold of them

287
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,519
and

288
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:15,199
you really haven't been able to about

289
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,039
the other stuff

290
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,240
you know i mean when you really think

291
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:22,719
about it right like the a5 and the c5

292
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,519
are in america right now uh people have

293
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,839
them

294
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,120
um those those things were found in 88

295
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,120
and 89

296
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,320
and i don't think they came to america

297
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,679
until a couple years ago

298
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,399
right i mean they were literally on

299
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:38,319
lockdown for something like 30 years

300
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,759
you could go to amsterdam i used to you

301
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,200
know i used to be able to smoke them

302
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:43,838
when i went to amsterdam they were a

303
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,360
staple in amsterdam coffee shops they're

304
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:50,079
a staple of cannabis breeding um but

305
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,120
it's the thing is is to be perfectly

306
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:52,879
honest

307
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,480
most of the people that think they know

308
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:56,000
hayes don't because they never got to

309
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,800
smoke the real deal

310
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,440
yeah

311
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:02,399
i mean that's just uh that's just really

312
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,079
the the truth uh how does mr nice fit

313
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,240
into the haze story

314
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:07,519
that's a little bit longer

315
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,919
convo but

316
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,879
the basic story is

317
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,799
um

318
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:15,838
man it's kind of a long story

319
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:15,838
the super short version

320
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,639
neville got busted during operation

321
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:21,599
green merchant and ended up in [ __ ]

322
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,159
jail

323
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,159
and ben and alan drunkers had money and

324
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:27,919
were willing to buy him out but they

325
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:29,519
weren't willing to buy him out unless he

326
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:30,799
gave them unless he sold them his

327
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,560
[ __ ] company

328
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:35,599
so in order to get his freedom and to

329
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:38,479
get out of the situation he's in he had

330
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,320
to sell sea bank

331
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,320
to scentsy seeds

332
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,440
and he ended up being sensei seed's main

333
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,600
breeder

334
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,519
uh one of that ended up being that since

335
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,360
he ended up owning most of his genetics

336
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,000
they trademarked a bunch of his famous

337
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,919
names like super skunk and other stuff

338
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,159
and after four or five years he wasn't

339
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:58,479
really getting along with ben and allen

340
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:00,958
drunkers and so he left

341
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,120
uh scentsy seeds and him and shanti

342
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:05,039
started working together and they bred

343
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,799
together for a few years

344
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:08,559
and that that

345
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:11,278
combination breeding

346
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:13,599
led to the super silver haze the mango

347
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:16,159
haze and the neville's haze didn't allow

348
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,440
arjun to get any of the seed

349
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:20,240
any of the

350
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,240
cuttings mom's dads or even grow any of

351
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,639
the flower they provided his coffee

352
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,879
shops with the flowers but

353
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,759
when they worked at greenhouse

354
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,919
um

355
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:31,838
shanti and neville never allowed arjun

356
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:34,799
to get a hold of any of the cuts

357
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,600
or any of the moms or dads they provided

358
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:38,799
him

359
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,519
with the seeds for sale at greenhouse

360
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:42,799
and they provided him with the flower

361
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,679
to uh

362
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:47,599
to sell at greenhouse right

363
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:48,958
does everybody get that

364
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,680
hopefully everybody got that i can hear

365
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:54,000
it okay so

366
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:55,679
what happened is is they after after

367
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,759
neville left scentsy

368
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:00,559
um

369
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:02,240
him and shanti worked together uh on the

370
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:03,119
super silver haze

371
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,799
the

372
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,039
mango haze and the neville's haze

373
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:09,120
project they each had a part of

374
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:11,679
greenhouse seeds

375
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,959
and they kept arjun out of the loop

376
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:16,719
by not giving them any cuts or any flour

377
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,719
they just basically gave them flour to

378
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,879
sell in the coffee shop and then they

379
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,360
provided the seeds and the packaging to

380
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:26,240
sell through the seed company and then

381
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,120
eventually they didn't like the deal

382
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,560
with arjun and so shanti left

383
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,759
and took the cuts and went to

384
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:35,199
switzerland

385
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:38,399
and started mr nice seeds

386
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:41,600
so that's how mr nice seeds

387
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:45,278
um and then matt can confirm this but

388
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,839
neville sold his seed bank era 80s era

389
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:50,720
seed collection

390
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:52,160
to shanti for a chunk of money when

391
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,000
neville was broke

392
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:55,439
and so shanti

393
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,799
um

394
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,199
shanti has

395
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:01,120
or had at some point

396
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:04,159
a bunch of neville's breeding work as

397
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,399
well as a bunch of neville's old seed

398
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:07,600
yes if that makes sense so that's kind

399
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,320
of how

400
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,000
um you know there's a lot of people that

401
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,920
believe in shanti there's a bunch of

402
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,600
people that think he's full of [ __ ]

403
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,639
which is pretty common for the weed

404
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,040
industry

405
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:22,320
um but he legitimately worked with

406
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:24,399
neville and he legitimately had access

407
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,519
to neville's cuts neville's breeding

408
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,198
parents

409
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:31,198
and a bunch of old 80 seed from neville

410
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:33,838
for lack of a better way to put it

411
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:35,599
yeah and i think he's he's probably the

412
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,000
main source for a lot of neville stuff

413
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,159
today that's more reliable one of the

414
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,320
most reliable sources for neville's

415
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:45,278
work today i would say

416
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,120
yeah and i mean you know so i mean

417
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:48,879
despite his uh

418
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,440
you know like but there's the thing is

419
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:52,480
is about shanti is that

420
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,519
there's not really a way to

421
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:58,959
cross-reference whether he has it or not

422
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,240
yeah no take his word for it all of it

423
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,919
right because

424
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,120
we're not in his mom room we're not in

425
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:06,559
his dad room

426
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,399
i would assume he's lost some things but

427
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:11,198
what it's hard to say

428
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,879
yeah he'd never tell you

429
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:14,319
and you know and on top of that he might

430
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:16,559
not be lying

431
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,240
you know yeah he might have it's it's

432
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:21,039
there we don't have any evidence one way

433
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,278
or the other a lot of times what happens

434
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:24,159
with this [ __ ] is um

435
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:26,240
you know

436
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,278
people end up believing the grower they

437
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,360
like

438
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:33,120
yeah yeah no that really is it

439
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,240
and disbelieving the grower they don't

440
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,440
you know

441
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,240
so

442
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,920
yeah

443
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,360
i hope people can hear me i'm not seeing

444

um

456
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:01,758
yeah that's kind of the

457
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,199
that's that's the long short version of

458
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,879
mr nice

459
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:09,439
um he has legitimate he has more

460
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:10,958
provenance and access to neville stuff

461
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,759
than almost anybody

462
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,799
and he may still have afghan tea

463
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,600
he might

464
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:20,078
be you know it's it's been you know when

465
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,720
matt was plugging the uh

466
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:25,278
the discord server and all that

467
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,278
we have endless debates on what's still

468
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:28,240
alive and what's dead

469
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:30,320
so

470
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,399
you know um

471
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,959
it's uh

472
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,958
hard to say

473
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:39,120
yeah it is hard to say you want to talk

474
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:40,159
about um pif

475
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,039
piv

476
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:42,719
yeah

477
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:45,198
i think that's probably one of the most

478
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,240
questions i get asked the most on here

479
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:48,319
i mean

480
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,680
it seems like so

481
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,360
you know the

482
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:52,399
it's kind of shrouded in a little bit of

483
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,800
mystery

484
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,799
but what it seems like is that

485
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:57,679
there was a guy that bought

486
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:59,120
um

487
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:01,039
there was a guy that bought seed from

488
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,039
neville in 1988

489
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:05,599
nl5 haze

490
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:07,119
and he was uh grateful he was on

491
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,318
grateful dead tour

492
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:11,279
and he

493
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:12,959
found this this final that he gave to

494
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:14,160
the student florida

495
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,199
um

496
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,120
the the original guy overdosed in 1990

497
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,759
sadly apparently

498
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:23,359
and um you know

499
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:25,439
the piff was born

500
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,958
for lack of a better term um it's gotten

501
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,720
a bunch of names some people think it

502
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,558
smells like frankincense that's why the

503
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,038
church thing came out

504
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:34,639
and it sort of got it's it sort of got

505
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:36,640
hype in new york

506
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,400
um and as a result of that because there

507
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,559
was a bunch of money in it

508
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,519
um a bunch of other people bought the

509
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:46,558
exact same seed line from neville and l5

510
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:48,720
hayes and wanted to find their own pith

511
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:50,480
their own church their own heights haze

512
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,558
their own block work

513
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,759
um and so that's where

514
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:58,798
seemingly most of the phenoes come from

515
00:17:55,759 --> 00:18:03,279
almost all the good phenos of nl5 haze

516
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:03,279
come from 88 to 95

517
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,600
right

518
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:12,160
that seems like it's neville has

519
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:15,519
confirmed that sometime in 94 or 95 the

520
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:18,000
nl5 mother died at scentsy

521
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:20,400
um and so after that the cross was never

522
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,400
the same

523
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:24,319
people are asking also about

524
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,919
cuban black haze i don't know if you

525
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:28,879
want to go over that

526
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:31,360
cuban black haze is um

527
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,080
it's most likely just another it's just

528
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:37,119
another pheno of nl5 haze

529
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:39,519
um yeah if if people want to go over it

530
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:40,558
things that are likely in l5 haze are

531
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:43,440
pif

532
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:45,200
heights haze cuban black haze

533
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,320
the dog [ __ ]

534
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,798
um

535
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:49,839
you know all those things are nl5 nl5

536
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:53,918
hazes

537
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:58,000
and uh in europe a5 c5 there's multiple

538
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:59,919
copies of each one uh c5 me you know

539
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,119
it's that's neville's notation it meant

540
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:06,400
that it was haze c crossed to nl5 haze

541
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:08,719
um a5 means it was the a dad crossed a

542
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:12,240
nl58 nl5

543
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:14,880
um so there's a bunch of f1 hybrids that

544
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:17,120
are famous that float around europe some

545
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,400
of them have crept over here in the last

546
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:21,199
few years

547
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,080
i saw people talk about you know uh one

548
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,679
of the

549
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:24,798
one of the old guys that used to work

550
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,440
for neville

551
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:28,240
um in the 90s uh

552
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,480
yeah

553
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,319
and [ __ ] dog bud no they're not the same

554
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,279
thing no

555
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:36,399
actually

556
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:38,558
dog [ __ ] is a sad thing because it

557
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,480
it got named dog [ __ ] in oregon but

558
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:43,678
before it was in oregon it was from

559
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:46,079
minneapolis minnesota and its name was

560
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,759
electric bugaloo

561
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:50,480
much better name which is one of the

562
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:51,599
coolest names in cannabis in my opinion

563
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,240
um

564
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:56,000
but for whatever reason it got changed

565
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,599
but it is also

566
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,640
uh old early 90s nl5 haze vino of some

567
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:04,719
kind

568
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:07,759
snow bud is an old afghan from florida

569
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,798
um it used to be called skunk 5 in

570
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:11,119
florida

571
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:12,480
i actually know the people that drove it

572
00:20:11,119 --> 00:20:14,798
from

573
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,640
florida to oregon where it got renamed

574
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:18,319
snow bud

575
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,840
like a lot of things back then if you

576
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:22,000
were in eugene

577
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:24,720
oregon you called it the eugene snow bud

578
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,279
some people called it organ snow bud

579
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,960
people called it humboldt snow bud

580
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:32,720
um our buddy csi has had it for 20 plus

581
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,079
years

582
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,839
probably longer he probably got it in

583
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:38,158
the late 90s i think

584
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:40,319
um he's made a lot of hybrids with it

585
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,240
um it's an old

586
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:45,359
i don't know i mean it could be nl it

587
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,120
could be nl5 skunk one it could be any

588
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:49,439
the earliest name we can find on this

589
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:50,558
skunk five

590
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,240
and it got it

591
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:56,720
and it got renamed snow in oregon

592
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,000
and it was a very frosty

593
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,319
low terp

594
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,038
uh old afghan

595
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:05,359
kind of like the white but better

596
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:06,240
uh in my opinion

597
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:07,519
yeah

598
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,319
you know

599
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:12,879
um it it had low flavor but there were

600
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:14,399
some times when it tasted amazing

601
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,559
every once in a while you'd hit it out

602
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,480
of the park and it would have really

603
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:21,200
deep amazing flavor

604
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,720
um a lot of times though it was mild

605
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,720
or like the white i don't think anyone's

606
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,120
ever gotten it to taste good

607
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,558
uh it's kind of just like a

608
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:31,519
you know it's kind of just like a mild

609
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:33,359
potent afghan yeah

610
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:35,759

611
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:37,678
