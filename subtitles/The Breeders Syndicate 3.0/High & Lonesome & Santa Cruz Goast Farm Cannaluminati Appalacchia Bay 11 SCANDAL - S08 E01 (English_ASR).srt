to document this history before it's

14
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,340
written by corporations and others who

15
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,159

all right so let's start off hi and

42
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:35,459
let's talk about some of your new lines

43
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,859
that you have coming out we have of

44
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:39,359
course have your uh Appalachia which is

45
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:41,040
pretty well known for for many reasons

46
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:44,879
can you talk about it a little bit

47
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,219
yeah uh so that's a F3 I did I uh went

48
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:51,478
back and I had actually worked the line

49
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:52,379
to F5 and I wasn't really happy with

50
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:54,719
um

51
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:57,859
with what I had selected so I went back

52
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:00,739
to the f2s I popped 50 of them I um

53
00:01:57,859 --> 00:02:03,539
selected two males and three females and

54
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:07,259
uh kind of let them go at it I wanted

55
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:09,959
more of the green crack side coming

56
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:12,439
through on the turf

57
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:15,360
you know one thing you hear a lot about

58
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:17,520
Appalachia is about like the creamy

59
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,800
milky stuff coming through in crosses

60
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,599
yeah

61
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,780
I kind of I'm I'm more a fan of the

62
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:27,238
tropical side of the of the Green Crack

63
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,640
same

64
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:33,000
um that creaminess kind of came through

65
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:36,179
the trace dog mail that I used

66
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,060
all of those that are popped

67
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,459
um they were very potent like the uh on

68
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,939
the females but they didn't have

69
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:47,280
the rankness that you would expect with

70
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:49,378
a Kim D yeah

71
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,060
how did that cross to the Appalachia

72
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:53,098
like did it none of the rankness really

73
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,300
crossed over in the in the outcrosses

74
00:02:53,098 --> 00:02:58,378
did you see it in different Generations

75
00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:00,840
any of it um that's not not a ton no it

76
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:01,679
was more of like a sweet cream

77
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,319
um

78
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:08,040
you know you see it in Star dogs

79
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:11,280
um in uh Kim four too it's kind of like

80
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:14,818
a bit sweeter not as nasty not as like

81
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:18,120
disgusting garbage as can be yeah

82
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:20,579
um but yeah so so that that's kind of

83
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,099
what I did I wanted to go back to the F3

84
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,200
kind of narrow it down instead of

85
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:28,378
keeping it wide open narrow it down to

86
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,939
what I wanted out of it what I liked and

87
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:31,318
um what did you like about the green

88
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:32,878
crack that made you want to choose that

89
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:34,199
as a mom or was it just like one of the

90
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:35,759
moms that you happen to have in the room

91
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:37,679
when you were doing the run like what

92
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:40,019
was specifically going on in your mind

93
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,900
well originally when I did it

94
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:46,340
um I was doing quite a bit of outdoor uh

95
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:50,700
on the East Coast uh probably middle

96
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:53,939
2000s and uh Green Crack performed

97
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:56,158
extremely well outside it was um yeah

98
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:58,139
except it needed needed some staking

99
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,479
which you know when your Gorilla growing

100
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:02,818
you can't do you can't grill it you

101
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,919
can't you know it's it's a pain in the

102
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:06,780
ass so I wanted to put

103
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:09,598
um I wanted to put it on a little bit

104
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:12,060
more robust frame

105
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:15,539
um I'd had Kim D for a little bit at

106
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,918
that point and uh you know I was smoking

107
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:19,620
it a lot and that's what I wanted to

108
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:22,680
smoke yeah um but the plants were also

109
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:25,978
extremely robust so I crossed it to

110
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:30,000
Green Crack uh purple Urkle chemical or

111
00:04:25,978 --> 00:04:33,659
MD the uh an Acapulco Gold cut that I

112
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,918
had at the time and uh abusive uh OG

113
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:39,380
Kush oh no [ __ ] yeah

114
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:42,418
gold cross dude

115
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:44,639
I never grew that when I gave them all

116
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:48,299
out to friends and I never really heard

117
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:52,199
anything back about that the uh the only

118
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:54,660
two that have any kind of lasting value

119
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:58,080
are the of course the Green Crack cross

120
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:59,460
and the purple Oracle cross yeah and you

121
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:03,599
said there was a chem 4 tray dog too

122
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:05,459
right yes yeah yep I did that as well

123
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,680
and you know

124
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:10,500
um what I found in it was very similar

125
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,019
to stardog there was some really nice

126
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:16,199
chem type plants in there and you know

127
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:17,939
some stuff that wasn't wasn't as ranked

128
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:19,740
you know some some of that creamy

129
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:21,959
sweetness coming through but still you

130
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,460
know extremely good quality smoking

131
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:25,560
plants

132
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:29,459
do you think you got what you wanted out

133
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:32,939
initially out of the the trace dog

134
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:35,279
um I I kind of wish I had

135
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:39,538
gone back through some f2s I made a few

136
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:41,819
f2s but I never really pursued it and

137
00:05:39,538 --> 00:05:45,418
um you know at this point the seeds are

138
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:48,599
no longer viable unfortunately

139
00:05:45,418 --> 00:05:50,339
um but it's it's cool on there's um you

140
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,860
know I feel like if you F2 that you'd

141
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:55,619
open up a lot of stuff yeah

142
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:59,400
I mean Trace dog and chem four is kind

143
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:02,038
of like your own version of star dog

144
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:04,500
uh yeah right yeah yeah yeah I mean

145
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:06,899
isn't it isn't I mean it'd be a

146
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,939
different male or yeah it'd be a

147
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:11,459
different selection from the line

148
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:13,319
yeah yeah it was

149
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:15,538
um I just made a kind of personal amount

150
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:17,399
of them to go through it's like a I

151
00:06:15,538 --> 00:06:21,120
always like to keep like a doomsday

152
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:23,818
stash of seeds you know

153
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,319
all my friends and all my cuts and just

154
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:28,379
like you know

155
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:30,539
I'm you know oh just a nobody floating

156
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:32,939
around out there I can have something to

157
00:06:30,538 --> 00:06:35,818
go back to to look through even even

158
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:37,439
plants that I don't like out I usually

159
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:39,180
will pollinate them before I drop them

160
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,500
yeah because you just never know like

161
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,759
something down the line might trigger

162
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,019
that sense member and you're like I

163
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,699
really wish I had that even though at

164
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:48,180
the time it doesn't even seem

165
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:51,360
viable or feasible for sure

166
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:55,379
yep and just you know it's fun to waste

167
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:58,800
all that space yeah right and energy and

168
00:06:55,379 --> 00:07:00,600
time time money hey man one thing I

169
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,639
thought about before before we get too

170
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:05,400
far away from it it's just a point I

171
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,439
might make which is that uh it's really

172
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:11,339
cool if you're doing a multi-stage

173
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:13,319
breeding thing to save seeds from every

174
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:15,959
stage of it

175
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:19,680
right so that way if you feel like you

176
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:22,318
screw up which is often you can go back

177
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,120
and be like oh I'd want to redo it so he

178
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,680
was just talking about I took it to F5

179
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,360
and I didn't really like some of the

180
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,478
direction that it went so I then I went

181
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,860
back all the way a few generations and

182
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:33,899
started taking it a different direction

183
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:36,120
you know I hear about that like people

184
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:39,060
say they do that all the time but there

185
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,500
is very rarely any proof of anyone ever

186
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,598
doing that where like you've seen it

187
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,339
you've seen the seeds they were out

188
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:46,259
there's been x amount of years between

189
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:48,478
it and you know that that's possible and

190
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:51,060
I actually have the F5s of Appalachia

191
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:53,879
here from him so I know he took it to F5

192
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,379
and went back and I think that's that's

193
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:57,719
pretty commendable because you just

194
00:07:55,379 --> 00:08:00,360
don't see it very often yeah

195
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,840
I also think like too like the the era

196
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,939
that that Hein Lonesome is talking about

197
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:07,859
it was I think it was more common for

198
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:10,379
people to like play around and work

199
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,598
their own little lines a bit it was way

200
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:14,399
before there was like a bunch of like

201
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:16,978
American Seed sales or anything like

202
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:18,959
that happening so now it's kind of like

203
00:08:16,978 --> 00:08:20,519
you make seeds and it's a one-off and

204
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:22,318
they exist until they don't exist

205
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:23,878
anymore yeah

206
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,860
um but then I think it was a little bit

207
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:28,020
more common you know at least amongst

208
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,340
like weed nerds to like you know you

209
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:30,598
make something and then it kind of

210
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:32,158
becomes the base of what you're doing

211
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:35,218
and you cross it to this and you cross

212
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:36,599
it to that and you know it it and a lot

213
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:38,640
of it like you was saying it's all about

214
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:41,240
like I'm breeding for personal smoke

215
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:43,559
yeah

216
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,940
it gives you a lot more freedom than if

217
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,379
you're breeding for the market because

218
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,860
you're just breeding for things that you

219
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:52,439
like no it all you know the whole even

220
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:57,680
just growing it started by trying to

221
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,680
make sure I had the best quality weed

222
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,860
and I I think that's the best way to

223
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:03,859
breed

224
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:08,519
you're not being true to yourself if

225
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,440
you're not because how are you going to

226
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:12,959
enjoy the smoke and like go through tons

227
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,820
of different you know examples yeah and

228
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,259
not enjoy it and and pick a keeper that

229
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,120
you don't enjoy that's really hard to do

230
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:20,399
yeah you want to be stoked on what

231
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,379
you're doing right sure yeah you can

232
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,539
lose a lot of a lot of uh passion for

233
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:26,100
something real fast by by cheapening it

234
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:27,719
that way in my opinion I mean there's

235
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,339
some people out there that like all

236
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,959
their phenos and stuff that they they

237
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:32,760
get found get found by other people

238
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:35,399
because those breeders don't crack them

239
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:37,679
themselves oh yeah they make them name

240
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:39,659
them package them sell them and then

241
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:41,099
they find out through others whether or

242
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:42,719
not anything good happened

243
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,220
oh yeah

244
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,899
you know I would say that's kind of

245
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,879
become the standard these days a little

246
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:49,379
bit but in the era that Ian Lonesome is

247
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:51,600
talking about which is

248
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:54,720
you know 15 plus years ago or whatever I

249
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,459
don't think that was the standard then

250
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,620
um you could get rid of anything back

251
00:09:56,458 --> 00:10:00,659
then oh yeah

252
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,159
and before we stray too far I do want to

253
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:03,360
to ask because I know this is going to

254
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:06,299
be the number one question people want

255
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,240
to know when did you meet

256
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:12,799
be Bodhi and when did he acquire the

257
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,799
Appalachia from you to work

258
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:20,399
um so he and I had been you know

259
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:22,680
chatting and exchanging seeds on uh I

260
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,000
think it might have originally been I

261
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:27,659
see mag

262
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,519
um but probably 06 ish

263
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:31,740
um you know he'd send me a few things he

264
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,440
made I'd send him a few things I made

265
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:37,080
and I uh when I did the uh Trey style

266
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,980
crosses I believe I sent all of them to

267
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,500
him

268
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,240
um just for him to check out and

269
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:45,299
um I didn't even know he had popped any

270
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,120
until he uh hit me up asking if it was

271
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:51,240
okay if he released some seeds that he

272
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:53,519
had made with the Appalachia

273
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,440
um I think you know

274
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,879
I I'm not sure it was something that he

275
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,440
meant to do but that's just kind of how

276
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:00,539
it worked out

277
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,540
um and he made some really cool stuff

278
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:06,059
and I mean people are still popping it

279
00:11:03,539 --> 00:11:09,059
people are still passing out cuts from

280
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:11,338
those seeds that's um it was definitely

281
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:12,838
a very comprehensive job he did of

282
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:13,940
Crossing it to everything relevant at

283
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,279
that time

284
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:18,899
I know it's a very common sentiment that

285
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:20,578
a lot of people feel that some of their

286
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:23,339
favorite stuff came from that you know

287
00:11:20,578 --> 00:11:25,559
like the the Appalachia crosses and one

288
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:27,360
of my favorite moments ever in life was

289
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:29,278
being able to to watch you and Buddy

290
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:33,120
meet in person for the first time and

291
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:36,860
then right away in the sunset

292
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,860
how sweet is that dude together

293
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:43,799
yeah he's a hell of a nice guy yeah

294
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,079
that's you know you meet him in person

295
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:49,199
and he's actually genuine you know it's

296
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:51,479
it's a rare thing but he's as nice as he

297
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,640
comes off and just a hell of a cool guy

298
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,079
yeah you know it's you know we were all

299
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:57,379
holding hands stirring out the windows

300
00:11:55,078 --> 00:12:00,120
you guys drove off

301
00:11:57,379 --> 00:12:01,519
too bad it wasn't into the sunset you

302
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,899
know

303
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:07,019
right it was just almost a little bit

304
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:10,379
past Sunrise I think everybody has a

305
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:12,360
flow going on though yeah yeah I had I

306
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:15,500
had a nice uh pregnant glow the next

307
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,500
morning yeah

308
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,600
not some of your stuff dude like uh yeah

309
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,759
man you kind of popped out of the

310
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,399
Woodworks with uh some old Cuts you have

311
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:28,379
an old Afghan cut that you work with

312
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,720
um you work with a lot of train wreck

313
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:32,519
stuff uh one of your big releases your

314
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,160
first big drop was a train wreck

315
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:37,320
reversal and you hit a few things uh do

316
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:40,259
you want to talk about some of that

317
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:43,139
sure man you know uh

318
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:44,639
where where do I begin you know I've uh

319
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:46,320
what was kind of had interest in

320
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,659
genetics you know just growing over the

321
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,700
years and what have you but um

322
00:12:48,659 --> 00:12:53,278
initially when I got into the game it

323
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:55,800
was all clones for me you know and my

324
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:57,659
crew and so you know you come across the

325
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:59,819
occasional seat pack or somebody you

326
00:12:57,659 --> 00:13:01,740
know like we'd shoot up to uh where is

327
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,879
it up to PC and grab things once in a

328
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,740
while

329
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:07,320
um not being stirs but you know whatever

330
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,419
seems I had hidden in the corners up

331
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,760
there in Gaslamp area

332
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:13,439
um so you know as much as seeds were

333
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:15,360
available and like not so I was told

334
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,399
stories you know a lot of that was going

335
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,839
on down down south from where I was at

336
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:20,399
that point I was

337
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,920
where I'm thinking is when I was living

338
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,839
up in Humboldt uh up in the northern

339
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:26,939
part of the county

340
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:28,139
um you know seeds were prolific down

341
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,820
there right there was a reason that

342
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:31,200
generations of people you know breeding

343
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,519
and whatnot but clones are just so

344
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,980
accessible back in the day that there

345
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:36,419
wasn't really a need to go hunting and

346
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,860
try to find whatever

347
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:39,479
um so it always kind of been on my radar

348
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,980
but it never been necessarily something

349
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,740
I turned towards

350
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:45,360
and then uh you know

351
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,100
um being in the game long enough you

352
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,720
come across certain cuts that you just

353
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,759
fall in love with even if they fall out

354
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,139
of style and what have you and

355
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:54,299
you know

356
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:55,919
um I caught on pretty quick in the 2000s

357
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:57,419
you know to the kind of turnover of

358
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:58,979
things you know you'd see something just

359
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,838
be prolific and then would disappear and

360
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:03,000
you wouldn't see it again and so it

361
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,399
determined that I would have to you know

362
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,559
hold on to some of these things and see

363
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:09,120
where that goes and so just you know

364
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:10,799
years pass and all of a sudden you

365
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,360
become this keeper of

366
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:15,240
whatever the hell you thought was good

367
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:18,139
from way back when and um so that's kind

368
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,759
of in terms of just what my

369
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:22,860
uh you know the way my path was laid out

370
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:24,778
with the whole garden scene so so you

371
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,500
know fast forward to now

372
00:14:24,778 --> 00:14:27,240
um

373
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,740
you know I've always been on on the DL

374
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,120
for the most part with what I do and I

375
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,579
didn't really have a big intention of

376
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,799
riding the wave into the legal market

377
00:14:32,578 --> 00:14:38,278
and try to go too heavy there

378
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:38,278
um there

379
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,339
um and uh and so I decided Well you know

380
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:52,859
hey man this is part of my life right

381
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:55,260
I'm not gonna just move on it's growing

382
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:57,180
as my therapy and so

383
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:58,980
um but I also am kind of bored here and

384
00:14:57,179 --> 00:15:01,439
I don't feel like living by the

385
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,000
algorithm of the garden so to speak like

386
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,399
I had for so many years and I needed

387
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,440
some kind of pivot right so

388
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:09,539
um just like anything you know consider

389
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,019
doing that for years but played around

390
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:14,819
but then uh you know uh come the time

391
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:16,799
that I I'm starting to get real bored

392
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,660
not wanting to to move forward growing

393
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:20,159
weight anymore I thought you know this

394
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:22,319
is that right time to have fun right and

395
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:25,019
get into the genetic side of things

396
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,519
um yeah and so what do I do you know

397
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:29,220
I'll just kind of tick what I had in my

398
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:31,259
uh Armory and started messing around and

399
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:33,360
here we are how did you find the crew in

400
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:35,039
the first place

401
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,379
it's a good question

402
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:40,439
um this crew right here this crew I came

403
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:42,838
across I came across you guys you know

404
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,940
unlike some some of the other cats in

405
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:46,440
this in this field like I stayed true to

406
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:48,300
trying to stay under the radar so I

407
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,480
never got into the forums back in the

408
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:53,159
day and I mean not so nose boot you know

409
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,480
send people to go buy your supplies at

410
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:57,539
the store and not have your license

411
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,039
plate get uh oh yeah or whatever so I'm

412
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:01,379
just kind of always abided by that code

413
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:02,039
and never got onto the forums and then

414
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:04,799
um

415
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:08,399

416
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:10,379
16 17 18 something like that and

417
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,179
started thinking about reversals I'm

418
00:16:10,379 --> 00:16:14,039
like hey man I got this this tdub cut

419

437
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,680
somebody relatively solid in the field

438
00:16:56,698 --> 00:17:00,659
or whatever you know what it for me what

439
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:02,698

ever since I've lost that cut I have had

443
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,980
people telling me heck up I got that cut

444

don't worry I got it and not once has

445
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:15,240
anyone ever been able to show me bud of

446
00:17:12,838 --> 00:17:17,279
it I've seen pictures of stuff that look

447
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,838
just like it but when I would get it it

448
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:20,160
would smell like [ __ ] flow or

449
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:23,220
something like that you know it just was

450
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,839
awesome it would look just like it and

451
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:27,058
then he brought it down and I was like

452
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:29,519
holy [ __ ] not only does he have real

453
00:17:27,058 --> 00:17:32,058
blue dream he has train wreck too he's a

454
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:34,980
little time capsules

455
00:17:32,058 --> 00:17:37,740
it wasn't just that it was how well they

456
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:40,140
were grown how well they were cured all

457
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,640
of it it was I hit all the points and I

458
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:44,340
was like God this guy cares about his

459
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:46,259
[ __ ] weed a lot you know he cares

460
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:48,480
about good weed and that's kind of where

461
00:17:46,259 --> 00:17:49,980
I I realized like this this is legit I

462
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,440
want to see where this dude what did

463
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:55,919
what this dude's story is and without

464
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,419
going into detail too much detail

465
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,799
um obviously you come from like the surf

466
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:00,780
background right

467
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:03,660
yeah you could say that I mean Central

468
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:05,220
Coast Coastal Life yeah for sure I mean

469
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:07,440
I'm not I'm not a big I'm not a big

470
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:09,360
Surfer I was a skater snowboarder kind

471
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,179
of but that was a part of your culture

472
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:13,798
who you hung out the kind of yeah why

473
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:15,960
you would have had access to these

474
00:18:13,798 --> 00:18:17,639
certain clones in the first place yeah

475
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,980
yeah it's definitely tied in it's tied

476
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,840
into the whole lifestyle of just you

477
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:24,298
know growing up in the in the 90s over

478
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:25,199
here on the Central Coast like you were

479
00:18:24,298 --> 00:18:28,019
getting away from him if you couldn't

480
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,400
find way you found a surfer but yeah you

481
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:31,500
know I was I was selling the weed to the

482
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,179
Surfers so you know

483
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,160
and Surfers usually had a pretty good

484
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:36,660
choice of weed back then like a lot of

485
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,759
them would travel around the world get

486
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:40,679
some of the best wheat on Earth so to

487
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:43,619
have it having the kind of clientele you

488
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:44,519
did without being specific it

489
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:47,159
um

490
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:49,558
I learned you know

491
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,179
that you had to perform better than

492
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:52,379
others to have the kind of clientele you

493
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:55,080
did at the time

494
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:56,940
which I took notice of and why why I

495
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:58,678
realized you you had gotten so good at

496
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,058
curing and drying and all that other

497
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:02,220
stuff because they were they were pretty

498
00:19:00,058 --> 00:19:03,538
high in clientele well and they're

499
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,940
pretty picky man you know I mean yeah

500
00:19:03,538 --> 00:19:07,440
their dads were Growers and they grew up

501
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,840
in the whole scene and they're around

502
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,880
the world yeah so exactly you can't you

503
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:13,259
can't bring schwag to those dudes and be

504
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,200
like yeah I want a good price for this

505
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:18,660
that's just not gonna happen no no one

506
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,519
thing one thing maybe I should interject

507
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,080
is like since high and Lonesome was

508
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:23,879
talking about Green Crack and now we're

509
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:25,980
talking with pack about blue dream and

510
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,020
train wreck is that there's some of

511
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:31,079
these things that like they became

512
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:32,879
famous long enough ago and then kind of

513
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:34,980
fell out of favor long enough ago that

514
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,200
people probably mostly only hear legends

515
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,240
about them to some degree and a lot of

516
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,100
people like Matt was saying get fakes or

517
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,259
you know or get it poorly grown for

518
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:45,119
whatever reason seed versions where they

519
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:47,819
use the name one of the things that

520
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:50,639
sucks about that is that often people

521
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:54,480
talk about why they got burned out on a

522
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:58,259
certain cut not why that cut had lasting

523
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:00,000
fans to begin with yeah yeah you know

524
00:19:58,259 --> 00:20:01,798
and I think with both with the three

525
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,919
things I just named with you know Green

526
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:07,379
Crack or with uh you know train wreck or

527
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:09,240
blue dream all three of those you know

528
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,740
uh there's a reason there's there's a

529
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,140
bunch of reasons why they got popular

530
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:15,359
and people really enjoyed them yeah and

531
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:17,160
then they

532
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:19,079
um you know they ended up getting burned

533
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:22,140
out you know because people were growing

534
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:23,819
huge amounts of it and once huge amounts

535
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:26,940
of it start growing a lot of people

536
00:20:23,819 --> 00:20:28,918
start doing it poorly yeah you know and

537
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:31,019
and then all of a sudden it gets a bad

538
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:33,660
reputation and then something moves on

539
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:35,339
and people lose track of the quality and

540
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,440
like you were saying like maybe only a

541
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:40,319
few people end up holding on to it

542
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:43,200
and then people are surprised at how

543
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:46,700
good this thing they've heard of

544
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,960
but maybe in derogatory terms oh yeah

545
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,819
you know and I don't mean you know I

546
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,740
just like there was a lot for me like

547
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:55,379
when when high and Lonesome was talking

548
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:57,240
I was thinking about how you know like

549
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:59,160
basically once people in like Grass

550
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:01,140
Valley and certain other regions got

551
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:03,620
green crack and started growing seven to

552
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:07,259
ten pound outdoor plants

553
00:21:03,619 --> 00:21:08,879
that kind of like mid Z Green Crack is

554
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:11,460
what blue

555
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,039
got turned people away from it but it

556
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:16,380
became accessible yeah but you know

557
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:18,119
Green Crack is you know in extracts and

558
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,919
something like that it actually has a

559
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:21,538
bunch of really nice Terps it has a

560
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,720
bunch of really nice structure to it it

561
00:21:21,538 --> 00:21:28,140
has a very like cool flavor done well

562
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,960
you know yeah indoor 70-day green crack

563
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:34,080
is tough to beat it yeah really good

564
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,058
like yeah I'm looking so far too right

565
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:37,740
he just said the other thing that

566
00:21:36,058 --> 00:21:40,079
happens to people is they grow it too

567
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:42,240
big and then they end up taking it 10 or

568
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:45,298
12 days early because it's it's done

569
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,159
enough to pass oh yeah makes all the

570
00:21:45,298 --> 00:21:49,440
difference too so then the market gets

571
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:51,059
flooded with a bunch of you know I mean

572
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,500
it definitely happened with green crack

573
00:21:51,058 --> 00:21:54,839
it definitely both happened with blue

574
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:57,240
dream and train wreck all three sort of

575
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:59,298
suffered the same fate and that they

576
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:02,819
could be enough of a production plant

577
00:21:59,298 --> 00:22:05,099
that they got over produced and people

578
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:06,418
thought the production version was the

579
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:09,178
version

580
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:11,640
when in reality so damn it

581
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:13,440
I think Blue Dream took a bigger hit I

582
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,299
think Blue Dream took a much bigger hit

583
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,580
than just that

584
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:19,679
um Green Crack didn't because I I knew

585
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:20,939
who was who was releasing seeds of it

586
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,259
and who wasn't and there weren't a lot

587
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,460
of Siege released to Green Crack there

588
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:25,558
were like green crack seeds out there

589
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:28,079
you could buy up in Mass you know but

590
00:22:25,558 --> 00:22:30,720
Blue Dream the second that thing kicked

591
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:33,119
off we had Emerald Triangle seeds which

592
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,980
was I believe made in Spain

593
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:36,119
um there was a you had Humboldt Seeds

594
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,460
you had all these different companies

595
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:41,219
releasing their versions of what blue

596
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:42,900
dream was which was whatever bulk

597
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:45,900
Spanish company was pushing out as their

598
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:48,500
blueberry Haze I mean and that's what

599
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:50,720
cuts got passed around is blue dream

600
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:54,058
I'm saying Vince

601
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:57,659
yeah yeah exactly yeah I'm convinced hnl

602
00:22:54,058 --> 00:23:00,658
that like in the in the dab era uh Green

603
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:03,120
Crack has been named renamed papaya

604
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:05,700
oh yeah a lot of a lot of those like

605
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:07,798
tropical Terps and stuff like that like

606
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:11,298
they would never call it a green crack

607
00:23:07,798 --> 00:23:14,099
extract no right

608
00:23:11,298 --> 00:23:17,359
Green Crack rosin and they'd be like oh

609
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:20,759
this is the papaya yeah

610
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:23,819
papaya this is the papaya you know this

611
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:26,819
is some tropical fruity and not to say

612
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:28,678
that natto has any knowledge that the

613
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:30,240
papaya strain out there from the

614
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:32,820
specific company is Green Crack he's

615
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:36,359
saying that's a probably what happens oh

616
00:23:32,819 --> 00:23:37,918
well you know even 15 years ago when

617
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:40,859
people didn't want to buy green crack

618
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:45,000
around here it went as mango it went as

619
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:46,199
papaya fish yeah yeah it just you know

620
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,119
that happens

621
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,019
there's half a dozen names for blue

622
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:51,959
dream

623
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:53,879
oh yeah and maybe even more that got

624
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,500
made because people got blown out on it

625
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,940
and they're like oh this isn't that this

626
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:00,058
is Blue Dragon

627
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:03,360
yes this is you know it reminds me of

628
00:24:00,058 --> 00:24:06,178
your Barry White story yeah yeah

629
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:08,459
you know I mean it's true and uh and but

630
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:11,159
you know the point that I'll I'll scroll

631
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:13,319
back on is that if you take somebody who

632
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:16,080
knows the strain like say pack or high

633
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:18,720
in Lonesome and they grow a nice two

634
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:20,339
three four six ounce plant either in a

635
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,919
greenhouse or in an indoor environment

636
00:24:20,339 --> 00:24:25,859
people are going to be blown away by how

637
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:27,720
good it is oh yeah

638
00:24:25,859 --> 00:24:29,939
blew over the party away I think people

639
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,860
have forgotten absolutely why those

640
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,480
things got so popular in the first place

641
00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:34,979
and they only think they got popular

642
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,620
because you could get an eight pound

643
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:40,019
outdoor plant that was bigger yeah yeah

644
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:42,959
and that's not what got them popular in

645
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:46,400
the beginning at all it's just not yeah

646
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,000
it was a grow in somebody's closet

647
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,880
yep

648
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,720
I mean a three ounce a three ounce Green

649
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:56,640
Crack plant is delicious yeah

650
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:58,679
it really is you know I think a four

651
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,299
ounce Blue Dream is damn Delicious

652
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:02,820
especially how long did you take it

653
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:04,500
packed this last time uh for the party I

654
00:25:02,819 --> 00:25:07,038
pulled it early actually yeah I know

655
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:11,400
it's weird yeah I think I pulled it at

656
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:14,279
60 60 61 days maybe and it was super

657
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:17,820
Berry for me yeah it was nice that was

658
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:19,940
the best I've ever had for sure

659
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:23,899
that was killer

660
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:26,340
when you grow a cut for you know

661
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:28,919
you better you better put out some work

662
00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:31,019
some good work after you know 20 years I

663
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:33,000
mean really what one of the things I you

664
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:35,158
know I remember talking to CSI about

665
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,278
this probably I don't know eight years

666
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:39,900
ago or something where in his mind going

667
00:25:38,278 --> 00:25:42,839
back to what pack was saying about where

668
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:45,360
he was up in Humboldt and stuff uh train

669
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:48,359
wreck was one of the first named clones

670
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:51,119
yeah yeah that really spread around the

671
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:52,859
growing Community deeply in that zone

672
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:54,658
like there was lots of seeds and there

673
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:57,240
was lots of name stuff that got like

674
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:59,520
here and there it popped up but like

675
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,980
train wreck really kind of had its

676
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:03,298
moment hey man that was the first strain

677
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,798
that you started seeing people wear

678
00:26:03,298 --> 00:26:06,000
t-shirts with the name train wreck

679
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:08,339
across the front

680
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,319
oh really I've never seen the shirts for

681
00:26:08,339 --> 00:26:13,079
sure yeah humble humble clothing company

682
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:15,960
I think it was up in up in Arcata uh

683
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:17,819
2001 something like that they they got

684
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:20,400
smart and started marketing strains on

685
00:26:17,819 --> 00:26:22,319
shirts and yeah there weren't many but

686
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,059
Trainwreck was the one that was like you

687
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:26,158
know what you saw perfect and you're

688
00:26:24,058 --> 00:26:28,500
right and you know what uh we never

689
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,299
referred to it or at least my crew being

690
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,558
up in Arcada it was never the Arcata

691
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:35,639
train wreck until

692
00:26:31,558 --> 00:26:37,079
years later yeah as a signifier you know

693
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,640
in terms of where it came from it was

694
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:41,220
just track it was t-dub or train ride

695
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,799
yeah yeah I think that popped up on the

696
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:46,200
forums as a designator you know once

697
00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:48,359
once it started to be a few fake cuts

698
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,278
and you know people would talk a lot

699
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:54,418
about the you know this is the arcade to

700
00:26:50,278 --> 00:26:55,220
cut or this is the e32 yeah 32 crew or

701
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:57,600
whatever

702
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:59,460
lemon rack was another one that was

703
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:01,918
floating around at that point yeah yeah

704
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:04,319
it seemed to pop up once uh people

705
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,240
started releasing seeds I think the

706
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:08,278
Dutch

707
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:09,500
started started messing with it and uh

708
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:14,400
wood horse

709
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:17,159
was it it was tuck and wood horse yeah

710
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:19,320
tuck and wood horse the big train I

711
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:21,179
remember using name dropping him again

712
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:23,038
but I remember when uh even though

713
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:24,480
they're discredited when philos first

714
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:27,538
came out or something

715
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:31,380
uh CSI called me up and he goes do you

716
00:27:27,538 --> 00:27:34,679
want to know what uh what DNA's uh Lemon

717
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:37,640
Skunk tests as and I was all what and

718
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:39,659
he's all Green Crack oh yeah

719
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,799
unfortunately yeah I mean like it kind

720
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:43,140
of makes sense like if they're both

721
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:45,240
skunk one they would kind of like maybe

722
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,679
show up in some range together

723
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,319
oh yeah

724
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:50,940
but I I just think like there's you know

725
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:53,579
and train wreck also the other thing

726
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:55,679
train wreck got known for was that it

727
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:58,259
was the like but long before anyone used

728
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:01,500
the word terpenoline

729
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:03,960
um you know uh train wreck Terps yeah

730
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,819
exactly yeah it got it got kind of a

731
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,980
moniker of like oh people didn't know

732
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:09,720
what that terp was but train wreck was

733
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:11,159
famous and well known I'm like oh this

734
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,659
kind of smells like train wreck to me

735
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:14,659
yeah it's got a train wreck smell

736
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:23,039
yeah

737
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:24,840
right you know but those it's so it's

738
00:28:23,038 --> 00:28:26,400
kind of like it's it's almost a bad

739
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:28,798
thing I don't want to say it's almost a

740
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:31,679
bad thing but any strain that has the

741
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:33,900
potential to be blown out huge

742
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:36,480
has the potential to get a bad

743
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:39,538
reputation because people only try it

744
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:42,000
blown out huge not dried right not cured

745
00:28:39,538 --> 00:28:43,919
right like Matt was saying about Pack's

746
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,839
ability to dry it and cure it and treat

747
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:47,820
it nicely

748
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:49,500
um and so sometimes even getting a good

749
00:28:47,819 --> 00:28:51,119
example of what made something famous

750
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:53,700
can be harder

751
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:56,879
yeah sure yeah and and I'll tell you

752
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:58,200
what man you know there's there's times

753
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,179
where I put it out and I won't smoke

754
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,038
that [ __ ] because I'm like no that's not

755
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:04,440
no I don't want to share that with

756
00:29:02,038 --> 00:29:08,720
somebody yeah for sure it's not

757
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,720
oh yeah we all have this Those runs

758
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:13,259
our buddy uh our you know we had some

759
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:14,939
friends of ours at the Gathering that we

760
00:29:13,259 --> 00:29:16,259
had or whatever that are quite a bit

761
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:19,500
younger than us

762
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:22,319
and it was really cool to have them try

763
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:24,778
some of the classics yeah that it faded

764
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:28,319
from popularity like long before they

765
00:29:24,778 --> 00:29:30,960
came onto the scene yeah yeah that was

766
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:32,579
really neat for me actually you know it

767
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,679
was that's where I noticed like the kids

768
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:36,960
love the blue green dude like this is

769
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:39,538
Blue Dream what this is what it's like

770
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,000
what were people talking about just

771
00:29:39,538 --> 00:29:45,240
watching HML push Trainwreck on poor

772
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,839
local now oh my God how'd that go I

773
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,839
didn't see that part

774
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:57,058
it's 10 o'clock man I'm way older than

775
00:29:55,019 --> 00:29:58,859
you you need to get here

776
00:29:57,058 --> 00:30:02,538
you need to go take a train wreck bong

777
00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:02,538
hit it

778
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:07,380
this is where this is right before I put

779
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:09,799
a Sharpie in his in his pocket to wake

780
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,799
him up

781
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:15,120
I was listening to an interview that

782
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:16,919
pack had uh did not very long ago last

783
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:18,658
week or something yeah and I remember

784
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:20,460
you talking about like train wreck was

785
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:22,140
the weed that like you pulled some bong

786
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:25,019
rips right before you had to do a bunch

787
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:27,059
of work oh yeah like if it was get after

788
00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:28,379
it weed you know it gave you that buzz

789
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:31,379
where you felt like you could get some

790
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:32,880
[ __ ] done absolutely and particularly so

791
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:35,220
much so if you if you pulled a little

792
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,140
bit early you know like you can train

793
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,399
wreck's got such a range of when you can

794
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:40,080
pull it and what you want to get off of

795
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:41,759
it sure does you pulled a little bit

796
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:43,319
early and it's just so much more Speedy

797
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:45,778
you know yeah

798
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:47,639
I feel like that's part of uh part of

799
00:30:45,778 --> 00:30:50,398
what gave it its reputation of you know

800
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:52,440
big blown out plants pulled it you know

801
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:55,199
50 days because it it looks good enough

802
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:58,380
at 50 days at seven weeks you can yank

803
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:01,019
it yeah that's why Green Crack was big

804
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:03,120
with us because like you pound it out

805
00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:04,859
yeah it's all about getting 700 of them

806
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:07,918
in in a year if you're doing them door

807
00:31:04,859 --> 00:31:09,599
you know yeah maybe that that's the and

808
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:11,278
that's another key why people end up

809
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:13,678
getting feel like something's not that

810
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:16,619
great I can't even tell you how much

811
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:20,038
Sour Diesel in Mendocino County was

812
00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:22,798
pulled as soon as it was good enough to

813
00:31:20,038 --> 00:31:25,259
go oh yeah like it probably should have

814
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:27,240
gone into the mid 70s and it hit 60 and

815
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:28,558
they're like it's ready hey man you're

816
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,058
not doing it for the love at that point

817
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:32,519
though you know what I'm saying no I get

818
00:31:30,058 --> 00:31:34,798
it but you know but it's like people

819
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:36,480
just don't I don't think people see like

820
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:39,240
that's the part about love that I don't

821
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:42,058
think people get where it's like you

822
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:43,859
know if you it's hard to come across

823
00:31:42,058 --> 00:31:45,359
people that know how to grow it the

824
00:31:43,859 --> 00:31:47,819
right way that will take it the right

825
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:49,678
amount of time that'll dry it and cure

826
00:31:47,819 --> 00:31:52,379
it the right way so you get that full

827
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:55,440
effect there's a lot of it's good enough

828
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:58,080
to go yeah yeah and it's good enough for

829
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,880
the the buyer won't reject it hey man

830
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:01,558
I'll tell you what I can't say I'm not

831
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,000
guilty of that in my past you know

832
00:32:01,558 --> 00:32:04,859
especially at certain points in time

833
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,038
where it was more economically feasible

834
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:10,678
than you know just for the love but I

835
00:32:08,038 --> 00:32:12,240
think when you stay in it long enough at

836
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:14,759
least for me it's like you kind of

837
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,839
mature into your grower status right

838
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:17,879
like

839
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:19,199
starting off written High Times I want

840
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,700
to grow everything I got to get it all

841
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,200
whatever but then you start to kind of

842
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:24,740
not only dial in the plant but you dial

843
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,740
in your style

844
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,159
it was a different world too you know

845
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,119
consumers

846
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:36,299
there wasn't you know as many

847
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:37,500
connoisseurs people just they wanted a

848
00:32:36,298 --> 00:32:40,319
bag of weed

849
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:42,179
um and you know they wanted to be pretty

850
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:44,220
and taste good and you know if you could

851
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:46,919
accomplish that and then get a buzz it

852
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:49,500
was all good to be fair like if I was

853
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:51,299
doing something outside like any of the

854
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:53,819
things we just mentioned and it was fall

855
00:32:51,298 --> 00:32:56,339
I could probably let it go if I got good

856
00:32:53,819 --> 00:32:59,158
weather until it was perfect right yeah

857
00:32:56,339 --> 00:33:01,798
but if I'm dapping it and it's 90 to 100

858
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:03,539
degrees every day in Mendo I'm gonna hit

859
00:33:01,798 --> 00:33:04,558
a point where it's all downhill from

860
00:33:03,538 --> 00:33:07,319
here

861
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:09,298
and I might not get that last five to

862
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:10,918
seven days that I would prefer out of it

863
00:33:09,298 --> 00:33:13,200
because it's going to go south because

864
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:14,580
it's 98 and it's hot and the flowers the

865
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,519
calyxes are going to start to yellow

866
00:33:14,579 --> 00:33:19,379
it's going to start to get beat up I

867
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:22,380
gotta pay my rent you know yeah yeah

868
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:24,659
yeah you know here we had we had

869
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:27,120
hurricanes every call you know or most

870
00:33:24,659 --> 00:33:30,360
every fall and so you know in October

871
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:31,859
you might get you know six inches of

872
00:33:30,359 --> 00:33:33,839
rain in a week

873
00:33:31,859 --> 00:33:36,599
um you know it just it can be terrible

874
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:39,418
and so sometimes it was good enough to

875
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:41,398
go October one you know it's done

876
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:43,080
I try to explain that to people all the

877
00:33:41,398 --> 00:33:45,178
time when it comes to like nature

878
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:48,178
farming you know where you're using

879
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:50,100
using the Sun or whatever that uh all

880
00:33:48,179 --> 00:33:53,460
downhill from here is an important

881
00:33:50,099 --> 00:33:55,439
decision to come to yeah it is I mean it

882
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:57,659
really is key because you can you can be

883
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,778
like oh I can make it better and then

884
00:33:57,659 --> 00:34:01,980
you're like I just made it worse yeah I

885
00:34:00,778 --> 00:34:03,659
mean one of the reasons one of the

886
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:05,640
reasons why I stuck to indoor growing

887
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:07,200
because you know you get to play God in

888
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:10,260
terms of how long something's going to

889
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,280
go and I mean obviously you know there's

890
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:13,740
there's

891
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,720
good and bad with both but um it's it's

892
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:18,059
an interesting uh distinction because as

893
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:19,500
an indoor grower mainly you know that

894
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:21,239
wasn't a consideration right what time

895
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:23,280
of the year it was unless you know I

896
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:25,079
didn't have the right kind of insulation

897
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,080
in the place that I'm growing or whatnot

898
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:31,679
sure um yeah

899
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:33,000
here we used I mean you know indoor

900
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,338
you know not that a lot of people

901
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,898
wouldn't go outside or whatever but the

902
00:34:35,338 --> 00:34:38,639
problem up here was that it got so hot

903
00:34:36,898 --> 00:34:39,659
and dry we always used to call it summer

904
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,539
bud

905
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:44,280
yeah same same here like you knew that

906
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:45,779
you knew the indoor summer Bud even just

907
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,700
because it was like you cannot keep your

908
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:49,679
[ __ ] under a hundred just because it's

909
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:52,759
like people were running Mini Splits

910
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:55,378
back in the day you know no it was minis

911
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:57,960
we didn't you know it didn't that kind

912
00:34:55,378 --> 00:35:00,059
of technology is all the stuff that's

913
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:02,460
common now I don't think people realized

914
00:35:00,059 --> 00:35:06,380
how slowly we had some of us adopted it

915
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:06,380
remember how hot the lights were

916
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,920
where I had three exposed bulbs hanging

917
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:25,200
in the middle and you had to get in

918
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,539
there to do whatever that was always so

919
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:28,618
brutal

920
00:35:26,539 --> 00:35:31,279
dude like you know I always heard these

921
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:31,280
wives tales

922
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:37,500
River seeing my skin hanging off a bulb

923
00:35:35,338 --> 00:35:38,940
and sizzling and it being just fine and

924
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,679
it was it was cooking the skin just fine

925
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:42,480
it didn't explode and I always heard

926
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:44,338
like yeah don't get your finger oils on

927
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,920
that bulb it'll blow up so I was always

928
00:35:44,338 --> 00:35:48,239
water yeah I don't know people like

929
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,579
finger oils like so I'd always like

930
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:54,118
screw them in all careful like oh yeah

931
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:57,440
I'd always like grab them yeah and screw

932
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:57,440
it in because I didn't want it

933
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,659
don't need them exploding

934
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:05,579
I don't know

935
00:36:03,659 --> 00:36:07,319
maybe that's true there was a couple

936
00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:08,780
times in life where like they hit the

937
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:11,720
top of my ear

938
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:14,339
that was pretty sensitive spot yeah

939
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:16,980
cause I'm a tall I'm a tall guy you know

940
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:20,759
and so yeah me too you're moving around

941
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:22,260
and you're trying to yeah you know but

942
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,820
yeah

943
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:26,640
but one of the things that we should

944
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:27,900
mention too is that you know and I don't

945
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:30,239
know high and Lonesome if you want to

946
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:33,240
talk about this but I would imagine that

947
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:37,139
when you were crossing uh Trace dog to

948
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:38,578
uh you know to Green Crack

949
00:36:37,139 --> 00:36:39,838
um maybe you could talk for a minute

950
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:41,460
about like something that I'm always

951
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:43,259
interested in which is like what you

952
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:45,539
were hoping each parent was going to

953
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:49,859
bring to the children

954
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:52,679
um yeah well um you know basically the

955
00:36:49,858 --> 00:36:56,098
only issues I had with spring crack

956
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:57,239
um were the structure of the plant and

957
00:36:56,099 --> 00:37:02,579
then

958
00:36:57,239 --> 00:37:05,639
um the uh the structure and the high of

959
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:07,740
the plant so I wanted to get something

960
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:10,319
with a little bit more robust structure

961
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:13,679
and something that you know had a little

962
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:15,780
more uh not depth to the high because I

963
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:17,819
think the care the character of Green

964
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:20,579
Crack is really nice but just something

965
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:22,500
that maybe hits you a little bit harder

966
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:25,260
behind the eyes yeah it's still a skunk

967
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:28,800
one high at the end of the day yeah I

968
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:31,380
mean yeah yeah I mean green crack in my

969
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,660
opinion is just skunk one um it's yeah

970
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:35,700
probably my favorite yeah yeah it's

971
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:37,679
really good one it's definitely my

972
00:37:35,699 --> 00:37:41,659
favorite of the skunk one type plants so

973
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:41,659
I have big margin yeah yeah

974
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:48,419
you know cheese is great I have run that

975
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:50,759
several times over the years I just

976
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:53,820
I can't smoke it but so much but

977
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:56,720
something about the like rotten mango

978
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:59,400
Green Crack is just so appealing

979
00:37:56,719 --> 00:38:01,078
and another one of your your really

980
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:03,358
well-known cuts and this is probably

981
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:06,000
what I knew you best for and one of the

982
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:08,098
cuts I chased the longest was the poodle

983
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,960
nuts cut can you talk a little bit about

984
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:14,820
that who selected the cut where it came

985
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:18,900
from Etc that was um it was selected by

986
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:20,460
a friend of mine from IC uh it went by

987
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:22,579
40 grit

988
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:25,079
um and then I think after that 40 ounce

989
00:38:22,579 --> 00:38:28,320
uh several several names over the years

990
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:30,960
but yeah he was blowing up warehouses of

991
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:34,200
Urkel before anybody else he always had

992
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,820
the most dialed in Urkel his [ __ ] you

993
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:37,919
know I remember smoking his weed and it

994
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:40,320
just being it was like slingshotting

995
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,838
though it was dense but it wasn't you

996
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:45,599
know blown out it was like perfect

997
00:38:42,838 --> 00:38:47,578
and uh his problem was he was running

998
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:50,940
warehouses of Urkel he needed something

999
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:53,880
with some hybrid Vigor um then he and I

1000
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:55,920
used to yeah [ __ ] a bunch so you

1001
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:58,200
know that was one that when I was making

1002
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,780
those crosses I kind of pollinated the

1003
00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:03,960
Urkel just to see if it was any more

1004
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:05,640
vigorous so I uh you know once the seeds

1005
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:08,699
were done I sent a bunch out to him and

1006
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:10,679
he he ran him he found I think two cuts

1007
00:39:08,699 --> 00:39:13,858
that he really liked but that one was

1008
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:16,259
the one that looked more Earthly and it

1009
00:39:13,858 --> 00:39:19,259
you know it got purple but it had

1010
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:21,359
increased Vigor and increased potency so

1011
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:24,599
he started you know running warehouses

1012
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:26,039
with that and crushing it loved it yeah

1013
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:28,079
nice and

1014
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:30,179
yeah and

1015
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,920
his I mean his cut his selection is

1016
00:39:30,179 --> 00:39:35,399
beautiful I've grown it

1017
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:38,539
um I've crossed it to some stuff

1018
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:41,639
um that line it ended up being you know

1019
00:39:38,539 --> 00:39:43,559
as you went through generations of it

1020
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:48,659
there was just more weird stuff popping

1021
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:52,440
up from the Urkel purple man yeah yeah I

1022
00:39:48,659 --> 00:39:54,598
took it I think to F4 and it was just

1023
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:57,480
you know you'd get more mutants and it

1024
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:58,940
would just it just didn't have the Vigor

1025
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:01,619
um

1026
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:04,800
I don't know I could have [ __ ] it up

1027
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:06,720
but uh you know it just it's one of

1028
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,800
those things that I couldn't go but so

1029
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:10,679
deep into

1030
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:13,019
I I can understand that um the actual

1031
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:15,239
poodle nuts cut is super unique looking

1032
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:17,940
like I've seen it express this really

1033
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:20,939
unique trait where it looks super knobby

1034
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:22,619
it's very hard to describe and and I've

1035
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:24,240
seen pictures of some of the outcrosses

1036
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:26,820
that have that same trait you know what

1037
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:29,098
I'm talking about yeah like bud

1038
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:32,460
structure yeah yeah the navi bud

1039
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:35,039
structure yeah yeah yeah that's um

1040
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:38,220
yeah that that kind of surprised me it's

1041
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:39,599
not quite the you know round balls you

1042
00:40:38,219 --> 00:40:42,358
get with Urkel

1043
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:45,599
um but it's it's great weed

1044
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:47,098
um yeah it's beautiful it smells and

1045
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:49,320
I've told people this a million times

1046
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:51,420
like people always talk about smelling

1047
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:53,160
cut smelling really Rank and veg and

1048
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:55,500
that's a perfect example of one for me

1049
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:57,239
where I can take cuts of that in the

1050
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:59,039
living room and in the bedroom Bryn B

1051
00:40:57,239 --> 00:41:00,539
like did the skunk spray in here because

1052
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:02,579
it really does smell like skunk spray

1053
00:41:00,539 --> 00:41:06,119
when you kind of like yeah veg that

1054
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:07,920
thing is insane yeah yeah and then it

1055
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:10,440
finishes up so sweet and nice you know

1056
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,460
yeah I do it's very Earthly of it

1057
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:13,380
because like Urkel does something

1058
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:16,139
similar it has that similar skunky smell

1059
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:18,660
and veg and you take cuts and it's like

1060
00:41:16,139 --> 00:41:20,159
wow this is gonna be skunky AF and then

1061
00:41:18,659 --> 00:41:21,960
when you when you flour it it's super

1062
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:24,539
grapey in the end you know it almost

1063
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:26,400
gets there and for people that are

1064
00:41:24,539 --> 00:41:28,679
younger or don't know or weren't around

1065
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:31,619
during the Urkel era

1066
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:34,799
um one of the big issues with Urkel was

1067
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:37,559
that uh it's not a very branchy mob it's

1068
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,200
not easy to get a lot of cuts off it and

1069
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:43,380
a lot of people would veg it for a long

1070
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:45,118
time before they bloomed it because it's

1071
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:47,940
kind of a slow grower

1072
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:51,720
you know it's not Urban no spacing is

1073
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:53,338
insane that's my problem is one of those

1074
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:55,500
ones that you kind of have to get it

1075
00:41:53,338 --> 00:41:57,358
around the size you want it to be when

1076
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:58,920
you bloom it yeah and then it's going to

1077
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:00,960
grow like six or eight inches and stop

1078
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,760
it's not like a diesel or something that

1079
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,579
has a butt like it's gonna double or

1080
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:08,160
triple in size and Branch out it's just

1081
00:42:05,579 --> 00:42:09,780
not going to so when Ian Lonesome was

1082
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:10,920
talking about like his buddy wanting

1083
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,420
something with a little bit better

1084
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:15,180
bigger

1085
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:17,579
uh Urkel took its time

1086
00:42:15,179 --> 00:42:19,319
okay they kind of puttered along you

1087
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:21,720
know it was that for me it was the node

1088
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:24,180
spacing it just it was it was just

1089
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:26,578
constant just like no spacing every few

1090
00:42:24,179 --> 00:42:28,799
centimeters yeah you had to thin it out

1091
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:30,839
and just constantly stay on it it took

1092
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,240
forever to veg it used to be you know

1093
00:42:30,838 --> 00:42:34,980
you could grow a haze in the same time

1094
00:42:33,239 --> 00:42:38,519
you could grow Urkle because you're

1095
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:40,679
gonna have to bed yeah three times as

1096
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:42,480
long four times as long and then when

1097
00:42:40,679 --> 00:42:45,118
you flower it you know it's it's gonna

1098
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:48,679
pretty much stay that size like natto

1099
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,680
said six eight inches and

1100
00:42:49,338 --> 00:42:53,578
most of my friends up here that were

1101
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:55,679
successful growing Urkel they would be

1102
00:42:53,579 --> 00:42:58,859
blooming a round of Urkel and they would

1103
00:42:55,679 --> 00:43:00,480
be vegging almost the entire bloom oh

1104
00:42:58,858 --> 00:43:02,818
yeah for their next round to get the

1105
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:05,460
Urkel of his like the root ball and just

1106
00:43:02,818 --> 00:43:06,838
the plan to be a sufficient size that

1107
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,338
they could then throw it into the bloom

1108
00:43:06,838 --> 00:43:10,380
when the when the other round was done

1109
00:43:08,338 --> 00:43:13,199
and get going come to think of it

1110
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:15,000
another cut that got bastardized by like

1111
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:17,399
being passed all around and a lot of

1112
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,019
crappy grows of it because like you know

1113
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:21,059
you always hear about how like lame and

1114
00:43:19,019 --> 00:43:22,920
unpotent Urkel is but like I've had my

1115
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:25,739
head ripped off by good herbal like

1116
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:28,338
really legit put in my ass by good Urkel

1117
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:31,139
it's just rare

1118
00:43:28,338 --> 00:43:33,599
it all comes down to the grower and you

1119
00:43:31,139 --> 00:43:35,400
know the conditions if you grow a giant

1120
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:38,880
outdoor Urkel it's just not going to be

1121
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:41,338
that quality no I don't like purple

1122
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,900
quite a bit but I I have to admit it

1123
00:43:41,338 --> 00:43:46,440
doesn't hit me the way it hits some

1124
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:49,260
people now I I will say Mr Hill says you

1125
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:51,858
do not like purples at all and in fact

1126
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:54,000
you agree it's all chickweed ask not to

1127
00:43:51,858 --> 00:43:57,739
I mean it's good it's good to have

1128
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:02,000
strong opinions I suppose you know

1129
00:43:57,739 --> 00:44:04,439
Mr Mendo perps but you know Urkel is

1130
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,079
Urkle for me like I have this weird

1131
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:09,119
relationship with with Urkel and that

1132
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:11,280
whole round of purples because

1133
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:12,720
at least in Cal I don't know you know

1134
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,839
where high and Lonesome is but at least

1135
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:16,919
in California it completely changed the

1136
00:44:15,838 --> 00:44:20,519
weed game

1137
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:23,519
yeah and what I mean by that is before

1138
00:44:20,519 --> 00:44:25,980
like Urkel and Mendo p and granddaddy

1139
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:28,739
purple and that like purple craze of

1140
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:31,500
like 040506 that kind of hit

1141
00:44:28,739 --> 00:44:33,059
yeah any good weed you grew generally

1142
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:36,780
speaking salt

1143
00:44:33,059 --> 00:44:39,119
yeah yep and I feel like the Urkel and

1144
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:40,519
the purple wave was the very beginning

1145
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:43,619
of like

1146
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:45,358
Brokers being like do you have this I'll

1147
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:47,220
take as much of it as you've got and if

1148
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:49,500
you don't I don't give a [ __ ] I don't

1149
00:44:47,219 --> 00:44:51,419
want whatever it is I didn't want to

1150
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:52,739
grow Oracle I liked it but I didn't want

1151
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:54,900
to grow it but that's what they were

1152
00:44:52,739 --> 00:44:56,219
asking for yeah and there was a bunch of

1153
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:58,740
people that were like hey man I'm having

1154
00:44:56,219 --> 00:45:00,779
a hard time moving my stuff and you're

1155
00:44:58,739 --> 00:45:03,899
like well if I give you this cut they'll

1156
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:07,440
take every bit of it yeah and that kind

1157
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:10,139
of started the movement of like Brokers

1158
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:12,300
want this so I'm going to grow this

1159
00:45:10,139 --> 00:45:14,578
where I think I think everybody probably

1160
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:18,539
on this call would agree like before

1161
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:21,660
2004 if you grew Fireweed it was just

1162
00:45:18,539 --> 00:45:23,579
going to go yeah yeah it was it was

1163
00:45:21,659 --> 00:45:26,759
gonna go it was going to have a home and

1164
00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:28,920
then like the name game with really

1165
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,420
started with purple craze and with Urkel

1166
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:32,358
and then it went to diesels and it went

1167
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:35,280
to cushions

1168
00:45:32,358 --> 00:45:37,019
but and a lot of those old strings like

1169
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,900
we were just talking train wreck Green

1170
00:45:37,019 --> 00:45:41,039
Crack you know Blue Dream you know all

1171
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:43,858
these different things started getting

1172
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:46,318
lost to the Wayside

1173
00:45:43,858 --> 00:45:49,500
um because they weren't as easy to move

1174
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:50,639
as whatever was dominant in the scene at

1175
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,500
the moment

1176
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:54,480
yep and we're just playing that game

1177
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,739
yeah and that's what ended up making

1178
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,980
them rare

1179
00:45:55,739 --> 00:46:01,139
you know it's crazy that it's awesome

1180
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:03,179
that pack loved train wreck and blue

1181
00:46:01,139 --> 00:46:06,900
dream enough to hold on to the real ones

1182
00:46:03,179 --> 00:46:08,699
yeah it is you know very thankful for it

1183
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:11,639
um and most of my collection is just

1184
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:14,039
stuff that I personally liked so I held

1185
00:46:11,639 --> 00:46:15,598
on to it you know or you know in high

1186
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:17,639
Lonesome skates it's like that's really

1187
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:20,280
what preservation needs is like

1188
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:22,739
different groups being like these Cuts I

1189
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:24,240
really enjoy yeah and so I'm gonna hold

1190
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:26,699
on to them and I'm gonna grow them nice

1191
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:29,219
regardless of what the market is telling

1192
00:46:26,699 --> 00:46:31,318
me because I care about them I mean that

1193
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:33,539
that's the dividing line between chasing

1194
00:46:31,318 --> 00:46:37,199
the dollar and doing it for the love of

1195
00:46:33,539 --> 00:46:39,539
what you're doing right you when you uh

1196
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:40,679
when you hold on to a cut long enough it

1197
00:46:39,539 --> 00:46:43,920
becomes

1198
00:46:40,679 --> 00:46:45,118
a a partner of yours right like I always

1199
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,559
say a train wrecks the longest

1200
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:48,780
relationship I've ever had with a girl

1201
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:50,338
oh yeah man I say the same thing about

1202
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:52,800
the Maui because I popped it when I was

1203
00:46:50,338 --> 00:46:54,299
18. yeah you know what I mean you grow

1204
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,980
up with these things right and they

1205
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:57,839
become this intimate part of your life

1206
00:46:55,980 --> 00:47:00,900
regardless of if people accept it or not

1207
00:46:57,838 --> 00:47:02,099
if it's if it's in your Zone and it's

1208
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,720
what you want then it really doesn't

1209
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:05,280
matter if it comes or goes right I mean

1210
00:47:03,719 --> 00:47:06,659
it there there was years we're trying to

1211
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,359
work with just one plant in the corner

1212
00:47:06,659 --> 00:47:10,379
yeah

1213
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:12,000
monocropping it for you know the whole

1214
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:13,800
25 years I've had it or however long

1215
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,659
it's been but you know she's she's

1216
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:17,220
always always kept that special place in

1217
00:47:15,659 --> 00:47:18,598
my heart and you know I've been around

1218
00:47:17,219 --> 00:47:19,618
long enough I'm not the oldest guy in

1219
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:20,700
the world but I've been around long

1220
00:47:19,619 --> 00:47:23,039
enough to know that if you wait long

1221
00:47:20,699 --> 00:47:24,659
enough [ __ ] comes back around man um and

1222
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:26,519
you and you learn by watching others

1223
00:47:24,659 --> 00:47:27,980
never hand your [ __ ] over to a tissue

1224
00:47:26,519 --> 00:47:30,539
culture guy

1225
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:32,460
the other the other thing I think is

1226
00:47:30,539 --> 00:47:34,980
that interesting about what we're

1227
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:37,559
talking about is that all these Elites

1228
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:40,740
that we're talking about from back then

1229
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:42,719
came about in a time when Elites only

1230
00:47:40,739 --> 00:47:43,739
got popular if enough people like to

1231
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:46,799
smoke them

1232
00:47:43,739 --> 00:47:49,199
yeah like this was an ERA where there

1233
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:51,839
was no modern weed marketing there was

1234
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:54,539
no hype machine yet like things got

1235
00:47:51,838 --> 00:47:56,940
hyped because people enjoyed growing

1236
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:58,380
them yeah and a lot of people had to

1237
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:00,119
enjoy growing them for them to become

1238
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:01,920
popular and not everyone had to like it

1239
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:04,380
but enough of the community had to like

1240
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,000
it for it to be desirable otherwise it

1241
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:07,980
just kind of would fall by the waist I

1242
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,900
you know I had my Clockwork Orange cut

1243
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:12,780
in San Diego and down there it sold

1244
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:14,460
really well it sold really well but I

1245
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:16,560
was really stingy with it and I did not

1246
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:19,019
like passing it out and those who had it

1247
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:21,119
I made sure they didn't pass it out

1248
00:48:19,019 --> 00:48:22,739
because it didn't get a lot of exposure

1249
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:24,480
you cannot

1250
00:48:22,739 --> 00:48:25,858
back then you couldn't convince people

1251
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,019
that a strain was good unless they got

1252
00:48:25,858 --> 00:48:29,880
to smoke it it just it was very hard to

1253
00:48:28,019 --> 00:48:31,980
do and you couldn't force that

1254
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:33,420
artificial hype it was very very hard to

1255
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:35,460
have artificial hype during those days

1256
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:36,838
and even stuff that wasn't really good

1257
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:40,139
if it didn't make it around it just

1258
00:48:36,838 --> 00:48:42,119
didn't that's what happened you know if

1259
00:48:40,139 --> 00:48:43,980
it was if it was listed as as a 50

1260
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:45,838
eighth in the back page of High Times

1261
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:47,639
over in Missouri then it got some air

1262
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:50,279
time right yeah you know what I'm

1263
00:48:47,639 --> 00:48:52,379
talking about air time is that is on the

1264
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:54,599
internet probably in like in the forums

1265
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:57,539
during like high-end lonesomes like you

1266
00:48:54,599 --> 00:49:00,059
know Heyday on the forums I I think like

1267
00:48:57,539 --> 00:49:02,579
the dog what people call the chem 91 now

1268
00:49:00,059 --> 00:49:04,799
was probably more popular than it was in

1269
00:49:02,579 --> 00:49:07,260
California because

1270
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,940
my friend that passed it out to the

1271
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:11,160
three or four people that got it he

1272
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:13,079
wouldn't let us give it out anywhere and

1273
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:14,818
so for the most part

1274
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:18,839
um Brokers were like well how good can

1275
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:20,639
it be if I don't have it yeah yeah I

1276
00:49:18,838 --> 00:49:23,119
think the forums is where the hype

1277
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:26,639
machine kind of got going absolutely

1278
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:29,220
you'd have somebody piss you know an OG

1279
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:31,259
Kush thread showing some pictures

1280
00:49:29,219 --> 00:49:32,879
talking about their cut

1281
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:34,560
you know talking about what it goes for

1282
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,599
in California and it would just look

1283
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:37,880
killer and you know people would go ape

1284
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:41,220
[ __ ] over it

1285
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:42,900
and that's kind of where it all started

1286
00:49:41,219 --> 00:49:45,899
um then you know people start arguing

1287
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:48,240
over strange and you know it's it's

1288
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:51,420
gotten us to where we are today I mean

1289
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:54,179
the lupus headband I remember that being

1290
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:55,740
one like that name starting to get

1291
00:49:54,179 --> 00:49:58,980
attacked

1292
00:49:55,739 --> 00:50:01,318
yeah well you know people started

1293
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:03,599
um getting their names attached to cuts

1294
00:50:01,318 --> 00:50:06,900
that they didn't create and they didn't

1295
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:11,720
pop they just you know they were the the

1296
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:15,059
one on the Forum to let it out to people

1297
00:50:11,719 --> 00:50:17,098
yeah so now it's it's their cut that's

1298
00:50:15,059 --> 00:50:19,739
their name attached to it and that you

1299
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:23,039
know that still goes on today you know

1300
00:50:19,739 --> 00:50:24,598
like yeah yeah I mean we better kick you

1301
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:26,579
better kick up royalties to some of

1302
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:27,960
these [ __ ] well I think I do

1303
00:50:26,579 --> 00:50:30,900
think there's I do think there's a

1304
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:32,460
difference between like your name gets

1305
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:34,680
attached to something because people are

1306
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:36,420
trying to differentiate which one it is

1307
00:50:34,679 --> 00:50:38,759
and they're saying comes from this

1308
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:41,400
person yeah there were certainly some

1309
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:44,520
people early on

1310
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:46,680
um like Lumpa or you know uh Ken from

1311
00:50:44,519 --> 00:50:49,338
Ken's GDP or something like that where

1312
00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:53,098
they intentionally attached their name

1313
00:50:49,338 --> 00:50:55,558
for control yeah sure yeah

1314
00:50:53,099 --> 00:50:57,059
you know and some people didn't attach

1315
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:58,440
their name for control it's just like

1316
00:50:57,059 --> 00:51:00,599
other it's almost like other your

1317
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:03,599
friends give you a nickname it's like

1318
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:06,359
people on The Forum started referring to

1319
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:07,980
things as a certain cut yeah and sort of

1320
00:51:06,358 --> 00:51:10,619
just organically happened where other

1321
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:12,059
people were like no I'm gonna attach my

1322
00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:14,640
name to it

1323
00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:16,800
yeah and therefore I need credit or I

1324
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:18,739
need money or I need seeds or all the

1325
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:21,839
little dynamics that developed around

1326
00:51:18,739 --> 00:51:23,338
possession and what's funny is is I

1327
00:51:21,838 --> 00:51:25,380
can't think of a single person that

1328
00:51:23,338 --> 00:51:28,139
intentionally attached their name to a

1329
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:32,119
cut that was actually the originator of

1330
00:51:28,139 --> 00:51:32,118
the cut made the seeds or popped it

1331
00:51:32,659 --> 00:51:40,139
oh let me think about that uh

1332
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:42,539
what about Strawberry Cough

1333
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:45,118
oh that's a tough one because I I don't

1334
00:51:42,539 --> 00:51:47,338
know did he pop the seed no you got to

1335
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:49,380
give it to him yeah

1336
00:51:47,338 --> 00:51:50,880
you know nothing against homie or

1337
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:53,880
anything like that but like obviously

1338
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:55,740
like the the camera one got skunked it

1339
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:57,180
got skunk va's name attached to it

1340
00:51:55,739 --> 00:51:59,098
because he was the first person talking

1341
00:51:57,179 --> 00:52:01,318
on the forums

1342
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:03,119
um the three people I remember that

1343
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:05,759
intentionally attached their name was

1344
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:09,420
like AJ attached his name to sour

1345
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:11,280
can attached his name to GDP and Lumpa

1346
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:13,800
attached his name to headband

1347
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:15,300
yeah all very Choice people yes you can

1348
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,800
all hate me for it or whatever but I I

1349
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:18,660
think those three at least like they

1350
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,940
intentionally added their own name oh no

1351
00:52:18,659 --> 00:52:22,699
yeah yeah for sure yeah I think AJ was

1352
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:24,920
just the latest of the game on that one

1353
00:52:22,699 --> 00:52:27,779
I never

1354
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:30,720
heard of that cut um I took a little

1355
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:33,540
break from being online and you know any

1356
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:36,659
of any of the Forum stuff and I got back

1357
00:52:33,539 --> 00:52:39,058
on uh about when I got onto IG and

1358
00:52:36,659 --> 00:52:40,679
started hearing about AJ's hour and it's

1359
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:43,800
like man I've never heard of this one

1360
00:52:40,679 --> 00:52:45,539
you know and it it just there's so many

1361
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:47,400
things that are like that that you know

1362
00:52:45,539 --> 00:52:50,279
I never heard of that cut I never heard

1363
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:51,720
of this sauerkraut I love the choco that

1364
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:55,079
you're welcome for that you're welcome

1365
00:52:51,719 --> 00:52:56,699
yeah yeah let me just let me just point

1366
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:58,920
out let me just point out it used to not

1367
00:52:56,699 --> 00:53:02,719
be a popular thing to put yourself out

1368
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:05,338
there in this game yeah one time no yeah

1369
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:07,858
I tried you know pack I try to make that

1370
00:53:05,338 --> 00:53:10,019
point all the time where it's like the

1371
00:53:07,858 --> 00:53:11,900
skill sets that kept us safe for a long

1372
00:53:10,019 --> 00:53:16,019
time which is kind of being in visible

1373
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:18,000
and keeping your head down uh you know a

1374
00:53:16,019 --> 00:53:21,420
lot of us were indoctrinated into that

1375
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:23,940
lifestyle for 10 15 20 years and then

1376
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:26,880
all of a sudden in like 2012 or 2015

1377
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:29,400
people start putting their faces onto

1378
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,780
things yeah yeah and that had never

1379
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,940
really happened before and it went

1380
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:35,579
against a lot of the and then people

1381
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:36,900
started associating you know like you

1382
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:38,640
know burner with cookie or something

1383
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:40,680
like that like where it was like the

1384
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:43,980
person that was the most vocal

1385
00:53:40,679 --> 00:53:46,199
ends up being like the the expert or the

1386
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:48,838
person that's like the most in charge of

1387
00:53:46,199 --> 00:53:51,598
whatever the strain is it must be an

1388
00:53:48,838 --> 00:53:53,400
official on the subject

1389
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:55,380
I mean what's what's funny about that

1390
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:57,240
too is that I've had bunch of talks with

1391
00:53:55,380 --> 00:54:00,358
CSI

1392
00:53:57,239 --> 00:54:02,818
um Urkel I would say probably blue dream

1393
00:54:00,358 --> 00:54:06,199
and train wreck they all kind of have

1394
00:54:02,818 --> 00:54:08,400
very mysterious Origins yeah

1395
00:54:06,199 --> 00:54:11,639
there's a lot of cuts out there that

1396
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:14,818
like I there's a general consensus on

1397
00:54:11,639 --> 00:54:16,679
most events that led to a Cuts creation

1398
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:18,358
and the people involved

1399
00:54:16,679 --> 00:54:20,460
to me

1400
00:54:18,358 --> 00:54:22,440
I I've never I mean I've heard people

1401
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:25,199
claim it but I've never any of those

1402
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:26,639
three strains they popped up and who the

1403
00:54:25,199 --> 00:54:27,960
hell made them and where the hell did

1404
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:30,799
they come from and

1405
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:33,420
still a mystery to me

1406
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:35,460
yeah all of them and let me let me point

1407
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:38,460
out you know that some of that might

1408
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:40,318
just be a of design

1409
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:42,119
yeah sure you know there's there's a

1410
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:44,759
bunch of old boys that that still grow

1411
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:45,960
that I have known over my lifetime they

1412
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,700
won't touch the internet and they could

1413
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:50,099
care less about having anything to do

1414
00:54:47,699 --> 00:54:51,539
with anything but doing what they you

1415
00:54:50,099 --> 00:54:54,359
know keep on keeping on growing the way

1416
00:54:51,539 --> 00:54:57,960
they have yeah

1417
00:54:54,358 --> 00:54:59,519
and scammers love that because it

1418
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:02,099
doesn't give them competition to the

1419
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:03,780
origin story very true like all of a

1420
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:07,140
sudden you can be like Urkel came from

1421
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:08,339
my farm this year I did this and there's

1422
00:55:07,139 --> 00:55:10,980
not going to be anyone that's going to

1423
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:12,420
compete it you know a monk showed up on

1424
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:14,639
my property and just happened to bless

1425
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:16,559
us with this with this cut or whatever

1426
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:19,500
you know yeah that was almost like the

1427
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:21,240
canasta's GDP store and at some point I

1428
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:23,400
got to cut in because people are going

1429
00:55:21,239 --> 00:55:25,078
to want to hear the Canasta story HML

1430
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:27,000
again I want to hear it

1431
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:29,220
yeah and I'm gonna I got something I got

1432
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,159
a couple questions myself exactly see

1433
00:55:29,219 --> 00:55:34,259
it's perfect time to bring it in

1434
00:55:31,159 --> 00:55:35,699
so and Estes

1435
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:37,859
story

1436
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:40,439
from your point of view how did it go

1437
00:55:37,858 --> 00:55:42,299
down you remember

1438
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:44,300
uh well I mean you're the one that

1439
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:48,539
tipped me off to it so

1440
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:52,380
I was the signal Ben you were I was kind

1441
00:55:48,539 --> 00:55:55,739
of uh I was kind of in the process of

1442
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:57,780
stepping away from the forums up and all

1443
00:55:55,739 --> 00:55:59,098
that but I still checked in every once

1444
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:01,440
in a while and you know mostly

1445
00:55:59,099 --> 00:56:04,619
communicated with you know some of some

1446
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:06,960
of my old friends on there voting from

1447
00:56:04,619 --> 00:56:09,480
um but one day you sent me a message

1448
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:11,358
kind of letting me know that

1449
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:15,420
um

1450
00:56:11,358 --> 00:56:19,318
female Appalachia cut that he kept had

1451
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:21,300
been entered into what was it the major

1452
00:56:19,318 --> 00:56:23,279
cup it was like a major cup like the

1453
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:26,339
High Times there's just barely doing

1454
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:29,880
cups yeah in the US yeah I think it was

1455
00:56:26,338 --> 00:56:30,480
like the San Francisco whatever

1456
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:35,280
um

1457
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:38,338
and evidently a cut had been taken from

1458
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:43,140
Bodie's mom room by I guess a helper

1459
00:56:38,338 --> 00:56:45,358
yeah and uh somehow Ken got it and uh

1460
00:56:43,139 --> 00:56:49,618
liked it enough that he renamed it day

1461
00:56:45,358 --> 00:56:53,219
11 and entered it into the cup so he won

1462
00:56:49,619 --> 00:56:56,818
the cup with that cut of Appalachia and

1463
00:56:53,219 --> 00:56:58,199
to follow up on the success created a

1464
00:56:56,818 --> 00:57:01,259
seed line

1465
00:56:58,199 --> 00:57:04,679
not even using the cut to the best of my

1466
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:07,680
knowledge yeah who knows uh from what I

1467
00:57:04,679 --> 00:57:11,879
think I if if I'm not mistaken I think

1468
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:14,279
it was he had an ooji Kush seed line and

1469
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:16,760
he crossed that to Green Crack and

1470
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:19,319
figured you know it'd be close enough

1471
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:22,079
and that was

1472
00:57:19,318 --> 00:57:23,579
um that was what came out as day 11 and

1473
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:27,059
I remember it being a you know a big

1474
00:57:23,579 --> 00:57:29,760
deal people yeah this isn't what that

1475
00:57:27,059 --> 00:57:32,579
was you know drastically different

1476
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:35,880
yeah so you know you kind of pit me off

1477
00:57:32,579 --> 00:57:38,339
for that story on icmag and I remember

1478
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:42,119
you know engaging in some conversations

1479
00:57:38,338 --> 00:57:43,500
about it uh I was shocked that they

1480
00:57:42,119 --> 00:57:47,039
admitted it

1481
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:49,380
yeah like you know normally that I was

1482
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:51,119
kind of that goes down yeah like

1483
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:53,220
normally that stuff stays wrapped up

1484
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:55,680
yeah you know

1485
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:58,139
but yeah

1486
00:57:55,679 --> 00:58:00,419
yeah so that was um

1487
00:57:58,139 --> 00:58:03,058
it would have been cool to you know have

1488
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:04,760
won a cup with the name yeah right like

1489
00:58:03,059 --> 00:58:07,440
yeah

1490
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:09,240
it was still when cups mattered like at

1491
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,500
that time there was it wasn't like fully

1492
00:58:09,239 --> 00:58:12,598
bastardized to where there were

1493
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:14,940
thousands of Cups you know hundreds of

1494
00:58:12,599 --> 00:58:16,619
Cups a year it was it was when cups

1495
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:19,260
winning a cup could mean the difference

1496
00:58:16,619 --> 00:58:21,539
between a thriving business or not you

1497
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:23,760
know yeah and it really pushed Ken's

1498
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:25,440
business I mean most people already knew

1499
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,300
who Ken was from GDP because he had

1500
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:29,639
marketed himself with that but the cup

1501
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:31,500
win boosted the sales for that bay 11

1502
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:34,500
and his whole company and Seed launch

1503
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:37,260
massively that was why I was like this

1504
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:40,019
is [ __ ] gross and even the GDP thing

1505
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:42,780
with Ken is is pretty suspect oh yeah it

1506
00:58:40,019 --> 00:58:44,460
is it's completely suspective I mean I I

1507
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:46,019
you know I don't tell this story very

1508
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:48,298
much and I'll have to be kind of like

1509
00:58:46,019 --> 00:58:52,259
I'll have to circumvent around certain

1510
00:58:48,298 --> 00:58:53,880
parts of it I suppose uh because uh the

1511
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:56,460
person that I'm gonna talk about is like

1512
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:57,780
a total Anarchist Outlaw like we were

1513
00:58:56,460 --> 00:59:00,298
just mentioning who would never want

1514
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:02,579
their name to be known yeah

1515
00:59:00,298 --> 00:59:07,139
um but that person

1516
00:59:02,579 --> 00:59:10,798
um is who can out the GDP from yeah up

1517
00:59:07,139 --> 00:59:13,739
in my up in my neck of the woods and she

1518
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:16,500
it actually came from a retiring Vietnam

1519
00:59:13,739 --> 00:59:19,199
vet who lived up in the hills by me in

1520
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:22,559
the Laytonville area and

1521
00:59:19,199 --> 00:59:28,159
um my friend was uh pretty and female

1522
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:28,160
which was pretty rare in cannabis uh

1523
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:33,359
but especially as pack will know

1524
00:59:31,559 --> 00:59:36,380
especially in the Humboldt or Mendo

1525
00:59:33,358 --> 00:59:38,818
Hills this is even rarer

1526
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:40,680
for a person to like own their own

1527
00:59:38,818 --> 00:59:42,838
properties and be doing their own things

1528
00:59:40,679 --> 00:59:45,239
or whatever else it was pretty rare back

1529
00:59:42,838 --> 00:59:47,039
then so yeah she was kind of gung-ho

1530
00:59:45,239 --> 00:59:49,500
about it and he was kind of sweet on her

1531
00:59:47,039 --> 00:59:54,179
a little bit and so he ended up giving

1532
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:56,358
her like I don't know 50 or 80 seeds of

1533
00:59:54,179 --> 00:59:59,639
um of his own hybrids that he had made

1534
00:59:56,358 --> 01:00:02,338
and she found GDP in the first batch

1535
00:59:59,639 --> 01:00:05,219
that she popped and the only reason I

1536
01:00:02,338 --> 01:00:08,159
figured that out really was because

1537
01:00:05,219 --> 01:00:11,519
um I helped her build like a a 60

1538
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:14,519
lighter in the woods oh wow and so

1539
01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:16,380
um I knew her before she knew Ken and

1540
01:00:14,519 --> 01:00:18,119
she gave it to Ken because they were

1541
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:21,059
Partners together on this thing right

1542
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:23,818
and she wanted to stay totally Anonymous

1543
01:00:21,059 --> 01:00:26,220
okay yeah and people don't realize this

1544
01:00:23,818 --> 01:00:28,500
about but this is sort of like the era

1545
01:00:26,219 --> 01:00:31,078
where like the first real dispensaries

1546
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:33,420
were opening up in the bay yeah um

1547
01:00:31,079 --> 01:00:34,740
places like yeah like the like you

1548
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:35,700
probably remember pack like the third

1549
01:00:34,739 --> 01:00:39,838
floor

1550
01:00:35,699 --> 01:00:42,118
oh yeah you know um and stuff and uh

1551
01:00:39,838 --> 01:00:44,578
what was the other one uh The Vapor Room

1552
01:00:42,119 --> 01:00:46,559
The Vapor Room the third floor

1553
01:00:44,579 --> 01:00:48,900
um there was a few of them uh not very

1554
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:49,980
many back then the power exchange I

1555
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:51,960
believe was one you would always talk

1556
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:53,400
about that was the one that Matt that

1557
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:56,460
you were a little bit more familiar with

1558
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:58,980
but be that as it may

1559
01:00:56,460 --> 01:01:01,019
um Ken was willing she wanted to stay up

1560
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:03,480
in the hills and stay anonymous

1561
01:01:01,019 --> 01:01:06,960
right yeah and he was willing to go to

1562
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:10,679
the bay and Market it

1563
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:13,619
and so it kind of became GDP and there

1564
01:01:10,679 --> 01:01:15,539
was and there was no there she was fine

1565
01:01:13,619 --> 01:01:17,579
with it because the last thing on earth

1566
01:01:15,539 --> 01:01:19,739
she wanted to do was attach her name or

1567
01:01:17,579 --> 01:01:22,140
show her face she had Outdoors yeah

1568
01:01:19,739 --> 01:01:23,578
attention she was under the radar she

1569
01:01:22,139 --> 01:01:25,440
had a she had you know you know 60

1570
01:01:23,579 --> 01:01:27,660
lighter was a big deal back then it was

1571
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:31,400
a diesel thing in the woods she wanted

1572
01:01:27,659 --> 01:01:31,399
to stay completely hidden

1573
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:38,639
and that's kind of why Ken's story

1574
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:41,039
changes because he heard it second hand

1575
01:01:38,639 --> 01:01:44,219
yeah that story and and if people want

1576
01:01:41,039 --> 01:01:45,779
to hear the full story from the the

1577
01:01:44,219 --> 01:01:48,659
werewolf's mouth

1578
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:52,619
it is uh there you can go on Google and

1579
01:01:48,659 --> 01:01:53,879
if you look up Ken's GDP story I forgot

1580
01:01:52,619 --> 01:01:56,099
what the name of the thing is but it's

1581
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:59,039
some like rapper guy interviewing Ken

1582
01:01:56,099 --> 01:02:00,838
about it and he tells this real mumbly

1583
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:02,759
story and you can still find the

1584
01:02:00,838 --> 01:02:04,980
transcript that I wrote online if you

1585
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:07,500
look for it and I actually transcribed

1586
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:08,880
it because it's a little screwy until

1587
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:11,579
you transcribe and actually see what

1588
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:14,400
he's saying but he says that Native

1589
01:02:11,579 --> 01:02:16,318
American like shamans

1590
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:19,639
thought he was a really great white dude

1591
01:02:16,318 --> 01:02:23,099
and help them and right that's all right

1592
01:02:19,639 --> 01:02:25,440
yeah yeah right and um decided that he

1593
01:02:23,099 --> 01:02:28,798
they were gonna gift him this magical

1594
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:30,179
purple Vietnamese skunk plant wow that's

1595
01:02:28,798 --> 01:02:32,960
where this came from

1596
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:37,078
so what's interesting about that is that

1597
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:41,338
the story goes is that the guy that gave

1598
01:02:37,079 --> 01:02:44,700
my friend the seeds was a Vietnam vet

1599
01:02:41,338 --> 01:02:46,798
and had brought back some uh seeds from

1600
01:02:44,699 --> 01:02:50,159
his adventures over there when he was in

1601
01:02:46,798 --> 01:02:52,798
the Army right and he it's basically

1602
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:54,179
like as you know it basically became

1603
01:02:52,798 --> 01:02:56,639
hillweed

1604
01:02:54,179 --> 01:02:57,960
right where he took the sativa and he

1605
01:02:56,639 --> 01:03:00,298
started Crossing into some of the

1606
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:03,059
indicas that started coming in into the

1607
01:03:00,298 --> 01:03:05,338
Mendo Humboldt area and trying to get a

1608
01:03:03,059 --> 01:03:06,960
plant that would finish

1609
01:03:05,338 --> 01:03:08,759
and then it sort of became that thing

1610
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:10,559
where it's like it was like on that hill

1611
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:11,940
and in that neighborhood or whatever it

1612
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:13,920
was like they were running this thing

1613
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:15,480
and people had different versions it

1614
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:19,380
makes sense you know

1615
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:21,000
um and it was unnamed and you know and

1616
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:23,400
when she popped him or whatever there

1617
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:26,699
was still a variety of like sativa to

1618
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:28,500
Indica leaning ones and they always pick

1619
01:03:26,699 --> 01:03:30,058
for the outdoor they always picked a

1620
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:32,460
little bit more of the sativa leaners

1621
01:03:30,059 --> 01:03:33,960
because they needed the stretch yeah and

1622
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:36,720
they didn't want much of the moldy

1623
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:41,099
density probably too but a little two

1624
01:03:36,719 --> 01:03:42,199
three foot chunky plant for uh for a you

1625
01:03:41,099 --> 01:03:46,740
know a

1626
01:03:42,199 --> 01:03:49,078
Woods indoor situation was perfect yeah

1627
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:51,659
yeah especially in the early 2000s and

1628
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:53,640
the way that people grew back then you

1629
01:03:51,659 --> 01:03:54,899
know a whole bunch of a whole carpet of

1630
01:03:53,639 --> 01:03:57,058
plants that were only two and a half

1631
01:03:54,900 --> 01:04:00,358
three feet tall and chunked out was a

1632
01:03:57,059 --> 01:04:03,540
great look yeah perfect

1633
01:04:00,358 --> 01:04:06,539
um and but yeah he you know he he he got

1634
01:04:03,539 --> 01:04:09,058
that exact cut from her

1635
01:04:06,539 --> 01:04:11,099
and nobody even knows who she is that's

1636
01:04:09,059 --> 01:04:13,380
crazy

1637
01:04:11,099 --> 01:04:15,420
I was just gonna say a Vietnam vet

1638
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:16,500
jump from a Vietnam vet to a Native

1639
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:18,420
American trauma and that's not the

1640
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:21,000
biggest leap huh yeah I mean you know

1641
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:22,980
addition here in addition there he was

1642
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,719
counting well I mean what's funny pack

1643
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:27,719
is like you know with you living up in

1644
01:04:24,719 --> 01:04:29,939
Humboldt obviously it's it's not like

1645
01:04:27,719 --> 01:04:32,039
the the natives up there have like a

1646
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:34,079
super high opinion of like you know

1647
01:04:32,039 --> 01:04:36,619
random white dudes like Ken you know

1648
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:40,818
yeah

1649
01:04:36,619 --> 01:04:40,818
right man we're in Vegas

1650
01:04:41,719 --> 01:04:46,379
so special especially in Humboldt and

1651
01:04:44,338 --> 01:04:47,699
stuff you know humble different places

1652
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:50,880
in Mendo like there's a lot of

1653
01:04:47,699 --> 01:04:52,919
resentment yeah absolutely white people

1654
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:55,920
did not treat the natives that were

1655
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:58,920
living in The Valleys very well

1656
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:01,318
um but yeah he basically he had to make

1657
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:04,200
up a story and whenever you make up a

1658
01:05:01,318 --> 01:05:07,139
story sometimes the details change you

1659
01:05:04,199 --> 01:05:08,879
know okay so yes or no not so I'll ask

1660
01:05:07,139 --> 01:05:15,259
you since you're from the area

1661
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:15,260
Ken Estes yes or no Mark Emery Mini

1662
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:21,059
no

1663
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:21,599
uh only because

1664
01:05:21,059 --> 01:05:23,819
um

1665
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:26,280
you know uh

1666
01:05:23,818 --> 01:05:28,380
you know he just

1667
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:31,140
he basically like there was it was more

1668
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:31,980
than just kidding like huh you're

1669
01:05:31,139 --> 01:05:34,460
welcome

1670
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:36,539
oh man

1671
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:38,099
but he just you know he just took it

1672
01:05:36,539 --> 01:05:39,539
down to the third floor and it was like

1673
01:05:38,099 --> 01:05:41,099
he was one of those guys that was

1674
01:05:39,539 --> 01:05:43,440
willing to there was not that many

1675
01:05:41,099 --> 01:05:45,000
people from Mendo and Humboldt that were

1676
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:48,659
willing to go into those dispensaries

1677
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:51,719
and funnel weed into them yeah yep

1678
01:05:48,659 --> 01:05:54,179
people wanted to be anonymous and he was

1679
01:05:51,719 --> 01:05:56,159
willing to be not anonymous

1680
01:05:54,179 --> 01:05:58,618
and as a result of that he got his name

1681
01:05:56,159 --> 01:06:01,818
attached yeah there's also a really good

1682
01:05:58,619 --> 01:06:05,640
song on YouTube called leave Ken alone

1683
01:06:01,818 --> 01:06:07,318
oh man really oh it is so good I forgot

1684
01:06:05,639 --> 01:06:10,679
who the rapper is in it but it's all

1685
01:06:07,318 --> 01:06:13,318
about Ken getting popped and leave him

1686
01:06:10,679 --> 01:06:15,838
alone and it's it's so good so is there

1687
01:06:13,318 --> 01:06:16,980
I highly recommend it

1688
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:18,838
huh

1689
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:21,838
I do the description

1690
01:06:18,838 --> 01:06:24,179
in maybe in maybe Ken's defense just

1691
01:06:21,838 --> 01:06:26,038
just a little bit because I think this

1692
01:06:24,179 --> 01:06:27,598
you could apply this to almost anyone

1693
01:06:26,039 --> 01:06:30,059
that uh

1694
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:31,798
um gets famous around weed is they get

1695
01:06:30,059 --> 01:06:33,480
famous and they get known for a

1696
01:06:31,798 --> 01:06:35,940
particular story

1697
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:38,159
and then it's like it becomes more of

1698
01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:39,240
maintaining their image than being

1699
01:06:38,159 --> 01:06:42,118
honest

1700
01:06:39,239 --> 01:06:44,159
sure yeah I think that temptation is a

1701
01:06:42,119 --> 01:06:45,838
really big Temptation and we could talk

1702
01:06:44,159 --> 01:06:47,219
about lots of different people in the

1703
01:06:45,838 --> 01:06:48,779
industry where

1704
01:06:47,219 --> 01:06:52,199
you know there's like not very

1705
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:53,640
well-known details that are true but you

1706
01:06:52,199 --> 01:06:56,279
know they have a narrative and they have

1707
01:06:53,639 --> 01:07:00,139
a public Persona and their interest is

1708
01:06:56,280 --> 01:07:03,059
maintaining that public persona

1709
01:07:00,139 --> 01:07:05,159
yeah I mean I I saw this in the UFO

1710
01:07:03,059 --> 01:07:07,440
World a lot too where people would be

1711
01:07:05,159 --> 01:07:08,818
like famous for let's say they claim to

1712
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:11,338
have an abduction

1713
01:07:08,818 --> 01:07:13,259
or UFO sighting and they get a lot of

1714
01:07:11,338 --> 01:07:14,940
Acclaim for this and maybe they did see

1715
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:16,380
something they found to be anomalous

1716
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:19,139
maybe these were they were being totally

1717
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:21,180
true or honest at the time but after

1718
01:07:19,139 --> 01:07:23,759
that attention goes away and all the

1719
01:07:21,179 --> 01:07:25,858
Adoration and admiration from people and

1720
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:27,000
the you're so cool this is you and the

1721
01:07:25,858 --> 01:07:30,239
recognition

1722
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:31,798
they slowly get this one need to get

1723
01:07:30,239 --> 01:07:34,259
those endorphins or whatever it is again

1724
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:36,838
the admiration flowing so they'll make

1725
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:40,079
it up they'll they'll force it they'll

1726
01:07:36,838 --> 01:07:41,639
force that whatever it is and take that

1727
01:07:40,079 --> 01:07:43,619
reputation shot and I see that in weed

1728
01:07:41,639 --> 01:07:45,900
it transfers over so well I mean some

1729
01:07:43,619 --> 01:07:47,099
people catch lightning in a bottle once

1730
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:49,200
and they spend the rest of their life

1731
01:07:47,099 --> 01:07:51,720
like trying to just chasing that Dragon

1732
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:53,939
yeah force that hype and it just looks

1733
01:07:51,719 --> 01:07:56,219
pathetic that's a thirsty ego is what

1734
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:58,980
that is or people make entire seed

1735
01:07:56,219 --> 01:08:01,318
companies just based around the one or

1736
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:03,298
two things that they're famous for and

1737
01:08:01,318 --> 01:08:05,159
only do variations around those things

1738
01:08:03,298 --> 01:08:08,460
because that's what they're known for

1739
01:08:05,159 --> 01:08:10,500
yeah sure right it's super common I mean

1740
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:12,599
you know you were talking we I don't

1741
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:14,880
know if it was Matt or you but like you

1742
01:08:12,599 --> 01:08:17,460
were talking about the train wreck name

1743
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:20,400
I mean I heard you know wasn't there

1744
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:24,319
rumors that like the e32 was because it

1745
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:27,778
was like the 32nd generation yeah

1746
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:30,060
30 second attempt to re-re-pro the

1747
01:08:27,779 --> 01:08:33,420
original yeah yeah something something

1748
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:36,199
wild h l what's this kind of crew the

1749
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:38,940
e32 crew

1750
01:08:36,198 --> 01:08:41,759
but I remember that

1751
01:08:38,939 --> 01:08:43,738
um you know that term coming out on the

1752
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:45,539
forums and it was like no you don't have

1753
01:08:43,738 --> 01:08:49,019
train wreck if you have the arcade to

1754
01:08:45,539 --> 01:08:52,738
cut the e32 cut it's the one I remember

1755
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:54,960
Calio Calio is a part of the e32 creep

1756
01:08:52,738 --> 01:08:57,119
there's like an early dhk type thing

1757
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:58,380
I don't know I don't know I know one

1758
01:08:57,119 --> 01:09:00,420
person who'd know I kind of bugged him

1759
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:01,679
about that and ask but yeah I was trying

1760
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:03,960
to remember because I know it was that

1761
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:05,880
was it Berkeley Patients Group that that

1762
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:07,759
Eric worked out of

1763
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:10,039
yeah

1764
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:12,659
that was his name on the forums like

1765
01:09:10,039 --> 01:09:14,399
a-e-r-i-c no it was the arcade uh

1766
01:09:12,659 --> 01:09:16,439
whatever the dispensary was it opened up

1767
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:19,259
I think that's right it wasn't Berkeley

1768
01:09:16,439 --> 01:09:21,238
you're right yeah BPG was different yeah

1769
01:09:19,259 --> 01:09:22,439
yeah like 11 there was a club like one

1770
01:09:21,238 --> 01:09:24,559
of the first clubs that opened up in

1771
01:09:22,439 --> 01:09:27,599
Arcata was off of 11th Street

1772
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:29,279
dude or you know yeah and so there was a

1773
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:33,179
Calio story from him and then there was

1774
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:35,580
the um train wreck and it does predate

1775
01:09:33,179 --> 01:09:38,460
him yeah but he he is the cut that goes

1776
01:09:35,579 --> 01:09:40,439
around is from him if I remember

1777
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:43,619
correctly and I'm sure someone will

1778
01:09:40,439 --> 01:09:46,318
correct me if I get that wrong but uh

1779
01:09:43,619 --> 01:09:48,358
yeah the e32 yeah the the cut that goes

1780
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:51,560
around that everybody has came by him

1781
01:09:48,359 --> 01:09:54,360
and was passed out by that Collective

1782
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:56,820
not the 100 original and nobody has it

1783
01:09:54,359 --> 01:09:59,819
yeah not the right I mean cry baby cry

1784
01:09:56,819 --> 01:10:01,259
baby it was pretty extensively he's done

1785
01:09:59,819 --> 01:10:02,939
his research there I think you're right

1786
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:04,560
that sounds like

1787
01:10:02,939 --> 01:10:06,359
yeah yeah he knows that story about

1788
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:07,860
these I've never seen the e32 cut though

1789
01:10:06,359 --> 01:10:10,439
I mean I haven't put it up against the

1790
01:10:07,859 --> 01:10:12,000
one that I've held on to but um I don't

1791
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:13,919
know do you do you guys I think it's

1792
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,500
that cut I think it's the same cut I

1793
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:20,100
think yeah I've never seen it I've just

1794
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:23,520
you know seen the Forum hype about it

1795
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:25,620
yeah I'm pretty sure it was out of there

1796
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:28,260
from Eric I'm pretty sure that's the one

1797
01:10:25,619 --> 01:10:29,779
that everybody has or that has it now or

1798
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:33,179
that had it back then

1799
01:10:29,779 --> 01:10:36,840

1801
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:40,920

1802
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:42,900
didn't come from him directly I got my

1803
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:45,420
cut from the boys up in the hill so

1804
01:10:42,899 --> 01:10:46,920
here's the story right come 2000 uh you

1805
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:51,359
know we're all into clones and we're now

1806
01:10:46,920 --> 01:10:54,179
popping seeds and uh my my roommate uh

1807
01:10:51,359 --> 01:10:56,939
partner at the time uh knew this girl in

1808
01:10:54,179 --> 01:10:58,319
Arcata and uh she was real uh you know a

1809
01:10:56,939 --> 01:10:59,879
cute little kid or whatever you know

1810
01:10:58,319 --> 01:11:01,259
kind of ditzy and whatnot and he asked

1811
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:03,840
her for some cuts and she's like sure

1812
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:05,520
you know someone's helping me she runs

1813
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:09,000
up into the hills I want to say it was

1814
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:11,100
up in Kneeland area and I got got a flat

1815
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:12,960
of tdub he brought it down and didn't

1816
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:15,300
tell them that she wasn't getting it for

1817
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:17,100
her own re-up yeah she ended up giving

1818
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:18,539
it to us right and that was my first

1819
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:21,420
introduction to the plant I hadn't even

1820
01:11:18,539 --> 01:11:23,460
seen it prior to that in in the Years a

1821
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:25,199
couple years before that and so we're

1822
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:27,658
growing this thing and then come come to

1823
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:29,219
find out she's getting hawked by these

1824
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:31,039
cats all of a sudden because she wasn't

1825
01:11:29,219 --> 01:11:33,960
supposed to let that [ __ ] thing out

1826
01:11:31,039 --> 01:11:36,119
and that's exactly the same time that

1827
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:37,920
Arcata we didn't call arcade turmeric

1828
01:11:36,119 --> 01:11:39,420
then but started getting really prolific

1829
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:41,158
and Arcadia and it was blocking

1830
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:43,560
everywhere it's just you couldn't get

1831
01:11:41,158 --> 01:11:45,539
away from it yeah um and then not too

1832
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:47,640
long you know two three years into that

1833
01:11:45,539 --> 01:11:49,260
all of a sudden people were bringing

1834
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:51,960
their Cuts in and bringing their their

1835
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:54,000
work in and it was you know rare you

1836
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:56,219
know you get 10 people line it up and it

1837
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,719
was rare that you got that original uh

1838
01:11:56,219 --> 01:12:00,060
you know Planet cut from that plan

1839
01:11:57,719 --> 01:12:01,679
that's I think because of like the tuxed

1840
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:02,940
lines the wood horse seed lines I

1841
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:04,920
finally got a hold of a wood horse we

1842
01:12:02,939 --> 01:12:07,619
can talk to him finally for an interview

1843
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:08,819
which would be cool I think um yeah he

1844
01:12:07,619 --> 01:12:10,140
was responsible for a lot of the train

1845
01:12:08,819 --> 01:12:13,759
wreck out there that head seat remember

1846

grateful Head HML yeah he did um

1847
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:20,360

know he at least did the Oriental

1853
01:12:28,738 --> 01:12:32,279
Express too you could do a public

1854
01:12:30,238 --> 01:12:34,439
service announcement uh don't name your

1855
01:12:32,279 --> 01:12:35,420
seed line after a famous cut

1856
01:12:34,439 --> 01:12:37,859
s

1857
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:39,899
please don't please pick a different

1858
01:12:37,859 --> 01:12:42,658
name this is why we've never seen the

1859
01:12:39,899 --> 01:12:44,359
same sfv OG cut after swerve released

1860
01:12:42,658 --> 01:12:47,099

1862

cut name please God or Larry or Tahoe

1863
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:54,000
they're all kind of just like up in the

1864
01:12:52,198 --> 01:12:55,678
air on if you ever see those cuts again

1865
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,420
that they'll ever be anything like they

1866
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:59,699
were originally because so many seeds

1867
01:12:57,420 --> 01:13:00,480
were sold under those exact names you

1868
01:12:59,698 --> 01:13:03,119
know

1869
01:13:00,479 --> 01:13:05,339
yeah yeah it makes it makes it hard you

1870
01:13:03,119 --> 01:13:07,319
know and uh yeah yeah and I will say

1871
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:10,460
that the Santa Cruz rank is not from

1872
01:13:07,319 --> 01:13:10,460
Santa Cruz by the way

1873
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:15,900
yeah but that that's super common too I

1874
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:18,000
mean Matt and I were chatting about that

1875
01:13:15,899 --> 01:13:19,259
like if you got snow and Humboldt it was

1876
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,140
humble snow

1877
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:24,539
yeah it was Oregon snow if you got a new

1878
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:26,100
Gene it was Eugene snow or if you got it

1879
01:13:24,539 --> 01:13:28,198
in Bakersfield there's Bakersfield snow

1880
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:29,120
because that's oh yeah lots of different

1881
01:13:28,198 --> 01:13:32,219
things

1882
01:13:29,119 --> 01:13:33,658
and then you know people would get it

1883
01:13:32,219 --> 01:13:35,158
and they would change the name and they

1884
01:13:33,658 --> 01:13:39,539
would bring it to different places and

1885
01:13:35,158 --> 01:13:43,019
like names have always been very uh very

1886
01:13:39,539 --> 01:13:45,000
odd part of the history yeah

1887
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:47,760
you know I found out about a local

1888
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:49,380
strain here that I never heard of

1889
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:51,659
um it's actually a city in the mountains

1890
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:53,640
45 minutes from here but it's it's very

1891
01:13:51,658 --> 01:13:55,679
close and it's called the Tehachapi

1892
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:58,500
Terror and I found it in a magazine from

1893
01:13:55,679 --> 01:14:00,840
the 70s and I know nothing else about it

1894
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:05,698
but yeah it sounded so cool it had to be

1895
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:08,760
Terror some backseat mash up yeah I mean

1896
01:14:05,698 --> 01:14:10,500
mashup was a Garb it doesn't attack do

1897
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:12,780
you or to Matt does anybody know like

1898
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:15,179
what is the blue dream origin story

1899
01:14:12,779 --> 01:14:17,399
since we've gone over like not knowing

1900
01:14:15,179 --> 01:14:20,399
what train wreck is what is

1901
01:14:17,399 --> 01:14:23,219
blue dreams supposed to be I've heard

1902
01:14:20,399 --> 01:14:25,198
I've heard a few different theories

1903
01:14:23,219 --> 01:14:28,140
hi in Lonesome what do you got

1904
01:14:25,198 --> 01:14:30,059
I don't Blue Dream wasn't in my world

1905
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:31,980
um we were we had green crack and try

1906
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:34,800
and wreck Blue Dream wasn't as big out

1907
01:14:31,979 --> 01:14:35,959
here that only stuff us off you know was

1908
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:39,659
flown in

1909
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:41,880
so so that specific cut when it was

1910
01:14:39,658 --> 01:14:44,819
first given to me by Bodhi

1911
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:47,100
and the people who kind of were around

1912
01:14:44,819 --> 01:14:48,599
the Santa Cruz area that knew the the

1913
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:51,440
crowd that was giving it out or where it

1914
01:14:48,600 --> 01:14:54,480
came from all said it was

1915
01:14:51,439 --> 01:14:56,339
98 blueberry from DJ that specific cut

1916
01:14:54,479 --> 01:14:58,139
that he would pass around crossed a

1917
01:14:56,340 --> 01:14:59,100
super specifically a super silver haze

1918
01:14:58,140 --> 01:15:02,940
from Greenhouse

1919
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:05,340
and I only know of one company that ever

1920
01:15:02,939 --> 01:15:07,379
released that specific cross

1921
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:09,179
and I don't know if it came after or

1922
01:15:07,380 --> 01:15:11,039
before

1923
01:15:09,179 --> 01:15:13,679
those things chicken before the egg and

1924
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:16,920
it was the blue hen from um

1925
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:18,359
Bluegrass seeds Kentucky some seeds

1926
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:20,340
something like that yeah it was a blue

1927
01:15:18,359 --> 01:15:22,439
hen and I remember seeing pictures of

1928
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:25,140
both in the Canada Bible so I'm not sure

1929
01:15:22,439 --> 01:15:26,579
which came first on that but they were

1930
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:28,260
both similar type plants that I'd

1931
01:15:26,579 --> 01:15:30,719
imagine you could find similar

1932
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:33,119
Expressions uh if they were both using

1933
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:35,399
similar lines to make them I would

1934
01:15:33,119 --> 01:15:37,619
imagine you know the only variation I

1935
01:15:35,399 --> 01:15:38,839
would add to that that I've heard is

1936
01:15:37,619 --> 01:15:41,939
um

1937
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:43,980
this uh Haze that people refer to as the

1938
01:15:41,939 --> 01:15:47,039
Santa Cruz Haze

1939
01:15:43,979 --> 01:15:48,718
being being that cut that was uh used

1940
01:15:47,039 --> 01:15:50,819
with the blueberry

1941
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:52,739
um I have yet to see

1942
01:15:50,819 --> 01:15:56,219
the Santa Cruz Haze I don't know if this

1943
01:15:52,738 --> 01:15:58,379
is just a myth or if it's I would I

1944
01:15:56,219 --> 01:16:00,239
would almost bet my left knot that it

1945
01:15:58,380 --> 01:16:03,060
would be a super silver haze based on

1946
01:16:00,238 --> 01:16:05,218
the the turf profile and everything else

1947
01:16:03,060 --> 01:16:06,539
I would be pretty pretty dead on

1948
01:16:05,219 --> 01:16:08,698
especially because how quickly it

1949
01:16:06,539 --> 01:16:10,859
finishes still all that yeah

1950
01:16:08,698 --> 01:16:14,759
yeah

1951
01:16:10,859 --> 01:16:17,000
the Johnny Blaze I think was uh

1952
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:20,100
yeah it was emergency to Neville's Hayes

1953
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:22,619
yeah that one took a little bit longer

1954
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:24,179
and it still got kind of big like

1955
01:16:22,619 --> 01:16:26,279
Neville's

1956
01:16:24,179 --> 01:16:29,819
um I could definitely see super super

1957
01:16:26,279 --> 01:16:32,219
Hayes being the father pack I remember

1958
01:16:29,819 --> 01:16:33,779
if I remember correctly I think Super

1959
01:16:32,219 --> 01:16:38,279
Silver Haze

1960
01:16:33,779 --> 01:16:42,000
got dropped as a seed line in 97.

1961
01:16:38,279 --> 01:16:43,319
mm-hmm I think it won three cups in a

1962
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:48,119
row

1963
01:16:43,319 --> 01:16:51,119
in in uh in the Cannabis cups in Holland

1964
01:16:48,119 --> 01:16:52,619
um and I believe it was like 97 98 99

1965
01:16:51,119 --> 01:16:54,479
something like that it could be wrong

1966
01:16:52,619 --> 01:16:57,140
maybe it was 96 but it was something

1967
01:16:54,479 --> 01:16:59,399
along those lines I think you're right

1968
01:16:57,140 --> 01:17:01,320
right around there it was right around

1969
01:16:59,399 --> 01:17:04,259
there that's right yeah I think about

1970
01:17:01,319 --> 01:17:07,920
like old song super Haze cut like if I

1971
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:09,659
cross that to the DJ's cut DJ's Mama

1972
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:11,819
blueberry that he sold when he was going

1973
01:17:09,658 --> 01:17:13,500
around giving lectures and stuff if I

1974
01:17:11,819 --> 01:17:15,658
cross those two I'm pretty sure I could

1975
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:19,279
nail that thing pretty fast it would it

1976
01:17:15,658 --> 01:17:21,839
would be pretty regular occurring

1977
01:17:19,279 --> 01:17:23,340
so yeah I I could see how that could be

1978
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:25,679
definitely

1979
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:27,179
one thing one thing I'll interject is

1980
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:28,140
that at the little gathering that we

1981
01:17:27,179 --> 01:17:30,719
just had

1982
01:17:28,140 --> 01:17:34,140
um one of the favorite things I smoked

1983
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:36,719
was uh a hybrid pack made that was a

1984
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:39,600
blue dream by train wreck oh yeah that's

1985
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:41,760
good so good one of the one of the

1986
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:44,760
things I'll say about it is that I think

1987
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:48,179
terpenoline has a lot of depth to it but

1988
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:52,320
it's so forward and strong like all it

1989
01:17:48,179 --> 01:17:54,899
overpowers a lot of people and that blue

1990
01:17:52,319 --> 01:17:57,658
dream hybrid with train wreck that blue

1991
01:17:54,899 --> 01:18:00,899
dream brought like a Sweetness in that

1992
01:17:57,658 --> 01:18:04,019
almost like took like the the edge off

1993
01:18:00,899 --> 01:18:06,238
that train wreck flavor oh yeah but yeah

1994
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:07,920
but like but the the flavor of train

1995
01:18:06,238 --> 01:18:10,559
wreck was still there it just wasn't

1996
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:12,539
like the predominant knock you just took

1997
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:14,219
a step back right yeah just took a step

1998
01:18:12,539 --> 01:18:16,198
back there was like a sweet it's almost

1999
01:18:14,219 --> 01:18:18,119
like with cooking where like you add

2000
01:18:16,198 --> 01:18:19,979
some acidity or you add some you know

2001
01:18:18,119 --> 01:18:21,738
you add something to balance out your

2002
01:18:19,979 --> 01:18:24,599
sauce

2003
01:18:21,738 --> 01:18:28,619
it had that brightness come through that

2004
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:30,659
yeah the brightness for sure and um you

2005
01:18:28,619 --> 01:18:32,219
know uh we joke a lot that like once you

2006
01:18:30,658 --> 01:18:34,859
get through paneling in something it's

2007
01:18:32,219 --> 01:18:37,079
really [ __ ] hard to get it out yeah

2008
01:18:34,859 --> 01:18:40,319
um yeah and I didn't think anything

2009
01:18:37,079 --> 01:18:41,880
could tame uh the train wreck nose so

2010
01:18:40,319 --> 01:18:44,698
much

2011
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:46,679
um but that hybrid it really allowed the

2012
01:18:44,698 --> 01:18:49,259
terpenolene to shine

2013
01:18:46,679 --> 01:18:51,179
because it gave it a sweetness I

2014
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:54,119
actually did a review on the blue dream

2015
01:18:51,179 --> 01:18:55,619
train wreck in a previous episode in a

2016
01:18:54,119 --> 01:18:58,319
short episode so go check that out if

2017
01:18:55,619 --> 01:19:00,119
you're interested but yeah it I I was I

2018
01:18:58,319 --> 01:19:01,979
was really impressed because it was two

2019
01:19:00,119 --> 01:19:04,979
very two things I was very familiar with

2020
01:19:01,979 --> 01:19:06,718
and they combined really nicely yeah

2021
01:19:04,979 --> 01:19:08,339
that yeah I think that surprised a lot

2022
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:09,899
of people and may have been I think

2023
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:10,920
other than the blue dream I think that

2024
01:19:09,899 --> 01:19:14,899
was probably the one that everybody

2025
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:14,899
gravitated to pretty hard yeah

2026
01:19:15,479 --> 01:19:20,718
yeah but he still did it it's luck with

2027
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:20,719
intention

2028
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:31,500
I think everybody did they're like yeah

2029
01:19:29,399 --> 01:19:33,059
so that that's that's kind of the

2030
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:34,920
impression that that that's kind of the

2031
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:38,100
impression that it made where I just had

2032
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:40,920
to say that uh two old school you know

2033
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:43,380
pretty famous things uh that crossed

2034
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:45,119
really well together yeah yep yeah you

2035
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:46,739
know the one thing that I that I I

2036
01:19:45,119 --> 01:19:48,479
appreciate that not so by the way but

2037
01:19:46,738 --> 01:19:50,579
all you guys I appreciate the you know

2038
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:52,559
your input with that I want to say that

2039
01:19:50,579 --> 01:19:54,000
the thing that I was struck most with

2040
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:56,400
was

2041
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:58,859
um not not just tdub taking a back step

2042
01:19:56,399 --> 01:20:01,259
but then the train wreck comes through

2043
01:19:58,859 --> 01:20:03,479
and pushes up the potency a little bit

2044
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:04,920
right oh yeah oh yeah you know both of

2045
01:20:03,479 --> 01:20:06,119
those in and of themselves if you don't

2046
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:07,319
if you're not used to smoking them and

2047
01:20:06,119 --> 01:20:08,880
your body's not used to taking it in

2048
01:20:07,319 --> 01:20:10,439
they can both hit you pretty hard in

2049
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:12,239
their own way yeah

2050
01:20:10,439 --> 01:20:14,339
um but it's it was it's nice to be able

2051
01:20:12,238 --> 01:20:16,678
to smoke both of the original appearance

2052
01:20:14,340 --> 01:20:18,960
side by side and then go over and hit

2053
01:20:16,679 --> 01:20:21,980
hit that combination and see where it

2054
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:24,119
kind of got in a hamster got pulled back

2055
01:20:21,979 --> 01:20:26,158
so it was really it was really a cool

2056
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:28,198
treat to be able to watch my buddies you

2057
01:20:26,158 --> 01:20:29,939
know and partake with my friends in

2058
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:32,158
terms of looking at that in real time

2059
01:20:29,939 --> 01:20:33,779
and getting that feedback you know it's

2060
01:20:32,158 --> 01:20:36,599
really like any special thing to do that

2061
01:20:33,779 --> 01:20:39,960
anytime you smoke like 60 things in two

2062
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:42,000
and a half days uh yeah it gets even

2063
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:43,500
even just smelling things you smell five

2064
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,600
or six things in a row and you're like

2065
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:47,340
your nostrils are kind of burned out for

2066
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:50,400
10 minutes but

2067
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:52,619
um the quality of that that hybrid shown

2068
01:20:50,399 --> 01:20:54,119
in my opinion while we're talking about

2069
01:20:52,619 --> 01:20:55,859
this stuff let's talk about some of the

2070
01:20:54,119 --> 01:20:57,599
the stuff we saw at the party and some

2071
01:20:55,859 --> 01:21:00,779
of the different things that we uh

2072
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:02,699
noticed didn't notice I mean um packet

2073
01:21:00,779 --> 01:21:04,079
was your first time there I didn't know

2074
01:21:02,698 --> 01:21:06,719
if it was your first time coming to the

2075
01:21:04,079 --> 01:21:08,399
one of the Gatherings so um yeah maybe

2076
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:09,960
maybe you guys I don't know which one he

2077
01:21:08,399 --> 01:21:12,119
wants to start but talk about some of

2078
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:14,819
the strains you saw what you thought was

2079
01:21:12,119 --> 01:21:17,039
the most unique what you thought uh

2080
01:21:14,819 --> 01:21:18,359
probably bummed you out the most and

2081
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:20,600
yeah all that

2082
01:21:18,359 --> 01:21:22,259
oh sure

2083
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:24,300
you know

2084
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:26,640
as we were just talking about it pox

2085
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:28,079
stuff surprised me

2086
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:30,780
um you know

2087
01:21:28,079 --> 01:21:33,238
and that that one in particular

2088
01:21:30,779 --> 01:21:35,460
um just how the train wreck came through

2089
01:21:33,238 --> 01:21:38,339
on some of his hybrids it took a back

2090
01:21:35,460 --> 01:21:41,100
seat I've grown quite a few hybrids of

2091
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:43,260
training Rapids normally A variation on

2092
01:21:41,100 --> 01:21:46,140
the theme you know it's it's train wreck

2093
01:21:43,260 --> 01:21:48,480
with a tiny bit of this or a tiny bit of

2094
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:50,280
that but you know his hybrid seemed

2095
01:21:48,479 --> 01:21:52,799
really well Blended that one in

2096
01:21:50,279 --> 01:21:53,759
particular I really enjoyed

2097
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:57,960
um

2098
01:21:53,760 --> 01:22:01,500
uh bitters grow of Shoreline was oh yeah

2099
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:02,760
oh that was amazing that was great um

2100
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:06,198
and his

2101
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:09,840
um dog [ __ ] uh Electric Boogaloo

2102
01:22:06,198 --> 01:22:11,339
yes sir both of those were great

2103
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:13,679
um

2104
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:15,719
it was just a lot

2105
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:18,960
um another one that really stood out to

2106
01:22:15,719 --> 01:22:20,698
me was the Death Star yeah several

2107
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:23,100
people you know Panda brought some local

2108
01:22:20,698 --> 01:22:28,319
brats um

2109
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:29,880
and that had such a it was a lot uh

2110
01:22:28,319 --> 01:22:34,139
Rancier than I thought it'd be it almost

2111
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:37,079
had like a Kim D rankness to it yeah it

2112
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:39,060
was you know in that level as far as

2113
01:22:37,079 --> 01:22:41,460
potency I would say but it was like

2114
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:43,880
definitely instead of being like that

2115
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:46,520
nasty garbage it was like nasty

2116
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:50,100
polyester

2117
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:52,020
it's hard to say but it was just it was

2118
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:55,199
it's very complex

2119
01:22:52,020 --> 01:22:59,219
very bright and

2120
01:22:55,198 --> 01:23:00,198
it's pretty [ __ ] hard yeah I dug it

2121
01:22:59,219 --> 01:23:03,179
yeah

2122
01:23:00,198 --> 01:23:05,339
so definitely it's a it's Unique

2123
01:23:03,179 --> 01:23:07,199
absolutely unique

2124
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:08,699
how about you pack what'd you see it

2125
01:23:07,198 --> 01:23:10,979
stood out

2126
01:23:08,698 --> 01:23:12,960
man I mean there's there's so much

2127
01:23:10,979 --> 01:23:15,119
novelty going around that it's hard to

2128
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:17,760
kind of determine some from the others I

2129
01:23:15,119 --> 01:23:20,039
was blown away by the cob just for the

2130
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:21,600
fact yeah we're old cob sitting there

2131
01:23:20,039 --> 01:23:23,640
and uh you know buddy brought that

2132
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:24,780
through those that was pretty amazing I

2133
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:27,480
wasn't sure if I was supposed to eat it

2134
01:23:24,779 --> 01:23:30,119
or smoke it so I just smoked it Oh I

2135
01:23:27,479 --> 01:23:32,698

made it so I just stuck it up my my ass

2139
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:40,800
yeah I think that's probably what made

2140
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:42,179
you sick yeah it probably was I probably

2141
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:44,760
knew exactly what I was going to do with

2142
01:23:42,179 --> 01:23:47,480
it and poisoned it you know what I do

2143

01:24:04,260 --> 01:24:10,020
high school oh yeah you know I just felt

2151
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:11,659
like yeah man I felt like it was 93 all

2152
01:24:10,020 --> 01:24:14,219
over again

2153
01:24:11,658 --> 01:24:16,619
it's a time capsule man that's a great

2154
01:24:14,219 --> 01:24:18,420
one Absolutely I'll look so forward to

2155
01:24:16,619 --> 01:24:21,238
Growing that too by the way so

2156
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:23,039
um but uh you know one that one that

2157
01:24:21,238 --> 01:24:24,959
threw me off guard that I wouldn't have

2158
01:24:23,039 --> 01:24:27,658
gone and picked up

2159
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:29,100
um on my own but happened to hit it and

2160
01:24:27,658 --> 01:24:30,658
it and somehow or another it cut through

2161
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:31,679
everything for me at that moment I got

2162
01:24:30,658 --> 01:24:33,539
so high

2163
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:35,279
I remember watching skid just laughing

2164
01:24:33,539 --> 01:24:37,019
at me looking at me like David you're

2165
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:39,559
stuck right now was that uh was that

2166
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:39,560
Moon boat

2167
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:45,300
yeah he brought and you know it could

2168
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:47,640
have been that I was on the you know

2169
01:24:45,300 --> 01:24:49,140
25th hour of the day yeah it might have

2170
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:50,820
been it's four in the morning you know

2171
01:24:49,140 --> 01:24:51,840
whatever I don't remember the time I

01:24:50,819 --> 01:24:53,698
don't remember where I was but I

2173
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:55,560
remember hitting that and just kind of

2174
01:24:53,698 --> 01:24:57,658
floating off into this like other place

2175
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:59,219
for a while and uh feeling embarrassed

2176
01:24:57,658 --> 01:25:01,979
because you know someone was laughing at

2177
01:24:59,219 --> 01:25:04,198
me at my reaction I liked it enough to

2178
01:25:01,979 --> 01:25:06,119
put a picture up of it on Instagram and

2179
01:25:04,198 --> 01:25:07,678
post about it so it was it was pretty

2180
01:25:06,119 --> 01:25:09,479
good yeah it was really good it was

2181
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:11,279
exciting I mean I've gone I've gone and

2182
01:25:09,479 --> 01:25:12,359
Revisited it since because you know I

2183
01:25:11,279 --> 01:25:14,158
was lucky enough to be able to bring

2184
01:25:12,359 --> 01:25:16,500
some party bags back

2185
01:25:14,158 --> 01:25:17,819
and you know it's really not that bad uh

2186
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:19,619
it's not something that I would

2187
01:25:17,819 --> 01:25:21,840
necessarily have in my Armory you know

2188
01:25:19,619 --> 01:25:24,539
in terms of I want to grow this and and

2189
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:26,940
get into it but I I might you know I

2190
01:25:24,539 --> 01:25:29,939
might do that if I had the right cut but

2191
01:25:26,939 --> 01:25:31,859
um that one stood out uh you know uh our

2220
01:26:36,658 --> 01:26:42,119
like everybody there sat around and

2221
01:26:38,819 --> 01:26:45,719
watched this thing nail 21 on just

2222
01:26:42,119 --> 01:26:47,039
ridiculous stuff like across the board I

2223
01:26:45,719 --> 01:26:48,840
mean I got

2224
01:26:47,039 --> 01:26:50,579
oh I'm sorry I was gonna say I just got

2225
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:53,039
one more shot out bro one more shot out

2226
01:26:50,579 --> 01:26:54,658
if I can uh to CB uh to everybody

2227
01:26:53,039 --> 01:26:56,880
crybaby

2228
01:26:54,658 --> 01:27:00,179
um and and some of the magic that he

2229
01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:02,819
weaves uh a friend panda came down from

2230
01:27:00,179 --> 01:27:05,699
way up North with an Arctic uh made the

2231
01:27:02,819 --> 01:27:07,920
trip down and I think uh another friend

2232
01:27:05,698 --> 01:27:10,859
of our ring our friend of our friends

2233
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:12,899
yeah grew out the Meteora for it yeah

2234
01:27:10,859 --> 01:27:16,019
that was good yeah and brought that down

2235
01:27:12,899 --> 01:27:18,960
and then um somebody had the uh what is

2236
01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:22,260
the Bo the burnt offering next to that

2237
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:24,000
which is I guess a grandchild of the uh

2238
01:27:22,260 --> 01:27:25,500
Meteora and it was nice to have those

2239
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,779
side by side because

2240
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:29,579
um you know just smoking that for an

2241
01:27:27,779 --> 01:27:31,380
offering a couple months back

2242
01:27:29,579 --> 01:27:34,139
um I was like wow this is very unique

2243
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:36,600
this is not something you usually get

2244
01:27:34,139 --> 01:27:39,480
um often and uh having that next to the

2245
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:41,159
media or forward seeing that kind of uh

2246
01:27:39,479 --> 01:27:42,539
relation between the two those those

2247
01:27:41,158 --> 01:27:44,099
pretty interesting for me to be able to

2248
01:27:42,539 --> 01:27:46,319
get to do that so that definitely sticks

2249
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:48,239
out in my mind meteor four was probably

2250
01:27:46,319 --> 01:27:50,158
my favorite like uh what would be

2251
01:27:48,238 --> 01:27:53,218
traditionally considered the evil

2252
01:27:50,158 --> 01:27:54,539
leaning type there yeah my favorite out

2253
01:27:53,219 --> 01:27:56,219
of all of them

2254
01:27:54,539 --> 01:27:58,079
in that category

2255
01:27:56,219 --> 01:28:01,560
what about you not so what about you

2256
01:27:58,079 --> 01:28:04,859
Matt what not to go ahead I'm gonna take

2257
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:06,900
a different tact I think in that uh my

2258
01:28:04,859 --> 01:28:07,859
favorite part of the Gathering was the

2259
01:28:06,899 --> 01:28:11,119
people

2260
01:28:07,859 --> 01:28:14,039
and the the reason I say that is because

2261
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:15,960
you know when when we threw these

2262
01:28:14,039 --> 01:28:17,880
parties earlier they were kind of based

2263
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:19,800
around the emerald cup

2264
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:22,319
um it was sort of like a way for heads

2265
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:25,039
and and friends to gather after the sort

2266
01:28:22,319 --> 01:28:27,359
of like the big the big Gathering itself

2267
01:28:25,039 --> 01:28:29,279
uh and this time was different and then

2268
01:28:27,359 --> 01:28:31,319
it was intentional

2269
01:28:29,279 --> 01:28:35,039
um and it was friends that mostly talk

2270
01:28:31,319 --> 01:28:37,619
online to each other coming from in some

2271
01:28:35,039 --> 01:28:39,840
cases literally all over America yeah

2272
01:28:37,619 --> 01:28:42,059
coming from the Far East from the far

2273
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:43,679
north from you know people spend a lot

2274
01:28:42,060 --> 01:28:44,880
of time and energy to make sure that

2275
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:47,219
they could come

2276
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:48,840
and you know I really there's no joke

2277
01:28:47,219 --> 01:28:50,279
getting it it was no joke once they hit

2278
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:52,920
the airport to get to where the party

2279
01:28:50,279 --> 01:28:54,719
was but yeah yeah yeah and I do think

2280
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:56,100
that like you know especially with covid

2281
01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:58,020
and stuff and people being trapped in

2282
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:59,579
their houses and being able to spend a

2283
01:28:58,020 --> 01:29:02,760
lot of time online you can make some

2284
01:28:59,579 --> 01:29:05,460
really good friends but I do think it

2285
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:06,960
really helps to spend a few days like

2286
01:29:05,460 --> 01:29:09,060
breaking bread with someone getting

2287
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:11,359
baked with them eating food shooting the

2288
01:29:09,060 --> 01:29:13,800
[ __ ] I mean

2289
01:29:11,359 --> 01:29:15,359

2290
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:17,219

2311
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:04,698

2313
01:30:04,698 --> 01:30:08,899
he went back to bed after that actually

2314
01:30:09,439 --> 01:30:14,579
and so just but but you know faces to

2315
01:30:12,539 --> 01:30:16,439
names hearing people's voices getting to

2316
01:30:14,579 --> 01:30:19,500
see people's sense of humor where it's

2317
01:30:16,439 --> 01:30:21,178
not typed out but it's in real time

2318
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:22,920
um you know the internet is cool because

2319
01:30:21,179 --> 01:30:24,060
it brings it can bring people together

2320
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:26,760
but

2321
01:30:24,060 --> 01:30:29,580
being able to spend time

2322
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:31,440
I think and just it was a it's like a

2323
01:30:29,579 --> 01:30:34,619
pro it was a proper to me like old

2324
01:30:31,439 --> 01:30:36,960
school Harvest Festival yeah where you

2325
01:30:34,619 --> 01:30:39,420
have a bunch of real weed people sitting

2326
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:42,420
down making friends talking shop eating

2327
01:30:39,420 --> 01:30:45,060
food joking sharing their passion

2328
01:30:42,420 --> 01:30:46,800
basically you know

2329
01:30:45,060 --> 01:30:48,719
um and that you know there was enough of

2330
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:51,239
us there that each brought some of our

2331
01:30:48,719 --> 01:30:53,939
old favorites uh that there was a lot of

2332
01:30:51,238 --> 01:30:55,439
good favorites there yeah I remember I

2333
01:30:53,939 --> 01:30:57,119
can't remember who it was it was like

2334
01:30:55,439 --> 01:30:58,439
I'm not gonna call them out because that

2335
01:30:57,119 --> 01:31:00,960
would be rude or anything like that but

2336
01:30:58,439 --> 01:31:03,178
I remember Panda telling me that one of

2337
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:06,539
the guys that came brought like all this

2338
01:31:03,179 --> 01:31:09,000
like new school Za you know yeah and

2339
01:31:06,539 --> 01:31:10,800
after he smoked the shoreline and the

2340
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:12,960
Electric Boogaloo and some Trenton some

2341
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:14,579
this and that he like took all his weed

2342
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:18,179
and he put it back in the bag because he

2343
01:31:14,579 --> 01:31:20,399
was like man you know I don't even care

2344
01:31:18,179 --> 01:31:23,158
about my weed he's like this right here

2345
01:31:20,399 --> 01:31:25,679
yeah and it's neat because you know

2346
01:31:23,158 --> 01:31:27,299
we're all older now or whatever and we

2347
01:31:25,679 --> 01:31:29,760
don't realize that stuff that we have a

2348
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:31,619
lot of experience with most new school

2349
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:35,340
smokers that have only been around for

2350
01:31:31,619 --> 01:31:37,019
eight or ten years missed the era of

2351
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:39,920
almost everything that all four of us

2352
01:31:37,020 --> 01:31:43,440
have been talking about this entire time

2353
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:45,300
she started smoking in like 2010 2012.

2354
01:31:43,439 --> 01:31:48,238
if you kind of got into the scene in the

2355
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:49,560
last 10 or 15 years

2356
01:31:48,238 --> 01:31:51,359
um you probably didn't smoke real train

2357
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:54,719
wreck or real blue dream or real Green

2358

Crack or what the hell is Trace dog or

2359
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:59,698

since the early to mid 2000s yeah yeah

2379
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:52,980

2380
01:32:51,658 --> 01:32:56,158
met in person

2381
01:32:52,979 --> 01:32:57,959

and that was the first time we've met

2386
01:33:04,939 --> 01:33:09,658
I remember I was like all all frantic as

2387
01:33:08,219 --> 01:33:12,139
I came in the door because that was the

2388
01:33:09,658 --> 01:33:15,359
last one there and like

2389
01:33:12,139 --> 01:33:17,699
yeah I was driving in the canyon I can't

2390
01:33:15,359 --> 01:33:19,979
see for [ __ ] it was super dark so it was

2391
01:33:17,698 --> 01:33:21,779
taking forever so I finally get there

2392
01:33:19,979 --> 01:33:24,299
and we brought had to bring the dog

2393
01:33:21,779 --> 01:33:25,800
because it was big and wild nobody else

2394
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:27,900

2395
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:30,840
carry in like three rooms of [ __ ] just

2396
01:33:27,899 --> 01:33:33,119
for the dog and so I am dead tired and I

2397
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:34,199
remember walking by hugging someone I

2398
01:33:33,119 --> 01:33:35,760
thought was Panda because I've seen

2399
01:33:34,198 --> 01:33:37,799
pictures of panda but I never met Panda

2400
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:39,539

01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:41,219
you know where a lot of a lot of times

2421
01:34:39,359 --> 01:34:42,779
you're really only hanging out with like

2422
01:34:41,219 --> 01:34:46,439
your own age group

2423
01:34:42,779 --> 01:34:49,259
and we had people there from their

2424
01:34:46,439 --> 01:34:53,099
mid-20s all the way up to their mid 60s

2425
01:34:49,260 --> 01:34:55,500
yeah yeah it was probably a 40-year you

2426
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:57,239
know I mean probably like you know uh

2427
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:59,520
Denali and his late you know there was

2428
01:34:57,238 --> 01:35:01,138
there was some senior citizens there

2429
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:04,320
there was some kids that were in our

2430
01:35:01,139 --> 01:35:06,960
opinion or barely out of their diapers

2431
01:35:04,319 --> 01:35:08,519
um you know and and I remember you know

2432
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:11,698
and some that are barely in their

2433
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:13,260
diapers yeah I remember Panda looking

2434
01:35:11,698 --> 01:35:14,819
over at me and being like dude I've

2435
01:35:13,260 --> 01:35:16,639
never been to anything like this in my

2436
01:35:14,819 --> 01:35:18,960
life

2437
01:35:16,639 --> 01:35:20,159
yeah to be able to soak people out like

2438
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:22,020
that is one of the coolest things on

2439
01:35:20,158 --> 01:35:24,238
earth and you know I don't I think I

2440
01:35:22,020 --> 01:35:25,860
think I stopped Matt once at one point

2441
01:35:24,238 --> 01:35:27,539
and I looked at him and said dude this

2442
01:35:25,859 --> 01:35:31,439
is one of those moments in time that's

2443
01:35:27,539 --> 01:35:33,420
quite rare uh to come across so

2444
01:35:31,439 --> 01:35:34,619
um don't you know just recognize I

2445
01:35:33,420 --> 01:35:37,139
wasn't telling him to recognize but I

2446
01:35:34,619 --> 01:35:39,179
reckon I'm right yeah I agree with you I

2447
01:35:37,139 --> 01:35:42,420
just think people taking their time and

2448
01:35:39,179 --> 01:35:44,520
their energy and money and flying and

2449
01:35:42,420 --> 01:35:46,619
driving and prepping and all the effort

2450
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:50,219
that went in to just have a nice time

2451
01:35:46,619 --> 01:35:53,880
with friends for a weekend and talk shop

2452
01:35:50,219 --> 01:35:56,520
um you know I can't I felt High honestly

2453
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:57,659
like for days afterwards and it wasn't

2454
01:35:56,520 --> 01:36:00,000
yeah

2455
01:35:57,658 --> 01:36:01,379
it was just I just enjoyed myself

2456
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:04,020
immensely

2457
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:07,500
there's a lot of positive intention for

2458
01:36:04,020 --> 01:36:10,020
being yeah that was pretty cool and uh

2459
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:12,420
you know I think uh I think that kind of

2460
01:36:10,020 --> 01:36:15,780
like bonding with people in person is

2461
01:36:12,420 --> 01:36:18,060
important yeah uh Brynn has never been

2462
01:36:15,779 --> 01:36:19,859
to one of our Gatherings before my chick

2463
01:36:18,060 --> 01:36:22,860
and she went this time and like when we

2464
01:36:19,859 --> 01:36:24,719
got home she was like I finally get it I

2465
01:36:22,859 --> 01:36:26,339
finally get how you bonded with these

2466
01:36:24,719 --> 01:36:27,960
guys and like why you guys love each

2467
01:36:26,340 --> 01:36:30,300
other as much as you do and why you guys

2468
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:32,100
are so loyal and close she's like I love

2469
01:36:30,300 --> 01:36:35,639
those dudes now too I feel like they're

2470
01:36:32,100 --> 01:36:37,199
family yeah so yeah you know I can tell

2471
01:36:35,639 --> 01:36:41,279
she's not in the room because she didn't

2472
01:36:37,198 --> 01:36:41,279
throw a shoe at you exactly

2473
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:48,479
hey man I'll tell you what dude the one

2474
01:36:46,859 --> 01:36:50,339
thing I want to say about that is you

2475
01:36:48,479 --> 01:36:52,019
know the the world that I was brought

2476
01:36:50,340 --> 01:36:54,060
into because I didn't grow up in the

2477
01:36:52,020 --> 01:36:55,739
weeds saying I I jumped into you know

2478
01:36:54,060 --> 01:36:57,960
Junior High High School kind of thing

2479
01:36:55,738 --> 01:37:00,419
but the the old cats that I that brought

2480
01:36:57,960 --> 01:37:02,698
me in under their wings that was the

2481
01:37:00,420 --> 01:37:04,619
energy and that was the philosophy you

2482
01:37:02,698 --> 01:37:06,000
know what I mean it was you know there

2483
01:37:04,619 --> 01:37:07,500
were people with egos of course and

2484
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:09,300
there's people you know snazzles out

2485
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:12,060
there and whatnot but for the for the

2486
01:37:09,300 --> 01:37:14,279
most part there was this cultural like

2487
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:15,719
consideration in this this bigger

2488
01:37:14,279 --> 01:37:18,300
picture that was going on besides the

2489
01:37:15,719 --> 01:37:20,460
plant the plant brings you together but

2490
01:37:18,300 --> 01:37:22,920
there's a certain way you know of of

2491
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:25,560
kind of interacting with people that

2492
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:26,760
that really kind of solidified that era

2493
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:28,980
for me and

2494
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:30,960
to be able to fast forward 20 some odd

2495
01:37:28,979 --> 01:37:33,658
years and get a touch of that you know a

2496
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:36,119
taste of that again in a very unique

2497
01:37:33,658 --> 01:37:38,099
kind of situation uh you know kind of

2498
01:37:36,119 --> 01:37:40,500
brought back some some uh

2499
01:37:38,100 --> 01:37:41,880
some Hope on my behalf right because I'm

2500
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:43,979
watching everything else fall out I'm

2501
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:45,960
not joining the big the big I guess I'm

2502
01:37:43,979 --> 01:37:48,059
not riding the wave or at this point I'm

2503
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:49,500
not and it's not my thing but

2504
01:37:48,060 --> 01:37:51,539
um to know that that was still well on

2505
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:53,760
the live and all we had to do was uh

2506
01:37:51,539 --> 01:37:56,279
you know kind of let it unfold naturally

2507
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:58,560
and get there you know yeah yeah I mean

2508
01:37:56,279 --> 01:38:01,139
there were a lot of a lot of young guys

2509
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:03,840
like nacho said you know a huge age Gap

2510
01:38:01,139 --> 01:38:07,139
but you know we're all weed people we're

2511
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:08,760
all you know very much similar yeah

2512
01:38:07,139 --> 01:38:11,819
we're in it

2513
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:14,760
um great to see I've tried to drive home

2514
01:38:11,819 --> 01:38:16,859
like in our our Discord patreon to like

2515
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:18,360
the the people that hang out there and

2516
01:38:16,859 --> 01:38:20,099
the Breeders syndicate with us and talk

2517
01:38:18,359 --> 01:38:22,079
stuff and like get really into the nerdy

2518
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:23,460
end of stuff is like when they hear us

2519
01:38:22,079 --> 01:38:24,840
talk about the Canon Illuminati they

2520
01:38:23,460 --> 01:38:26,639
like you know they they kind of first

2521
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:28,319
you're like yeah is it like some

2522
01:38:26,639 --> 01:38:29,940
underground like you know they don't

2523
01:38:28,319 --> 01:38:32,219
realize like it was named as kind of

2524
01:38:29,939 --> 01:38:33,899
like a a tongue-in-cheek joke just

2525
01:38:32,219 --> 01:38:35,520
because it was like it wasn't anybody

2526
01:38:33,899 --> 01:38:37,198
who gives a [ __ ] it wasn't any of the

2527
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:39,000
the famous people that you'd see in

2528
01:38:37,198 --> 01:38:40,198
cannabis like as the main faces you

2529
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:42,119
wouldn't see Snoop Dogg there you

2530
01:38:40,198 --> 01:38:43,678
wouldn't see sherpinsky you wouldn't see

2531
01:38:42,119 --> 01:38:46,380
any of those guys there

2532
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:48,539
um but what you did have was the most

2533
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:50,520
passionate people in cannabis I felt

2534
01:38:48,539 --> 01:38:51,960
like I that's all it's ever been about

2535
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:54,179
has nothing to do with how long you've

2536
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:56,158
been doing it has nothing to me nothing

2537
01:38:54,179 --> 01:38:58,319
to do with how good you are at doing it

2538
01:38:56,158 --> 01:39:00,299
not even that it has to do with your

2539
01:38:58,319 --> 01:39:02,099
passion your drive and like how intent

2540
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:03,960
you are to to make this your your

2541
01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:05,179
passion really I think that's how we all

2542
01:39:03,960 --> 01:39:09,119
found each other

2543
01:39:05,179 --> 01:39:10,619
absolutely sure yeah for sure but I I uh

2544
01:39:09,119 --> 01:39:12,300
it's pretty it's pretty cool you could

2545
01:39:10,619 --> 01:39:13,859
be on the same level as a brother you

2546
01:39:12,300 --> 01:39:15,960
had never met from halfway across the

2547
01:39:13,859 --> 01:39:17,219
world and you guys walk in the door and

2548
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:18,779
it's as if you knew each other your

2549
01:39:17,219 --> 01:39:21,239
whole life you know yeah it's crazy man

2550
01:39:18,779 --> 01:39:22,738
nothing better I definitely think it I

2551
01:39:21,238 --> 01:39:25,138
definitely think it strengthened some

2552
01:39:22,738 --> 01:39:27,779
friendships you know

2553
01:39:25,139 --> 01:39:29,460
um which is pretty cool and in the fact

2554
01:39:27,779 --> 01:39:31,859
that it was pretty quick

2555
01:39:29,460 --> 01:39:34,020
either way yeah as far as the actual

2556
01:39:31,859 --> 01:39:36,179
weed goes since I pontificated a bunch

2557
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:39,600
about like just like human as the human

2558
01:39:36,179 --> 01:39:43,260
element you hit everybody's feels yeah

2559
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:46,620
I've been super clear that I think that

2560
01:39:43,260 --> 01:39:50,219
the 90s and the early 2000s was sort of

2561
01:39:46,619 --> 01:39:53,219
the golden era of weed and so most of my

2562
01:39:50,219 --> 01:39:55,679
favorites are things from that era you

2563
01:39:53,219 --> 01:39:59,340
know the chems the cushes the train

2564
01:39:55,679 --> 01:40:02,880
wrecks the blue dreams the shoreline

2565
01:39:59,340 --> 01:40:06,060
um for my for my age or whatever I just

2566
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:07,079
find most of that older weed hits me

2567
01:40:06,060 --> 01:40:09,659
better

2568
01:40:07,079 --> 01:40:11,760
yeah it gives me a better effect and

2569
01:40:09,658 --> 01:40:15,179
even if it's a wide variety of effects

2570
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:17,100
it's the rare weed that's been made in

2571
01:40:15,179 --> 01:40:19,859
the last five or six years that hits me

2572
01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:22,560
like some of that older stuff yeah and

2573
01:40:19,859 --> 01:40:25,559
so having a bunch of friends bring their

2574
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:28,020
personal favorites you know uh you know

2575
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:30,480
we he mentioned it but bitter brought

2576
01:40:28,020 --> 01:40:33,000
you know two three kind maybe four kinds

2577
01:40:30,479 --> 01:40:35,658
of kush along with the Electric Boogaloo

2578

01:41:02,179 --> 01:41:06,539
uh you know it eventually you know at

2591
01:41:05,219 --> 01:41:08,158
first I was like oh I wonder if there's

2592
01:41:06,539 --> 01:41:09,420
going to be enough weed and then I was

2593
01:41:08,158 --> 01:41:11,579
like man I wonder if there's enough

2594
01:41:09,420 --> 01:41:13,880
places to put all this weed because like

2595
01:41:11,579 --> 01:41:17,279
we kept moving table tops

2596
01:41:13,880 --> 01:41:18,960
and all that and uh well nothing usually

2597
01:41:17,279 --> 01:41:21,259
brings it all like like most of the

2598
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:23,420
parties it's it's been like 90 percent

2599
01:41:21,260 --> 01:41:25,679
yeah

2600
01:41:23,420 --> 01:41:27,719
I'm not gonna be bringing a bunch of

2601
01:41:25,679 --> 01:41:28,880
stuff so we were he was concerned yeah

2602
01:41:27,719 --> 01:41:31,439
yeah

2603
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:33,719
it was that way because because I had

2604
01:41:31,439 --> 01:41:36,238
greenhouses and stuff like that even if

2605
01:41:33,719 --> 01:41:39,000
I'm like mono cropping say two things

2606
01:41:36,238 --> 01:41:41,339
for the market yeah I would have a 20 by

2607
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:43,679
30 bed that was a bunch of head stash

2608
01:41:41,340 --> 01:41:45,360
yeah yeah sure and it was just me you

2609
01:41:43,679 --> 01:41:47,399
know so the first two three parties we

2610
01:41:45,359 --> 01:41:52,079
did I don't know Matt I probably brought

2611
01:41:47,399 --> 01:41:54,059
pounds it was yeah I think like yeah it

2612
01:41:52,079 --> 01:41:55,559
was like pounds of each individual thing

2613
01:41:54,060 --> 01:41:57,000
they probably brought like you know

2614
01:41:55,560 --> 01:41:59,400
there was probably like four or five

2615
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:01,800
pounds of like you know total but it was

2616
01:41:59,399 --> 01:42:04,618
like 35 different things you know yeah

2617
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:08,840
uh no I think it was like one to two

2618
01:42:04,618 --> 01:42:08,839
pounds of like 35 different things yeah

2619
01:42:11,359 --> 01:42:15,899
in a commercial environment just

2620
01:42:13,738 --> 01:42:19,138
everyone sharing being super generous

2621
01:42:15,899 --> 01:42:21,960
giving samples to all their friends you

2622
01:42:19,139 --> 01:42:24,539
know CSI uh you know dumped a bunch of

2623
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:26,399
uh you know various crosses he'd made on

2624
01:42:24,539 --> 01:42:29,279
the ground so that anyone could grab

2625
01:42:26,399 --> 01:42:31,679
them up people were exchanging seeds and

2626
01:42:29,279 --> 01:42:33,420
information I think I should shout out

2627
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:35,579
to I brought you know not everybody

2628
01:42:33,420 --> 01:42:38,219
could do this because some people flew

2629
01:42:35,579 --> 01:42:41,100
and didn't drive but yeah I brought some

2630
01:42:38,219 --> 01:42:44,460
mementos from my past

2631
01:42:41,100 --> 01:42:48,659
um Matt brought a bunch of very cool

2632
01:42:44,460 --> 01:42:52,618
um magazines and old art and uh you know

2633
01:42:48,658 --> 01:42:53,939
rare rare um you know catalogs of

2634
01:42:52,618 --> 01:42:57,880
different things for people to look

2635
01:42:53,939 --> 01:43:00,559
through and no one stole anything

2636
01:42:57,880 --> 01:43:03,060
[Music]

2637
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:05,280
I think that's that's ended up in my

2638
01:43:03,060 --> 01:43:07,679
stuff yeah you're the only other person

2639
01:43:05,279 --> 01:43:09,840
that brought books you know yeah so it

2640
01:43:07,679 --> 01:43:12,118
just ended up in my stuff but but just

2641
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:15,060
just a bunch of friends you know cooking

2642
01:43:12,118 --> 01:43:17,880
and eating out and and smoking things

2643
01:43:15,060 --> 01:43:20,820
and chatting and all that it really does

2644
01:43:17,880 --> 01:43:22,679
make a difference yeah well the vibe too

2645
01:43:20,819 --> 01:43:24,179
right like it wasn't a competition it

2646
01:43:22,679 --> 01:43:26,940
wasn't about who's got the biggest uh

2647
01:43:24,179 --> 01:43:28,859
ego or the biggest issue it was you know

2648
01:43:26,939 --> 01:43:30,658
really kind of this this joining right

2649
01:43:28,859 --> 01:43:32,460
like I check this out I think that makes

2650
01:43:30,658 --> 01:43:34,439
a difference too like honestly we've

2651
01:43:32,460 --> 01:43:36,239
talked about like do we want to make it

2652
01:43:34,439 --> 01:43:37,678
like a cup event we've talked about it a

2653
01:43:36,238 --> 01:43:39,899
few times between a few of us and it's

2654
01:43:37,679 --> 01:43:41,760
like I I don't know man would that

2655
01:43:39,899 --> 01:43:43,679
change it like because even even though

2656
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:45,900
it's all really close friends as men

2657
01:43:43,679 --> 01:43:48,420
we're competitive you know to a degree

2658
01:43:45,899 --> 01:43:50,179
and if you have like a prize or

2659
01:43:48,420 --> 01:43:53,100
something that we can all like

2660
01:43:50,179 --> 01:43:55,199
argue over like Flex honey even Flex on

2661
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:57,300
each other over it just changes the vibe

2662
01:43:55,198 --> 01:43:58,979
completely so I mean the hard thing too

2663
01:43:57,300 --> 01:44:01,079
is when you have a party like that with

2664
01:43:58,979 --> 01:44:03,779
the way that weed works it's like a

2665
01:44:01,079 --> 01:44:05,340
snapshot in time yeah so there was thing

2666
01:44:03,779 --> 01:44:07,859
there was friends of ours that couldn't

2667
01:44:05,340 --> 01:44:09,659
come because of conflicts

2668
01:44:07,859 --> 01:44:12,299
um there was weed that was almost done

2669
01:44:09,658 --> 01:44:14,099
that couldn't make it that was on the

2670
01:44:12,300 --> 01:44:16,079
line you know but not quite ready to be

2671
01:44:14,100 --> 01:44:18,300
in the bag so it was kind of like what

2672
01:44:16,079 --> 01:44:20,219
do I have ready at the time yeah and

2673
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:22,440
some of it was a little fresh some of it

2674
01:44:20,219 --> 01:44:24,480
was a little old some of it was perfect

2675
01:44:22,439 --> 01:44:27,000
you know

2676
01:44:24,479 --> 01:44:28,618
um but really what it was is it was

2677
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:30,539
mostly just like

2678
01:44:28,618 --> 01:44:31,979
you know it's kind of like everybody

2679
01:44:30,539 --> 01:44:33,359
brought stuff and it's like here's what

2680
01:44:31,979 --> 01:44:35,279
I do for love

2681
01:44:33,359 --> 01:44:36,658
and here's what I'm cropping right now

2682
01:44:35,279 --> 01:44:38,880
to survive

2683
01:44:36,658 --> 01:44:41,460
yeah and here's a variety of things that

2684
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:43,618
that incorporate all that you know

2685
01:44:41,460 --> 01:44:45,420
I mean how better can it get man you

2686
01:44:43,618 --> 01:44:48,000
know no it was I'm not I I mean the only

2687
01:44:45,420 --> 01:44:49,739
thing my only complaint with it was that

2688
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:53,279
um it needed to be like an extra two

2689
01:44:49,738 --> 01:44:57,319
days yeah for sure and I needed I needed

2690
01:44:53,279 --> 01:44:57,319
like a humidifier and throat

2691
01:44:57,920 --> 01:45:02,279
uh we had it in a pretty we had it in a

2692
01:45:00,658 --> 01:45:04,920
pretty dry mountainous part of

2693
01:45:02,279 --> 01:45:08,099
California and with all the talking and

2694
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:10,279
smoking I was like a husk yeah you

2695
01:45:08,100 --> 01:45:13,619
sounded bad at the end of the day

2696
01:45:10,279 --> 01:45:15,479
you know I think all of us most people I

2697
01:45:13,618 --> 01:45:17,219
talked to uh or heard their voice for

2698
01:45:15,479 --> 01:45:19,379
three or four days afterwards were in

2699
01:45:17,219 --> 01:45:22,279
the same position yeah oh yeah it took a

2700
01:45:19,380 --> 01:45:25,440
minute it took a minute to recover yeah

2701
01:45:22,279 --> 01:45:27,238
shout out to cry baby he sent this and

2702
01:45:25,439 --> 01:45:29,698
I'll I'll give a plug to the company too

2703
01:45:27,238 --> 01:45:31,138
so oh nice this is that piece I brought

2704
01:45:29,698 --> 01:45:32,939
it to the party and he sent it out so we

2705
01:45:31,139 --> 01:45:35,940
could use it at the party and to hook us

2706
01:45:32,939 --> 01:45:39,178
up yeah it's a molten I think they say

2707
01:45:35,939 --> 01:45:42,059
it's the g-y-z-r perk which it's just a

2708
01:45:39,179 --> 01:45:43,618
few little holes but it's it's probably

2709
01:45:42,060 --> 01:45:46,020
my favorite piece you don't get like

2710
01:45:43,618 --> 01:45:47,939
crap all in the lip you know I don't

2711
01:45:46,020 --> 01:45:50,280
know one of the coolest things and this

2712
01:45:47,939 --> 01:45:52,559
is the tornado I think it's called the

2713
01:45:50,279 --> 01:45:54,899
tornado like ash catcher thingy whatever

2714
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:56,580
yeah that was the other cool part was

2715
01:45:54,899 --> 01:45:58,198
just I mean I brought up I brought a

2716
01:45:56,579 --> 01:46:01,198
tube and stuff but there was a bunch of

2717
01:45:58,198 --> 01:46:04,079
different Vapes Joe you know not only

2718
01:46:01,198 --> 01:46:06,479
that but just like smoking smoking the

2719
01:46:04,079 --> 01:46:09,539
way people prefer to smoke yeah which

2720
01:46:06,479 --> 01:46:11,698
can vary widely yeah local local tried

2721
01:46:09,539 --> 01:46:14,100
glass for his first time he had only

2722
01:46:11,698 --> 01:46:16,319
ever smoked out of joints or blunts I'm

2723
01:46:14,100 --> 01:46:18,480
like bro you have to try that and after

2724
01:46:16,319 --> 01:46:20,579
that he was a changed man and then he

2725
01:46:18,479 --> 01:46:22,859
trained and then he tried the rip and he

2726
01:46:20,579 --> 01:46:25,198
was even more mind blown that that weed

2727
01:46:22,859 --> 01:46:26,460
could taste like that you know yes well

2728
01:46:25,198 --> 01:46:29,698
it was funny with that old school

2729
01:46:26,460 --> 01:46:32,158
[ __ ] Vape box uh yeah yeah and the

2730
01:46:29,698 --> 01:46:34,799
crew like that method that we figured

2731
01:46:32,158 --> 01:46:36,839
out with it or whatever you know

2732
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:39,119
um and and then you just and then what's

2733
01:46:36,840 --> 01:46:42,060
interesting about that is you smoke a

2734
01:46:39,118 --> 01:46:43,920
joint a blue dream or you or you Vape

2735
01:46:42,060 --> 01:46:46,080
blue dream or you take a bong hit of it

2736
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:49,380
and you get different qualities sure

2737
01:46:46,079 --> 01:46:52,198
yeah yeah you know lots of it not to

2738
01:46:49,380 --> 01:46:55,199
explain explain what that box was again

2739
01:46:52,198 --> 01:46:57,618
oh man so the box it's like one of the

2740
01:46:55,198 --> 01:47:00,539
what's in the box not so it's awesome

2741
01:46:57,618 --> 01:47:02,819
it's probably like one of the older like

2742
01:47:00,539 --> 01:47:04,500
Vape devices that came out it's probably

2743
01:47:02,819 --> 01:47:06,539
been around for a good 20 years or

2744
01:47:04,500 --> 01:47:08,880
longer it's been a long time and it's

2745
01:47:06,539 --> 01:47:10,500
basically a wrapping

2746
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:12,960
can you guys hear it oh I'm sorry hold

2747
01:47:10,500 --> 01:47:15,658
on let me stop that

2748
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:17,698
I got an interesting house here it likes

2749
01:47:15,658 --> 01:47:19,079
to make some noises hold up he's beating

2750
01:47:17,698 --> 01:47:22,500
off there it is

2751
01:47:19,079 --> 01:47:25,198
and uh so it's like a wooden box that

2752
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:27,479
has like a glass uh element with a

2753
01:47:25,198 --> 01:47:30,359
ceramic on it and you can dial it in for

2754
01:47:27,479 --> 01:47:33,779
how hot it gets and then it has like a a

2755
01:47:30,359 --> 01:47:35,759
glass mouthpiece with a a tube for lack

2756
01:47:33,779 --> 01:47:37,979
of a better term that connects to

2757
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:39,659
another glass piece

2758
01:47:37,979 --> 01:47:42,479
um and most people would end up like

2759
01:47:39,658 --> 01:47:44,219
filling the glass like really deep yeah

2760
01:47:42,479 --> 01:47:46,439
and then you get one or two nice hits

2761
01:47:44,219 --> 01:47:48,480
and then it kind of tastes popcorny and

2762
01:47:46,439 --> 01:47:50,279
everything and it kind of loses its

2763
01:47:48,479 --> 01:47:52,799
flavor and it's hard to deal with but we

2764
01:47:50,279 --> 01:47:55,500
figured out 20 years ago is if you just

2765
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:57,360
grind up weed and you just you just use

2766
01:47:55,500 --> 01:48:00,600
the mouthpiece and you just suck up a

2767
01:47:57,359 --> 01:48:03,059
little bit just enough it's the motion

2768
01:48:00,600 --> 01:48:05,340
you do it yeah can you do it you have to

2769
01:48:03,060 --> 01:48:07,679
like Hoover yeah but what do you do do

2770
01:48:05,340 --> 01:48:10,560
you put it to your mouth I do you have

2771
01:48:07,679 --> 01:48:12,239
to put it I smoke by putting things to

2772
01:48:10,560 --> 01:48:13,920
my mouth and inhaling I don't know how

2773
01:48:12,238 --> 01:48:16,259
other people do it but that's my method

2774
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:19,020
okay uh I inhale if I can get you to

2775
01:48:16,260 --> 01:48:21,719
pantomime and so I uh and so you know

2776
01:48:19,020 --> 01:48:24,000
know if you but if you just coat the the

2777
01:48:21,719 --> 01:48:25,679
screen with a little bit of weed yeah

2778
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:27,238
you can get two or three really nice

2779
01:48:25,679 --> 01:48:28,739
hits and then you can blow it out in a

2780
01:48:27,238 --> 01:48:30,658
little bit of water or a glass or

2781
01:48:28,738 --> 01:48:32,579
something like that and it just is

2782
01:48:30,658 --> 01:48:34,439
really user friendly yeah that

2783
01:48:32,579 --> 01:48:39,840
completely changed my grip deck too now

2784
01:48:34,439 --> 01:48:42,079
yeah we the vapewear box right yeah Vape

2785
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:45,300
Wares and Vapor brothers made um

2786
01:48:42,079 --> 01:48:47,819
vapewear Vapor Brothers indeed and yeah

2787
01:48:45,300 --> 01:48:49,500
we smoked it a bunch and it kind of fell

2788
01:48:47,819 --> 01:48:52,319
in and out of favor and then when we

2789
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:54,179
figured out how to do it that way

2790
01:48:52,319 --> 01:48:57,380
there was like a couple year period

2791
01:48:54,179 --> 01:49:00,420
where like that was the method

2792
01:48:57,380 --> 01:49:02,340
and you get really clean Terps that way

2793
01:49:00,420 --> 01:49:04,319
you know you get really like a really

2794
01:49:02,340 --> 01:49:06,480
good sense of like the profile of how

2795
01:49:04,319 --> 01:49:08,099
the weed tastes I feel like it's a

2796
01:49:06,479 --> 01:49:11,158
little bit of a different Buzz I think

2797
01:49:08,100 --> 01:49:13,020
you get way higher in my opinion I at

2798
01:49:11,158 --> 01:49:14,599
least it's it's it's a noticeably

2799
01:49:13,020 --> 01:49:16,980
different High

2800
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:18,780
smoking any other way and I it's got to

2801
01:49:16,979 --> 01:49:20,638
be because like the volatile

2802
01:49:18,779 --> 01:49:22,198
[ __ ] that would normally burn away right

2803
01:49:20,639 --> 01:49:24,060
away you're actually experiencing what

2804
01:49:22,198 --> 01:49:25,919
it's like to you know and then the other

2805
01:49:24,060 --> 01:49:28,199
thing I'll say is that since everyone

2806
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:31,260
was so generous with samples

2807
01:49:28,198 --> 01:49:32,519
I'm still smoking off samples I brought

2808
01:49:31,260 --> 01:49:34,920
home

2809
01:49:32,520 --> 01:49:37,980
um and I got a much better sense of a

2810
01:49:34,920 --> 01:49:39,420
lot of the weed at home yeah sure I did

2811
01:49:37,979 --> 01:49:42,000
at the party because when you're at the

2812
01:49:39,420 --> 01:49:44,399
party once you've smoked 27 kinds of

2813
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:46,738
weed in eight hours through nine

2814
01:49:44,399 --> 01:49:48,420
different methods you know just looking

2815
01:49:46,738 --> 01:49:50,099
for what cuts through at that point yeah

2816
01:49:48,420 --> 01:49:51,779
it's like what cuts through but it's

2817
01:49:50,100 --> 01:49:54,000
like you you know it's hard and it's

2818
01:49:51,779 --> 01:49:55,559
like then it's like I can wake up and I

2819
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:57,179
can do some chores and I can take a

2820
01:49:55,560 --> 01:49:59,100
couple hits of this and go do some stuff

2821
01:49:57,179 --> 01:50:01,139
and I'll be like oh it does that

2822
01:49:59,100 --> 01:50:03,239
yeah yeah oh it's got that kind of

2823
01:50:01,139 --> 01:50:05,100
effect you know like oh it makes me want

2824
01:50:03,238 --> 01:50:06,839
to sit down and do nothing or like pack

2825
01:50:05,100 --> 01:50:09,840
said with the train wreck oh like it

2826
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:12,619
makes me want to move yeah did any of

2827
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:15,000
you get to try the banana tie oh yeah

2828
01:50:12,618 --> 01:50:18,059
that [ __ ] makes me want to move makes my

2829
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:21,319
heart pound I love it I love it a bit

2830
01:50:18,060 --> 01:50:21,320
much for me all right

2831
01:50:23,960 --> 01:50:29,520
that's the other part of it that I that

2832
01:50:26,639 --> 01:50:31,079
I do like is that you know pack used to

2833
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:33,119
live up in Humboldt and I do think that

2834
01:50:31,079 --> 01:50:36,139
like Humboldt and Mendo and going to I

2835
01:50:33,118 --> 01:50:39,539
call Santa Cruz like the very edge of

2836
01:50:36,139 --> 01:50:42,179
the weird bubble you know yeah there's

2837
01:50:39,539 --> 01:50:44,519
this bubble that there's enough weed

2838
01:50:42,179 --> 01:50:46,380
people doing stuff around you that

2839
01:50:44,520 --> 01:50:49,560
there's somewhat of a community

2840
01:50:46,380 --> 01:50:51,359
you know and we we got some friends that

2841
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:53,340
came out from Illinois and from Alaska

2842
01:50:51,359 --> 01:50:54,960
and from here and from there that

2843
01:50:53,340 --> 01:50:57,739
they're kind of like the only person

2844
01:50:54,960 --> 01:51:00,899
like them in their little Community yeah

2845
01:50:57,738 --> 01:51:02,879
and so it was really it was really nice

2846
01:51:00,899 --> 01:51:04,379
to see especially some of the younger

2847
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:06,539
guys

2848
01:51:04,380 --> 01:51:09,060
um get to hang out with a bunch of

2849
01:51:06,539 --> 01:51:11,219
people like them of all age groups

2850
01:51:09,060 --> 01:51:12,360
I think probably for them it was like

2851
01:51:11,219 --> 01:51:14,698
more

2852
01:51:12,359 --> 01:51:18,179
memorable even for us

2853
01:51:14,698 --> 01:51:19,919
I'm sure yeah maybe I don't know I don't

2854
01:51:18,179 --> 01:51:21,960
know if memorable would be the correct

2855
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:23,219
term saying how we're all so high you're

2856
01:51:21,960 --> 01:51:25,439
probably not going to retain a lot of

2857
01:51:23,219 --> 01:51:28,020
the members you know influential I don't

2858
01:51:25,439 --> 01:51:30,599
know remember I remember a fishing hook

2859
01:51:28,020 --> 01:51:31,940
almost hit me in the head a few times

2860
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:34,260
yeah yeah

2861
01:51:31,939 --> 01:51:36,000
and you know just just speaking of that

2862
01:51:34,260 --> 01:51:37,800
bubble not so that you brought up I was

2863
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:39,479
telling it you know a while back you

2864
01:51:37,800 --> 01:51:41,159
know one of the reasons why I didn't get

2865
01:51:39,479 --> 01:51:44,039
on the farm back in the days because I

2866
01:51:41,158 --> 01:51:46,679
you know I was in that network from you

2867
01:51:44,039 --> 01:51:48,238
know or the network that I that I had

2868
01:51:46,679 --> 01:51:49,859
around me was you know it was kind of

2869
01:51:48,238 --> 01:51:51,419
compartmentalized right like there was

2870
01:51:49,859 --> 01:51:53,519
the cruise down in Big Sur and you had

2871
01:51:51,420 --> 01:51:55,739
your Monterey cats Seaside gas and the

2872
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:57,239
injured people and you know Santa Cruz

2873
01:51:55,738 --> 01:52:00,299
and Humboldt

2874
01:51:57,238 --> 01:52:02,279
um but I I never had a need to go

2875
01:52:00,300 --> 01:52:04,739
outside of whatever the network was that

2876
01:52:02,279 --> 01:52:06,719
I was working within in terms of trying

2877
01:52:04,738 --> 01:52:09,599
to reach out or find out you know what's

2878
01:52:06,719 --> 01:52:11,939
going on with others or you know growing

2879
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:13,260
techniques or whatnot not that it wasn't

2880
01:52:11,939 --> 01:52:15,238
wouldn't have been something that would

2881
01:52:13,260 --> 01:52:17,159
have been helpful at that point but

2882
01:52:15,238 --> 01:52:18,779
because of my propensity to not want to

2883
01:52:17,158 --> 01:52:20,519
be on the radar whatsoever and even

2884
01:52:18,779 --> 01:52:21,539
touch a computer and say anything on

2885
01:52:20,520 --> 01:52:22,679
there

2886
01:52:21,539 --> 01:52:24,899
um that had anything to do with whatever

2887
01:52:22,679 --> 01:52:25,859
I wasn't really compelled at least in my

2888
01:52:24,899 --> 01:52:27,839
group to

2889
01:52:25,859 --> 01:52:29,219
have to you know feel like I need some

2890
01:52:27,840 --> 01:52:30,539
connection outside of what I'm doing on

2891
01:52:29,219 --> 01:52:32,880
my own you know I wasn't really that

2892
01:52:30,539 --> 01:52:35,039
kind of Lone Wolf space whereas you know

2893
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:36,118
a lot of people I think and HDL could

2894
01:52:35,039 --> 01:52:37,439
probably speak to us better than me but

2895
01:52:36,118 --> 01:52:39,539
a lot of people who weren't so connected

2896
01:52:37,439 --> 01:52:41,819
or had to be even more

2897
01:52:39,539 --> 01:52:43,439
um discreet right and they weren't going

2898
01:52:41,819 --> 01:52:45,000
to talk to anybody it was like that was

2899
01:52:43,439 --> 01:52:46,738
a great place to be able to make those

2900
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:49,560
connections and and really kind of

2901
01:52:46,738 --> 01:52:52,138
figure out what was going on right yeah

2902
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:53,760
here it was uh a whole different animal

2903
01:52:52,139 --> 01:52:57,719
I mean you didn't

2904
01:52:53,760 --> 01:53:00,539
you knew two guys maybe in the area it

2905
01:52:57,719 --> 01:53:03,060
was you know if you wanted if you wanted

2906
01:53:00,539 --> 01:53:04,920
to be amongst people like you you had to

2907
01:53:03,060 --> 01:53:07,260
find them online because you weren't

2908
01:53:04,920 --> 01:53:09,118
talking to other people around you doing

2909
01:53:07,260 --> 01:53:09,960
the same thing weren't talking and it's

2910
01:53:09,118 --> 01:53:13,198
still

2911
01:53:09,960 --> 01:53:15,779
uh still kind of like that here even

2912
01:53:13,198 --> 01:53:18,719
with you know some version of

2913
01:53:15,779 --> 01:53:21,238
legalization it's um it's still pretty

2914
01:53:18,719 --> 01:53:22,800
pretty closed-lipped at least you know

2915
01:53:21,238 --> 01:53:23,638
the people that have been doing it a

2916
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:27,360
long time

2917
01:53:23,639 --> 01:53:30,659
I agree and I also think that because

2918
01:53:27,359 --> 01:53:33,899
we're sort of like a a very small subset

2919
01:53:30,658 --> 01:53:36,960
of a subculture right

2920
01:53:33,899 --> 01:53:38,638
um in a way like we love weed for weed

2921
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:41,219
you know

2922
01:53:38,639 --> 01:53:43,560
um is that the either you know the

2923
01:53:41,219 --> 01:53:46,920
internet is a way for lots of people

2924
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:49,139
that have sort of unusual interests to

2925
01:53:46,920 --> 01:53:50,639
find each other

2926
01:53:49,139 --> 01:53:52,560
right

2927
01:53:50,639 --> 01:53:54,779
um you know from all kinds of walks of

2928
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:58,800
life if you know that or bathroom stalls

2929
01:53:54,779 --> 01:54:02,880
you only have two choices I mean and uh

2930
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:05,880
you know so they uh how I got NASA's

2931
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:08,420
numbers and indeed right off the

2932
01:54:05,880 --> 01:54:12,600
bathroom Saul

2933
01:54:08,420 --> 01:54:15,239
but yeah I mean I I I agree I you know

2934
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:16,739
it's it's that you know even in people

2935
01:54:15,238 --> 01:54:19,079
think

2936
01:54:16,738 --> 01:54:21,419
I get it all the time where people think

2937
01:54:19,079 --> 01:54:24,059
that Mendo or Humboldt is something that

2938
01:54:21,420 --> 01:54:25,618
it isn't yeah because they you know they

2939
01:54:24,060 --> 01:54:28,260
think of it as like this weed Mecca

2940
01:54:25,618 --> 01:54:29,519
which it kind of is but it also has all

2941
01:54:28,260 --> 01:54:32,100
these elements that like you wouldn't

2942
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:36,000
really get unless you lived there

2943
01:54:32,100 --> 01:54:38,280
um and so I but you know just you know

2944
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:41,520
sharing time and energy with like-minded

2945
01:54:38,279 --> 01:54:44,698
individuals I think is a good thing you

2946
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:47,040
know and I was I'd like pack I too I was

2947
01:54:44,698 --> 01:54:49,799
scared of the internet

2948
01:54:47,039 --> 01:54:52,560
um especially when Heaven's stairway and

2949
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:55,320
uh and cannabis world and and overgrow

2950
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:58,080
all got shut down yeah I wasn't very

2951
01:54:55,319 --> 01:55:00,238
tech savvy so I got worried that like

2952
01:54:58,079 --> 01:55:04,340
everything I did instead would be

2953
01:55:00,238 --> 01:55:06,178
permanently there that they could find

2954
01:55:04,340 --> 01:55:08,460
wasn't it

2955
01:55:06,179 --> 01:55:09,899
was a little bit it was kind of screen

2956
01:55:08,460 --> 01:55:14,039
Merchant

2957
01:55:09,899 --> 01:55:15,960
yeah it was definitely more like 1990

2958
01:55:14,039 --> 01:55:17,698
and this was like probably I don't know

2959
01:55:15,960 --> 01:55:21,359
I don't think those busts happened until

2960
01:55:17,698 --> 01:55:23,819
like code 304 if I remember correctly

2961
01:55:21,359 --> 01:55:25,979
um but I didn't like when with high and

2962
01:55:23,819 --> 01:55:30,599
Lonesome being on icmag and all that

2963
01:55:25,979 --> 01:55:32,339
like I worked in that era uh but I just

2964
01:55:30,600 --> 01:55:35,520
basically like you were on someone

2965
01:55:32,340 --> 01:55:38,159
else's computer yeah and I was I was in

2966
01:55:35,520 --> 01:55:40,980
NorCal Lake County Mendo you know it was

2967
01:55:38,158 --> 01:55:42,000
kind of a booming time for my area for

2968
01:55:40,979 --> 01:55:43,799
cannabis

2969
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:48,380
hmm

2970
01:55:43,800 --> 01:55:51,480
yeah not mine no not yours

2971
01:55:48,380 --> 01:55:53,400
hey Matt we didn't get you partner what

2972
01:55:51,479 --> 01:55:55,919
was was what was the standout or

2973
01:55:53,399 --> 01:55:58,920
standouts for you man oh [ __ ] I don't

2974
01:55:55,920 --> 01:56:01,079
know um of course a blue dream just

2975
01:55:58,920 --> 01:56:04,260
because like I it's a classic for me and

2976
01:56:01,079 --> 01:56:09,238
because I'm such a blueberry head like

2977
01:56:04,260 --> 01:56:10,760
um that's that that's what I I pulled to

2978
01:56:09,238 --> 01:56:13,919
um

2979
01:56:10,760 --> 01:56:15,659
let's see like the main standouts I know

2980
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:17,158
everybody was stoked on the shoreline I

2981
01:56:15,658 --> 01:56:18,658
didn't get to try that one because I was

2982
01:56:17,158 --> 01:56:19,618
so busy trying everything else but

2983
01:56:18,658 --> 01:56:22,618
that's the one I remember everybody

2984
01:56:19,618 --> 01:56:24,118
being real stoked on and hearing about

2985
01:56:22,618 --> 01:56:27,238
um foreign

2986
01:56:24,118 --> 01:56:30,059
yeah I liked Caleb's flight plan I think

2987
01:56:27,238 --> 01:56:32,279
it's called Flight Risk your flight plan

2988
01:56:30,060 --> 01:56:35,159
I always get it wrong that was a good

2989
01:56:32,279 --> 01:56:38,899
one Flight Risk light risk there you go

2990
01:56:35,158 --> 01:56:41,879
yeah it makes more sense in Flight Plan

2991
01:56:38,899 --> 01:56:44,698
and then there was he had one called

2992
01:56:41,880 --> 01:56:46,679
um the the blackberry wine 69. it was

2993
01:56:44,698 --> 01:56:50,399
real unique and tasted and smelled like

2994
01:56:46,679 --> 01:56:53,600
wine like a Chardonnay that was cool

2995
01:56:50,399 --> 01:56:58,738
um there was the the

2996
01:56:53,600 --> 01:57:01,380
uh sweet 16 I want to say yeah that was

2997
01:56:58,738 --> 01:57:03,599
really good I like that one paints and

2998
01:57:01,380 --> 01:57:05,219
burp selection I think yeah it was from

2999
01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:07,500
the pinks and perps like because I'm a

3000
01:57:05,219 --> 01:57:10,618
Blackberry Widow hybrid Mendo perps type

3001
01:57:07,500 --> 01:57:12,960
thing real cool yeah yeah kept going

3002
01:57:10,618 --> 01:57:15,118
back to that jar as a matter of fact

3003
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:16,560
yeah there was so much stuff there that

3004
01:57:15,118 --> 01:57:18,658
it was just ridiculous to try to go

3005
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:20,159
through it all there when I got home I I

3006
01:57:18,658 --> 01:57:21,238
didn't tried the Death Star much while I

3007
01:57:20,158 --> 01:57:23,638
was there when I got home I really

3008
01:57:21,238 --> 01:57:25,919
enjoyed it you know

3009
01:57:23,639 --> 01:57:28,380
um p91 I finally got to try when I got

3010
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:30,719
home and and that was really good really

3011
01:57:28,380 --> 01:57:32,520
good grow of it

3012
01:57:30,719 --> 01:57:35,819
um

3013
01:57:32,520 --> 01:57:37,500
God and it Denali silver Pearl I never

3014
01:57:35,819 --> 01:57:39,359
get enough of silver Pearl that was just

3015
01:57:37,500 --> 01:57:41,340
so good and I've never had outdoor

3016
01:57:39,359 --> 01:57:43,139
silver Pearl yet and it was still pretty

3017
01:57:41,340 --> 01:57:44,579
good I liked it and it actually had a

3018
01:57:43,139 --> 01:57:45,659
pretty pretty strong high for silver

3019
01:57:44,579 --> 01:57:50,658
Pearl

3020
01:57:45,658 --> 01:57:50,658
um 21 21 at least

3021
01:57:52,618 --> 01:57:58,920
yeah that's what I dug for sure

3022
01:57:55,920 --> 01:58:00,779
I was wondering I have a bag of that

3023
01:57:58,920 --> 01:58:01,859
silver Pearl it was smoked on the other

3024
01:58:00,779 --> 01:58:04,439
night and it looked like something

3025
01:58:01,859 --> 01:58:06,799
Denali put out so tasty

3026
01:58:04,439 --> 01:58:06,799
yeah yeah

3027
01:58:07,679 --> 01:58:13,079
backyard victory garden yeah

3028
01:58:11,039 --> 01:58:15,840
you know and so he gets to do a bunch of

3029
01:58:13,079 --> 01:58:18,420
favorites and stuff like that so yeah

3030
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:19,980
um yeah he had he had a I gave him uh my

3031
01:58:18,420 --> 01:58:23,460
Sour Diesel cut he had a pretty nice

3032
01:58:19,979 --> 01:58:25,559
example of that it was good um you know

3033
01:58:23,460 --> 01:58:27,380
I didn't even get to try that

3034
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:30,539
no I don't know

3035
01:58:27,380 --> 01:58:33,359
it's a hard one outside like the flavor

3036
01:58:30,539 --> 01:58:35,880
varies a lot outdoor but the potency is

3037
01:58:33,359 --> 01:58:37,679
there yeah for sure

3038
01:58:35,880 --> 01:58:39,000
oh wait no I take that back he did I did

3039
01:58:37,679 --> 01:58:41,340
get to try that one he sent it to me

3040
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:44,039
beforehand it was good did it really

3041
01:58:41,340 --> 01:58:45,599
good Outdoors yeah I was like wow this

3042
01:58:44,039 --> 01:58:46,859
actually is really good sour at first he

3043
01:58:45,599 --> 01:58:48,360
didn't know he's like I don't know if

3044
01:58:46,859 --> 01:58:49,500
this is good or not I was like no it's

3045
01:58:48,359 --> 01:58:52,679
actually coming through in the outdoor

3046
01:58:49,500 --> 01:58:55,920
it has a great smell yeah

3047
01:58:52,679 --> 01:58:57,779
the sour so variable outdoor it is

3048
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:59,819
but you know

3049
01:58:57,779 --> 01:59:02,399
I feel like the high normally is there

3050
01:58:59,819 --> 01:59:05,219
it's just the flavor and the looks you

3051
01:59:02,399 --> 01:59:06,779
know and for me are very variable

3052
01:59:05,219 --> 01:59:09,420
definitely

3053
01:59:06,779 --> 01:59:11,759
it takes a long time high in Lonesome so

3054
01:59:09,420 --> 01:59:12,539
you really need a good season

3055
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:14,280
yeah

3056
01:59:12,539 --> 01:59:16,198

we're always in the lab doing something

3142
02:02:32,760 --> 02:02:38,280
around here yeah I would say I would say

3143
02:02:35,760 --> 02:02:40,199
keep your eye out uh you know I don't

3144
02:02:38,279 --> 02:02:42,238
know if if anyone does follow on

3145
02:02:40,198 --> 02:02:43,738
Instagram or whatnot I have a tendency

3146
02:02:42,238 --> 02:02:45,238
to kind of post some things that I'll be

3147
02:02:43,738 --> 02:02:46,618
working with maybe a couple months ahead

3148
02:02:45,238 --> 02:02:48,299
of time

3149
02:02:46,618 --> 02:02:49,920
um and that's for me to get an idea as

3150
02:02:48,300 --> 02:02:51,719
to what I'm doing right it's Paul part

3151
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:52,859
of the vetting process but

3152
02:02:51,719 --> 02:02:55,500
um if you're wondering what might be

3153
02:02:52,859 --> 02:02:58,559
coming down uh the pipe here in the next

3154
02:02:55,500 --> 02:02:59,639
six months to a year or shorter

3155
02:02:58,560 --> 02:03:00,900
um you know there's some good things in

3156
02:02:59,639 --> 02:03:01,859
the works

3157
02:03:00,899 --> 02:03:03,539
um

3158
02:03:01,859 --> 02:03:05,039
I'll say that Shoreline is on that

3159
02:03:03,539 --> 02:03:08,219
Shoreline and that green crack is on the

3160
02:03:05,039 --> 02:03:09,960

high in Lonesome in the future maybe I

3164
02:03:13,380 --> 02:03:16,980
hope I think that's it in the books I

3165
02:03:15,479 --> 02:03:20,178
think it's a good idea that might be

3166
02:03:16,979 --> 02:03:20,178
