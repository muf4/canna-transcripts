maker for over a decade and a half and

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,240
this is my journey in defining my truth

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:18,480
in this wild world of cannabis I invite

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,820
you to join me and the can Illuminati by

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,160
strapping into the passenger seat but be

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,660
warned it's not always pretty with the

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,518
invasion of corporate culture into

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,740
cannabis it's getting even more muddy

12
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:30,538
which is why I've made it my mission to

13
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:32,460
have a permanent record before all the

14
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:33,480
history is lost and buried under a pile

15
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,160
of

16
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:37,500

The Syndicate is a collection of seed

19
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:43,738
makers that want to push back against

20
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:45,299
all the smoke and mirrors in doing so we

21
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:47,339
will continue to ruffle the feathers of

22
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:49,799
those who oppose and my personal mission

23
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,200
has become much bigger than myself

24
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:55,280
welcome to the Cannabis Underground

25
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,280
this is the revolution

26
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,600
hey everyone welcome to reader Syndicate

27
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:01,799
welcome to the season finale of season

28
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,079
eight

29
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:05,819
um today me and thousand thousand will

00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,099
be joining us we're going to be going

31
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:11,158
through users questions and kind of have

32
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:14,059
a relaxed Kickback episode to end the

33
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:17,159
season for a real kind of serious

34
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:18,000
breeding topic so yeah

35
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,400
um

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,519
let's kick it off

37
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,618
yeah sure okay so this is one we got

38
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,840
from Buckshot Hill actually a while ago

39
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:30,659
but we couldn't get to it and um we'll

40
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,520
see how we do okay so Buckshot wants to

41
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,799
know he says I've been talking with not

42
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:36,539
so about the early Pearl and how best to

43
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,299
proceed with my goals for finding a long

44
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,880
lost Fino or doing a 2.0 remake with

45
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,439
starting material that's period correct

46
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:45,839
the topic has been brought up to The

47
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:48,539
Syndicate before and it's been discussed

48
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,978
uh or maybe speculated that nl1 might be

49
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,040
the unknown indica

50
00:01:49,978 --> 00:01:54,599
never used to make early Pearl improved

51
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,820
I've been planning across with silver

52
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:59,280
Pearl to bring the DNA of 90s early

53
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:00,679
pullback into the mix not so agree that

54
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,000
is a good direction for a starting point

55
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,799
I've also been looking into what pure

56
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,098
Indica would have been available to

57
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,479
Neville in 89.90 and big bud fits the

58
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:11,699
possibilities

59
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,160
I started perfect proceeds from pip and

60
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:16,919
lost Pearl from Greenhouse both silver

61
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:19,318
Pearl s1s

62
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:21,119
um what do you think uh you know does

63
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:22,139
this sound appropriate

64
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,580
um

65
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:26,339
yeah so this is an interesting one

66
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,800
because this is a mixture of provenance

67
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,659
and what we know of

68
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,000
these lines

69
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:34,139
um as well as a breeding question so

70
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,939
yeah

71
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:40,079
so what do you think

72
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:41,939
early Pearl is an early early line

73
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,640
um brought to the community by Rob Clark

74
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:45,900
I'm not sure who like the basis for it I

75
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:47,039
should say were brought to you by Rob

76
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,080
Clark I'm not sure who's actually

77
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,959
responsible for it

78
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:55,200
um later on uh early Pearl worked its

79
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:57,360
way to Holland uh and into Neville

80
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:00,119
schoenmaker's hands

81
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,440
um according to his one of his last

82
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,120
Partners

83
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,459
um early Pearl ended up being one of his

84
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,379
favorite strains ever and he was

85
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:09,479
constantly working to trying to find the

86
00:03:07,378 --> 00:03:11,098
sweetness that was in the Mexican in

87
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:12,658
early Pearl because he felt like the

88
00:03:11,098 --> 00:03:15,419
sweetness that was coming through in the

89
00:03:12,658 --> 00:03:17,699
early Pearl was from the Mexican or

90
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:20,639
oaxacan type side

91
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:22,679
um so yeah that's that's the idea that

92
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:24,719
he was going for behind early Pearl was

93
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,879
the sweetness in that Mexican and he

94
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,259
liked the high a lot and I I agree I

95
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:29,579
like the high from the pearls quite a

96
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:30,840
bit

97
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,940
um

98
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,019
if I were gonna do an early Pearl

99
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:36,180
Project

100
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:37,860
like I think that's a great place to

101
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,200
start and mostly because I love silver

102
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:43,440
Pearl so much like

103
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:47,280
I don't know though I don't remember how

104
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:49,560
much different like the s1s like from

105
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,719
Greenhouse are going to be from like say

106
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,699
I had one early Pearl clone that went

107
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:54,739
around San Diego

108
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:56,939
yeah

109
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:58,739
you know like there's a bunch of

110
00:03:56,939 --> 00:04:01,079
different ones and I don't know how

111
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,060
similar they all were to each other and

112
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,580
I don't know how similar silver Pearl

113
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,019
was to like the early broken I saw you

114
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,900
know what I mean yeah

115
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:12,180
um yeah but if if you want a basis for

116
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,580
provenance like that that perfect Pearl

117
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:17,459
from killer killer some of the best

118
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:19,199
silver Pearl work that there is

119
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:21,180
with silver Pearl though there's

120
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,919
definitely some skunk one in it in the

121
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,360
in the smells but

122
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:27,120
it's it's

123
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,520
a world of other scents too so it's one

124
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,800
of the few skunk one lines that really

125
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:34,139
doesn't get too muddled down with skunk

126
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,040
one you know and silver Pearl

127
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:37,500
um

128
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,639
yeah I those lines would be perfect I

129
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,600
don't know anything about like I said I

130
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,340
don't know anything about the greenhouse

131
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,220
line and they're not very consistent and

132
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:45,959
they kind of um I mean they're not for

133
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,160
their bait and switching in the first

134
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:48,418
place so

135
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,520
you know you never know what you're

136
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:53,399
gonna get there uh but with Fifth Line

137
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:55,439
I've seen it run it used it read with it

138
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:57,659
it's amazing so I think that's an

139
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:01,019
amazing thing to start with um as far as

140
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:04,560
the unknown Indica I think the big uh uh

141
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:06,478
definitely a viable option

142
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,100
um there's not a lot of reading that

143
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:10,860
Neville did where he didn't disclose

144
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:13,020
what he was using and I tend to have the

145
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,939
sneaking suspicion and it's just like

146
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:16,680
from knowing Neville and talking to him

147
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:18,899
and you know

148
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,519
messing with them that I think you know

149
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:22,679
usually when I see things like unknown

150
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:23,939
Indica being referenced by Neville it

151
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,579
immediately makes me think oh he's

152
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:29,579
probably using Afghani one or something

153
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:32,339
because he hated Sam this company so

154
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:34,500
much that like if there was anything

155
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:36,060
used to name his work yeah if there's

156
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,720
anyone who strip credit

157
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:41,100
from it would totally be Sam you know so

158
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,960
um yeah all he ever did was don't talk

159
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,120
Afghan he won but I swear to God he used

160
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:47,099
it a lot of stuff so

161
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,259
um and and named it other things called

162
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,000
it other things you know so that's just

163
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:53,819
a theory I know some of the other

164
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,439
partners share that theory with me too

165
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:57,959
separately yeah because Buckshot

166
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:01,500
mentioned that his guest was big bud but

167
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:03,120
I imagine that if it had been there's no

168
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:07,019
reason for it to not have been named

169
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,780
right yeah yeah especially at that point

170
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:12,060
yeah fascinating

171
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:13,619
I guess

172
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,538
I mean I had a thought here which is

173
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:19,319
also uh and because he doesn't mention

174
00:06:15,538 --> 00:06:23,339
it with a buckshot himself has

175
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:24,719
um a sense of the Pearl that he wants to

176
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:26,219
capture

177
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,560
um or whether this is kind of like an

178
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,940
abstract almost like academic thing and

179
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,879
he doesn't actually have that experience

180
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:36,060
I think um his family had a early early

181
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:37,800
Pearl cut or seed line but they like

182
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,240
cherished so that's why they're going

183
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,879
back to 100 so I think they have a lot

184
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,680
of experience with the pearls so that'll

185
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:44,939
be a tremendous help you know obviously

186
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,620
like if you have a ton of experience

187
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:48,120
with early Pearl and you're running

188
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,800
through a bunch of silver Pearl crosses

189
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,780
that's going to be

190
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,720
tons of help you know to select away

191
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:56,638
from the skunk one and everything else

192
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,139
cool all right

193
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,360
well Buckshot I guess you got to keep us

194
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:04,579
updated on how this goes yes please do

195
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,580
shout out to Buck and his wife

196
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,400
yeah I hope you're doing well buddy

197
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:09,299
okay

198
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:11,579
um

199
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,978
so this is a a bit of a broader question

200
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:16,139
Matt and this one has more to do with

201
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:18,360
the industry and maybe

202
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:21,300
ethics and philosophy a little bit as

203
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:24,300
well but I'll start so this is from

204
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:27,060
squirrel okay and he asks what's the

205
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:28,918
difference between a breeder a seed

206
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:31,800
maker and a seed company

207
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:33,959
he also wants to talk uh he also wants

208
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,199
to ask you about ghost breeding

209
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:36,198
um yeah

210
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,340
and there's more to the question that

211
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,199
concerns uh Josie and subcool but maybe

212
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:45,119
I don't know do you want to like include

213
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,560
that no I want to just address his first

214
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,399
question yeah we'll do the first one

215
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,978
first

216
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:53,579
yeah okay so this is something like I've

217
00:07:49,978 --> 00:07:55,800
spent a lot of my career trying to

218
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:57,300
not necessarily educate people on but

219
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,680
try to help Define this for the

220
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,379
community

221
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:04,019
and and make it very clear that there

222
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:05,939
are different categories

223
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:08,818
um so that when people are shopping they

224
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:11,160
understand who they're buying from what

225
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:12,660
they're buying and all of that and

226
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,780
that's the difference between a breeder

227
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:18,660
a seed maker what's the last one

228
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:20,939
anything Seed Company

229
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,860
I guess maybe that could mean like a

230
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:25,800
potentially like a seed bank maybe yeah

231
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:29,300
okay so yeah let's do breeder let's do

232
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:33,060
breeder Seed Company seed bank

233
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:34,440
seed maker Seed Company same thing to me

234
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:38,038
um

235
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:40,800
so a breeder let's start with a breeder

236
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:43,559
there is rarely going to be anyone who

237
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,958
can actually call themselves a breeder

238
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:47,639
in cannabis even though our show is

239
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,979
called the breeder syndicate

240
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:52,080
like realistically looking at

241
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:54,420
agricultural breeding I can't call

242
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,060
myself like a real breeder I don't sit

243
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:59,338
there and work a line for 25 years bring

244
00:08:57,059 --> 00:09:01,679
it to Market you know like hunt Sports

245
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:05,700
in a line like all that stuff to me

246
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:10,399
that's very much breeding breeding

247
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:14,100
um in cannabis though we kind of

248
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,620
considering what we've had you know and

249
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,879
and who's led the way and and how

250
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,980
they've done it

251
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:22,559
Britain has been a lot different from

252
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,659
our cultural perspective right it's so

253
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:26,518
much different than AG so the breeders

254
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:28,980
in our community tend to be what we

255
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:31,980
consider the people who have worked many

256
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:35,459
lines multiple Generations you know they

257
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:38,159
start with a goal they look at their

258
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:40,319
Tools in their toolbox be it clones or

259
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:43,679
seed lines and they say what can help me

260
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,080
get to this goal and then they you know

261
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,338
they use those tools and work until they

262
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,600
meet that goal it could be several

263
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:50,820
Generations in or it could be one

264
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,278
generation but that's that's breeding

265
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:55,140
breeding is just goal-oriented selection

266
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:56,458
to me

267
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:58,379
um

268
00:09:56,458 --> 00:10:01,679
then there's seed making

269
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:03,539
and anybody can make seats

270
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:05,939
like that's not

271
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:07,799
that's not a secret like anybody can

272
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:10,080
make seeds and anybody can make seeds

273
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:12,319
that turn out decent

274
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,300
anybody can make seeds that turn out

275
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,700
insanely fire

276
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:18,899
um but seed making isn't necessarily

277
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,940
breeding

278
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:23,820
while you are making seeds while

279
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:25,680
breeding a seed maker is one in our

280
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,600
community the definition would be one

281
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:29,579
who makes seeds but they're not really

282
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,080
into the selection they're not really

283
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,600
working lines they're doing you know

284
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:37,440
one-off crosses here they are boom you

285
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,159
know it's and it's a very valid way of

286
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,500
um

287
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:43,919
selling seeds like most of the market is

288
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:46,860
this I'd say 99.9 of the market is this

289
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:48,659
I do a lot of this one-off crosses here

290
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:51,959
they are if you want to take it further

291
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:54,179
feel free if not you know drop it

292
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:55,799
um I think it's the most common thing

293
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:58,500
you're gonna run into in the seed world

294
00:10:55,799 --> 00:11:00,899
is seed makers now you can have seed

295
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,000
makers that do breeding projects I would

296
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:05,399
say that I've done that

297
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,860
um but I've done more seed making

298
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,958
projects than breeding projects and I

299
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,399
think that's the majority of our

300
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:13,379
community

301
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:16,259
and then you have something like a seed

302
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:19,379
bank and a seed bank is somewhere where

303
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:20,939
you can go and get

304
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:23,338
the idea would be that you can go and

305
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,620
get a multitude of different options of

306
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:27,420
lines from a seed bank

307
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,799
um usually a seed bank hosts many

308
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:30,899
breeders

309
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:33,000
in cannabis in our culture that's how

310
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:35,278
it's usually gone down but then there

311
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,440
are some breeders like CSI that are so

312
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:40,620
prolific that you can literally get

313
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,839
almost any cross from them and they

314
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:45,000
become a seed bank in themselves they're

315
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:46,920
so prolific that's a rare rare

316
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,360
occurrence I mean there's people who

317
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:50,639
claim that they do that but there's not

318
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,459
really yeah yeah

319
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,319
um that would be the overall rundown on

320
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:58,859
that I'll stop my head like the main

321
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:02,339
differences is goal oriented versus

322
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:04,200
um just strictly production and uh yeah

323
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:05,459
I know I didn't go into ghost breeding

324
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,920
yet

325
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:09,958
yeah I guess that that's like a natural

326
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:13,139
next yeah

327
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:15,899
step so I guess this is when um the seed

328
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:18,360
making itself or all breeding I guess is

329
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:19,980
outsourced to someone else right yeah so

330
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,200
a lot of us have done this I've done it

331
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,240
I um I see no problem with doing this

332
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,740
for people I like to be transparent

333
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,579
about it but a lot of people that hire

334
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,379
me

335
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:30,059
don't want me to be transparent about it

336
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:32,159
and that's fine too because it's their

337
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:33,599
prerogative how they how they move their

338
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:35,100
seeds and sell their seeds isn't up to

339
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,259
me I just want to make so just to

340
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:40,079
clarify Matt you mean that you've um

341
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:41,759
you've done some ghost seed making slash

342
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:44,578
breeding for other people yeah for other

343
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:46,379
seed companies yeah yeah and and made

344
00:12:44,578 --> 00:12:49,559
seeds for them they sold it under their

345
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:51,778
name you know and let them rep that as

346
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:53,099
their strain and and you don't really go

347
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:54,179
around telling people that you made it

348
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,399
because

349
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:58,078
you got paid up front and that's your

350
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,120
goal is to just do that and their goal

351
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:00,838
is to be the seed maker

352
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,440
um

353
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:07,200
it's it was a lot more common

354
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:09,240
um to see back in the day like things

355
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,040
like that I don't really know what's

356
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,799
going on today most of the ghost

357
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:17,338
breeding quote unquote ghost breeding is

358
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:19,740
done in Spain or in Colombia and people

359
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:22,200
are buying their seeds bulk from there

360
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,720
and I I well I spilled this out in other

361
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:27,300
episodes but essentially like in the in

362
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,360
the mid 2000s the way it worked was you

363
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:32,278
know like Amsterdam would Source out

364
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,379
people were already making seeds in

365
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:36,720
Spain and they were making crosses of

366
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:38,700
things like random Northern Lights I

367
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,879
remember that the plant just said NL in

368
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:44,700
the in the um Buddha seeds room

369
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:49,620
um uh orange bud

370
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:51,480
uh White Widow AK-47 uh White Russian

371
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,759
White Rhino

372
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,200
blueberry

373
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:56,819
hash plant

374
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,379
like there's a lot of things like that

375
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,459
just normal generic things that you

376
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,740
would have seen in like scentsy's

377
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:04,078
catalog back in the day is what they say

378
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:06,659
they have in Spain and they make crosses

379
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:09,239
of all of these feminized crosses of all

380
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:11,699
of them every single which direction and

381
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,200
then the the Dutch company's given a

382
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,639
catalog and they'll look through it and

383
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,680
they'll say oh this is the closest to

384
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,899
what my Cali missed was or this is the

385
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:21,838
closest to what uh the White Rhino

386
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:23,639
hybrid we had was or this isn't even

387
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,019
close to gelato but [ __ ] it it's cheap

388
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:27,360
let's put it in there people will know

389
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:29,100
the difference a la Barney's Farm you

390
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,919
know like their purple punch or whatever

391
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:34,980
you can name any of their their work

392
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:36,539
um work but yeah that's essentially how

393
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,379
it worked back then and they would go

394
00:14:36,539 --> 00:14:39,659
through it they would try to find

395
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:40,919
something that was similar genetically

396
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:45,778
similar and that would be good enough

397
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:48,059
and you know 2005 on anybody that bought

398
00:14:45,778 --> 00:14:50,639
anything from Amsterdam from any Dutch

399
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:53,698
company that's what happened they all

400
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:56,459
Outsource that's it was done it's a why

401
00:14:53,698 --> 00:14:57,838
it's a wrap Spanish is Spain Spain's

402
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:59,578
making everything everything is now

403
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,220
confused because everything's being

404
00:14:59,578 --> 00:15:04,259
relabeled and renamed you know so think

405
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,579
of all the Breeders post 2005 that were

406
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:07,620
using Dutch genetics to make their

407
00:15:05,578 --> 00:15:10,319
hybrids

408
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:14,278
so Matt like from from the point of view

409
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:16,740
of these uh companies with seed banks uh

410
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:18,958
Outsourcing the stuff or you know kind

411
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:20,579
of picking from these catalogs the

412
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:22,500
incentives for them are quite clear it's

413
00:15:20,578 --> 00:15:24,479
obviously going to be cheaper and blah

414
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,639
blah finally

415
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,440
I'm curious then this is a tangent for

416
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,480
you when you were doing it what was the

417
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,040
incentive for you or like why would you

418
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,560
have gotten into it

419
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:36,659
um why does one get into that so when I

420
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:38,879
got into it is because I had small

421
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:43,259
spaces and the places that wanted me to

422
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:44,939
do these reversals had massive spaces so

423
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:46,319
even though they were choosing what I

424
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:50,279
got to work with

425
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:52,800
like I got to see massive populations of

426
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:55,320
done in these big reversals that I was

427
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:57,479
doing so my main motive was that just

428
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:59,278
getting to see populations grown and

429
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,259
traits and all that didn't matter what

430
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:03,240
it was as long as I was getting to see

431
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:05,220
massive populations because that was my

432
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,379
goal was to see massive populations and

433
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:09,540
how and what what comes in it you know

434
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:11,698
yeah um yeah and so there were some

435
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:13,679
interesting benefits for you yeah and

436
00:16:11,698 --> 00:16:15,179
sometimes it would be friends you know

437
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:17,338
like friends that had seed companies

438
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:19,019
that were down at the time and couldn't

439
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:20,760
make the seeds so I just be like [ __ ]

440
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:22,379
I'll put it out there and do it you know

441
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:23,278
they knew that I'd do it and do it right

442
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:25,500
and

443
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:28,439
yeah so if any of you are still hiring

444
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,879
you know I do I do it

445
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,019
I don't know how many I don't know how

446
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:33,539
many seed companies are still in

447
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:34,980
existence after this uh fallout but yeah

448
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:36,778
I mean that was a big thing for a long

449
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,820
time uh making Femme seeds for other

450
00:16:36,778 --> 00:16:42,778
dudes so they could sell them

451
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:45,240
yeah yeah and I I think you know uh in a

452
00:16:42,778 --> 00:16:47,759
way when you first when one first hears

453
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,759
about this it might seem immediately

454
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:53,278
like it's a

455
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:55,199
scummy or kind of a scammy thing but not

456
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:57,899
necessarily right like it can it can be

457
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:59,758
super innocuous like that in that

458
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:02,100
situation when I do it like I'm using

459
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,419
the real clones to do it so you're

460
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,058
getting the product that you think

461
00:17:03,419 --> 00:17:07,798
you're gonna get it's not like uh

462
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:09,539
you know like they outsourced it you're

463
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:10,798
getting calumist white rhino when you

464
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:11,759
think you're getting wedding cake you

465
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:13,078
know what I mean like it's you're

466
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:14,519
actually getting what you're supposed to

467
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:17,338
be getting the only transparent

468
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:19,859
transparency that's not there usually is

469
00:17:17,338 --> 00:17:21,298
who made it and most of these guys that

470
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:23,099
I did this for don't even really

471
00:17:21,298 --> 00:17:24,900
communicate with the public to say that

472
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:26,879
they made it or didn't make it it's just

473
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,199
assumed it's inferred because there's

474
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,860
such big companies They Don't Really

475
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:33,298
interact you know so okay so that's an

476
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:36,119
important distinction to make as well

477
00:17:33,298 --> 00:17:37,918
that even within this

478
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:41,099
um Endeavor of ghost breeding or

479
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:43,080
Outsourcing seed making that there's

480
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:45,480
still a difference as it as it as there

481
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:47,339
is with actual breeding uh between the

482
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,900
people who are using

483
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:50,519
um the real materials and know what

484
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:54,480
they're doing versus the people who

485
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:56,339
don't yeah and there's one other thing I

486
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,019
definitely want to to put out there too

487
00:17:56,339 --> 00:18:00,839
is that like

488
00:17:58,019 --> 00:18:02,579
Spaniards got [ __ ] on a lot because they

489
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:05,159
were the ones making the seeds that the

490
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:07,319
Dutch were selling but

491
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,880
the the Spaniards did really good work

492
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:10,500
like I think they were very confident

493
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,720
the guys who were making the bulk seeds

494
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,279
over there were very competent um they

495
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,679
were some of the first pioneers doing

496
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:17,940
massive massive Femme reversals over in

497
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:20,100
Spain so I have a lot of respect for

498
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,840
those dudes a lot and it's just

499
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,399
unfortunate how it played out because

500
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:25,918
like in Spain it was just a bunch of

501
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,559
dudes with like no ego at all that

502
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,720
wanted to make seeds and that's it they

503
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:32,038
just wanted to make seeds and they

504
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,079
didn't care about a name they didn't

505
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:36,000
care about getting famous at all yeah

506
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:38,819
and yeah

507
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,519
go ahead the onus was I guess more on

508
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:43,439
the the people using these seeds and

509
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:45,900
selling these seeds on and what how they

510
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,640
represented them right absolutely yeah I

511
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:50,280
mean there's no transparency it makes it

512
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,020
kind of hard right like you you think

513
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:53,339
that Barn there's a guy named Barnegat

514
00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:57,079
Barney's Farm doing all this killer

515
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:57,079
breeding right like yeah

516
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,740
there is no Barney I wonder who Barney

517
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,660
is

518
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:06,058
he doesn't even exist there's a guy

519
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,380
named Gary somewhere

520
00:19:06,058 --> 00:19:09,960
yeah

521
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:13,020
okay that's cool I think actually those

522
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,519
were a couple of good insights that um

523
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:15,900
you kind of have talked about these

524
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:17,879
things before but maybe not in that much

525
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,080
depth so that's cool those were cool

526
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,660
anecdotes

527
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:22,918
yeah um ghost breeding so it's a tricky

528
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,720
thing because like I said yeah it's

529
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:25,440
political

530
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,900
um

531
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,660
you know and and the weird thing was

532
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:32,400
that I've got accused of like buying

533
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:35,400
bulk seeds from Spain and selling them

534
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,900
that was like for for a company to have

535
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,700
to do that like you have to be a pretty

536
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:42,000
wealthy company moving a lot of seeds to

537
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,200
make that a viable method for doing it

538
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,940
because you're buying in bulk so you're

539
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,819
spending like 20 grand

540
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:50,460
I don't have 20 grand like to be buying

541
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:52,019
bulk seeds like you know so it just even

542
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:53,819
financially and economically it would

543
00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:56,879
never make sense for me to Outsource

544
00:19:53,819 --> 00:20:00,119
some not that big you know like

545
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,640
yeah there's no reason to Outsource um

546
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:05,879
the kilowatt hours in Spain versus the

547
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,860
US was and the land prices in rent was

548
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,600
white a lot of people chose why Spain

549
00:20:07,859 --> 00:20:11,639
ended up being the place to do all this

550
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,859
the permissiveness

551
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,538
um because it was wasn't super permitted

552
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:17,699
but it wasn't super

553
00:20:15,538 --> 00:20:20,519
attacked

554
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:23,340
um by the local police there and the

555
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:25,379
kilowatt hour and the space is why and

556
00:20:23,339 --> 00:20:27,359
and it's also why Colombia opened up too

557
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:29,100
and why Colombia is starting to produce

558
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:31,859
a massive amount of these seeds down

559
00:20:29,099 --> 00:20:34,019
there for the Breeders up here the seed

560
00:20:31,859 --> 00:20:36,678
makers like uh the compounds or whatever

561
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:36,679
of the world

562
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:41,159
uh another tangent

563
00:20:39,298 --> 00:20:42,720
um and I mentioned to you that just

564
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:46,140
before we start a recording that I

565
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,940
watched burn a video okay visiting

566
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:50,520
Thailand to open the cookie stores there

567
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:51,720
but I also wonder next what Thailand is

568
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:55,319
going to

569
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:57,298
you know what kind of platform or um

570
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:59,220
possibilities Thailand is going to

571
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:01,200
introduce so I'm going to say something

572
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:03,058
very very it might hurt a lot of

573
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,740
people's feelings might be a little

574
00:21:03,058 --> 00:21:06,660
spicy

575
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:10,140
but I saw

576
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:12,660
the worst of California

577
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:14,820
go to the world go and be the worst in

578
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:16,798
Colorado and then they went to Michigan

579
00:21:14,819 --> 00:21:19,439
the same people and then they went to

580
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:22,038
Oklahoma and now they're all in Thailand

581
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:25,798
like it's just like been this

582
00:21:22,038 --> 00:21:27,359
downward slide of failure and refuse all

583
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:29,819
going to time there's good dudes there

584
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:33,359
too like the good dudes went but like

585
00:21:29,819 --> 00:21:35,099
a lot of Bad Dudes went a lot of bad

586
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:37,439
dudes that just ripped people off along

587
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:39,359
the way in all these states all ended up

588
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,640
there so I'm very interested to see how

589
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:42,538
that plays out because it's like they

590
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,100
went there because they think it's

591
00:21:42,538 --> 00:21:47,099
[ __ ] Lawless and they get away with

592
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:49,259
some crazy [ __ ] you know but yeah I I

593
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:50,279
just don't know I don't know I don't

594
00:21:49,259 --> 00:21:51,538
know if they know what they're in for

595
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:53,940
either

596
00:21:51,538 --> 00:21:56,579
maybe uh either later in the year or

597
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:59,460
even 2024 we can try and Wrangle a

598
00:21:56,579 --> 00:22:00,839
Thailand update from someone everybody

599
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,419
there I have everybody there right now

600
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:04,500
yeah that would be that would be really

601
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:05,299
interesting

602
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,339
um

603
00:22:05,298 --> 00:22:10,440
to watch his journey it's rough dude

604
00:22:08,339 --> 00:22:12,480
like when he first got over there

605
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,740
um I'm talking about HBK uh we

606
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,259
interviewed him right before he moved

607
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:19,259
and um just watching his journey on

608
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:22,558
Facebook just like even adapting to the

609
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:24,779
food and water was brutal to watch him

610
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:26,759
he just got so [ __ ] up by that place

611
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:29,158
you know like there's so many things

612
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:31,079
that I wouldn't even think about when

613
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:34,620
thinking about moving to Thailand to

614
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:36,298
grow like just basic food survival stuff

615
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:39,500
that our American stomachs can't take

616
00:22:36,298 --> 00:22:39,500
you know things like that

617
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:44,158
yeah okay well I I think this could be

618
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,339
an interesting episode so maybe imagine

619
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:49,860
I can discuss this later yeah

620
00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:51,839
okay well coming back to squirrel's

621
00:22:49,859 --> 00:22:53,759
question and I uh was there anything

622
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:55,079
else you wanted to say on ghost breeding

623
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:57,379
Matt before we moved on to the second

624
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:57,379
part

625
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:01,380
just that it's more prolific than than

626
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:03,779
most people know like

627
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,340
you know like it's it's hard to not name

628
00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:06,779
names

629
00:23:05,339 --> 00:23:08,339
because

630
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:11,480
people really think these people make

631
00:23:08,339 --> 00:23:11,480
their seeds but like

632
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,840
the biggest sellers the people who make

633
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,538
the most money in seeds the compounds

634
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:19,379
the seed Junkies you know name a few

635
00:23:18,538 --> 00:23:21,419
names

636
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,860
they don't make their seeds they're not

637
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:24,480
breeders

638
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:26,038
they have other people make them at

639
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,319
these facilities that are [ __ ] trash

640
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:30,119
you know like and they don't give a [ __ ]

641
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:33,899
who's making the seeds they just need

642
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:35,399
seed to put in a in a shell to sell as

643
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,960
long as there's a physical seed there

644
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,519
they're good because they don't give a

645
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,900
[ __ ] what happens to it afterwards as

646
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:42,000
everybody saw it with the Candy Rain

647
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,740
incident cookies you know like yeah

648
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,720
nobody cares

649
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:47,159
but yeah that's it is the majority of

650
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,960
what people have in their collections

651
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:51,720
was made

652
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,240
ghost bread it was Ghost bread or made

653
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,860
in Spain or Colombia and they just have

654
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,259
no clue

655
00:23:55,859 --> 00:24:01,379
yeah and so I guess like like you were

656
00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:04,859
implying earlier ghost breeding in and

657
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:07,020
of itself isn't a good or bad thing

658
00:24:04,859 --> 00:24:09,119
um it's a context and in some contexts

659
00:24:07,019 --> 00:24:11,038
it's perfectly innocuous in another

660
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:12,658
context it's perfectly insidious

661
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:14,940
insidious

662
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:17,580
it's as Insidious as you can imagine in

663
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:20,159
some contexts but um yeah yeah it's um

664
00:24:17,579 --> 00:24:22,199
it's very mild it's just a matter of

665
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:25,679
well you know at least you get what you

666
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:28,259
got yeah it seeds it's almost the best

667
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,700
you can hope for anyone it's sad oh well

668
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:31,859
at least you got what you [ __ ] paid

669
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,120
for I mean maybe you know maybe it

670
00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:35,219
wasn't a dude

671
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:36,599
whose face was on that picture smiling

672
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,220
at you but at least you got what you

673
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:40,199
paid for and that's like that's sad

674
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:42,538
that's the best we can hope for really

675
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,340
like like it's hard to hope for a

676
00:24:42,538 --> 00:24:45,779
breeder who will like write you back and

677
00:24:44,339 --> 00:24:47,220
be like okay well if you're interested

678
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:48,960
in this line you know like here's some

679
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,339
traits and blah blah blah that it

680
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,600
doesn't happen I hear about it all the

681
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:53,399
time people email me and I'm like dude

682
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:55,558
I'm surprised you even responded I've

683
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:58,019
never had anybody respond before

684
00:24:55,558 --> 00:24:59,099
you know yeah but it's because people

685
00:24:58,019 --> 00:25:01,079
don't understand it's not because

686
00:24:59,099 --> 00:25:02,279
they're busy people just don't know how

687
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:03,538
to answer the questions they don't have

688
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:05,879
answers to the questions that you're

689
00:25:03,538 --> 00:25:09,839
asking if it's about breeding stuff

690
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:11,159
that's a reality like it sucks to say

691
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:13,439
and people are probably gonna get pissed

692
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:14,760
that I said it but it's a reality it

693
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,640
really is

694
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:19,319
yeah so it's a great question because

695
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:22,140
it uh

696
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:24,119
it sums up quite a bit uh it does the

697
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:27,960
industry I think it's one of the most

698
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:30,239
important topics to to probably recover

699
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:33,120
every now and then just because there's

700
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:35,880
so many new people coming in that don't

701
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:38,759
know that big massive part and when it

702
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,980
was going on during the mid-2000s I was

703
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:42,778
jumping up screaming stomping my feet

704
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,038
[ __ ] screaming it from the rafters

705
00:25:42,778 --> 00:25:46,319
and that's when I was getting banned

706
00:25:44,038 --> 00:25:48,538
from every Forum back then

707
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:51,240
it wasn't something that everybody knew

708
00:25:48,538 --> 00:25:53,460
it was never it was never an Open Secret

709
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:55,079
back then even like it just wasn't

710
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,700
talked about you weren't allowed to talk

711
00:25:55,079 --> 00:26:00,000
about it like

712
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:01,159
you know it's just yeah

713
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,038
maybe

714
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:06,900
every year or every six months they're

715
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:08,940
they're certain certain topics that are

716
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:11,460
worth revisiting maybe like I think

717
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:13,798
that's a good good call

718
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:15,480
we can okay it's finally I just off the

719
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:16,400
top of my head right it would be fun to

720
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:20,700
like

721
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:23,038
uh get a Euro Europe update be fun to

722
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:25,200
get a Thailand update it'd be fun for

723
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:27,839
you to do a reflection on the uh

724
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,179
American industry you know what I really

725
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:31,379
want to do too is a prediction episode

726
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:33,900
each year

727
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:35,820
predicting what's going to happen as

728
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,500
well what companies will do what what

729
00:26:35,819 --> 00:26:39,000
companies will still be around and yeah

730
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,940
I think that'll be fun

731
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,298
yeah a little spicy

732
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:48,240
okay okay let's so

733
00:26:45,298 --> 00:26:50,579
squirrel's second question which is

734
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,679
related also has to do with some of the

735
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:55,259
politics politics and complexities of

736
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:56,038
you know running these companies sure

737
00:26:55,259 --> 00:26:58,500
um

738
00:26:56,038 --> 00:27:02,038
and he wants to know about

739
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:06,440
the legacy of breeders or seed makers

740
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:09,179
who have died and some of the messes or

741
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:12,840
complications around that like do you

742
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:14,759
have any you know yeah so

743
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:17,220
I think like the main one that most

744
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:19,079
people think of when it comes to messes

745
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:21,120
after people pass would probably be

746
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:22,038
Gorilla Glue

747
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:25,859
um

748
00:27:22,038 --> 00:27:27,119
Josie Josie and lone

749
00:27:25,859 --> 00:27:28,079
I don't want to use a real name

750
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:30,359
everybody knows their names but I'm

751
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:32,939
Josie alone are the people responsible

752
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:36,298
for Gorilla Glue and

753
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:38,400
near the end they had tried to do a

754
00:27:36,298 --> 00:27:40,558
legal company and there was a lot of

755
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,200
like cease and desists sent out saying

756
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:44,579
you can't use Gorilla Glue for clone

757
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,558
which is a clone that was passed to

758
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:47,939
everyone and anybody that was using it

759
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:50,038
they were sending cease and desist too

760
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:51,179
they didn't do it to me because we were

761
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:52,619
friends

762
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:54,360
um but it wasn't even necessarily Josie

763
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:56,699
and lone that were doing it they they

764
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:58,139
had hired some legal stuff and you know

765
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,720
they had a friend named Kat who's super

766
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:03,059
nice I got along with cat real well

767
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,740
um nice person and she ended up being

768
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:08,339
who had Gorilla Glue after they both

769
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:11,099
passed and um yeah it was just wild it

770
00:28:08,339 --> 00:28:13,379
was different it was political I know

771
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:14,339
um I sat on my Gorilla Glue 4 hybrids

772
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:17,520
because me and Josie were gonna release

773
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:18,778
it as a collab and then after we passed

774
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:20,460
there was some lawsuits going on with

775
00:28:18,778 --> 00:28:22,200
the company I'm like look this I'm not

776
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:24,720
dealing with this [ __ ] you know they're

777
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:28,019
getting revved up in some lawsuit so uh

778
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:31,798
I just sat on him forever you know um

779
00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:33,900
I know CSI like I I won't even

780
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:35,400
he he released Gorilla Glue in

781
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,720
collaboration with Josie and made sure

782
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,400
that his family's still getting money

783
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,960
for it too which I think is so

784
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,700
commendable there's all different ways

785
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,480
it's done

786
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,880
um

787
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,860
and it's just you know it really depends

788
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,539
up to the person how they handle it but

789
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:51,178
it's it's also they have a community

790
00:28:48,538 --> 00:28:52,259
break Acts I think

791
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:55,620
um

792
00:28:52,259 --> 00:28:58,200
that is to say like

793
00:28:55,619 --> 00:29:00,239
you can't really ask these breeders that

794
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,759
are passed away you know like if you can

795
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,700
use their work right and like a lot of

796
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:08,460
times you know Suns pop up like we saw

797
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:11,159
with uh bog he actually had a real son

798
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:13,200
and then we had fake Sons pop up after

799
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:15,120
they died pretending to sell his gear

800
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,519
this has happened so many times after

801
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:19,439
people pass um it happened with zochi

802
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:22,319
when he passed someone was claiming to

803
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,298
be him selling his seeds goat monkey

804
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:26,339
it's horrible it's one of the most

805
00:29:24,298 --> 00:29:28,259
disgusting horrible things I've seen and

806
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:30,178
it's more of a recent Trend when people

807
00:29:28,259 --> 00:29:32,579
die for someone to pop up pretend to be

808
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:34,200
their son and sell their seeds

809
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:37,859
um but yeah it's been happening a lot

810
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:39,419
that's that's one weird segment of this

811
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:41,959
uh question

812
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:45,419
as far as like for me

813
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:47,100
uh using lone star's blue bonnet

814
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:49,259
specifically because me and Lone Star

815
00:29:47,099 --> 00:29:50,699
weren't tight we weren't enemies by any

816
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:52,619
stress to Magic we never argued or

817
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,778
anything but um

818
00:29:52,619 --> 00:29:57,058
we were tight like we weren't friends

819
00:29:54,778 --> 00:29:58,140
and I wasn't close with his friends that

820
00:29:57,058 --> 00:30:01,139
are still around

821
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:03,120
so approaching the blue Bond stuff was

822
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:05,640
kind of weird for me and it still is to

823
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:07,199
this day because like I want to make

824
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,520
sure that he gets as much respect as

825
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,038
possible because it was beautiful work

826
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:13,019
that made all of the blueberry stuff

827
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:14,460
that I do that is so super blueberry he

828
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:17,099
did all of the work that made all that

829
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:18,659
possible and you know like when when I'm

830
00:30:17,099 --> 00:30:19,980
looking at my posts people want to give

831
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:22,260
me credit and the whole time I'm like

832
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:23,819
but I didn't really do much you know but

833
00:30:22,259 --> 00:30:25,079
people want to give me credit and I

834
00:30:23,819 --> 00:30:27,480
don't know how his friends feel about

835
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:28,859
that because I don't want to necessarily

836
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,960
take credit for it but it keeps getting

837
00:30:28,859 --> 00:30:34,678
put on me you know what I mean like

838
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,778
there it's complex it is so complex but

839
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:39,899
in the end like I just try to think

840
00:30:36,778 --> 00:30:41,700
about it from my own perspective like if

841
00:30:39,898 --> 00:30:43,259
I'm gone and the stuff that I had

842
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,419
anything to do with is still passing on

843
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:47,398
and people are still saying my name then

844
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:49,799
that's Magic

845
00:30:47,398 --> 00:30:51,178
that's the only way you still live right

846
00:30:49,798 --> 00:30:52,319
yeah

847
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:54,419
yep

848
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:55,980
that's the way I look at it but some of

849
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:57,360
the people may look at it different you

850
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:59,819
know um

851
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:01,199
yeah people Sue each other over this

852
00:30:59,819 --> 00:31:03,918
[ __ ] so

853
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,919
it's weird

854
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:09,778
did you want to mention TJ or talk to

855
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:12,839
speak to TGA

856
00:31:09,778 --> 00:31:15,419
I mean sure yeah

857
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:17,099
I mean that was a that was a hard one I

858
00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:19,259
you know he's even hard to talk about

859
00:31:17,099 --> 00:31:20,398
after passing you can't like let alone

860
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:22,740
not even talking about using his

861
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:23,339
genetics just speaking about it

862
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,079
um

863
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:27,480
because of all the things that happened

864
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:28,859
prior like right before the last two

865
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,778
years

866
00:31:28,859 --> 00:31:32,219
um got pretty wild and hairy and humans

867
00:31:30,778 --> 00:31:34,500
were human especially when they find out

868
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:37,259
they're no longer living some will make

869
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:40,019
amends with people and some will

870
00:31:37,259 --> 00:31:42,599
live their life to the fullest that they

871
00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:44,339
see fit you know and that's kind of what

872
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:46,379
happened there

873
00:31:44,339 --> 00:31:48,839
um mostly what I see though in cannabis

874
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:50,039
is people being Sanctified after they

875
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:52,798
pass

876
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:54,298
um maybe unjustly Sanctified in many

877
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:55,980
ways

878
00:31:54,298 --> 00:31:57,960
um if you notice and like they give

879
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:59,099
they're given sainthood

880
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,860
um yeah

881
00:31:59,099 --> 00:32:04,500
yeah I see that a lot like oh this guy

882
00:32:01,859 --> 00:32:07,379
he was such a [ __ ] amazing breeder

883
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:09,898
collector he was legit newest [ __ ] and

884
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:11,278
it's like what when he was alive he was

885
00:32:09,898 --> 00:32:13,619
one of the biggest you know like not

886
00:32:11,278 --> 00:32:15,778
even talking to himself but just there's

887
00:32:13,619 --> 00:32:17,158
a lot of this there's a lot because I

888
00:32:15,778 --> 00:32:18,419
mean people are complex and not

889
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:19,860
everybody's a good human their whole

890
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:21,240
life and some people are really bad

891
00:32:19,859 --> 00:32:24,058
humans

892
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:25,558
um most of their life but when they die

893
00:32:24,058 --> 00:32:28,200
in cannabis for some reason they get

894
00:32:25,558 --> 00:32:31,379
sainthood though I think some people may

895
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:33,058
not see that same fate you know just

896
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:35,340
kind of I mean who you are

897
00:32:33,058 --> 00:32:37,558
even people who are alive get that same

898
00:32:35,339 --> 00:32:40,918
Hood I mean they may not deserve it yeah

899
00:32:37,558 --> 00:32:43,619
that's very true that is very true

900
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:47,159
the sainthood going on

901
00:32:43,619 --> 00:32:50,398
uh yeah don't as we always say you know

902
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:54,299
um be very wary of having Heroes

903
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:56,099
kick over the statues so I say no don't

904
00:32:54,298 --> 00:32:59,398
worship any statues don't have any

905
00:32:56,099 --> 00:33:01,139
pedestals because breed like breeders

906
00:32:59,398 --> 00:33:03,058
are all [ __ ] ups like most of us are

907
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:06,000
ex-junkies too like whether whether they

908
00:33:03,058 --> 00:33:08,460
admit it or not like most of us like

909
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,960
have Shady pass so a bunch of [ __ ] ups

910
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:11,340
there's nothing to look up to that's for

911
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:14,940
damn sure

912
00:33:11,339 --> 00:33:16,678
myself on a positive note I it is worth

913
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:18,600
kind of reiterating what you said before

914
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:21,600
which is that you know one of the least

915
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:22,139
I think or one of the

916
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,459
um

917
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:25,980
one of the best things you could do is

918
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:27,960
just continue to gesture towards the

919
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:30,058
people whose work your work depends on

920
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:32,460
like in general whether they're whether

921
00:33:30,058 --> 00:33:34,319
they're dead or alive exactly yeah I

922
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:36,360
always get always give thanks and just

923
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:39,058
not even just give thanks but just be

924
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:42,719
thankful in general like have that in

925
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:44,398
your heart like don't just say it like

926
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,380
how did your heart and carry with you

927
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:47,699
like in your projects like with the Lone

928
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:49,860
Star stuff like

929
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:52,919
I I try to think about that all the time

930
00:33:49,859 --> 00:33:54,599
like I don't I don't let that slip from

931
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:56,038
from the picture you know and maybe

932
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:58,079
that's why I don't get ego with it

933
00:33:56,038 --> 00:33:59,640
because it's not

934
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:01,619
you know what I mean like just have it

935
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:03,720
in your heart Harry carry that with you

936
00:34:01,619 --> 00:34:06,538
don't just say it do it

937
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:08,460
yeah and I think I think for I said The

938
00:34:06,538 --> 00:34:11,280
Syndicate it's clearly like a core value

939
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:13,559
to acknowledge

940
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:17,220
um that we are just one point on like a

941
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:18,719
long line of points you know in through

942
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:20,638
running through time

943
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,739
and that like

944
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:25,858
we wouldn't be here

945
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:27,658
with that a lot a lot of a lot of my uh

946
00:34:25,858 --> 00:34:29,159
Focus has been like trying to find

947
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:31,320
things that other breeders had already

948
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:32,940
made years ago that's been lost so it's

949
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,919
like

950
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:36,480
you know like things were made a long

951
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:38,158
time ago that were so good that we're

952
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,019
still digging them up like someone was

953
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,639
doing it right back then so good that

954
00:34:40,019 --> 00:34:43,559
way better than what we have now even

955
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:45,960
you know so yeah

956
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:48,239
I don't know kind of a tangent

957
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:50,338
no it's cool I think it's you know I

958
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:52,378
think occasionally it's nice to have a

959
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:54,000
bit more of a like philosophical you

960
00:34:52,378 --> 00:34:57,598
know ethical reflection on these things

961
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,039
so I think yeah breeding ethics is a uh

962
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,480
one that I used to get asked a lot on

963
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:02,699
the live feeds you know about breeding

964
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,500
ethics how do you know if it's okay do

965
00:35:02,699 --> 00:35:07,259
you ask a breeder

966
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:08,760
um you know that that's a I mean it's a

967
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,560
hard one to do because so many people

968
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,880
have different answers people go online

969
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:13,619
and they see breeders have different

970
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:17,338
reactions to people using their stuff

971
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:19,079
like I I almost like think it's silly

972
00:35:17,338 --> 00:35:21,059
when people ask me if they can use my

973
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:22,380
stuff from stuff they bought for me you

974
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:25,920
know like but I know they're doing out

975
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:27,838
of respect but like for me like if you

976
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,940
bought a pack of seeds it's yours

977
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:32,279
whatever hell you want with it I don't

978
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:34,019
care whose it is you know like we put it

979
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:37,380
out there it's there to be put out

980
00:35:34,019 --> 00:35:39,358
and if you use it that's

981
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:41,880
that is a her name's getting carried on

982
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:43,920
like if you use it there's nothing more

983
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,300
like to me special than seeing someone

984
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,500
that found something so unique and

985
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,480
special they wanted to bring it into

986
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:50,639
something and make it theirs

987
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,679
that to me is the ultimate win for a

988
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:54,539
breeder so when people get mad when

989
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:56,039
people like use males from their line or

990
00:35:54,539 --> 00:35:58,559
use a female from their line or whatever

991
00:35:56,039 --> 00:36:00,960
and want to kick back like to me it

992
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:03,059
blows my mind is the the

993
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,240
the respect has already been paid there

994
00:36:03,059 --> 00:36:08,699
by them wanting to use it

995
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:10,799
maybe that should be another recurring

996
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:12,000
episode every year or so will we yeah

997
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,280
probably

998
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,699
um

999
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:19,260
yeah ethics and morals in 2023.

1000
00:36:16,699 --> 00:36:20,759
yeah they definitely change over the

1001
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,200
years I'll tell you what they have

1002
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,240
changed it might be a good thing to

1003
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:26,098
revisit

1004
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:29,098
like the name game changed completely

1005
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:31,079
the name the name game that used to be

1006
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:32,519
one of the most deadly serious games we

1007
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:34,140
played in breeding is when we were

1008
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:37,440
picking names making sure we didn't step

1009
00:36:34,139 --> 00:36:40,259
on any [ __ ] toes and at one point it

1010
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,639
was pretty there were still names out

1011
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:43,680
there you could use that hadn't been

1012
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:45,539
reused if they weren't super obvious you

1013
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:47,219
know you could have uniqueness in your

1014
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:49,139
name still

1015
00:36:47,219 --> 00:36:50,578
um but you know if you weren't too

1016
00:36:49,139 --> 00:36:52,199
creative it was very easy to step on

1017
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:54,240
toes and it wasn't like it is today

1018
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:56,279
where people were like whatever you know

1019
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:58,679
because there's so many names you can't

1020
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:00,780
avoid but you're using names now

1021
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:02,338
back then like people took that very

1022
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:04,440
serious and with like messaging people

1023
00:37:02,338 --> 00:37:05,880
watch your head like you better change

1024
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:08,460
that now or

1025
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,780
else you know yeah so yeah that's

1026
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,338
another thing that's definitely changed

1027
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:13,560
it is uh

1028
00:37:11,338 --> 00:37:17,338
our policy today is were you here before

1029
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:20,099
me okay if not [ __ ] [ __ ] kick rocks

1030
00:37:17,338 --> 00:37:22,199
kid that's the way I look at it you know

1031
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:23,579
are you here for me okay you don't get

1032
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:25,439
to choose the name you don't get to keep

1033
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:29,539
the name the dick move we gotta start

1034
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,539
somewhere you know yeah

1035
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:36,900
okay whoa slight change of pace we come

1036
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:38,338
back to a much more practical set of

1037
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,358
questions I think

1038
00:37:38,338 --> 00:37:39,900
okay

1039
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:41,759
um

1040
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:43,320
simple one I think from freezeblade you

1041
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,660
know when do you think is the best time

1042
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:48,619
to pull to to take clones or to take

1043
00:37:45,659 --> 00:37:48,618
cuttings off plots

1044
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:55,139
it depends

1045
00:37:51,539 --> 00:37:58,079
and what by it depends I mean any number

1046
00:37:55,139 --> 00:38:01,019
of factors is it a Seedling mom is it a

1047
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,640
clone mom if it's a Seedling mom you

1048
00:38:01,019 --> 00:38:04,019
know is it gonna [ __ ] up the whole

1049
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:05,879
structure of the plant if I take the

1050
00:38:04,019 --> 00:38:08,880
Clones or am I not really worried about

1051
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:10,920
that like there's many reasons like that

1052
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,660
I go into when I'm taking clones or

1053
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,740
things that I take into account like is

1054
00:38:12,659 --> 00:38:15,420
this going to be something that I'm

1055
00:38:13,739 --> 00:38:17,279
flowering out am I taking clones in a

1056
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:19,019
specific spot from the plant to make it

1057
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,540
have a specific structure when it's

1058
00:38:19,019 --> 00:38:24,420
flowering you know yeah because that's a

1059
00:38:21,539 --> 00:38:26,460
big part of what what part of the plants

1060
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:28,800
clones I'm taking how many I take the

1061
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:30,420
shape of it that all goes into it

1062
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,980
usually for me I wait till it's about

1063
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:34,200
two to three feet tall before I start

1064
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:36,240
making clones you know some people do it

1065
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:38,098
at the first two nodes you know like

1066
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:40,199
once there's a leaf material to take and

1067
00:38:38,099 --> 00:38:43,200
there's a node bam take it

1068
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:46,019
um you know anything like that you can

1069
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:49,379
get in that context do you see have you

1070
00:38:46,019 --> 00:38:51,539
experienced or observed um maturity

1071
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:53,099
playing a very big role in the success

1072
00:38:51,539 --> 00:38:55,739
of routine

1073
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:58,260
or not necessarily

1074
00:38:55,739 --> 00:39:00,539
um you know nothing that I could like

1075
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:02,339
not good anecdotes that I could give but

1076
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:04,500
I'm sure there is you know hormonally a

1077
00:39:02,338 --> 00:39:07,078
plant changes over time so I'm sure I'm

1078
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:08,579
sure there is but yeah what I'm talking

1079
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:09,839
about they're already so big at that

1080
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:12,780
point that you're not really worried

1081
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:15,119
about the maturity as much I mean and

1082
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:17,760
when I run my plants I usually run uh

1083
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:19,079
veggie 24 hours light almost always I I

1084
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,520
can't think of a situation where I've

1085
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:23,280
been running anything less than 24 hours

1086
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:24,659
in Veg it's constant constantly on and

1087
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,579
the reason I do that is because I also

1088
00:39:24,659 --> 00:39:29,460
do a lot of re-veging

1089
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:32,460
um yeah and do in saying that like I

1090
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:34,920
mean my plants grow pretty fast uh in

1091
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:38,220
veg because the lights are on 24 hours

1092
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:39,960
so yeah um

1093
00:39:38,219 --> 00:39:41,639
two to three feet

1094
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,400
they're not you know there's no heavy

1095
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:47,480
pre-flowering going on so yeah

1096
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:51,599
what do you think of uh people taking

1097
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:53,639
cuttings in the flowering stretch I know

1098
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,960
that's quite common slash popular as

1099
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:57,539
well I guess because you know you get so

1100
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:00,300
much like extra vegetative growth often

1101
00:39:57,539 --> 00:40:01,980
that you have to get rid of anyway

1102
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:03,960
um what do you think of pulling cuttings

1103
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:05,460
at that point

1104
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,679
um so what point are you talking about

1105
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:09,838
later in flower or early in flower no

1106
00:40:07,679 --> 00:40:12,358
sir during the flowering stretch first

1107
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:13,858
few weeks okay yeah no that's great um a

1108
00:40:12,358 --> 00:40:15,179
lot of times I'll have stems that'll

1109
00:40:13,858 --> 00:40:17,159
root better too

1110
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:18,539
I don't know why but like they have what

1111
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:19,980
are your stems and for some reason I I

1112
00:40:18,539 --> 00:40:23,639
have better luck with Woody or stems

1113
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:25,858
like that or harder stems

1114
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:27,598
um and hormonally I think they're for

1115
00:40:25,858 --> 00:40:29,279
whatever reason they're more able to

1116
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,440
root at that stage hormonally because

1117
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,260
they do root faster I found that out

1118
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,820
just by process of

1119
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:38,760
like

1120
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:40,680
thinking I had something backed up and

1121
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,300
clones backed up going to flower

1122
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:43,739
something starting in flower and

1123
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:45,780
realizing oh [ __ ] I don't have any more

1124
00:40:43,739 --> 00:40:47,459
clones of this and then having to take

1125
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:48,900
loans that way that's when I started

1126
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:50,460
realizing that there was kind of a

1127
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:52,980
difference between how fast they would

1128
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:54,659
root how well they would root

1129
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:57,480
um and the type of routes they gave off

1130
00:40:54,659 --> 00:41:00,179
even you know what I mean so yeah that's

1131
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:02,519
I've run into that that just by

1132
00:41:00,179 --> 00:41:04,440
happenstance you know but it is

1133
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:07,259
effective

1134
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,760
when you take cuttings at that point do

1135
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:11,460
you have to deal with re-veging or not

1136
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:13,380
really it just depends sometimes but but

1137
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:15,119
usually it's not a very super long rib

1138
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:17,579
Edge if anything it's like a weed or two

1139
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,320
Max but um if you get it at the right

1140
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:20,880
time not usually it'll it'll revert

1141
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:23,160
pretty quick

1142
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,740
cool yeah nice

1143
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:28,500
that was uh

1144
00:41:25,739 --> 00:41:31,199
good juicy bit of info I love re-veging

1145
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:32,760
I love it I it makes me sad when people

1146
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:34,919
say that they don't do it I don't know

1147
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:37,200
why it's just to me it's so easy to do

1148
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:39,300
and I I just I don't have a lot of

1149
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:40,799
talents in life

1150
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,880
um okay even when it comes to Growing

1151
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,320
like there's I don't have a lot of

1152
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,539
talents when it comes to Growing but I'm

1153
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:47,640
like better at this than anyone else or

1154
00:41:45,539 --> 00:41:49,679
better at that than anyone else but I'm

1155
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:52,019
really good at revenging and I'm really

1156
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:53,338
good at popping seeds like those are two

1157
00:41:52,019 --> 00:41:56,039
things that I can do exceptionally well

1158
00:41:53,338 --> 00:41:58,619
and re-veging to me like

1159
00:41:56,039 --> 00:42:01,079
it's something I could teach anyone at

1160
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:03,900
any time and it's as long as you follow

1161
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:05,880
like a few simple [ __ ] rules anybody

1162
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:08,039
could do it anytime as long as you can

1163
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:10,200
put your lights on 24 hours guaranteed

1164
00:42:08,039 --> 00:42:11,400
yeah but yeah a lot of people do have

1165
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:12,419
trouble with it and I don't understand

1166
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,079
it

1167
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,338
um

1168
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:16,320
I don't know it's just one of those

1169
00:42:14,338 --> 00:42:18,179
things I've never gotten why people

1170
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:19,500
black troubles or veggies yeah awesome

1171
00:42:18,179 --> 00:42:20,940
technique I guess to me you have to be

1172
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:23,099
very patient

1173
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:25,858
yeah I guess to me the main costs of

1174
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:27,420
re-veging would be space and time right

1175
00:42:25,858 --> 00:42:30,960
um and money

1176
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:32,519
and money well yes yeah but the 24-hour

1177
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,960
light like a lot of people don't want to

1178
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:36,059
do that because it's like doubling your

1179
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:39,659
flower cycle of money you know what I

1180
00:42:36,059 --> 00:42:41,338
mean yeah it can get uh

1181
00:42:39,659 --> 00:42:43,858
you can get more expensive that extra

1182
00:42:41,338 --> 00:42:46,460
six hours of hour hours of light a night

1183
00:42:43,858 --> 00:42:46,460
is uh

1184
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:50,279
okay

1185
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:52,740
that was a good one okay

1186
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:55,260
um we can move on to Digger's question

1187
00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:57,299
and I I think you had a sense of what

1188
00:42:55,260 --> 00:43:00,180
he's asking here I'm not entirely clear

1189
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:03,119
okay it says pros and cons of steering a

1190
00:43:00,179 --> 00:43:05,279
line or clone with males a color

1191
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:07,858
flowering time and stability of the male

1192
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:12,300
or males use

1193
00:43:07,858 --> 00:43:14,639
so so what he's talking about I think is

1194
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:18,060
using like using the mail

1195
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:21,719
and breeding using the mail as basically

1196
00:43:18,059 --> 00:43:23,279
a stud using are all of his traits onto

1197
00:43:21,719 --> 00:43:26,219
the females and yeah I mean you could do

1198
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,960
it it's you can do it with a female or

1199
00:43:26,219 --> 00:43:31,379
with a male it doesn't really matter

1200
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:33,179
there's no set there's nothing set with

1201
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:36,660
like all males

1202
00:43:33,179 --> 00:43:38,519
bring this straight all females breed

1203
00:43:36,659 --> 00:43:41,219
this way you know like there's nothing

1204
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:43,739
it is so variable down to the the plant

1205
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:45,179
and environment on what traits are

1206
00:43:43,739 --> 00:43:47,578
passed

1207
00:43:45,179 --> 00:43:49,199
that like

1208
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:51,240
it's it's a very hard question to answer

1209
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:52,559
but yes you can absolutely you know like

1210
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:54,659
with the Bonnet stuff that's exactly

1211
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:56,699
what I did is bring it towards the nail

1212
00:43:54,659 --> 00:43:58,019
that was it was what you which you would

1213
00:43:56,699 --> 00:43:59,639
actually consider a stud because I

1214
00:43:58,019 --> 00:44:02,219
wanted everything to be blueberry that

1215
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:04,559
he touched and yeah and historically

1216
00:44:02,219 --> 00:44:06,899
it's been done a lot right yeah this is

1217
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:07,739
a very common passion

1218
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:10,800
um

1219
00:44:07,739 --> 00:44:12,598
yes and no yes yes in the way of like

1220
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,539
skunk one

1221
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:18,780
um was used as a male a lot nl1 was used

1222
00:44:15,539 --> 00:44:20,579
as a male a lot by Neville but overall

1223
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:23,220
there's been a lot of seed making with

1224
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:25,740
males there's not been a lot of breeding

1225
00:44:23,219 --> 00:44:26,879
done with a male for trait selection

1226
00:44:25,739 --> 00:44:27,959
like that

1227
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,300
true

1228
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:31,920
yeah good distinction yeah

1229
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:34,800
okay

1230
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:37,200
that's a good question

1231
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,700
um anything else on that if not I think

1232
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:41,219
that's good

1233
00:44:38,699 --> 00:44:43,439
Stone root what are your thoughts on

1234
00:44:41,219 --> 00:44:45,598
convergent evolution through breeding

1235
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,818
starting with rather different cultivars

1236
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:50,460
by ending up in the same place through a

1237
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:52,139
series of generations uh he says similar

1238
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:54,539
to crabs in the ocean have you

1239
00:44:52,139 --> 00:44:57,179
experienced this I mean okay one thing

1240
00:44:54,539 --> 00:44:59,579
I'll say though right away is that crabs

1241
00:44:57,179 --> 00:45:02,338
in the ocean were not bread yeah they

1242
00:44:59,579 --> 00:45:04,140
evolved yeah um and I know what he means

1243
00:45:02,338 --> 00:45:05,338
he means that like throughout the

1244
00:45:04,139 --> 00:45:08,519
different

1245
00:45:05,338 --> 00:45:10,159
eras of creatures on the planet quite a

1246
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:12,000
few different

1247
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:13,799
species I don't know how the right

1248
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,659
taxonomy here but quite a few different

1249
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:18,240
species have kind of converged on a

1250
00:45:15,659 --> 00:45:20,818
similar morphology a very crab-like

1251
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:22,559
morphology throughout time

1252
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:23,940
um I don't know if that is conflatable

1253
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:25,739
with breeding because breeding is

1254
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:27,900
actually active because he said two

1255
00:45:25,739 --> 00:45:30,838
different cultivars but that would mean

1256
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:32,700
they were both cannabis

1257
00:45:30,838 --> 00:45:34,500
I think the crab thing was meant to be

1258
00:45:32,699 --> 00:45:36,598
an analogy I'm just kind of explaining

1259
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:38,519
why the analogy doesn't really make I

1260
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:40,260
know but like with this question he said

1261
00:45:38,519 --> 00:45:42,420
two different cultivars but it sounds

1262
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:44,280
like you just said we're different he

1263
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:46,619
just said with different cultivars but

1264
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:48,119
so not even necessarily cannabis is he

1265
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:49,440
talking about just can't the two

1266
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:51,240
different candidates yeah yeah sorry he

1267
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,159
does he does mean cannabis I'm assuming

1268
00:45:51,239 --> 00:45:55,199
yeah

1269
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:57,179
so like I was saying to you before the

1270
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:58,500
recording like the the most obvious

1271
00:45:57,179 --> 00:46:01,799
thing that comes to mind that it's not

1272
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:04,619
breeding is what happens when you let

1273
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:07,140
you just let cat like you know maybe uh

1274
00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:09,180
drug type cannabis like go wild right

1275
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:11,098
yeah yeah you can watch it regress very

1276
00:46:09,179 --> 00:46:14,039
quickly to him to him in a few

1277
00:46:11,099 --> 00:46:15,599
Generations yeah but I don't know if you

1278
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:19,099
this makes sense if you're talking about

1279
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:19,099
it from a breeding perspective

1280
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:22,618
I mean

1281
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,420
the only thing I can think of from a

1282
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:26,640
breeding perspective that even remotely

1283
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:29,818
comes close to this is someone currently

1284
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:32,578
Crossing Ops and cannabis

1285
00:46:29,818 --> 00:46:34,739
Cannabis sativa you know like right a

1286
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:36,780
few different kind of semi-related

1287
00:46:34,739 --> 00:46:38,759
plants and finding a way to interbreed

1288
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:40,200
them but it's not done evolutionarily

1289
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,760
it's not done naturally it was done

1290
00:46:40,199 --> 00:46:42,719
through greeting

1291
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,339
um

1292
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:46,439
like what he's talking about takes

1293
00:46:44,338 --> 00:46:50,900
thousands and thousands and thousands of

1294
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:54,119
years you know like Evolution I it's yes

1295
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:56,460
for Humanity yeah yeah yeah unless we're

1296
00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:57,358
talking about major major like GMO type

1297
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:00,420
stuff

1298
00:46:57,358 --> 00:47:01,739
um Advanced science techniques you know

1299
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:03,300
um yeah and I wouldn't know anything

1300
00:47:01,739 --> 00:47:04,679
about that

1301
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:06,480
no I think you make a really good point

1302
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:08,519
like you can't really have Evolution and

1303
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:11,400
breeding in the same like sentence they

1304
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:13,199
don't work like they don't yeah they're

1305
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,760
not simpatico

1306
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:16,679
yeah

1307
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:19,980
okay there you go nice and Loud there

1308
00:47:16,679 --> 00:47:21,899
you go move on to screwstone escape

1309
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:23,940
quotes question

1310
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:27,059
okay this is an interesting one so he

1311
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:30,000
says we uh men also have talked about

1312
00:47:27,059 --> 00:47:31,799
growing for seed versus going for flower

1313
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,739
production

1314
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:37,619
um but what about the difference between

1315
00:47:34,739 --> 00:47:41,598
having a what he calls a regular veg

1316
00:47:37,619 --> 00:47:44,400
setup uh versus a setup that's more for

1317
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:46,260
uh preservation I guess uh you know

1318
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:49,019
keeping moms

1319
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:51,720
um how how different are those setups

1320
00:47:49,019 --> 00:47:55,858
or can they be how different can they be

1321
00:47:51,719 --> 00:47:58,919
from seed making to keeping moms

1322
00:47:55,858 --> 00:48:00,598
no I think it means like production like

1323
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:02,519
what what are the difference between

1324
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:04,318
differences between a setup that you're

1325
00:48:02,519 --> 00:48:07,199
using just to like grow plants to grow

1326
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:09,599
plants for I guess for cropping

1327
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:12,118
um versus a setup that's just for

1328
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:14,039
keeping stuff okay so

1329
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:16,318
if I were doing just cropping I would

1330
00:48:14,039 --> 00:48:18,119
probably be doing a lot in tables

1331
00:48:16,318 --> 00:48:19,739
a ton

1332
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:21,900
um if I'm keeping moms you can't really

1333
00:48:19,739 --> 00:48:23,818
keep moms in tables I mean maybe you can

1334
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:27,059
I don't know anybody who does but

1335
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:29,639
usually like can you explain a bit why

1336
00:48:27,059 --> 00:48:31,139
um I mean because they get so big

1337
00:48:29,639 --> 00:48:33,000
you know you can't really have those big

1338
00:48:31,139 --> 00:48:34,139
monster moms in in tables especially if

1339
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,139
you're keeping them around a long time

1340
00:48:34,139 --> 00:48:39,000
it also depends like some people like to

1341
00:48:37,139 --> 00:48:40,259
do clone of their mom clone of their mom

1342
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,818
clone of the mom keep it small

1343
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:43,020
constantly clone them on clone of the

1344
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:45,119
Mom it's a lot of work you can do it

1345
00:48:43,019 --> 00:48:47,519
that way and keep it small

1346
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:50,338
um and that's the way you could do it in

1347
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:53,159
tables technically you could also use

1348
00:48:50,338 --> 00:48:54,480
tables and re-vege so there's not really

1349
00:48:53,159 --> 00:48:56,299
any

1350
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,619
there's workarounds for every situation

1351
00:48:56,300 --> 00:49:01,200
but ideally like

1352
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:03,960
if I'm if I if I have moms I have a

1353
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:06,899
whole room dedicated to that of just

1354
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:07,740
moms in pots and containers in Cocoa you

1355
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,460
know

1356
00:49:07,739 --> 00:49:10,318
um

1357
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:12,539
and then if I'm running production

1358
00:49:10,318 --> 00:49:14,579
whether it's usually if I'm running

1359
00:49:12,539 --> 00:49:16,380
production for me I do it all in the

1360
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:19,318
same pot and stuff like that but it's

1361
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:21,180
because I rent and if I owned a place I

1362
00:49:19,318 --> 00:49:23,219
would be doing all [ __ ] tables all

1363
00:49:21,179 --> 00:49:25,440
day all day long

1364
00:49:23,219 --> 00:49:29,519
um so I guess the only difference would

1365
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:32,460
be how you keep the moms longer in a mom

1366
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:33,838
room I don't really know like

1367
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:35,579
yeah I think like you were saying

1368
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:37,440
earlier it depends right it depends on

1369
00:49:35,579 --> 00:49:39,240
it depends on what constraints you have

1370
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,818
yeah like if you don't have a lot of

1371
00:49:39,239 --> 00:49:43,379
space then you might have to resort to

1372
00:49:41,818 --> 00:49:45,838
what you were pointing out before like

1373
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:48,240
what I call like serial cloning where

1374
00:49:45,838 --> 00:49:50,099
you don't actually have a mom that

1375
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:52,439
you're constantly just taking clones off

1376
00:49:50,099 --> 00:49:54,180
you have like a chain you're you're

1377
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:55,980
cloning and then taking a clone off that

1378
00:49:54,179 --> 00:49:58,618
clone and and doing that successively

1379
00:49:55,980 --> 00:50:00,900
through time I did that for years man I

1380
00:49:58,619 --> 00:50:03,599
did it for years that way Solo Cup moms

1381
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:05,099
Bonsai moms which is horrible like I

1382
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:07,318
didn't understand like

1383
00:50:05,099 --> 00:50:10,859
I didn't understand that I was like

1384
00:50:07,318 --> 00:50:12,420
super stunting [ __ ] and like then now

1385
00:50:10,858 --> 00:50:14,279
I'm gonna take that and breed with this

1386
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:16,800
super stunted plant because I made a

1387
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:17,880
bonsai mom out of it you know like I

1388
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,680
didn't understand what I was doing back

1389
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:21,720
then and I don't know that I don't know

1390
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:23,699
the ramifications that has for the

1391
00:50:21,719 --> 00:50:25,980
future of what I made back then with

1392
00:50:23,699 --> 00:50:27,899
that and

1393
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:29,960
yeah just thinking about that that was

1394
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:32,160
yeah

1395
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:33,659
recycled clones

1396
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:35,338
that's actually a really big question

1397
00:50:33,659 --> 00:50:38,279
but I think we still don't really have

1398
00:50:35,338 --> 00:50:40,619
great answers for which is yeah like you

1399
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:42,420
say if let's say you have a mom and then

1400
00:50:40,619 --> 00:50:45,180
you've kind of had to you've been forced

1401
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:47,519
to uh stress slash traumatize it in

1402
00:50:45,179 --> 00:50:49,679
various ways to keep it small what kind

1403
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:51,960
of impact that does have on clones you

1404
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:53,098
take off it later right and or even the

1405
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:55,019
seeds that you make with it

1406
00:50:53,099 --> 00:50:56,519
epigenetically yeah

1407
00:50:55,019 --> 00:50:58,679
yeah

1408
00:50:56,519 --> 00:51:00,000
yeah you know I don't know what happens

1409
00:50:58,679 --> 00:51:01,858
there

1410
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,679
yeah so maybe this is something you know

1411
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:07,019
if anyone in the community has an idea

1412
00:51:04,679 --> 00:51:09,239
um or has seen any theory around this

1413
00:51:07,019 --> 00:51:10,739
like definitely let us know Chimera if

1414
00:51:09,239 --> 00:51:12,959
you want just let me know

1415
00:51:10,739 --> 00:51:14,578
yeah

1416
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,318
uh I guess the other side of this in

1417
00:51:14,579 --> 00:51:17,940
terms of setup is like I can think of

1418
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:20,699
things like

1419
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:23,400
um basic things uh that you probably

1420
00:51:20,699 --> 00:51:25,500
have already thought through like what

1421
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:27,960
kinds of other differences in like say

1422
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:29,460
light intensity the feeding I know

1423
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,380
you've covered a bit of that but yeah

1424
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:33,659
feeding definitely

1425
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:35,940
light intensity here's a weird one a

1426
00:51:33,659 --> 00:51:37,618
kind of it's on the topic but kind of a

1427
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:40,740
tangent a lot of us are getting news

1428
00:51:37,619 --> 00:51:42,838
like a lot of us I mean like the oldest

1429
00:51:40,739 --> 00:51:44,338
ones of us are just getting used to LEDs

1430
00:51:42,838 --> 00:51:47,338
now or just getting to try them for the

1431
00:51:44,338 --> 00:51:49,199
first time and it is so [ __ ]

1432
00:51:47,338 --> 00:51:50,880
different like how the plants eat and

1433
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:53,338
everything it's so massively different

1434
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,599
so yeah interesting there are a lot of

1435
00:51:53,338 --> 00:51:56,578
things to take into account too just

1436
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:58,140
from light intensities on Feed and all

1437
00:51:56,579 --> 00:52:00,720
that [ __ ] not just for breeding but for

1438
00:51:58,139 --> 00:52:03,719
anything you know

1439
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:06,539
yeah and that's I'm someone who's only

1440
00:52:03,719 --> 00:52:08,578
ever had LEDs you know yeah yeah see

1441
00:52:06,539 --> 00:52:10,619
that's a trip for me like I started on

1442
00:52:08,579 --> 00:52:13,500
magnetic ballasts and t5s and [ __ ] like

1443
00:52:10,619 --> 00:52:15,480
that and like I still have t5s that I

1444
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:17,940
would use because I'm [ __ ] old and

1445
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:19,260
like I think that's a legit technology I

1446
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:20,760
don't know I never I've never moved on

1447
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:22,319
to LEDs mostly because I'm broke and

1448
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:24,180
cheap but

1449
00:52:22,318 --> 00:52:26,159
if anybody wants to be an LED sponsor

1450
00:52:24,179 --> 00:52:27,419
get a hold of me

1451
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:29,098
there you go

1452
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:30,960
gotta use this [ __ ]

1453
00:52:29,099 --> 00:52:33,119
absolutely

1454
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:35,579
okay anything else about the differences

1455
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:36,960
between you know keeping plants for an

1456
00:52:35,579 --> 00:52:39,240
archive versus keeping plants for

1457
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,500
production any changes anyone obviously

1458
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:42,838
there's a different mindset you know

1459
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:44,960
obviously it's a different strategy

1460
00:52:42,838 --> 00:52:44,960
um

1461
00:52:45,838 --> 00:52:51,480
okay or if nothing else there we go all

1462
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:54,240
right no I can't think of anything else

1463
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:55,619
we can move on to South Coast Canada's

1464
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:57,959
question

1465
00:52:55,619 --> 00:53:00,660
random one but does a male have

1466
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:02,940
different traits as a okay I guess what

1467
00:53:00,659 --> 00:53:06,118
he's asking here is uh how differently

1468
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:08,039
can a male plant but I think it doesn't

1469
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:09,838
have to be just about a male how

1470
00:53:08,039 --> 00:53:13,079
differently can a plant Express when

1471
00:53:09,838 --> 00:53:14,239
seed ground versus like you know uh as a

1472
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:16,680
cutting

1473
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:18,598
vastly different vastly different it's

1474
00:53:16,679 --> 00:53:20,159
why I always say like if you're really

1475
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:23,579
serious about it

1476
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:27,960
about like a line and hunting through it

1477
00:53:23,579 --> 00:53:29,640
do run at all as seeds flower them and

1478
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:31,079
then run it as clones before you toss

1479
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:32,940
them because sometimes that change might

1480
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:34,318
be so drastic that the Terps changed so

1481
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:36,059
far that it you might have already

1482
00:53:34,318 --> 00:53:38,400
tossed a keeper if you haven't run it

1483
00:53:36,059 --> 00:53:40,380
the second time can can you break this

1484
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,358
down a little bit Matt because I know

1485
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:44,700
that like in the past whatever I

1486
00:53:42,358 --> 00:53:47,699
remembered you saying like I know for

1487
00:53:44,699 --> 00:53:52,199
example that the expression of um

1488
00:53:47,699 --> 00:53:53,759
intersex Expressions change a lot right

1489
00:53:52,199 --> 00:53:54,739
um but now you're actually saying that

1490
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,599
even

1491
00:53:54,739 --> 00:53:59,759
Expressions might be different sent

1492
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:01,140
um internode spacing all kinds it's

1493
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,420
because it's there's so many different

1494
00:54:01,139 --> 00:54:05,818
hormones packed into that seedling mom

1495
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:08,579
which is why it grows so different and

1496
00:54:05,818 --> 00:54:10,440
as you as it ages as you take clones of

1497
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:12,720
that those hormones start to wear out

1498
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:14,639
you know and and you get to see a

1499
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:16,199
totally different plant it just grows

1500
00:54:14,639 --> 00:54:19,618
totally different as a as a clone

1501
00:54:16,199 --> 00:54:21,779
different root system everything

1502
00:54:19,619 --> 00:54:23,579
yeah another thing like that for me

1503
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:26,819
anyway I don't really mean science

1504
00:54:23,579 --> 00:54:28,500
there's no main Tap Root on a on a clone

1505
00:54:26,818 --> 00:54:32,420
you know like there's not like that big

1506
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:35,760
hard main Tapper like a Seedling gets

1507
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:36,960
this is another one where I think you

1508
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,940
know there probably is quite a lot of

1509
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:41,460
science underneath and oh yeah again if

1510
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:43,079
anyone can chip in on this topic we

1511
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:45,358
could probably revisit this because it

1512
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:47,640
is a quite an interesting and big one I

1513
00:54:45,358 --> 00:54:49,199
think awesome

1514
00:54:47,639 --> 00:54:50,519
okay

1515
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:52,618
um was there anything else in terms of

1516
00:54:50,519 --> 00:54:54,239
differences that you could think of just

1517
00:54:52,619 --> 00:54:56,400
you know beyond the fact that they are

1518
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:57,598
going to be potentially pretty major

1519
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,880
ones

1520
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:02,460
any anecdotes in particular Matt that

1521
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:04,079
you can think of or

1522
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:06,179
um I mean it's just something that we

1523
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:07,980
see every single time that we run a

1524
00:55:06,179 --> 00:55:10,618
plant like every single time it's going

1525
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:12,780
to change from um seedling and not all

1526
00:55:10,619 --> 00:55:15,000
of them change drastically some some are

1527
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:15,839
real minor changes just you know Leaf

1528
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,880
shape

1529
00:55:15,838 --> 00:55:19,558
um width sometimes you'll just see that

1530
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:22,380
or a little bit stockier a little bit

1531
00:55:19,559 --> 00:55:25,920
longer but sometimes it can be Worlds

1532
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:28,380
Apart you know um that bubble gum clone

1533
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,300
of the Northern Lights 5 was so pink

1534
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:33,838
bubble gum when we first got it

1535
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:35,460
yeah you're mind blown right but as a as

1536
00:55:33,838 --> 00:55:37,500
a clone

1537
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:40,920
about Third Generation in it's a lot

1538
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:43,559
less pink bubble gummy a lot less

1539
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:45,659
it's one of those examples

1540
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:48,240
yeah this is a this is a fascinating

1541
00:55:45,659 --> 00:55:51,058
topic I think yeah oh yeah a lot of

1542
00:55:48,239 --> 00:55:52,979
complexity here it's a ton and and it is

1543
00:55:51,059 --> 00:55:55,079
very sciency we've got a couple of

1544
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:57,960
questions from in the wind and I think

1545
00:55:55,079 --> 00:56:00,839
generally what I get from in the wins

1546
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:02,460
questions here is he's taken into

1547
00:56:00,838 --> 00:56:05,219
account some of the theory that we've

1548
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:07,079
explained in the previous episodes

1549
00:56:05,219 --> 00:56:10,019
and on some of the complexities of

1550
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:12,660
breathing like we pointed out there are

1551
00:56:10,019 --> 00:56:14,039
uh linked linked traits I.E genes that

1552
00:56:12,659 --> 00:56:15,779
are linked or grouped together for

1553
00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:16,500
whatever reason

1554
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:18,839
um

1555
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:20,280
and you know the inverse of that we

1556
00:56:18,838 --> 00:56:22,318
talked about I think where we you could

1557
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:25,800
even have multiple genes controlling a

1558
00:56:22,318 --> 00:56:28,019
single trait yeah um and so for me the

1559
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:30,900
vibe I get from him is like okay that

1560
00:56:28,019 --> 00:56:32,519
that that sounds like breeding is like

1561
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:34,260
impossible or like intentional breeding

1562
00:56:32,519 --> 00:56:36,780
is impossible because of these

1563
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:39,059
conditions and obviously it's it it's

1564
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:41,339
true that it's extremely difficult to to

1565
00:56:39,059 --> 00:56:43,680
make predictable

1566
00:56:41,338 --> 00:56:44,940
um but okay we'll get into his first one

1567
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:47,159
which is

1568
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:50,519
how much of our assessment of linked

1569
00:56:47,159 --> 00:56:53,098
traits and true breeding traits

1570
00:56:50,519 --> 00:56:55,318
um can actually be observed in like can

1571
00:56:53,099 --> 00:56:57,720
actually be observed full stop

1572
00:56:55,318 --> 00:56:59,099
um that's kind of what I see in this

1573
00:56:57,719 --> 00:57:00,179
question he says how much of it is like

1574
00:56:59,099 --> 00:57:02,480
visual

1575
00:57:00,179 --> 00:57:07,639
um and can be perceived through effect

1576
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:07,639
all of its visual except for effect

1577
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:11,640
yeah

1578
00:57:09,539 --> 00:57:13,318
trying to think am I correct in saying

1579
00:57:11,639 --> 00:57:15,980
that I think so like most of the traits

1580
00:57:13,318 --> 00:57:15,980
that we breed for

1581
00:57:20,358 --> 00:57:25,799
you know but observable in some way

1582
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:28,019
except for the high

1583
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:29,940
that's always going to be variable for

1584
00:57:28,019 --> 00:57:31,739
every single person every single

1585
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:34,318
different time like

1586
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:36,058
trying to explain this to the the like

1587
00:57:34,318 --> 00:57:38,279
normal person who goes into a collective

1588
00:57:36,059 --> 00:57:40,319
they're so mindset I'm thinking oh do I

1589
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:41,700
need a sativa indica or hybrid you know

1590
00:57:40,318 --> 00:57:43,199
like that's where their mindset's at

1591
00:57:41,699 --> 00:57:47,098
whereas

1592
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:49,019
like in my mindset I'm at I wonder if

1593
00:57:47,099 --> 00:57:50,940
this Bud from this plant is going to

1594
00:57:49,019 --> 00:57:52,858
affect me the same way it did last night

1595
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:55,559
when I was in a different mood because

1596
00:57:52,858 --> 00:57:58,679
in reality that's where we should be at

1597
00:57:55,559 --> 00:58:01,079
yeah like it's that variable

1598
00:57:58,679 --> 00:58:03,960
um yeah so trying to quantify high and

1599
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:05,160
breeding for high very hard very hard

1600
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,659
because you never know if the next

1601
00:58:05,159 --> 00:58:09,179
person is going to have the same higher

1602
00:58:06,659 --> 00:58:10,139
the same reaction and you don't know

1603
00:58:09,179 --> 00:58:11,460
that if you're gonna have the same

1604
00:58:10,139 --> 00:58:12,838
higher reaction the next time you smoke

1605
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:17,460
it

1606
00:58:12,838 --> 00:58:20,519
um yeah so in some sense it can be

1607
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:22,318
too variable to account for

1608
00:58:20,519 --> 00:58:24,599
yeah but there are variables we can't

1609
00:58:22,318 --> 00:58:26,159
account for and breed for it

1610
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:27,599
yeah so this is one of those questions

1611
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:31,019
where like there isn't a straightforward

1612
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:33,720
answer yeah like it depends on what

1613
00:58:31,019 --> 00:58:36,119
traits you are interested in and of

1614
00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:37,618
course within within the tools that you

1615
00:58:36,119 --> 00:58:41,280
have like if all you have are your

1616
00:58:37,619 --> 00:58:43,559
observations then obviously you can only

1617
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:45,900
um you can only depend on what You

1618
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:48,619
observe to exactly your decisions like

1619
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:51,480
this yeah there's just there's no magic

1620
00:58:48,619 --> 00:58:53,519
shortcut to that if you don't have

1621
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:57,838
access to you know other kinds of

1622
00:58:53,519 --> 00:59:00,239
testing exactly the and this is where

1623
00:58:57,838 --> 00:59:02,519
knowing your baselines having experience

1624
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:04,979
running out the baselines going through

1625
00:59:02,519 --> 00:59:06,420
populations in the baselines in for

1626
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:08,460
Baseline see our previous episodes

1627
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:09,180
recent episodes

1628
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:12,240
um

1629
00:59:09,179 --> 00:59:14,039
having that experience will help you to

1630
00:59:12,239 --> 00:59:16,019
make those selections and see those

1631
00:59:14,039 --> 00:59:19,558
traits that you're looking for and know

1632
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:21,960
okay well it reads about this common in

1633
00:59:19,559 --> 00:59:23,460
this line it's about that common so

1634
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:25,318
hopefully I'll see it in this you know

1635
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:28,858
roughly this percentage in this

1636
00:59:25,318 --> 00:59:30,838
population of this hybrid Etc you know

1637
00:59:28,858 --> 00:59:32,039
um the more you Lo know the lines you're

1638
00:59:30,838 --> 00:59:35,279
working with or clones you're working

1639
00:59:32,039 --> 00:59:37,019
with the more educated you can be about

1640
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:39,298
making those distinctions and

1641
00:59:37,019 --> 00:59:41,159
projections

1642
00:59:39,298 --> 00:59:43,920
yeah

1643
00:59:41,159 --> 00:59:46,679
and I think we we did talk about this as

1644
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:49,079
well which is that sometimes you do have

1645
00:59:46,679 --> 00:59:51,779
to go forward and then go backwards

1646
00:59:49,079 --> 00:59:54,599
because you just don't have any other

1647
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:57,180
way of getting more information yeah

1648
00:59:54,599 --> 00:59:58,798
sometimes it's literally you have to run

1649
00:59:57,179 --> 01:00:00,298
the progeny and not everything's a hit

1650
00:59:58,798 --> 01:00:03,440
you know

1651
01:00:00,298 --> 01:00:03,440
yeah that's what it is

1652
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:08,519
so his second question is I think we've

1653
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:11,700
more or less covered it about I'll I'll

1654
01:00:08,519 --> 01:00:15,179
uh sound it out anyway okay so he said

1655
01:00:11,699 --> 01:00:18,118
uh yeah how reliable is a you know

1656
01:00:15,179 --> 01:00:19,798
visual uh sorry observable slash like

1657
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:21,000
smoke test in the search for Unique

1658
01:00:19,798 --> 01:00:24,920
expressions

1659
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,920
and then he kind of goes into like

1660
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:30,200
uh is it possible for something to not

1661
01:00:28,019 --> 01:00:32,099
express the trait in its first

1662
01:00:30,199 --> 01:00:35,519
expression I guess he means in the first

1663
01:00:32,099 --> 01:00:36,660
generation and then for that trade to

1664
01:00:35,519 --> 01:00:38,880
appear in successive Generations

1665
01:00:36,659 --> 01:00:40,318
obviously yes right yeah very very much

1666
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:42,539
so yeah

1667
01:00:40,318 --> 01:00:44,759
um Tower recessives work you know they

1668
01:00:42,539 --> 01:00:47,279
pop up in the yeah and after these f3s

1669
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:48,900
you'll never see them in the F ones

1670
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:50,460
um or in that first generation crash as

1671
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:53,039
I should say

1672
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:55,920
um yeah that's that's that's

1673
01:00:53,039 --> 01:00:58,139
it that's that's a part of it you know

1674
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:59,818
that's a major thing yeah and again I

1675
01:00:58,139 --> 01:01:02,578
perceive underlying this question his

1676
01:00:59,818 --> 01:01:06,239
his real question is how can I predict

1677
01:01:02,579 --> 01:01:09,240
this and it's like it's the same answer

1678
01:01:06,239 --> 01:01:12,058
it's like either you have very good

1679
01:01:09,239 --> 01:01:14,818
information and previous experience on

1680
01:01:12,059 --> 01:01:17,940
how what you're holding

1681
01:01:14,818 --> 01:01:19,318
um does pass and breed exactly or you're

1682
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:21,480
gonna have to actually

1683
01:01:19,318 --> 01:01:24,000
do some work

1684
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:25,440
test approximity and maybe do another

1685
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,059
generation if that's why you're looking

1686
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,798
you know if you're trying to trace

1687
01:01:27,059 --> 01:01:31,859
something down Generations you just have

1688
01:01:28,798 --> 01:01:33,059
you can't avoid actually doing it yeah

1689
01:01:31,858 --> 01:01:36,480
essentially

1690
01:01:33,059 --> 01:01:39,180
you know and and to this point like

1691
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:41,099
I would rather see someone pop

1692
01:01:39,179 --> 01:01:44,039
100 seeds

1693
01:01:41,099 --> 01:01:46,338
in a very small space and flower them

1694
01:01:44,039 --> 01:01:49,199
small to get an idea of the population

1695
01:01:46,338 --> 01:01:51,599
then run two or three plants really big

1696
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:55,318
to try to get an idea of what a clone's

1697
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:56,818
like yeah you know like if if people are

1698
01:01:55,318 --> 01:01:58,619
wondering like

1699
01:01:56,818 --> 01:02:00,358
which would be better which would be

1700
01:01:58,619 --> 01:02:02,338
more ideal which would give them the

1701
01:02:00,358 --> 01:02:04,078
most information

1702
01:02:02,338 --> 01:02:06,779
um the smaller plants would give you the

1703
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:09,420
most information and that would be ideal

1704
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:11,760
um smaller plants can be just as terpy

1705
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:13,798
and potent as anything else and if we're

1706
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:15,059
going for assessing and learning about a

1707
01:02:13,798 --> 01:02:16,739
plant

1708
01:02:15,059 --> 01:02:18,480
um you know as long as it has enough Bud

1709
01:02:16,739 --> 01:02:20,338
to get you a few [ __ ] bowls so you

1710
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:23,460
can get a pretty good idea if it's even

1711
01:02:20,338 --> 01:02:24,119
a high you enjoy you personally enjoy

1712
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:26,699
um

1713
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:28,980
yeah I mean just flower them out little

1714
01:02:26,699 --> 01:02:30,179
clones little little seedlings it's easy

1715
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:32,699
to do

1716
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:35,098
yeah yeah so I guess my paraphrase for

1717
01:02:32,699 --> 01:02:37,739
that is whenever you are looking for

1718
01:02:35,099 --> 01:02:40,740
stuff you face significant odds and the

1719
01:02:37,739 --> 01:02:45,298
only strategy that's viable is to go

1720
01:02:40,739 --> 01:02:47,838
with numbers numbers always yeah

1721
01:02:45,298 --> 01:02:47,838
okay

1722
01:02:48,358 --> 01:02:53,039
um

1723
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:55,318
we can move on okay NJ grow guy is

1724
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:58,798
asking a question that I think you know

1725
01:02:55,318 --> 01:03:00,358
is always the question in a way

1726
01:02:58,798 --> 01:03:03,659
um what is the best way to go about

1727
01:03:00,358 --> 01:03:04,920
extending stock on a pack of seats ah

1728
01:03:03,659 --> 01:03:06,838
yes I have a 12-pack and want to make

1729
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:09,420
more so I can grow them out again would

1730
01:03:06,838 --> 01:03:11,699
you just op that pack or would you go

1731
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:13,858
and select

1732
01:03:11,699 --> 01:03:17,098
um you know maybe do one-to-one with

1733
01:03:13,858 --> 01:03:19,980
your favorite from the pack

1734
01:03:17,099 --> 01:03:22,140
so so I in this case you know what I'd

1735
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:25,440
say I would say if you have like 12

1736
01:03:22,139 --> 01:03:27,179
seeds I'd run them all I keep clones of

1737
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:30,059
each just in case

1738
01:03:27,179 --> 01:03:31,858
now if it's already an open pollination

1739
01:03:30,059 --> 01:03:33,420
there might not be a need to do a

1740
01:03:31,858 --> 01:03:35,578
success of open pollination unless it's

1741
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:36,720
solely for preservation and like you

1742
01:03:35,579 --> 01:03:38,220
feel like the last person probably

1743
01:03:36,719 --> 01:03:40,259
didn't do that good of a job like if

1744
01:03:38,219 --> 01:03:42,659
someone just did it from five seeds I

1745
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:44,700
would probably re-op it again just you

1746
01:03:42,659 --> 01:03:46,500
know just because to bring out more

1747
01:03:44,699 --> 01:03:47,879
examples but

1748
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:49,920
um

1749
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:52,920
yeah I don't know

1750
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:54,659
open pollinations are are great you know

1751
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:56,818
if this is solely for preservation do

1752
01:03:54,659 --> 01:03:58,019
open pollinations but there's some lines

1753
01:03:56,818 --> 01:04:00,119
where if like someone just didn't open

1754
01:03:58,019 --> 01:04:02,159
pollination and

1755
01:04:00,119 --> 01:04:04,260
it won't kill you to just do little

1756
01:04:02,159 --> 01:04:05,940
selections from it to make the seeds you

1757
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:08,280
would be doing directional breeding in a

1758
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:10,559
sense and start that direction narrowing

1759
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:13,019
but I mean

1760
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:15,000
if it's plants that you like as opposed

1761
01:04:13,019 --> 01:04:18,358
to just random and you've already run

1762
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:20,880
them then yeah that makes sense

1763
01:04:18,358 --> 01:04:22,318
yeah yeah I think again this is one of

1764
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:24,298
those like it depends and it comes down

1765
01:04:22,318 --> 01:04:27,058
to your constraints like yeah I imagine

1766
01:04:24,298 --> 01:04:28,619
the risk with OP is that I think we did

1767
01:04:27,059 --> 01:04:30,420
address this in the Theory episode as

1768
01:04:28,619 --> 01:04:34,579
well is that

1769
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:34,579
it's easy to lose things

1770
01:04:34,739 --> 01:04:38,879
um and it's not to say that you've lost

1771
01:04:36,659 --> 01:04:40,440
them forever but that's why I say it

1772
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:42,119
comes down to your constraints like you

1773
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:43,380
have plenty of time in the future and

1774
01:04:42,119 --> 01:04:48,119
you know you're going to have lots of

1775
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:50,940
time then maybe NLP is okay but

1776
01:04:48,119 --> 01:04:53,039
yeah exactly

1777
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:55,380
if you like if you're doing an OP

1778
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:57,539
strictly so you can do a big ass pop

1779
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:58,980
this one line that makes sense to me but

1780
01:04:57,539 --> 01:05:00,960
if you're just oping it just to pop

1781
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:03,838
three seeds that doesn't make any sense

1782
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:06,539
yeah I think that's a good that's a good

1783
01:05:03,838 --> 01:05:07,798
simile statement yeah

1784
01:05:06,539 --> 01:05:09,480
okay

1785
01:05:07,798 --> 01:05:11,579
Petty cheetah

1786
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:14,219
I've selected a stable female from an

1787
01:05:11,579 --> 01:05:15,960
intersex prone lion and outcrusted to a

1788
01:05:14,219 --> 01:05:18,539
male from a stable line

1789
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:21,480
in your experience despite choosing a

1790
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:23,818
stable individual how often do you think

1791
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:27,380
the intersex traits from the females I

1792
01:05:23,818 --> 01:05:27,380
get past into the progeny

1793
01:05:28,199 --> 01:05:33,960
it depends again because we don't know

1794
01:05:31,139 --> 01:05:35,940
if that trait is a late trait don't know

1795
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:38,039
much about that trait you know like for

1796
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:40,500
this particular example

1797
01:05:38,039 --> 01:05:42,480
um typically typically generally

1798
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:44,460
speaking though if you're if you're

1799
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:46,619
breeding away from intersex trades let's

1800
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:49,740
say this line is very very

1801
01:05:46,619 --> 01:05:51,119
um aren't prone and you find a a male

1802
01:05:49,739 --> 01:05:52,858
from a line that's just super stable

1803
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:55,200
sexually

1804
01:05:52,858 --> 01:05:57,480
um usually you're doing a great service

1805
01:05:55,199 --> 01:06:00,539
to line if your end goal is to have

1806
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:02,818
no intersex trades that's that's what

1807
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:04,858
you want to do so that that's that's the

1808
01:06:02,818 --> 01:06:06,420
best method for it if that's the trait

1809
01:06:04,858 --> 01:06:09,598
you're trying to like

1810
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:12,019
suppress that's how you would do it

1811
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:12,019
yeah

1812
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:14,539
okay

1813
01:06:14,639 --> 01:06:21,659
uh squirrel again is asking

1814
01:06:18,838 --> 01:06:24,838
let me see

1815
01:06:21,659 --> 01:06:26,838
so I think his question is

1816
01:06:24,838 --> 01:06:29,940
we often address

1817
01:06:26,838 --> 01:06:33,480
uh traits such as you know the most

1818
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:37,559
common ones like uh scent

1819
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:40,079
um color color yeah

1820
01:06:37,559 --> 01:06:42,660
and he's wondering like and we have

1821
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:44,760
talked a bit about this before but

1822
01:06:42,659 --> 01:06:48,118
do you have much experience with people

1823
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:50,460
who have bred for bud structure for

1824
01:06:48,119 --> 01:06:53,400
smoking specifically

1825
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:55,199
no um not that I know of but I mean

1826
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:57,000
maybe someone does out there that's an

1827
01:06:55,199 --> 01:06:58,139
actual breeder but I don't know of it

1828
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,599
and I haven't had that discussion with

1829
01:06:58,139 --> 01:07:04,019
anyone however I've talked about it

1830
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:07,140
because I I hate I see I [ __ ] hate

1831
01:07:04,019 --> 01:07:10,019
with a passion super dense Bud like I

1832
01:07:07,139 --> 01:07:11,699
like to break up I my preference has

1833
01:07:10,019 --> 01:07:14,880
always been to break it up by hand

1834
01:07:11,699 --> 01:07:16,500
really easy you know not not thumb it up

1835
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:18,119
super bad but I don't know how to handle

1836
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:21,119
bud you know but I like to break it up

1837
01:07:18,119 --> 01:07:23,160
by hand and pretty much nowadays I have

1838
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:25,440
to use a grinder every single time

1839
01:07:23,159 --> 01:07:27,358
because this stuff is so dense

1840
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:28,920
that it was just it's pointless to try

1841
01:07:27,358 --> 01:07:30,538
to break it apart like that and I don't

1842
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:32,400
like [ __ ] that dense

1843
01:07:30,539 --> 01:07:34,799
um and a lot of customers don't eat it

1844
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:37,858
because it's usually mold prone like

1845
01:07:34,798 --> 01:07:40,318
massively mold prone stuff like that so

1846
01:07:37,858 --> 01:07:43,199
yeah I was I was going to say that even

1847
01:07:40,318 --> 01:07:46,019
if people in their work haven't been

1848
01:07:43,199 --> 01:07:48,779
explicitly looking for

1849
01:07:46,019 --> 01:07:51,838
um flower structure relative to smoking

1850
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:54,480
people certainly pay attention to how

1851
01:07:51,838 --> 01:07:55,619
prone flowers out to Bud Rock

1852
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:58,318
um this is true

1853
01:07:55,619 --> 01:07:59,700
so that is often the kind of

1854
01:07:58,318 --> 01:08:02,400
corresponding

1855
01:07:59,699 --> 01:08:04,439
consideration like it definitely is yeah

1856
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:07,559
especially for the grower side more

1857
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:09,119
dense more density means more mold so I

1858
01:08:07,559 --> 01:08:10,680
mean that's why I just came there I

1859
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:12,539
never could believe that cookies blew up

1860
01:08:10,679 --> 01:08:15,179
like it did not only was it a smaller

1861
01:08:12,539 --> 01:08:18,000
yielder but the density just made it a

1862
01:08:15,179 --> 01:08:19,559
mold nightmare for people so yeah it

1863
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,179
just blows my mind

1864
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:22,980
I have a question here for you Matt

1865
01:08:21,179 --> 01:08:25,798
which you know you know the Indiana

1866
01:08:22,979 --> 01:08:28,798
bubble gum cut is often cited for being

1867
01:08:25,798 --> 01:08:32,159
really mold resistant yeah

1868
01:08:28,798 --> 01:08:34,319
do you uh in your opinion like is it

1869
01:08:32,159 --> 01:08:35,880
partly the structure of the flower that

1870
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:37,859
contributes to that or is there other

1871
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:40,259
are there other qualities you think I

1872
01:08:37,859 --> 01:08:42,420
mean I I it's it's this it's pretty

1873
01:08:40,259 --> 01:08:45,420
dense it's not as dense as like cookies

1874
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:47,100
but it's very dense Afghanistan yeah

1875
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:49,259
it's just one of those things where the

1876
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:52,079
genetics it's just very mold resistant

1877
01:08:49,259 --> 01:08:54,179
it's it's weird yeah so it's an example

1878
01:08:52,079 --> 01:08:55,380
where it wasn't it wasn't it's not

1879
01:08:54,179 --> 01:08:57,079
necessarily because of the flower

1880
01:08:55,380 --> 01:09:00,719
structure that is exactly

1881
01:08:57,079 --> 01:09:03,778
okay like um a lot of the urn beer stuff

1882
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:05,759
the Swiss sativa strawberry stuff also

1883
01:09:03,779 --> 01:09:07,380
tends to be mold resistant and I don't

1884
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:09,479
like early on I was trying to figure out

1885
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:11,460
if it was tied to its scent like

1886
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:13,619
whatever the oils are in its glands you

1887
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:15,298
know whatever I never figured it out but

1888
01:09:13,619 --> 01:09:17,219
the strawberry stuff is extremely mold

1889
01:09:15,298 --> 01:09:19,859
resistant as well

1890
01:09:17,219 --> 01:09:21,838
interesting interesting

1891
01:09:19,859 --> 01:09:23,100
yeah because I guess yeah paraphrase of

1892
01:09:21,838 --> 01:09:24,899
that is

1893
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:27,000
the other obvious way something can be

1894
01:09:24,899 --> 01:09:30,479
mold resistant is presumably through its

1895
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:31,738
cannabinoid like balance and all that

1896
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:34,159
yep

1897
01:09:31,738 --> 01:09:34,159
okay

1898
01:09:35,039 --> 01:09:42,298
um that might actually be the end of our

1899
01:09:38,159 --> 01:09:42,298
questions today Matt bruh

1900
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:48,600
wow we are at the end of the questions I

1901
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:52,759
know that

1902
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:52,759
you wanted to talk about something else

1903
01:09:54,119 --> 01:09:58,619
yeah

1904
01:09:56,159 --> 01:10:01,439
um which one should I talk about first

1905
01:09:58,619 --> 01:10:04,738
so did you want to talk about your your

1906
01:10:01,439 --> 01:10:07,198
recent experience with cereal milk and

1907
01:10:04,738 --> 01:10:11,839
tell us what that is I'll tell you about

1908
01:10:07,198 --> 01:10:11,839
my experience the the rundown on it so

1909
01:10:11,939 --> 01:10:16,139
I wanted to check out some of these new

1910
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:18,239
buds

1911
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:20,400
because I had not tried cereal milk I

1912
01:10:18,238 --> 01:10:22,799
had not tried jealousy

1913
01:10:20,399 --> 01:10:24,238
there's a bunch I hadn't tried from a

1914
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,739
lot of the hype stuff not just cookie

1915
01:10:24,238 --> 01:10:27,000
fam stuff but in general generally

1916
01:10:25,738 --> 01:10:28,139
speaking

1917
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,539
um a lot of the newer stuff I haven't

1918
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:33,119
tried and people ask me a lot about it

1919
01:10:30,539 --> 01:10:34,738
and my normal comment is well what is it

1920
01:10:33,119 --> 01:10:37,198
it's like cookies crust or cookies

1921
01:10:34,738 --> 01:10:39,779
probably trash you know like in my

1922
01:10:37,198 --> 01:10:41,879
opinion that's usually what you get

1923
01:10:39,779 --> 01:10:43,139
anyway I I got some

1924
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:44,640
and I probably should have taken

1925
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:46,980
pictures but I figured it's cereal milk

1926
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:49,560
I'm probably not going to enjoy it so

1927
01:10:46,979 --> 01:10:51,238
I mean I was that confident that I would

1928
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:53,520
not enjoy this stuff

1929
01:10:51,238 --> 01:10:56,519
I mean that is a bias coming with the

1930
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:58,320
bias to not wanting to enjoy this and

1931
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:59,940
now you're not wanting to but expecting

1932
01:10:58,319 --> 01:11:02,579
to not enjoy it

1933
01:10:59,939 --> 01:11:05,219
so the bud shows up I look at it it's

1934
01:11:02,579 --> 01:11:06,859
very dense looks like cookies cool

1935
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:10,079
um expected

1936
01:11:06,859 --> 01:11:11,880
and the density is just exactly like I

1937
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:14,399
hate hard to break up

1938
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:15,960
and there's not a lot of scent to it I

1939
01:11:14,399 --> 01:11:17,698
was expecting cereal milk to smell like

1940
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:19,739
the sweet indivo G that actually smells

1941
01:11:17,698 --> 01:11:21,658
like cereal milk so like I thought the

1942
01:11:19,738 --> 01:11:23,579
name would be apropos and some kind of

1943
01:11:21,658 --> 01:11:25,679
extension of that because that exists in

1944
01:11:23,579 --> 01:11:27,779
that line why would you not choose that

1945
01:11:25,679 --> 01:11:29,100
expression to represent it but they

1946
01:11:27,779 --> 01:11:29,759
didn't

1947
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:31,980
um

1948
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:35,420
I think the name is a misnomer scent

1949
01:11:31,979 --> 01:11:37,198
wise it was very

1950
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:38,340
Bland

1951
01:11:37,198 --> 01:11:42,119
um Terps

1952
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:44,520
which also threw me off as far as like

1953
01:11:42,119 --> 01:11:47,579
I'm expecting this to not be very good

1954
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:49,440
it's Surplus incense

1955
01:11:47,579 --> 01:11:50,939
I can't really even pin down a scent for

1956
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:55,859
you on what it smelled like it was just

1957
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:58,500
ashy maybe at best so

1958
01:11:55,859 --> 01:12:00,059
I smoke it

1959
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:01,500
and about 30 minutes in I'm already

1960
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:03,120
expecting this thing to be over and I'm

1961
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:04,140
like I'm actually enjoying this I'm

1962
01:12:03,119 --> 01:12:08,158
giggly

1963
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:10,320
this is giggly weed and it was strong I

1964
01:12:08,158 --> 01:12:13,859
had been dabbing diamonds and sauce all

1965
01:12:10,319 --> 01:12:16,439
day and it broke through and

1966
01:12:13,859 --> 01:12:18,059
it repeatedly did that until the very

1967
01:12:16,439 --> 01:12:19,619
last bowl

1968
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:22,800
so

1969
01:12:19,619 --> 01:12:25,559
because I I spend so much time talking

1970
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:27,719
about like cookies being the end of

1971
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:30,420
breeding as far as like the the very end

1972
01:12:27,719 --> 01:12:32,399
of where you can take that line

1973
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:34,020
um I don't know much about Snowman and

1974
01:12:32,399 --> 01:12:36,119
Wildlife obviously it's some kind of

1975
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:38,520
cookies cookies you know

1976
01:12:36,119 --> 01:12:39,599
but I was impressed and I felt like I

1977
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:41,340
like

1978
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:44,400
even though

1979
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:46,679
I want so badly not to say that cereal

1980
01:12:44,399 --> 01:12:48,839
milk is is decent like it was pretty

1981
01:12:46,679 --> 01:12:49,859
[ __ ] decent and I was surprised

1982
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:52,860
um

1983
01:12:49,859 --> 01:12:55,019
yeah so because I talked so much [ __ ] I

1984
01:12:52,859 --> 01:12:56,698
had to actually you know man up and say

1985
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:58,980
that it was it was good I was surprised

1986
01:12:56,698 --> 01:13:01,019
and and I'm gonna try to do that more

1987
01:12:58,979 --> 01:13:04,799
often grab some stuff now and then from

1988
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:06,360
newer stuff and you know maybe do some

1989
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:08,520
reviews for people so that if they can

1990
01:13:06,359 --> 01:13:11,219
see it and get an idea of someone who's

1991
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:13,380
more used to Old School strains what

1992
01:13:11,219 --> 01:13:14,939
my opinion would be on stuff like that

1993
01:13:13,380 --> 01:13:18,119
if it's worth a [ __ ] because I was

1994
01:13:14,939 --> 01:13:19,799
surprised I was hella surprised that I

1995
01:13:18,119 --> 01:13:21,960
would even run that clone it was that

1996
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:24,060
good and even though it was Surplus I

1997
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:26,219
like I wouldn't if I was an extractor I

1998
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:28,800
would never run that [ __ ] but the high

1999
01:13:26,219 --> 01:13:30,060
from it was exceptional and I don't

2000
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:32,340
think the grower was anything special

2001
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:34,679
but I do think that I was exceptional so

2002
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:36,360
yeah I Gotta Give Them props where it's

2003
01:13:34,679 --> 01:13:38,399
dude they had someone make them a good

2004
01:13:36,359 --> 01:13:40,259
line

2005
01:13:38,399 --> 01:13:42,299
and I guess it's still consistent You

2006
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:44,699
know despite with what we say like

2007
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:47,820
despite of course us enjoying bashing on

2008
01:13:44,698 --> 01:13:50,359
cookies for various good reasons yeah um

2009
01:13:47,819 --> 01:13:53,279
there's obviously no reason why

2010
01:13:50,359 --> 01:13:56,158
outlies within that you know can appear

2011
01:13:53,279 --> 01:13:58,259
and be good yeah it's just the part that

2012
01:13:56,158 --> 01:13:59,879
blew my mind though was that it didn't

2013
01:13:58,260 --> 01:14:02,159
look like anything different than a

2014
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:04,440
gelato you know it looked nothing

2015
01:14:02,158 --> 01:14:06,119
different than gelato 33 you're looking

2016
01:14:04,439 --> 01:14:07,139
to be like oh that's a lot of 33. you

2017
01:14:06,119 --> 01:14:11,340
know

2018
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:13,440
the smell nothing to write home about at

2019
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:16,380
all in fact it was one of the more

2020
01:14:13,439 --> 01:14:18,839
scentless buds that I've ever had

2021
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:20,579
but for whatever reason and like that

2022
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:23,460
totally shits on that Entourage effect

2023
01:14:20,579 --> 01:14:25,619
type thing right like it totally you

2024
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:28,198
it's the opposite of how it should have

2025
01:14:25,619 --> 01:14:31,319
worked in my brain if that's real

2026
01:14:28,198 --> 01:14:33,960
um but it did it and it had a great

2027
01:14:31,319 --> 01:14:36,658
[ __ ] high like markedly great

2028
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:38,460
something that I don't see in cookies so

2029
01:14:36,658 --> 01:14:41,219
yeah it's it's definitely

2030
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:43,380
um that that clone at least or the the

2031
01:14:41,219 --> 01:14:44,760
example maybe maybe it wasn't even

2032
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:47,100
cereal milk who [ __ ] knows it came

2033
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:49,860
from a dispensary so God knows but I'm

2034
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:52,079
pretty sure it was and uh

2035
01:14:49,859 --> 01:14:53,579
it was impressive

2036
01:14:52,079 --> 01:14:54,960
what are the implications of this

2037
01:14:53,579 --> 01:14:57,300
statement Matt are you are you telling

2038
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:59,520
everyone that cookies was great and that

2039
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:01,340
I'm gonna blow burner it's what's gonna

2040
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:04,739
happen

2041
01:15:01,340 --> 01:15:06,840
I'm gonna make me he's my puppy I guess

2042
01:15:04,738 --> 01:15:08,698
I don't know what this means but it's uh

2043
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:10,199
what it means is that I need to start

2044
01:15:08,698 --> 01:15:13,019
giving some of these new things a try

2045
01:15:10,198 --> 01:15:14,519
and see if if uh I can't break some of

2046
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:17,159
my own myths that I have in my head

2047
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:19,199
about them or I can't prove myself right

2048
01:15:17,158 --> 01:15:21,539
but I'm determined now to at least like

2049
01:15:19,198 --> 01:15:24,539
maybe once a week if I can afford it

2050
01:15:21,539 --> 01:15:29,460
because it's expensive man legal weeds

2051
01:15:24,539 --> 01:15:31,260
expense the taxes on this unreal unreal

2052
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:33,239
so yeah

2053
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:35,219
um I would like to do that though once a

2054
01:15:33,238 --> 01:15:37,979
week you know grab some grab one even

2055
01:15:35,219 --> 01:15:39,539
one or two things and um

2056
01:15:37,979 --> 01:15:41,759
you know like another thing that I got

2057
01:15:39,539 --> 01:15:45,779
that I'd like to talk about that blew my

2058
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:47,520
mind too mango Haze diamonds and it

2059
01:15:45,779 --> 01:15:48,719
didn't blow my mind for the reasons that

2060
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:51,420
you think it would

2061
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:54,420
it blew my mind that someone would grow

2062
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:56,579
like a 14 to 16 week plant and then

2063
01:15:54,420 --> 01:15:59,640
extract it down to Diamonds

2064
01:15:56,579 --> 01:16:02,658
what the [ __ ] was that who came up with

2065
01:15:59,640 --> 01:16:05,880
that idea and why did I buy it but I did

2066
01:16:02,658 --> 01:16:08,039
I did and there was no scent to it

2067
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:10,079
really it was just diamonds it didn't

2068
01:16:08,039 --> 01:16:12,840
have an exceptional high at all there

2069
01:16:10,079 --> 01:16:15,658
was nothing Mingo hazy about the high to

2070
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:19,079
me you know like if it was used if it

2071
01:16:15,658 --> 01:16:22,738
was a real 14 16 week grown mango Haze

2072
01:16:19,079 --> 01:16:24,779
it was lost in the extraction but like I

2073
01:16:22,738 --> 01:16:26,939
don't see any of these people running a

2074
01:16:24,779 --> 01:16:28,380
14 to 16 week Haze and extracting it so

2075
01:16:26,939 --> 01:16:30,479
it's probably around an eight and

2076
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:32,279
extracted you know and at that point you

2077
01:16:30,479 --> 01:16:33,658
just have THC diamonds and you could

2078
01:16:32,279 --> 01:16:35,579
have that from anything and it wouldn't

2079
01:16:33,658 --> 01:16:37,859
matter because there's no

2080
01:16:35,579 --> 01:16:39,300
nothing else with it except just THC and

2081
01:16:37,859 --> 01:16:42,539
that's a very very

2082
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:44,640
specific High you know yeah so yeah it

2083
01:16:42,539 --> 01:16:46,560
was almost offensive that

2084
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:48,300
um mango Haze diamonds existed and I

2085
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:51,300
couldn't believe they existed and I even

2086
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:52,679
tried them in hopes that they would be

2087
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:54,360
something good that they they just were

2088
01:16:52,679 --> 01:16:56,520
diamonds

2089
01:16:54,359 --> 01:16:58,319
yeah I can I can totally see why it's

2090
01:16:56,520 --> 01:17:00,060
offensive it's like sacrilegious like

2091
01:16:58,319 --> 01:17:03,359
yeah it is

2092
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:05,039
why why like they could have done live

2093
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:08,339
resin sauce and I've been like [ __ ]

2094
01:17:05,039 --> 01:17:10,500
dope but they did diamonds like straight

2095
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:12,000
just THC diamonds

2096
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:13,619
what

2097
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,899
yeah in which case why would you use

2098
01:17:13,619 --> 01:17:17,640
something like mango Haze exactly why

2099
01:17:15,899 --> 01:17:20,099
not you could use anything on Earth to

2100
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:22,860
do that why would you use a 14 16 week

2101
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:25,320
plan yeah so that was my experience at

2102
01:17:22,859 --> 01:17:28,439
the uh local collectives there was some

2103
01:17:25,319 --> 01:17:32,158
um a funny tale was that the place where

2104
01:17:28,439 --> 01:17:34,799
I got the um Juicy Fruit Thai clone

2105
01:17:32,158 --> 01:17:36,599
add Juicy Fruit on their menu again so I

2106
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:39,539
was like what they're growing that again

2107
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:40,320
okay so I was gonna order it but I

2108
01:17:39,539 --> 01:17:42,000
didn't

2109
01:17:40,319 --> 01:17:43,019
I I don't remember why because I was

2110
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,880
buying everything else it was too damn

2111
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:46,679
expensive I just you know whatever but

2112
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:48,840
they gave me a full free ounce of their

2113
01:17:46,679 --> 01:17:50,880
Juicy Fruit and Holy balls was the most

2114
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:53,340
moldy [ __ ] I've ever seen in my life

2115
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:55,500
I couldn't even identify if it was juicy

2116
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:57,539
fruit or not I'm like I had to beat the

2117
01:17:55,500 --> 01:17:59,039
[ __ ] that hit someone's like hey bro

2118
01:17:57,539 --> 01:18:00,600
that stuff you're giving out it's all

2119
01:17:59,039 --> 01:18:02,279
moldy you might want to check that like

2120
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:04,199
it doesn't look good like even though

2121
01:18:02,279 --> 01:18:07,219
it's free like you're repping your

2122
01:18:04,198 --> 01:18:07,219
business you know

2123
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:10,619
I won't say which business because

2124
01:18:09,359 --> 01:18:12,238
they're nice and obviously they have my

2125
01:18:10,619 --> 01:18:15,000
address

2126
01:18:12,238 --> 01:18:18,479
I think that it's a great idea for you

2127
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:20,460
to periodically I don't know how often

2128
01:18:18,479 --> 01:18:23,099
um get some products to review I think

2129
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:26,039
that's that's fun and like for me you

2130
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:29,400
know I have no other connection to

2131
01:18:26,039 --> 01:18:32,340
dispensary lands yeah right so because

2132
01:18:29,399 --> 01:18:34,579
vicariously live through it

2133
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:34,579
yeah

2134
01:18:35,039 --> 01:18:39,840
yeah that's that's that was my

2135
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:41,640
experience like um what else did I get I

2136
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:44,279
got some something called Inferno OG

2137
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:46,460
diamonds and that actually was like had

2138
01:18:44,279 --> 01:18:49,920
some really

2139
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:52,859
loud loud OG sense to it in the diamonds

2140
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:54,179
it was really [ __ ] impressive like it

2141
01:18:52,859 --> 01:18:55,799
was some of the best diamonds in the

2142
01:18:54,179 --> 01:18:57,600
sauce I've ever had but it was just

2143
01:18:55,800 --> 01:19:00,480
diamonds but I didn't really see any

2144
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:02,460
sauce but it was so loud OG

2145
01:19:00,479 --> 01:19:03,658
um smelling is exactly like I would have

2146
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:05,698
wanted

2147
01:19:03,658 --> 01:19:08,279
um

2148
01:19:05,698 --> 01:19:10,379
there was some uh Mars OG the place was

2149
01:19:08,279 --> 01:19:13,319
selling and that was just absolute

2150
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:17,279
garbage it was uh just really poorly

2151
01:19:13,319 --> 01:19:19,799
grown like Athena grown you know just

2152
01:19:17,279 --> 01:19:21,899
[ __ ] smashed with nudes

2153
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:24,600
it was it was not good there's not like

2154
01:19:21,899 --> 01:19:26,399
a really nice OG scent to it like I like

2155
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:28,679
or flavor that was gone it was just

2156
01:19:26,399 --> 01:19:30,179
earthy really disappointing to be honest

2157
01:19:28,679 --> 01:19:32,100
with you because I used to love Mars OG

2158
01:19:30,179 --> 01:19:33,260
that was a really good OG

2159
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:35,280
um

2160
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:38,760
I can't really think of anything else

2161
01:19:35,279 --> 01:19:40,738
that that jumped out that was uh of note

2162
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:43,079
I had a Jack Herer live resin sauce that

2163
01:19:40,738 --> 01:19:45,000
wasn't that good wasn't that special it

2164
01:19:43,079 --> 01:19:47,100
wasn't even natural penalty which is

2165
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:49,140
weird for a jack her alive resin sauce

2166
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:51,300
but it was in there it just wasn't as

2167
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:53,699
loud

2168
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:55,260
um yeah overall disappointing I don't

2169
01:19:53,698 --> 01:19:56,939
really do collectives like I've never

2170
01:19:55,260 --> 01:19:58,800
really done that it had been a long time

2171
01:19:56,939 --> 01:20:00,719
and it usually if I'd ever got anything

2172
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:02,039
from a collective it would be a clone if

2173
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:03,480
it's something that interested me you

2174
01:20:02,039 --> 01:20:05,640
know like oh they got that there let's

2175
01:20:03,479 --> 01:20:06,419
see if it's it you know

2176
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:10,199
um

2177
01:20:06,420 --> 01:20:11,300
but yeah what a trip man what a trip the

2178
01:20:10,198 --> 01:20:14,339
taxes

2179
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:15,900
the trash level of it some of it

2180
01:20:14,340 --> 01:20:17,760
surprisingly though like I said

2181
01:20:15,899 --> 01:20:19,559
something was [ __ ] good I was

2182
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:22,140
surprised I was able to get something

2183
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:24,000
decent so yeah

2184
01:20:22,140 --> 01:20:26,219
I mean I guess you could say the same of

2185
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,658
like collectives and dispensaries as as

2186
01:20:26,219 --> 01:20:29,340
you just did about as we did about

2187
01:20:27,658 --> 01:20:31,079
cookies in general like obviously it

2188
01:20:29,340 --> 01:20:33,840
doesn't mean that like the old bed and

2189
01:20:31,079 --> 01:20:35,460
everything's bad it's just sure what the

2190
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:38,039
likelihood is

2191
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:39,899
um and yeah there's obviously still a

2192
01:20:38,039 --> 01:20:42,300
chance that you can get some

2193
01:20:39,899 --> 01:20:43,738
some good products what's funny is some

2194
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:45,539
of my friends are the people growing

2195
01:20:43,738 --> 01:20:48,839
weed for cookies that goes in those

2196
01:20:45,539 --> 01:20:51,800
mylars you know like yeah some of it's

2197
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:51,800
good so

2198
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:55,440
well I don't know man is this a good

2199
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:57,980
point to like

2200
01:20:55,439 --> 01:21:00,599
do a little bit of an outro

2201
01:20:57,979 --> 01:21:02,519
for the subscribers

2202
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:04,320
yeah yeah yeah exactly that's what I

2203
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:05,940
mean like okay yeah maybe this is where

2204
01:21:04,319 --> 01:21:08,340
we talk about

2205
01:21:05,939 --> 01:21:09,719
well we've decided that this is the end

2206
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:11,579
of this season

2207
01:21:09,719 --> 01:21:14,239
um this episode that's one and then the

2208
01:21:11,579 --> 01:21:17,939
series end of everything bye we're done

2209
01:21:14,238 --> 01:21:20,059
finished we're out oh oh yeah that's

2210
01:21:17,939 --> 01:21:20,059
right

2211
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:22,560
now we've covered everything Matt

2212
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:25,260
there's nothing else to say about

2213
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:26,960
anything so I mean I think that's it for

2214
01:21:25,260 --> 01:21:30,179
us yeah

2215
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:32,279
so one thing I did want to point out is

2216
01:21:30,179 --> 01:21:35,039
that we just hit 7000 Subs which is

2217
01:21:32,279 --> 01:21:36,539
pretty cool yeah

2218
01:21:35,039 --> 01:21:38,340
it's

2219
01:21:36,539 --> 01:21:40,439
I'll tell you why I'm proud of it one of

2220
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:42,539
the reasons is that I I occasionally go

2221
01:21:40,439 --> 01:21:44,960
and look at other cannabis channels

2222
01:21:42,539 --> 01:21:48,300
especially ones that I really hate and

2223
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:51,960
one thing I've noticed that I think is

2224
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:53,640
so absurd but also so unsurprising is

2225
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:55,920
that some of these channels you go in

2226
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:59,579
that you see they've got like 100 or

2227
01:21:55,920 --> 01:22:01,980
like 200 000 Subs oh yeah but then you

2228
01:21:59,579 --> 01:22:03,359
go and look at their the actual views

2229
01:22:01,979 --> 01:22:05,459
that they get on their videos and it's

2230
01:22:03,359 --> 01:22:07,979
like a couple of thousand every video

2231
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:11,579
yeah and so a lot of these channels

2232
01:22:07,979 --> 01:22:13,559
don't have real subscribers or if they

2233
01:22:11,579 --> 01:22:16,500
do they're a tiny portion of the numbers

2234
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:19,280
that they claim yeah and from what I've

2235
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:22,679
loved seeing from our data our analytics

2236
01:22:19,279 --> 01:22:25,439
is that our subscriber base is real

2237
01:22:22,679 --> 01:22:27,179
because a good portion of people show up

2238
01:22:25,439 --> 01:22:29,219
every week

2239
01:22:27,179 --> 01:22:31,800
and so not only have we grown

2240
01:22:29,219 --> 01:22:34,380
organically we actually have a proper

2241
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:36,060
regular following and I think that is

2242
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:38,579
something that you can't

2243
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:41,039
take for granted you know I don't think

2244
01:22:38,579 --> 01:22:43,140
that this I'm not trying to like

2245
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:45,479
be too self-deprecating or anything but

2246
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:47,400
you know what we the kinds of

2247
01:22:45,479 --> 01:22:50,879
information that we're interested in

2248
01:22:47,399 --> 01:22:53,759
um are very Niche and so we may not get

2249
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:56,819
or may not even want to have a hundred

2250
01:22:53,760 --> 01:23:01,079
thousand Subs no but to be able to

2251
01:22:56,819 --> 01:23:03,960
develop a proper close following with

2252
01:23:01,079 --> 01:23:06,479
regular people showing up I think that's

2253
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:08,880
very special in content land I never

2254
01:23:06,479 --> 01:23:11,759
thought it would happen for um cannabis

2255
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:14,100
genetics because it is so Niche it takes

2256
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:16,500
certain type of personalities to be this

2257
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:18,840
into learning about what you're smoking

2258
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:21,000
why it's affecting you the way it does

2259
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:22,500
and like keeping track like the whole

2260
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,420
provenance of everything and just try to

2261
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:26,219
get to the bottom that's that's weird

2262
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:28,079
that's super [ __ ] weird there's not a

2263
01:23:26,219 --> 01:23:30,179
lot of weirdos like us out there so

2264
01:23:28,079 --> 01:23:32,039
every time that I see like our

2265
01:23:30,179 --> 01:23:33,480
subscriber count growing it tells me

2266
01:23:32,039 --> 01:23:35,939
there's more people that are fascinated

2267
01:23:33,479 --> 01:23:38,039
by this topic and deeply fascinated by

2268
01:23:35,939 --> 01:23:40,259
it at that and that it blows my [ __ ]

2269
01:23:38,039 --> 01:23:41,819
mind because I I just watching the

2270
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:43,800
forums over the years you know just a

2271
01:23:41,819 --> 01:23:45,359
few hundred people interacting on each

2272
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:47,219
one and that was the best you'd get and

2273
01:23:45,359 --> 01:23:49,679
a lot of them are really mean and

2274
01:23:47,219 --> 01:23:51,600
weren't there for good reasons and these

2275
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:53,760
are all like our our community is

2276
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:56,100
amazing absolutely amazing if I died

2277
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:57,780
tomorrow it would run itself and that's

2278
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:59,640
what's so [ __ ] cool

2279
01:23:57,779 --> 01:24:01,619
I absolutely love it

2280
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:03,960
I don't I mean I I feel like that's

2281
01:24:01,619 --> 01:24:06,479
possibly an exaggeration I don't I don't

2282
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:09,119
know if you could die tomorrow and this

2283
01:24:06,479 --> 01:24:12,718
I just run but we'll see I mean no

2284
01:24:09,119 --> 01:24:15,179
hopefully we won't see sorry oh my god

2285
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:17,579
um I'm calling it I'm calling um a hit

2286
01:24:15,179 --> 01:24:20,279
on that tonight yeah yeah it's good a

2287
01:24:17,579 --> 01:24:22,079
thousand foot show from New Zealand

2288
01:24:20,279 --> 01:24:23,519
um live from New Zealand reader

2289
01:24:22,079 --> 01:24:26,399
syndicate

2290
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:28,140
uh what was I gonna say I think okay I

2291
01:24:26,399 --> 01:24:30,000
think my paraphrase of what Matt just

2292
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:31,619
said though is that what makes me happy

2293
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:34,198
is that there are people who are

2294
01:24:31,619 --> 01:24:35,939
interested in finding out the truth or

2295
01:24:34,198 --> 01:24:39,059
at least as much of the truth as they

2296
01:24:35,939 --> 01:24:40,619
can because that's what we're into yeah

2297
01:24:39,060 --> 01:24:42,719
um and it is

2298
01:24:40,619 --> 01:24:46,559
it is heartwarming to see

2299
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:50,158
um it is encouraging to see yeah

2300
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:52,440
um the other side of I think uh this

2301
01:24:50,158 --> 01:24:54,779
ending the season on this note um you

2302
01:24:52,439 --> 01:24:56,279
know we we covered

2303
01:24:54,779 --> 01:24:57,719
the whole breeding series I think that

2304
01:24:56,279 --> 01:24:59,579
was really fun it was really

2305
01:24:57,719 --> 01:25:01,439
comprehensive and I found myself

2306
01:24:59,579 --> 01:25:03,719
actually quite exhausted afterwards and

2307
01:25:01,439 --> 01:25:06,899
like not knowing what what kinds what

2308
01:25:03,719 --> 01:25:09,779
other episodes we could do yeah um

2309
01:25:06,899 --> 01:25:12,839
but but in saying that I think Matt and

2310
01:25:09,779 --> 01:25:14,698
I have some good ideas for uh the next

2311
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:16,980
season yes

2312
01:25:14,698 --> 01:25:18,539
um we have we're also toying with some

2313
01:25:16,979 --> 01:25:19,939
like trying out some new kinds of

2314
01:25:18,539 --> 01:25:23,698
content I don't know if it'll actually

2315
01:25:19,939 --> 01:25:27,419
come to fruition but like we joked at

2316
01:25:23,698 --> 01:25:31,559
least about maybe doing reaction videos

2317
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:34,619
to Strain Hunters or maybe like burners

2318
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:36,900
like funny documentaries

2319
01:25:34,619 --> 01:25:39,238
um maybe maybe we'll see and I'm also

2320
01:25:36,899 --> 01:25:40,679
thinking about doing like watching UFO

2321
01:25:39,238 --> 01:25:43,259
videos and getting really [ __ ] up and

2322
01:25:40,679 --> 01:25:45,658
commenting on them as reaction videos

2323
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:47,460
don't you already kind of do that yeah

2324
01:25:45,658 --> 01:25:49,920
but I don't record it

2325
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:52,500
I don't like let people watch me do

2326
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:55,140
stupid [ __ ] and talk over UFO videos so

2327
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:57,238
it might be funny I say stupid [ __ ] when

2328
01:25:55,140 --> 01:25:59,159
I'm stoned

2329
01:25:57,238 --> 01:26:01,500
but yeah we've definitely also got a few

2330
01:25:59,158 --> 01:26:04,738
guests in mind a couple of whom we've

2331
01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:05,520
actually like lined up and and uh a few

2332
01:26:04,738 --> 01:26:08,698
more

2333
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:11,340
um we still need to line up yeah but

2334
01:26:08,698 --> 01:26:13,319
still plenty more good stuff to come so

2335
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:15,840
you know what I love that this season

2336
01:26:13,319 --> 01:26:19,079
thousand fold got to figure out how hard

2337
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:21,480
it is to run the show behind the scenes

2338
01:26:19,079 --> 01:26:25,019
yeah weekly get people communicate and

2339
01:26:21,479 --> 01:26:27,479
like you know yeah it's not as easy it

2340
01:26:25,020 --> 01:26:28,920
sucks it's not and the funny thing is

2341
01:26:27,479 --> 01:26:30,718
that you know I can I kind of look back

2342
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:32,520
on a week and and count the hours and be

2343
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:35,520
like oh it's not it's not that much but

2344
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:36,960
I think what happened why it feels kind

2345
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:38,639
of like it it stretches throughout the

2346
01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:40,380
week is because yeah the start of the

2347
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:41,880
week we we have to decide what we're

2348
01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:44,340
doing yeah then we have to try to

2349
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:46,139
coordinate uh

2350
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:47,219
like the planning and recording of it

2351
01:26:46,139 --> 01:26:49,380
and then of course it actually gets

2352
01:26:47,219 --> 01:26:51,300
published later in the week so it's

2353
01:26:49,380 --> 01:26:53,940
actually kind of like an endless cycle

2354
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:55,619
and I'm like I think now I'm like now

2355
01:26:53,939 --> 01:26:57,919
that I've seen what I've seen I'm like

2356
01:26:55,619 --> 01:27:00,719
forcing Matt into more and more like

2357
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:02,760
organization being like no we need to

2358
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:05,100
start like scheduling things in advance

2359
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:07,320
I'm Gonna Make a list like a schedule of

2360
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:10,679
episodes that we can cover and

2361
01:27:07,319 --> 01:27:13,319
yeah he has no idea he's in I'm the I am

2362
01:27:10,679 --> 01:27:16,079
the opposite of schedule and

2363
01:27:13,319 --> 01:27:18,779
organization it's gonna be great yeah

2364
01:27:16,079 --> 01:27:20,600
it's gonna be great hey it's worked I'll

2365
01:27:18,779 --> 01:27:22,920
put it this way Matt's put up with like

2366
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:23,639
Matt's kind of been really

2367
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:25,500
um

2368
01:27:23,639 --> 01:27:27,420
open to like you know what I've had to

2369
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:30,238
bring so far so I'm hoping oh yeah

2370
01:27:27,420 --> 01:27:32,819
what's good [ __ ] I'm stoked I think I

2371
01:27:30,238 --> 01:27:34,738
think everybody all the feedback has

2372
01:27:32,819 --> 01:27:36,420
been great for this season people have

2373
01:27:34,738 --> 01:27:37,379
really enjoyed the content they've

2374
01:27:36,420 --> 01:27:38,940
enjoyed

2375
01:27:37,380 --> 01:27:41,159
I think a lot of people have really

2376
01:27:38,939 --> 01:27:43,500
enjoyed being able to have some like

2377
01:27:41,158 --> 01:27:45,899
from point A to point B to point C to

2378
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:49,319
point d as opposed to trying to look at

2379
01:27:45,899 --> 01:27:51,238
through my ADHD brain because it's

2380
01:27:49,319 --> 01:27:54,479
everything that I produce is very

2381
01:27:51,238 --> 01:27:57,539
[ __ ] if it's just left up to me to

2382
01:27:54,479 --> 01:27:59,519
bring it to be it's it's just how I do

2383
01:27:57,539 --> 01:28:01,198
things it's just random thoughts at all

2384
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:03,239
times so I think people really have

2385
01:28:01,198 --> 01:28:06,238
enjoyed being able to like follow along

2386
01:28:03,238 --> 01:28:07,799
and actually follow along so yeah yeah

2387
01:28:06,238 --> 01:28:09,000

2391
01:28:14,279 --> 01:28:18,658

2392

2405
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:53,639
community has really really been built

2406
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:56,039
through our patreon Discord like

2407
01:28:53,639 --> 01:28:57,840
that's made of family that's made an

2408
01:28:56,039 --> 01:29:00,539
absolute family I love some of these

2409
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:02,400
people like there's gonna be a lot of

2410
01:29:00,539 --> 01:29:04,198
lifelong friends built out of that place

2411
01:29:02,399 --> 01:29:05,519
and people really genuinely care about

2412
01:29:04,198 --> 01:29:07,198
each other taking care of each other

2413
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:09,360
it's insane to see

2414
01:29:07,198 --> 01:29:11,759
um and you can be a part of that

2415
01:29:09,359 --> 01:29:13,380
um for as much as a coffee a month like

2416
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:15,840
you can be a part of that and chill and

2417
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:17,819
hang out with us and it basically it

2418
01:29:15,840 --> 01:29:20,400
keeps the trolls out and it's a really

2419
01:29:17,819 --> 01:29:22,500
awesome place and yeah do you know

2420
01:29:20,399 --> 01:29:25,138
roughly how many

2421
01:29:22,500 --> 01:29:27,840
people we have as members on the server

2422
01:29:25,139 --> 01:29:30,719
I think it's about 500. I have no at

2423
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:32,639
least on the Discord but yeah yeah

2424
01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:34,980
probably about that I would guess I know

2425
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:36,840
it got up to 900 at one point and then

2426
01:29:34,979 --> 01:29:40,259
cleared it out I think that included the

2427
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:42,060
Free People yeah the free people I mean

2428
01:29:40,260 --> 01:29:44,520
yeah you know what I mean yeah they were

2429
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:46,199
free

2430
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:47,460
yeah and occasionally we'll do that

2431
01:29:46,198 --> 01:29:49,079
again we'll open it up for free so

2432
01:29:47,460 --> 01:29:50,100
people can get like an idea of what goes

2433
01:29:49,079 --> 01:29:52,619
on in there and see if it's something

2434
01:29:50,100 --> 01:29:54,600
they're even into you know some people

2435
01:29:52,619 --> 01:29:56,698
are tentative about Discord and chat

2436
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:59,039
rooms and interacting we have a lot of

2437
01:29:56,698 --> 01:30:00,539
people that just kind of you know Snoop

2438
01:29:59,039 --> 01:30:01,800
from the background and learn as they go

2439
01:30:00,539 --> 01:30:03,600
and don't interact much and that's

2440
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:05,159
totally fine too

2441
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:08,340
um and then there's people who get up in

2442
01:30:05,158 --> 01:30:11,359
the mix and you know don't shut up you

2443
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:11,360
