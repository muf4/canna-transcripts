00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,879
something that's what the sound is she

17
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,920

18
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:46,439
couldn't get her out of the garage mom

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,280
kicked me in the chickens out so I'm

20
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:51,399
living in a garage down the road at a

21
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:54,558
buddy's house freezing my balls off it

22

24
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,719
and a pillow basically that's why I got

25
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:02,480
the hoodie on cuz I'm freezing

26
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,239
but I do got a space heater so we're all

27
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,438
right but I got the space heater off

28
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,439

29
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:10,679
course we're going to bring you guys the

30
00:01:08,438 --> 00:01:12,839
best quality the best show the best

31
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,600
entertainment that we can do over here

32
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,159
on Breer Syndicate TV I mean that's what

33
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:18,640
this is all about I know there's some

34
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,280
people in the community might not like

35
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,239
me that much might think I'm a little

36
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,560
bit arrogant or a jerk or whatever you

37
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:27,560
know or play around too much and that's

38
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,478
fine y'all but I'm here to rock out for

39
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,759
breeders Syndicate when no one else is

40
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:34,359
willing to to do so I'm willing to lay

41
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:37,959
it all on the line I'm willing to leave

42
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:40,319
my ego in the Maola hot tub get up here

43
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:43,000
and say and do what I got to do to

44
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:46,798
further the breeder Syndicate way of

45
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,159
living truth justice in American way put

46
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,000
a fork in me I'm almost done but not

47
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,240
quite we got a couple things on this

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,879
episode y'all I got to be careful

49
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,839
because we can't show plans I had to

50
00:01:55,879 --> 00:02:02,039
refilm this whole episode on the blue

51
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:05,000
Zushi because I showed macro shots and

52
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:07,599
all this other stuff in the in the video

53
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,878
I had already filmed for this episode so

54
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:13,479
this is a rerun or a redo I should say a

55
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:16,079
few hours before it airs tonight so I do

56
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:17,719
apologize if it seemed a little off or

57
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,519
you know the pacing is a little weird

58
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:21,560
it's kind of on the Fly freestyling this

59
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:23,080
essentially like I do everything but you

60
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,920
know what I'm saying this is just more

61
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:28,480
freestyle but I got some growing tips

62
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,559
for the new people out there we got

63
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:30,399
we're going to talk about a couple

64
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,719
things

65
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,480
not real heady stuff you know and to

66
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:37,400
some of you OG's watching I know we had

67
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:39,119
a couple people on the last episode say

68
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,560
a few things I know there's other ways

69
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,840
to do a lot of the stuff that I'm

70
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,080
talking about but keep in mind we're

71
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:48,080
trying to make an episode or a show that

72
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,120
will bring in some new faces some new

73
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,519
people you know we can't have the most

74
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,680
headiest craziest topics for these

75
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:56,879
people at all times and I'm not the one

76
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,239
to give it to them anyways like that I'm

77
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:00,359
very chill I want to have a good time

78
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:01,519

79
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,599
trying to look at some titties I'm

80
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,200
trying to smoke some blunts I don't care

81
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:09,079

freaking uh wreck weed store a little

163
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:25,160
purple on it Frosty you know given looks

164
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:27,079
are all there wasn't expecting a smell

165
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,120
you I wasn't expecting a blueberry smell

166
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:31,318
of all things even though Blue's in the

167
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,160
name you know this is wreck weed mind

168
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:38,879
you so I'm expecting nothing

169
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,919
really but I couldn't help but realize

170
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:44,680
I'm getting the same exact blueberry

171
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:47,598
TPS but toned down way way down now if

172
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,918
this was a grow of a blue Zushi you know

173
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:51,959
homegrown maybe on the same level but as

174
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:56,038
far as you know what I had there was not

175
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:59,638
on the same level uh intensity wise or

176
00:06:56,038 --> 00:07:01,240
range uh you know it there was that

177
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,478
blueberry turp but there wasn't a

178
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,680
spectrum if that makes any sense on the

179
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:08,719
blue Zushi but it brought me back to my

180
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,478
Groves of the blueberry X of Matts if

181
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,720
you like blueberry turps if you want one

182
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:16,478
of the best expressions or the best

183
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,840
blueberry strange cvars whatever you

184
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:20,000
want to call it out there pick up the

185
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:21,598
blueberry IX or some of the blue bonnet

186
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,160
work from mat but I would recommend

187
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:26,360
doing the blueberry

188
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,360
IX it's going to give you the most uh

189
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,520
blueberry plant you could really find

190
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,400
that I've been able to grow I haven't

191
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:34,359
haven't grown a lot of blueberry stuff

192
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:36,598
but definitely can smell blueberry in a

193
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:39,720
range of blueberry turps I mean I'm

194
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:41,719
talking candy blueberry pies maybe even

195
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,720
all the way the muffins to a sharp candy

196
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,840
kind of smell and this is what that

197
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,240
blueberry Zushi kind of reminded me of

198
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:51,119
more of that kind of sharp candy

199
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,680
blueberry turp or smells whatever you

200
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,720
want to call it now that didn't really

201
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,120
translate to the actual smoke itself but

202
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,960
the turbs brought me back to the

203
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,199
blueberry ex which made me think like

204
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:04,318
man like all these people are out here

205
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:06,280
getting hyped off this blue Zushi

206
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,800
Meanwhile my boy Matt got the best

207
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:10,758
blueberry turbs in the world over here

208
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:13,000
on the IX and people might say I'm

209
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:15,280
biased but I grew them out and they are

210
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,800
a lot better I mean they are some of the

211
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:19,478
best blueberry turps I've had in life

212
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,879
the best really I mean the only other

213
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:25,758
ones that compare would be more of the

214
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:28,400
blue Bonet stuff through matte but the

215
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,120
ixs were delicious they're great if you

216
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:34,199
want something blueberry it's all for

217
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:38,679
you right there now the high on anything

218
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:41,000
blueberry to me is never is never crazy

219
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:45,000
from the Expressions that I've got grown

220
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,080
myself I just haven't seen crazy potency

221
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,759
like I'm not trying to knock on it it's

222
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:53,278
just that I smoke a lot of weed so a lot

223
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:55,559
of the buds I'm smoking you know I need

224
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:57,278
some real potent stuff you know now I

225
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:59,039
will say that kind of that kind of weed

226
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:00,600
there is great for going to work cuz you

227
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,958
ain't going to get get blasted blasted

228
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,000
you'll be able to function and still

229
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:07,639
talk but that weed is great for waking

230
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,519
and baking maybe uh if you don't like

231
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:10,759
got to go to work or if you got maybe

232
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,519
you ain't trying to get blasted and

233
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,958
laying on the couch I don't know I don't

234
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:16,759
know I don't really do that any I don't

235
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:19,399
get blasted hardly anyways off anything

236
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:21,120
but you know I do want some potency but

237
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:23,320
I will say if you want to experience

238
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,799
that blueberry stuff check out the I

239
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,480
exes and what something I thought was

240
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:30,000
more important if you're growing wheat

241
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,519
and you're picking up blue Zushi

242
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,919
just get a pack of blueberry ex they

243
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:37,879
regulars and do some chucking like what

244
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:40,159
the heck you

245
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:42,200
know and Matt's telling me I can get

246
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:45,360
that blueberry turch to express on a lot

247
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:47,519
of different stuff pretty easily so my

248
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,320
me being a chucker I was sitting there

249
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,759
thinking like why would I even grow blue

250
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,600
Zushi if I could grow a blueberry ex and

251
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:56,278
then make some Chucks and you could

252
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,480
really pretty easily make your own cool

253
00:09:56,278 --> 00:10:01,838
blueberry esque plant with little little

254
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,879
to no work like I don't know I don't

255
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:07,600
understand the hype on it on the blue

256
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:09,159
Zushi stuff I don't really get it uh but

257
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,360
to each their own and maybe if I had a

258
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:13,360
homegrown version of it I would speak

259
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,360
differently on it you know it's hard to

260
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,959
compare one plant that's grown

261
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,639
recreational to four or five

262
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:23,439
plants homegrown with different

263
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:25,278
Expressions that were all I mean it's

264
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,279
just a whole different thing but I did

265
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:29,799
find it interesting to say the least so

266
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:33,078
I think moving forward you know we're

267
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:34,838
going to talk about uh more modern stuff

268
00:10:33,078 --> 00:10:36,638
uh to get up in them algorithms of

269
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:38,839
spread the breeder Syndicate message cuz

270
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:41,639
we got to be let's be realistic most of

271
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:43,399
us watching this [ __ ] are like 35 plus

272
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:45,278
we got to get some new blood in whether

273
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:47,440
you like it or not the next generation

274
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:51,559
is going to have to take the torch at

275
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:54,000
some point right so we gotta educate we

276
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:55,479
got to educate them we got to teach them

277
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,200
we got to tell them like look bro

278
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:59,600
there's other ways to do this [ __ ] you

279
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,720
don't have to be out here looking like a

280
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,480
weirdo smoking the blue Zushi bro you

281
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:06,040

282

295
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,879

383
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:58,000
them both you know I I am particular

384
00:15:55,879 --> 00:16:00,360
about nipple shape though so you know I

385
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,198
might say you got weird nipples but

386
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:06,519
don't take it personal but we talk

387
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:08,919
about you

388
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:10,919
know protecting your plants we talk

389
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:13,479
about sulfur we talk about pests and

390
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:16,078
things and today I wanted to talk about

391
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:19,000
some sulfur cuz I felt like we talked

392
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:21,278
about it before but people were a little

393
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,440
bit confused cuz I know I'm a visual

394
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:25,799
learner too guys I got to see the

395
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,079
boobies in front of me or you telling me

396
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:29,639
the Double D's and they're under a shirt

397
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:31,879
I might think they're A's I don't really

398
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:34,879
know I got to see it to believe it you

399
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:34,879
know

400
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:42,198
so I think we needed to talk about two

401
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:45,519
what kind of person would want to use

402
00:16:42,198 --> 00:16:47,799
sulfur if you got a tent if you got two

403
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,399
tents if you got a few tents but they're

404
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:53,359
spread out in different areas of your

405
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,679
house you know depending on your climate

406
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:59,079
maybe there's a few different things

407
00:16:55,679 --> 00:17:00,519
where your average little new grower a

408
00:16:59,078 --> 00:17:02,239
you don't really need sulfur I see

409
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:04,318
people all the time saying my plants get

410
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:09,640
everything they need so they don't need

411
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:13,438
it well there's a difference Bud from

412
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:15,880
growing 10 plants versus you know

413
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,720
somebody met hypothetically growing a

414
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:22,640
lot of plants 100 plants maybe in a

415
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,439
small smaller room you know uh you

416
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,480
really at that point if you running a

417
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:29,160
lot of plants you're really a dummy for

418
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:33,400
not running sulfur unless you're just

419
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:35,000
got the super best climate ever and you

420
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,280
don't have problems like that there it

421
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,200
is possible I mean I at home back in

422
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:41,720
Kentucky I'd never had PM I'd never have

423
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,960
any kind of problems

424
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:47,600
really but we've talked about sulfur

425
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:50,319
before for using it for PM powdery

426
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:54,879
mildew and let me tell y'all it works

427
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:57,558
like a charm when you have one tent two

428
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,360
tents you don't need to sulfur out I

429
00:17:57,558 --> 00:18:01,798
wouldn't even recommend doing it really

430
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:03,918
if you just got a couple of plans but if

431
00:18:01,798 --> 00:18:06,519
you are in an environment I'm next to a

432
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:09,280
swamp I'm next to Woods I'm next to

433
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:12,158
decaying matter I'm next to all kinds of

434
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,599
[ __ ] so I got to prepare for the worst

435
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:15,760
up here I've never experienced this in

436
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:17,319
my life back in Kentucky so a lot of

437
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:19,400
this stuff I'm learning for the first

438
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:23,678
time myself so I figure we'll share it

439
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:26,080
but if you're getting PM especially if

440
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,759
you you first off you need to get your

441
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:29,158
circulation going a little bit better

442
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:30,640
that's the first off you need to get

443
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:33,080
your your fans going you need to have a

444
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,960
fan on the bottom blowing on the bottom

445
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:36,798
there some people you won't need to do

446
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,200
this but for me up here I have to have a

447
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:41,158
me a fan on a bottom blowing like to

448
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:45,240
have me one up on the top of the canopy

449
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:47,360
and I like to have me one blowing up so

450
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,519
I can blow that warm air up and out

451
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:51,719
through the exhaust so you need to

452
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:52,960
increase your flow for starters but if

453
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,400
you're like me and you got plants

454
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,480
crammed and they're so damn tight and

455
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:00,280
you got too many where you can't keep up

456
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,319
with the folan like you should or

457
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:04,279
whatever or you're not training them

458
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:05,519
maybe you're going to run into some

459
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:08,519
problems sometimes so I start getting a

460
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:10,918
little PM in the winter time this season

461
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:13,879
or this winter I didn't get any in the

462
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:15,720
summertime except for out outside but

463
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,280
the with the climate being cold it shift

464
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,038
all cold one day and shift warm the next

465
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:22,918
Michigan's got crazy weather where I'm

466
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:25,119
at right so I got to talk in the bitter

467
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:27,840
I seen bitter talking about sulfur like

468
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:30,199
using it for plants to take care of PM I

469
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:32,038
said bitter home dog what the heck is up

470
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,240
if you don't know who bitters is he's in

471
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:38,000

474
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:42,399

475
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,839

476

guys I pretend to be but anyways we uh

479
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:55,639
he got to talking about sulfur one time

480
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:57,440
and I I ended up asking about it I said

481
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,159
how you use that how you implement it in

482
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:03,240
your garden if you get a little peen

483
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:04,960
he says Chuck Chuck it's simple bro and

484
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:08,159
he

485
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,079
recommended buy that Bondi or what

486
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,600
however you say it I'll hold it still

487
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:13,079
there for you so you can look at it

488
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:15,719
there's a couple different versions of

489
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:18,158
it and this is going to be your cheaper

490
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:21,200
alter you know your cheaper version of s

491
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:25,559
of you know powdered dry sulfur whatever

492
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:29,480
you want to call it um micro

493
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:32,319
rized uh but you can get a a better

494
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:35,839
brand that's more fine that that really

495
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:37,639
all you're getting out of it is uh not

496
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:39,720
having to use so much and and it is

497
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,840
finer so you know in the water itself

498
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,400
it's just smaller particulas or

499
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:46,599
particles I guess you could say so it's

500
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,679
it stay stay suspended as well more in

501
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:50,678
the water too I'd imagine different

502
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:52,200
things but I actually just went with the

503
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:54,519
cheaper stuff and it's been working

504
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,319
great but to way you want to use this in

505
00:20:54,519 --> 00:21:00,480
your garden let me finish this up

506
00:20:57,319 --> 00:21:02,000
y'all don't just take care of PM as well

507
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,599
it takes care of russed mites and I

508
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,159
think maybe one other thing but I know

509
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:09,759
for sure bidder was saying that it takes

510
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:11,400
care of Russ russets as well which is

511
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:15,079
pretty cool I never experienced russets

512
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,679
so I don't know I you know whatever but

513
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:19,199
there's some better stuff and I forget

514
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:20,960
the brand of it and maybe uh bitter or

515
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,600
somebody can drop the brand down or

516
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,519
maybe if you guys got some brands of of

517
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:27,519
micro eyes sulfur put them down in the

518
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:28,960
comments for people to try I like this

519
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:32,400
one here just cuz it's cheap it's

520
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,558
affordable it's off Amazon it goes a a a

521
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,240
long way you know and it gets to my door

522
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:37,759
in a day so when I needed it that's what

523
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,278
I happened to order maybe I would have

524
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:41,200
bought the better stuff if I had more

525
00:21:39,278 --> 00:21:42,519
time or whatever but that's what I had

526
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,919
and ultimately that's what I'm probably

527
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:45,798
going to use for now because it works

528
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,400
great and I'm going to implement it into

529
00:21:45,798 --> 00:21:50,119
my Gardens outside this year cuz we did

530
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:52,559
have some PM outside last year on a few

531
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:53,798
plants I'm hoping that helps me out but

532
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:56,558
the way you want to use it in your

533
00:21:53,798 --> 00:22:00,038
garden is if you got a little bit of

534
00:21:56,558 --> 00:22:03,000
PM you want to use one tablespoon per

535
00:22:00,038 --> 00:22:05,440
gallon right if you got a real bad case

536
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
of it you can do two

537
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:11,640
tablespoons and you really want to put

538
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:15,679
your little drop drop of soap in there a

539
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:19,360
little molier you know and put you one

540
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:21,480
little drop of dish soap in there and

541
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:23,399
you want to mix it up real good and it's

542
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:25,400
best to use it right after you mix it

543
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,120
mix it but I have used some that's sat

544
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,038
around in a spray bottle for a day or

545
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:32,399
two it still does work but the way you

546
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:36,519
want to use it least the way I do

547
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:40,000
it a is a foil I can't talk right now

548
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:43,440
you guys you want to use it as a a

549
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,839
spray and you mix up your little gallon

550
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,159
or however much you want if you're doing

551
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:49,119
a half gallon you could do half of a

552
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:50,760
tablespoon or what you know you just

553
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:54,759
break it up

554
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:56,839
accordingly you mix it up and I like to

555
00:22:54,759 --> 00:23:00,000
use these right

556
00:22:56,839 --> 00:23:01,519
here the Z bottles I really like Zip not

557
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,839
because I'm sponsored or anything like

558
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:05,679
that but they uh they just last a long

559
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:08,720
time I've had literally one of these

560
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,759
since since I started growing again uh

561
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,200
for last five or six years and it's

562
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:14,079
never broke on me I've tried some of

563
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,840
those little pump little tiny half

564
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:19,038
gallon pump ones and [ __ ] little gallon

565
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:20,399
ones like you know it's got I don't know

566
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:22,000
you see them in like lows and like the

567
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,600
gardening section those always break on

568
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,079
you the seals go bad [ __ ] like that but

569
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:28,798
I also like using these this is a

570
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:31,839
smaller one I do have a two gallon one I

571
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:34,119
do like these wand uh this is the brand

572
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:37,319
I got um I think I ordered this in like

573
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:39,158
a two pack uh off of Amazon for like 20

574
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:41,960
bucks or something but it's a

575
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:43,720
gallon I like these cuz you can really

576
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,200
if you got a tent you can get up

577
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:48,400
underneath cuz you want to spray

578
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:51,400
underneath the leaves and on top and the

579
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,880
stocks like for me I didn't really get

580
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,720
much on my leaves but I would get it

581
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:58,159
more on my my stems my lower stems like

582
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:01,400
at the very bottom just above the soil

583
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:04,400
so I really like those uh but another

584
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:06,600
thing too is you really want um you

585
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,798
really want to do this at night time

586
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:10,240
because if you do it with the lights on

587
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:12,240
or in the sun it'll burn the [ __ ] out of

588
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,720
your plants and trust me I tried it and

589
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,319
and it not I didn't try it but I I you

590
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,000
know I've experimented a little bit and

591
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:21,278
I found out yeah definitely will will

592
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,960
burn your [ __ ] not by choice but but by

593
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:27,720
accident I did burn a couple things not

594
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:29,240
too terribly bad but um you can burn

595
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,240
them and also you don't want to use it

596
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,919
if you have any kind of oils or anything

597
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:36,359
like that man if you put any like NE oil

598
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,559
or anything oil based on it you want to

599
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:39,278
give it a few weeks before you put

600
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:42,398
anything else on it or it's going to

601
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:45,319
mess it up bro another thing

602
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:47,879
too is if you got

603
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:50,439
clones you can dip your clones

604
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:53,399
especially if you got like a rock W rock

605
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:55,600
wool cubes it's really easy man you just

606
00:24:53,398 --> 00:24:57,918
take that thing turn it upside down and

607
00:24:55,599 --> 00:25:00,558
bring it all the way to the don't don't

608
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,440
put your roots or your your actual Cube

609
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:04,119
down in there but right above it and

610
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,519
just bring it right down dip it in real

611
00:25:04,119 --> 00:25:07,798
quick and pull it out I'll give a little

612
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:09,278
shake or so so it's not real heavy

613
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:10,960
especially on a fresh clone you don't

614
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:14,599
want a bunch of water sitting on top of

615
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:16,120
it but and then what I like to do is

616
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:19,079
with when I do the Clones like that I'll

617
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:21,239
let them kind of dry I I'll

618
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:22,558
intermittently we got a chicken in here

619
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,319
chewing on stuff I told you she's going

620
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:26,359
to make racket at some point now she's

621
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:29,000
chewing on styrofoam quit chewing on

622
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:31,119
styrofoam there chicken it's eating

623
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,200
eating styrofoam I I got the weirdest

624
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:35,319
chickens hold on a second let me let me

625
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,880
shut this thing up don't why you eating

626
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:41,079
styrofoam God damn it boy get out of

627
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:44,960
here what the hell Mom's done put me in

628
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:46,599
a a messed up situation you guys got

629
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,960
chicken living in here with me I mean

630
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:50,319
damn my old lady don't even want to come

631
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:53,038
kick it with me got this chicken hanging

632
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:54,759
out you can dip your clones in it and I

633
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:56,919
really like that but something you need

634
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:59,839
to be careful on on what that is if you

635
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:01,360
got your clones domed you're you know

636
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:05,038
your the water is not going to really

637
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:07,359
evaporate off of your uh dipped clones

638
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:09,839
that much so what I like to do is I kind

639
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:12,158
of occasionally I'll for like the first

640
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:14,918
12 hours or or whatever I I kind of keep

641
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,278
them more in the in the shap like not in

642
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:19,159
direct light I'll kind of put them in

643
00:26:16,278 --> 00:26:20,839
ambient light I run some uh ions I think

644
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:23,080
they're like 35 Watts a piece or

645
00:26:20,839 --> 00:26:24,720
something like that and I got a rack so

646
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:26,519
I'll kind of set them off to the side a

647
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,839
little bit and occasionally I'll take

648
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:31,278
that Dome off and let that that water

649
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:33,158
evaporate or even put a a little fan on

650
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:35,159
just a little bit increments at you know

651
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:37,000
a little bit at a time because you can

652
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:39,840
dry your [ __ ] dry them out like that so

653
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,480
you need to be careful but I like doing

654
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:45,398
that it is easier to probably just spray

655
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:48,159
them uh you know but dipping the clones

656
00:26:45,398 --> 00:26:50,278
and stuff I it's the way I like to do it

657
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,520
you can use a paintbrush of some kind

658
00:26:50,278 --> 00:26:55,159
too if you have to just hit a few spots

659
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:57,240
so if you got a plant somewhere and you

660
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:59,840
want to you don't want to spray it down

661
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,798
or or you know whatever you can go in

662
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:02,240
there and kind of hit it with the

663
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:03,679
paintbrush a little bit of that sulfur

664
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,880
just dip your paintbrush in and keep

665
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:09,159
hitting it now you want to do this like

666
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:12,278
two weeks like you could do it right as

667
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:15,159
you flower basically right when you flip

668
00:27:12,278 --> 00:27:17,599
you can spray and let it chill but you

669
00:27:15,159 --> 00:27:19,600
don't want to be doing that [ __ ] like

670
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:21,558
really like after a week cuz some stuff

671
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:23,759
will flour faster on on you and the

672
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:26,278
others and it'll burn burn your buds a

673
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:29,119
little bit and stuff so you you really

674
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:30,558
want to sulfur It Up is like a

675
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:32,599
preventative thing you know right when

676
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:35,678
you flip that's probably gonna be your

677
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:37,599
best time you know you can do it like a

678
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,559
weekend but you want to do it really

679
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:43,278
before your buds start to your you know

680
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:45,879
your flowers start to form and stuff but

681
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:48,000
uh yeah man if you so if you got

682
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:52,480
problems with russets or if you got

683
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:54,839
problems with with PM pick you up some

684
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,519
microzed I can't talk tonight y'all

685
00:27:54,839 --> 00:28:00,119
sulfur and I think this is a you know

686
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:01,679
you could dust on too if you want uh I

687
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:03,839
like doing it like bitter said with the

688
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,480
soap cuz you know the water and the soap

689
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:08,959
cuz it kind of all helps it stick to the

690
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:11,440
plant and yeah man I think I covered

691
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:14,399
everything yeah don't don't use it with

692
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:17,519
the lights on or you know you burn them

693
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:20,518
uh use a little a drop of soap one

694
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:24,440
tablespoon per gallon two if it's real

695
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:26,839
bad don't do it at least I would say

696
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:29,558
seven days after flip don't do it

697
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:31,599
anytime after that but but try to do it

698
00:28:29,558 --> 00:28:32,960
right when you flip this is going to be

699
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:35,319
better for somebody that's got a lot of

700
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,079
plants so if you're running into pm get

701
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:40,000
you some sulfur dude this stuff is so

702
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:42,119
cheap and this thing's like a 5B bag it

703
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,440
I mean this is an extra bag I've ordered

704
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:46,199

709
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:56,720

when are my plants done when how do you

732
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:49,159
know when your plants are done well when

733
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:50,720
you've grown for a while you know by

734
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:53,440
visuals you know by looking at the

735
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,480
tricomes you know by you know the look

736
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,278
of the plant if you're feeding it right

737
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,519
she's fading pretty good for you she

738
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:02,038
ain't dark green on on you when you're

739
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:04,679
done or at least you shouldn't be most

740
00:30:02,038 --> 00:30:07,440
genetics if you if you're doing it right

741
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:10,919
but for me I like to use one of these

742
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:14,200
right here and I see people say all the

743
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:16,038
time I you know I use my phone and this

744
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,360
and that and that's cool some people

745
00:30:16,038 --> 00:30:19,640
they got little things you can attach to

746
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:21,639
your phones some people you like to cut

747
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,120
off something and take it over to a

748
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,320
microscope or whatever the heck you want

749
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:27,439
to see I got to use a microsc scope to

750
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:29,278
see my [ __ ] to be honest with you so I

751
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:33,480
get it I really do I can relate to you

752
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:35,359
guys fully but this is from AC infinity

753
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:37,079
and I don't and I'm not plugging them I

754
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:39,719
just I use a lot of their products I use

755
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:43,000
a lot of other people's products too but

756
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:45,079
I really like this uh Jeweler Loop here

757
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,798
I've tried an actual Jeweler loop I got

758
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:48,879
even got some I got this one that even

759
00:30:46,798 --> 00:30:50,720
goes across your head and I'm like y'all

760
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:53,519
I can't see [ __ ] with that but this one

761
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,880
actually here I really like cuz it's got

762
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:57,720
for one it's got two different sizes and

763
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:00,159
I can't remember I think this is a 50

764
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:02,558
time and then 100 times but I'm not 100%

765
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,799
sure on that I suck I should have

766
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:06,278
already known that but something I

767
00:31:03,798 --> 00:31:08,000
really like about these ones here is

768
00:31:06,278 --> 00:31:10,558
it's got a light on it so you got a

769
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,319
light for one side and then you got a

770
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:14,798
light for another one and I actually get

771
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:17,638
pretty good results with this and I'm

772
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:19,038
able to actually see I I wear glasses

773
00:31:17,638 --> 00:31:21,599
sometimes and I can actually see with

774
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:22,839
those without glasses so if I can see

775
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:24,199
with that y'all should be able to see

776
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:26,879
with that but I think that thing's like

777
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,278
eight bucks or something on on on AC

778
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,760
infinity or through Amazon you don't

779
00:31:28,278 --> 00:31:30,919
even have to go through them you can I'm

780
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:32,960
pretty sure they sell them in different

781
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:35,000
places and different different brands

782
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:38,278
probably have more like these I just

783
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,638
went with AC Infinity one because I was

784
00:31:38,278 --> 00:31:42,038

785
00:31:39,638 --> 00:31:43,439

786

838
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:54,120

839
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:56,720

00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,960
heads out there are like

842
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:03,558
man dabbing is weird I think it's a

843
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,440
little weird too but I do got a dab rig

844
00:34:03,558 --> 00:34:08,358
here that I

845
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:11,280
use occasionally when I pick up some of

846
00:34:08,358 --> 00:34:12,918
Peach's Peach's stuff I gotta I want to

847
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,879
try something you know I got to have

848
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:17,878
something for when I pick up some homie

849
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:19,759
stuff want to try out some concentrates

850
00:34:17,878 --> 00:34:21,440
I'm not a big concentrate guy but

851
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,280
occasionally like I said a homie will

852
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:27,440
send me or you know we'll get something

853
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:29,720
going but I see people all the time they

854
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:33,079
talking about the old days when people

855
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:34,039
hit hit your your dab rig with the torch

856
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:37,480
full

857
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:38,960
blast 5,000 degrees fam that ain't the

858
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:42,199
way to do it I'm going to teach y'all

859
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:44,398
today about cold starts if you don't

860
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:47,719
know what a cold start is it's pretty

861
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:50,398
simple it's dabbing a form of dabbing

862
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:52,759
that don't tort your lungs my guys let

863
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:56,239
me get this over here so you can see it

864
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:59,040
all right I put some tobacco oil in here

865
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:02,199
you know so like for a demonstration so

866
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:06,480
we wouldn't get in trouble

867
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:08,559
but oh man anyways this is I think they

868
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,000
call this a quartz bangers is what this

869
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:12,920
is I forget the little names of these

870
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,800
bro

871
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:17,000
but you tell I I'm not really a Dabber

872
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,640
like I said I don't know the names of

873
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
anything bro I just use it I don't have

874
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:25,879
nobody talk to in person about this [ __ ]

875
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,239
so really a cold start's pretty

876
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:32,800
simple all you doing

877
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:35,358
is warming up that tobacco juice wink

878
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:38,560
wink until it starts to smoke a little

879
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:40,119
bit or not smoke I should say vaporize a

880
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:44,960
little bit it'll start to bubble and

881
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:49,000
vaporize a little bit so turn your torch

882
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:51,679
on and hit it it might take a second or

883
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,679
two it's a little

884
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:58,639
cold well you watch it'll start the

885
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:58,639
bubble

886
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,639
you see the you might not be able to see

887
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:04,239
the smoke but you see the bubbles you

888
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:06,118
see them bubbles there you go you can

889
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:08,919
see the smoke pull it

890
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:11,039
off and then you hit it guys it's easy

891
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:13,240
as simple simple like that that's all

892
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:15,119
you got to do you can lift it up if you

893
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:18,519
want you lift your finger off the little

894
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:20,039
little rush hole whatever and that's it

895
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:22,199
put your little water some Kool-Aid

896
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:24,880
Mountain Dew whatever your preferences

897
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:26,118
and you save your lungs guys gals I know

898
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,760
some of the old school guys are like

899
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:30,400
what the what is this guy on talking

900
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,680

901
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,039

907
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:50,920
for Education today y'all I'll be honest

908
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:52,440
uh but I figure we go into a few maybe

909
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:55,599
one story I've dragged on a little bit

910
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:59,639
about the sulfur so we're going to maybe

911
00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:02,280
just do one story I guess so T so

912
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:04,358
tonight I figure we'll jump in we's see

913
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:06,000
which one am I gonna give y'all today

914
00:37:04,358 --> 00:37:08,279
we'll

915
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,599
do I think the running through the field

916
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:12,119
one's a good one I know people have

917
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,119
heard this one before but the the

918
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:17,000
viewers that aren't in the Discord

919
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:18,400
probably have not so we'll do that one

920
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,519
uh you know I dragged down a little bit

921
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,280
too long I had three stories planned but

922
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:25,239
we're just going to do one for

923
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:28,440
tonight and I used to live in a cabin in

924
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:30,838
Kentucky with my old lady and we kind of

925
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:33,800
lived out on a on Lane Road up a gravel

926
00:37:30,838 --> 00:37:36,480
road you know off a beaten Trail type of

927
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,359
thing which is often the case in

928
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,440
Kentucky that's where I like to be bro I

929
00:37:38,358 --> 00:37:43,199
like to be out out there in the woods or

930
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:45,039
on a farm just away from people

931
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:48,078
Obviously good them [ __ ] around with

932
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:48,079
pot and [ __ ] like

933
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:55,400
that

934
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:58,039
and had three tents rolling

935
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,800
bro just flipped

936
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:01,279
had some really cool genetics had some

937
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:04,560
stuff that a guy like me probably

938
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:06,119
shouldn't even really had uh you know

939
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:09,759
people you know how it is people give

940
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:12,200

941
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:14,560
community and give you some [ __ ] that

942
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:16,358
you probably shouldn't have well I'm

943
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:18,559
growing some of that kind of [ __ ]

944
00:38:16,358 --> 00:38:20,960
probably the to the time the best run

945
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:25,358
the most money I've sunk into a

946
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:26,599
run up until this point and uh I'm

947
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:29,480
chilling me and her are chilling One

948
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:32,400
Night in the middle like summer

949
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:37,000
bro

950
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,000
and I like the dog starts

951
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:42,480
barking it's like what the

952
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,039
[ __ ] so in the country when you got a

953
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,760
dog and a dog's barking especially live

954
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:48,318
in a middle of nowhere usually it's

955
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:51,000
coyotes or somebody's come up your drive

956
00:38:48,318 --> 00:38:52,920
or somebody's around or you know maybe

957
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,079
they see a deer or something but usually

958
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,079
you know somebody come up the

959
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:01,159
drive so I look down bro and I we're

960
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:04,199
purched up on a hill in this

961
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:08,078
cabin and at the bottom probably 4 or

962
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:11,000
500 yards down there's a creek a

963
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:12,560
bridge a mailbox in the main road and

964
