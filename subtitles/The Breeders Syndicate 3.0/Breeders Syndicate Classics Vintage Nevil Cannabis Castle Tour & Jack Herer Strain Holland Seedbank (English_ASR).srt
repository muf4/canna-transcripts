w

193
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:56,078
we used to do U

194
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:59,000
um uh Rock but you know you have to

195
00:16:56,078 --> 00:17:02,638
think uh ecologically as well

196
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:07,439
and uh in a year from today we'll have

197
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:09,798
uh a plan a medium based on hemp HS and

198
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:13,240
they've done some testing for us and um

199
00:17:09,798 --> 00:17:13,240
the first results look real

200
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,400
promising

201
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:42,359
small clean

202
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,799
houses uh we usually use this in the

203
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:47,319
summer but of course you can work with

204
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:50,440
the lights as much as we can we have two

205
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:52,918
different systems it's the light system

206
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:55,679
and then we have the blinding system we

207
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:58,038
can do five crops a year we do about

208
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:01,480
three because of the winter time and we

209
00:17:58,038 --> 00:18:04,519
don't need need actually the space

210
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:08,440
so also we have some Goose they come

211
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:10,240
here they fly on to our house and we'

212
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:14,200
fed them ham

213
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:17,400
seed how how do they do since then you

214
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:19,120
know they came three they about eight

215
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,759
now or something so they're very happy

216
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:21,759
and they want more

217
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:27,959
seeds this is a greenhouse with just

218
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:31,000
some cuttings and this is just again

219
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:33,440
mother PL some varieties and they will

220
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,839
be transported very soon

221
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:40,600
green what is interesting have a flow

222
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:44,279
system and it's um it

223
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:44,279
sprays on top of the

224
00:18:56,359 --> 00:19:03,240
plant spr water on the

225
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,640
to keep the humidity around 9 80 to

226
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:09,000
90% can't keep it on too long because

227
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:12,520
otherwise the water will hit the

228
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,319
bulbs I think it's already doing

229
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:17,200
that this is this part it's for for the

230
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:20,720
rest is not so interesting so let's go

231
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,720
back to the other side of the

232
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240

different varieties and look what they

239
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:11,440
did so it just flow testing quality and

240
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:11,440
different

241
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
