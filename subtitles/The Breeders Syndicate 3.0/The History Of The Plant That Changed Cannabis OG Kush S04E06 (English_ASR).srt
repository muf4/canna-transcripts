00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,320
bejazzling talk out of the way i did i

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,159
did i wanted to let them know that

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,480
he wanted that as a monologue where i

16
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:46,479
didn't have any chance to object or

17
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:48,558
change the subject so

18
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,078
uh that was all that was all it was

19
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:52,000
either technical difficulties or

20
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,480
intentional on matt's part yeah i don't

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,558
know what it was um but yeah no i mean i

22
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,799
was just telling about your new hobby

23
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:00,640
where you put your gems and you just get

24
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,479
nice adhesive and stick it real hard and

25
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,439
take pictures it's [ __ ] it's pretty

26
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,039
cool

27
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:06,560
i mean the people that can make a living

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,600
doing that

29
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,600
you know

30
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,919
i mean i got to make a living somehow

31
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:13,679
you know i would i you know i mean they

32
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,439
probably played they probably paid marky

33
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,000
mark a lot to pose on those calvin

34
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:20,319
kleins right yeah i would think so you

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,159
know so you would imagine so

36
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:24,319
yeah he's not packing heat like i am

37
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,320
though that's for sure no i mean i think

38
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:28,798
there was an unripe avocado involved or

39
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:32,239
something like that so it's all that's

40
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,640
that's for artists avocado

41
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:35,839
that's for artistic impressions

42
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,359
all right so what do we want to cover

43
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,240
today where do you want to start

44
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:41,239
uh well we we thought

45
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:44,879
we thought about putting out like a few

46
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:46,319
different things people were requesting

47
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,478
certain stuff so

48
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,000
uh we'll pay attention to comments if we

49
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,078
can and we'll take questions and then

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,719
people were asking

51
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,798
about like uh because it's it's like a

52
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,798
big name like what what's some of the

53
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,040
super dog which i'm kind of tied into

54
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,079
story is about and then what some of the

55
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,079
kush story is about yeah and it's like

56
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,000
not to be we probably won't get like

57
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:10,318
massively in-depth and some kind of step

58
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,159
by step because there's a lot of

59
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,159
uh i don't know what would you like a

60
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:16,159
lot of toes to step on and a lot of

61
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:19,039
people with money tied to their story

62
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:20,318
about og kush so yeah but so so there's

63
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:22,799
there's some legends and there's

64
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:24,159
competing tales and there's stories that

65
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,800
you kind of have to choose who to

66
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:30,000
believe again yeah um it's it's one of

67
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,760
the more complicated ones and uh

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
but we can talk about like how it

69
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,679
impacted california which is kind of

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,878
really where it got famous

71
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,200
yeah you know

72
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:40,159
and uh you know kush

73
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,039
uh

74
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:44,959
i wow that's an interesting one i did

75
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:47,120
know [ __ ] huh yeah

76
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,640
he has been uh he's been missing for a

77
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,560
super long time

78
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:51,919
uh and his family still pays like

79
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,959
there's like hundreds of thousands of

80
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:53,679
dollars

81
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,719
yeah

82
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,159
i mean it's

83
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:57,359
one of those it's one of those things

84
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:59,039
that uh

85
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,040
someone asked weeks ago to do some

86
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:03,199
missing person stories or whatever and

87
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:05,039
it's like yeah there's people have

88
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,158
families and friends and loved ones and

89
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,000
stuff and

90
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:10,158
all that so yeah

91
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,158
uh it's probably not the most like

92
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:14,000
the coolest thing to chat about you know

93
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:16,318
the sensitive nature of that i'm sure

94
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,680
yeah kids and stuff left behind well no

95
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:19,359
i mean it's just more like you know

96
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,719
people you know it's like someone goes

97
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,480
missing you got friends and family that

98
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:23,919
love yeah yeah for sure and they don't

99
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:26,158
have any and and the reason why there's

100
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:28,798
a huge reward is they don't have closure

101
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:30,399
yeah yeah it's pretty horrible you know

102
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,040
and so that kind of stuff that kind of

103
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,840
stuff happens up here yeah you know it's

104
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:38,479
isolated and so yeah i don't know but

105
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:42,158
did you catch the obsolete um posting

106
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:44,798
pictures of hlv infected seeds

107
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:46,798
you know i didn't but

108
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,400
uh you know i was actually strangely

109
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,920
enough if we could talk about that for a

110
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,439
second because

111
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,199
uh it was probably two nights ago or

112
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:56,560
something i had a pretty long chat with

113
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:57,759
uh uh csi yeah and we were talking about

114
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,000
a bunch of different things and one of

115
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,919
the things that's interesting is you

116
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,039
know as you know he's got a couple of

117
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:06,399
plants

118
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:07,919
uh that have dudding yeah right that are

119
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,599
just really old

120
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:11,839
and irreplaceable

121
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:13,598
yeah and so he keeps them but he keeps

122
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,079
them in a totally separate spot and all

123
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:19,120
that yeah right well anyway one of them

124
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,280
is uh one of them is calio yeah right

125
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,360
and so there's this rumor you know i

126
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:26,559
don't know if it's a rumor but there's a

127
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,759
there's uh tails going around that the

128
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,240
viroid uh duding viroid hl whatever the

129
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,879
[ __ ] you call it hplv or whatever yeah

130
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,800
um past not only does it stay alive in

131
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:38,319
plants but it passes on to a certain

132
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,800
percentage of seed

133
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,560
yeah it's i think the the number is

134
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,960
from the hops people it was eight

135
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,079
percent of seeds it can be passed to but

136
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:47,519
that doesn't necessarily people

137
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:48,800
understand is that doesn't necessarily

138
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:50,879
mean that eight percent of your seeds

139
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,840
that you pop are gonna absolutely show

140
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,879
it i mean

141
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,319
that it gives it eight percent chance

142
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:58,319
and it could be eight percent of the

143
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:00,240
seeds you didn't pop that you had you

144
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:01,038
know oh yeah i mean the chances is like

145
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,840
so

146
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:06,000
over a huge number of seeds you're you

147
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:08,478
know all things being equal your seeds

148
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,918
somewhere between like 50 50 male female

149
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:12,560
or 16 40

150
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:15,439
right over over like a large lot like on

151
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,079
a big average but i mean i've popped

152
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:21,279
like 26 seeds two packs of like mangoes

153
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:23,198
haze and got three girls yeah

154
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:26,159
yeah i have the same same stuff where

155
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,840
you get like zero females all males yeah

156
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,240
or vice versa you know the law of

157
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:32,719
averages on like a very small amount is

158
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,199
not that great but i will say the point

159
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,759
before i get too too distracted is

160
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,639
he grew out some of those hybrids

161
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,120
yeah

162
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,280
uh and he didn't see any he didn't he

163
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,840
didn't find any evidence of it yet

164
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:47,519
yes that's correct so i don't know i

165
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,439
don't know that

166
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:51,519
that's i don't want to say true but i

167
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,038
don't know how proven that is yeah i

168
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:54,879
don't know how proven that that eight

169
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:56,879
percent is and is that just hops is it

170
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:59,360
not necessarily cannabis which is a hops

171
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,519
you know relation um

172
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,000
there's not enough science on it yet on

173
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:06,478
uh as it relates to just cannabis

174
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,079
yeah no one no one looks cool smoking

175
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:09,120
their vape so i try to hide it sometimes

176
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:11,038
sorry guys

177
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,800
yeah no no one looks cool smoking a

178
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:16,639
[ __ ] it is it is interesting um because

179
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,400
you know there's an aspect

180
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,600
him and i were also chatting about which

181
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:21,120
is like

182
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,160
there was an era where you didn't really

183
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,399
worry about uh disease or bugs too much

184
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,080
right powdery mildew was unheard of

185
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,799
there was no dudding there was anything

186
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:32,399
like that and there was this thing where

187
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,240
most people either

188
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,638
did their own clones

189
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,199
yeah or only supplied their small little

190
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,120
tiny group of friends yeah right and so

191
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,800
a lot of times diseases or issues or

192
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,038
something like that were fairly

193
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,439
localized and didn't really you never

194
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:50,719
really heard about them to be honest

195
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:52,959
and then in like the 215 era uh when

196
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,000
people when lots of clubs started

197
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:57,918
selling racks of cuttings for like uh

198
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,160
for profit yeah

199
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:01,598
a lot of people stopped running their

200
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,520
own veggies

201
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:05,360
stopped the cake taking care of their

202
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:07,038
own mother stock and their own clones

203
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,439
and everything like that yeah and just

204
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:10,800
decided [ __ ] that power in space i'm

205
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:12,079
just gonna buy

206
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,560
clones

207
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:17,680
yeah for my next rip from you know my

208
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,879
friend at this shop yeah

209
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,840
smart cart

210
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,000
yeah

211
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,119
yeah and don't you know and and certain

212
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,360
companies

213
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,319
you know and so that so in a way it's

214
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,960
like

215
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,280
those diseases made their way to like

216
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:32,879
certain like nurseries and clearing

217
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:34,159
houses that were supplying a lot of

218
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:35,598
clubs

219
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,199
yeah and they spread it all over and

220
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:38,959
they spread it to thousands of different

221
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,560
gardens yeah

222
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,680
and so then it kind of became this thing

223
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,680
where now

224
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,918
you see it on ig and all this there's

225
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,879
advertisements for viroid tests like

226
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:48,240
crazy

227
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,000
yeah people are taking all kinds of

228
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,960
precautions we've had buddies that it

229
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,598
came in

230
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:54,719
and uh ripped through their rooms

231
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,560
um

232
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,720
there seems to be different different

233
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,280
strengths and different ones

234
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,960
uh most people don't understand uh what

235
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:05,038
a viroid even is

236
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:07,359
i think we've all everyone in our crew

237
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:09,199
has at least seen one dud over time to

238
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,360
be able to experience what that was and

239
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,280
now we all kind of [ __ ] know it sucks

240
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,240
yeah but i mean there was even a thing

241
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:18,000
where i was listening to a different and

242
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,759
an excerpt from a different podcast and

243
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,519
they were interviewing someone who

244
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,800
uh scientifically studied it right and

245
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:23,918
they were talking about the different

246
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,079
methods

247
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:28,079
um because it's a it's a not even a

248
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:31,439
virus it's a viroid it's like little

249
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:33,199
bits of rna or whatever yeah uh and it's

250
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:35,440
like for the most part it's like it's

251
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,519
totally fine and 99

252
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,360
isopropyl yeah

253
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,158
it's it doesn't kill it

254
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,599
yeah uh you know we've been i some a

255
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:45,759
couple good friends of ours they had

256
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,120
some tech at their nurseries where they

257
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,360
had like the

258
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,399
the propane canister and the torch that

259
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,480
attaches to it yeah and they would torch

260
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:57,278
their their you know their equipment

261
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,159
plant to plant yep that doesn't kill it

262
00:08:57,278 --> 00:08:59,278
no

263
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:01,600
you know

264
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:03,600
i mean root to like like what i saw was

265
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,200
root uh like if you have a tray of

266
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,959
clones and you've taken all these

267
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,879
different strains some are more

268
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:11,039
susceptible to catching it by the roots

269
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:12,799
in the water or it's the [ __ ] razor

270
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:15,838
blade or whatever you're doing it

271
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:17,439
spreads pretty [ __ ] bad

272
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,720
and so and so then there's an aspect

273
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,519
where it's like basically what they

274
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,320
found is that like you know 10 or 15

275
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,759
bleach for 10 minutes does kill it

276
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,519
really yeah

277
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:31,519
but like uh uh h2o2 hydrogen peroxide

278
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,440
the strong [ __ ] yeah that doesn't kill

279
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,480
it alcohol doesn't kill it fire doesn't

280
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,080
kill it

281
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,000
uh there's something about the chemical

282
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,800
composition of uh

283
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,919
of bleach i wonder if the vine oxide

284
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:44,559
works

285
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:47,278
there's this other stuff uh yeah there's

286
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:48,879
a few other things that that cause that

287
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:50,799
kill it but some of those things are

288
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,159
like really harsh on tools

289
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,759
yeah or you

290
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:55,838
you know so

291
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:58,559
uh but then the interesting thing about

292
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:01,200
bleach is if you buy like store bleach

293
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:04,078
uh yeah uh uh our buddies skunk just

294
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,320
said vicrons um if you buy if you buy

295
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:08,879
like uh clothing bleach

296
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,440
like sodium hypochloride that stuff only

297
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:13,679
stays good once you mix it for like i

298
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,640
don't know five to eight hours yeah and

299
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:17,599
then if it gets too dirty it goes inert

300
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:19,519
yeah

301
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,440
i remember jungle boys jungle boys was

302
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,839
saying they were using i don't want to

303
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,320
get it wrong but it was um something

304
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,959
like sanitate or oxidate yeah it was

305
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,720
like one from that company zerathol or i

306
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:33,199
remember yeah zero tall i remember i

307
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,000
spilled that [ __ ] pure on my [ __ ] leg

308
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,360
once oh [ __ ] yeah

309
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,240
i mean

310
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,240
steroids are tough yeah um but you know

311
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,240
for people now that we've gone this far

312
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,480
into it or whatever but

313
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,480
if you want to use a bleach solution

314
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,720
that stays a lot more lasting and

315
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,200
doesn't get [ __ ] up super fast like uh

316
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,959
your laundry bleach yeah uh get bleach

317
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,040
for pools

318
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:59,119
uh because that way that's calcium

319
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:01,679
hypochlorite

320
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,919
right and calcium hypochlorite is you

321
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:05,679
know pools are dirty you know they get

322
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:07,278
[ __ ] in them and stuff like that like as

323
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:09,759
far as you know dirt and leaves and

324
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:12,559
whatnot so it doesn't go inert the same

325
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:14,319
way sodium hypochlorite does yeah

326
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:15,599
but now people i mean i go i go to the

327
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,160
store and i buy

328
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,519
uh you know like a hundred pack of of

329
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:22,480
blades

330
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,480
yeah and i just i i just add you know

331
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,800
yep every plant gets a new every plant

332
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,320
gets a new blade yeah it's a good habit

333
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:31,919
to make and you know you uh yeah and so

334
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,480
there's an act there's aspect to it

335
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:36,639
where it's like so what sucks is that

336
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,159
you know you go somewhere and you see

337
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:39,278
some really cool tech that somebody's

338
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:42,000
doing and you're like oh i'm gonna

339
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:43,278
incorporate that into my own thing and

340
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,600
then you find out that it actually

341
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:47,519
doesn't work yeah

342
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,079
yeah yeah i tried with i tried with the

343
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,320
sanitate and oxidate on the

344
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:53,919
four-way trinity cut because both of

345
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,440
those have the hlb

346
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:59,278
and

347
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,279
not no dice hey natto

348
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,959
yes

349
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:07,039
[Laughter]

350
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:10,039
i just want to wish you a happy pride

351
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,039
indeed

352
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,399
before i lose it because it'll go off my

353
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,639
screen every plant gets its own rooting

354
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,360
hormone yeah uh taking all the

355
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:22,399
precautions to actually like separate

356
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,879
and not cross contaminate um it's a pain

357
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,078
in the ass yeah it is and it's basically

358
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:27,838
like dipping in

359
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,599
you having a separate like thing a

360
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,279
clonex for every [ __ ] thing or

361
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,720
whatever yeah and then on top of that

362
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:34,320
then you're then you got to use rock

363
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,560
wool or you got to use the earth plugs

364
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,639
or something like an easy cloner yeah

365
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:40,479
it's like that's everywhere yeah that's

366
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,879
if you're done at that yeah that's like

367
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,759
making out with people with the flu yeah

368
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,159
you know

369
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:47,919
and uh you know and and so it's hard

370
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:50,719
because there's like real science and

371
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:52,719
bro science yes and for a long time we

372
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,959
only had bro science because real

373
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,959
science couldn't touch wheat i i can't

374
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:59,838
tell you how long i have heard that

375
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:02,559
powdery mildew plastic passes to

376
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,160
seedlings like that's bro science it's

377
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:05,679
been bro science for a long time so when

378
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:07,679
i first heard about the hlv thing i was

379
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:08,879
very skeptical you know because i'd seen

380
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:11,199
a lot of people breed with duds over the

381
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,519
years and never seen the does pop up in

382
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,278
seed porn but apparently the hops people

383
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,278
do say it happens so

384
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:19,600
yeah and i mean that that obviously

385
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:21,360
still has to be checked and and proven

386
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,278
over time and that's how science is

387
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,240
right is it like it's the best

388
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:28,000
information you have and and you know

389
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,079
we'll we'll see i don't know where that

390
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,679
originates from yeah i know that's

391
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:33,919
stupidity i think

392
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:36,319
you know

393
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:37,759
and uh well you know it

394
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,320
people to have to understand the life

395
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:43,198
cycle of things and like a viroid isn't

396
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,320
even a virus it's like little bits of

397
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:46,559
rna

398
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,399
yeah and so to have something so small

399
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,399
like that be able to just [ __ ] us up so

400
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,759
hard the skunk va knows i don't even

401
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,759
know what trans laminar means and i

402
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:56,078
probably should but i think that sounds

403
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:58,000
correct so translaminer

404
00:13:56,078 --> 00:14:00,000
is there's two things right there's

405
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,759
vascular where it's moving through your

406
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,278
vascular system yeah yeah and then

407
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:06,480
there's trans laminar which is

408
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:09,120
essentially like uh the the leaf surface

409
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,800
okay yeah that means right so in some

410
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,399
for for instance like to give you an

411
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:13,599
example of you could use a certain kind

412
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,000
of poison

413
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,600
yeah and it would be a contact killer or

414
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,480
maybe it would form a relationship and

415
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,560
be trans laminar and go on the leaf okay

416
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,159
and or not systemic

417
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:25,838
that could be systemic though it could

418
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:28,078
it could have systemic trans laminar

419
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,600
then you can have systemic vascular i

420
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:30,479
know i know a systemic vascular but i

421
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,720
never heard

422
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,920
i wouldn't think systemic would be just

423
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,000
leaf touching but i guess that makes

424
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:37,360
sense yeah you know well i mean it just

425
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,198
depends there's people humans have

426
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,680
figured out all kinds of different [ __ ]

427
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:43,198
yeah you know um but he's right in the

428
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:44,638
sense that pm is

429
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:48,000
you know it's like p.m the hardest thing

430
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:50,480
is to break its life cycle yeah

431
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,360
you know um and that's what people don't

432
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,360
do

433
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,519
yeah you know they mostly like break its

434
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,199
life cycle but then it like

435
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,639
you know i don't know i mean when you

436
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:00,000
live in mendo and you're surrounded by

437
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,000
vineyards and everything else and

438
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,879
everybody grows uh you know we got a

439
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,480
crash course 20 years ago in pm

440
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:08,078
yeah you know i i wanted to make some

441
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,199
eagle 20 jokes but it's about you can't

442
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:10,638
even joke about that [ __ ] anymore

443
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:13,439
because people take that [ __ ] soon yeah

444
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,360
they said have it is a uh avid is we

445
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,079
used to call avid the death

446
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:21,519
uh avid is a trans laminar yeah uh

447
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:24,159
systemic or whatever um and you know 20

448
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,120
25 years ago someone is systemic

449
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,120
yeah

450
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,720
because i last i i do remember that

451
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,799
spider mites are not susceptible to

452
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,120
things that are systemic because of how

453
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:34,958
deep they go into the leaf

454
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,198
no they're susceptible

455
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:39,518
i mean the issue the issue becomes

456
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:40,639
really with spider mites specifically

457
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,120
is that

458
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,759
20 25 30 years ago there was there's a

459
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,198
bunch of poisons for spider mites uh

460
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,360
that are you know all from pretty

461
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:50,879
natural to pretty toxic that worked

462
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,159
really well

463
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:55,679
and you know people overuse these toxins

464
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:57,600
over and over and over again and would

465
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:59,198
dip their clones in it every time and

466
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,879
would just yeah they were trying to take

467
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:03,198
precautions

468
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:04,879
but what they bred was super mites yeah

469
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:06,559
i was pretty sure avid wasn't systemic

470
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:08,480
yeah it's one of the ones it's not um

471
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:10,078
just because it's not it's not systemic

472
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,519
doesn't work necessarily with spider

473
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:13,278
mites you don't need systemic so they

474
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,120
don't go that far so maybe people are

475
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:17,679
there's there's vascular systemic and

476
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,519
there's trans laminar

477
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:20,799
right and so

478
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,959
like when you think about it like if

479
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:24,879
something's a contact killer it means

480
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:27,758
that the bug has to come into contact to

481
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:31,360
kill it yeah right if there's something

482
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:33,919
that's trans laminar and like and uh um

483
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:37,120
and and persists within the leaf for a

484
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:39,198
period of time it'll kill the bug for

485
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,278
that length of time that it persists but

486
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:42,559
that's not necessarily systemic if it

487
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:44,159
stays in the plant that's not a

488
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:45,518
definition of systemic

489
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:47,600
well i mean it's also one of those

490
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,278
things though that it's systemic in the

491
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,199
sense that

492
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:52,559
your plant will test positive for it for

493
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:54,639
a long time

494
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:56,239
yeah yeah but it i think there's

495
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,759
something specific about it not being

496
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,000
systemic like

497
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,759
what it what it actually is avid uh yeah

498
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,679
i mean someone's amachloropid which is

499
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,400
the people used for root aphids or

500
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:06,480
whatever

501
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,720
that stuff you can test like that stuff

502
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,640
will test dirty one to two years later

503
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,000
yeah that's crazy [ __ ] so that's kind of

504
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,160
maybe i mean maybe i'm getting it wrong

505
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,759
what i consider to be systemic yeah is

506
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,439
that if you apply it

507
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:18,959
and then weeks or months later you can

508
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,959
still test for it

509
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,959
yeah it's around

510
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,600
it's in the plant system somehow whether

511
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,959
that's the leaf system or the the you

512
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:29,279
know and maybe we can look it up and

513
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,600
maybe i'm totally [ __ ] yeah i don't

514
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,279
know it's always possible but that's

515
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:35,759
kind of how i that's kind of how i view

516
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:37,839
things is like things that persist yeah

517
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:40,319
i don't i have no clue to be honest with

518
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:42,079
you i just remember that that the the

519
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:43,519
old saying that systemic stuff doesn't

520
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:44,879
work on mites because they don't go deep

521
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:46,798
enough into the leaf yeah someone just

522
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,160
asked if you spray avid and veg it will

523
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:50,798
absolutely

524
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,798
um it will absolutely persist for some

525
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:54,558
time yeah and there you have it in 90

526
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:56,558
days i should say i should say this

527
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:58,240
thing there used to be this thing where

528
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:00,399
not to call anybody out or anything like

529
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,079
that but there was a lot of people that

530
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,960
supplied clubs

531
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:07,599
that knew exactly how many weeks you had

532
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,759
to go not spraying it to test totally

533
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:11,918
clean at the club oh yeah

534
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:13,759
and so they would do this thing where

535
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,120
like this gentleman just just asked can

536
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,400
you spray it and veg they would spray

537
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:17,279
the [ __ ] in veg

538
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,038
yeah

539
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:20,558
and veg for x amount of weeks and then

540
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:22,640
bloom for x amount of weeks and then

541
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:24,480
know that it would be clean

542
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,200
and then in order to in order to get

543
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:30,160
around that yeah uh the legal testing it

544
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,558
went from ppm to ppb

545
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,880
oh oh yeah that's right from parts per

546
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:37,599
million to parts per billion

547
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,760
and once it went to parts per billion it

548
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:41,759
[ __ ] every all those people's math and

549
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:43,279
all the rates they were using it and

550
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:44,798
everybody was hiding using it and

551
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:47,440
getting away with it

552
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:48,720
um you know and so now what's happened

553
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,200
is is that

554
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,960
a lot of these mites have survived

555
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,720
decades of people

556
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,600
spraying them with all kinds of funky

557
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,200
[ __ ] yeah yeah and so there are a lot

558
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:01,038
they're a lot stronger and they're a lot

559
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,120
more resistant in california than your

560
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:05,359
average might would be in the wild that

561
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:07,119
[ __ ] in san diego back in the day dude

562
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:09,119
they would drink out of it they'd take a

563
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:11,119
shot and say [ __ ] you you know like they

564
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:11,918
were they're brutal yeah i mean there's

565
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:14,000
hair

566
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,440
there's a it's it's not

567
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,839
you know and then everything gets

568
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,519
overused and just like anything else if

569
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:21,359
you don't actually eliminate the problem

570
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:22,639
if you just knock the problem down to

571
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:24,479
low levels

572
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,080
and you keep doing that over and over

573
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,679
and over again

574
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:29,199
eventually the ones that survive are

575
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,200
going to be better at resisting whatever

576
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:35,120
you're using yeah and it could be

577
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:38,880
totally organic it could be evil like uh

578
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:40,399
avid or forbid or kantos or

579
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,280
you know there's those aren't evil i

580
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,280
don't like being sued

581
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:46,558
they uh

582
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,798
just in the sense of you know i mean

583
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:52,240
everything has its place i suppose but

584
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:53,679
yeah uh and i don't want to be today

585
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,599
well you know i mean all that stuff

586
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,038
comes from the only reason why that [ __ ]

587
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:58,319
exists is because it's all over your

588
00:19:57,038 --> 00:19:59,839
[ __ ] food

589
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:01,439
yeah yep

590
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:02,399
you know it doesn't exist for weed

591
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,558
people

592
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,519
all those all those crazy chemicals and

593
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:09,599
stuff eagle 20 and all that stuff it all

594
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:12,879
exists because it gets used all the time

595
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:15,199
in commercial food production yeah

596
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,520
that's why you could even buy it i

597
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,360
remember back in the day the big mix and

598
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:21,918
in our old cruise i shouldn't even admit

599
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:22,798
this but it was a long time ago before

600
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,240
before

601
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:25,918
you know a lot of the information was

602
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,519
available even though you could smell it

603
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,559
you could smell the toxicity but it was

604
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:32,798
a phyton 27 and

605
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:34,798
spectrocyte immunox

606
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,639
for some reason seemed to just knock pm

607
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:38,798
out but it would also murder your

608
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,240
[ __ ] plants you know yeah emunox is

609
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:42,960
kind of like a derivative it's like

610
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,919
another brand name for eagle 20. yep you

611
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,480
know

612
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,799
and uh yeah the eagle 20 gets sprayed

613
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,279
for grapes uh avid a lot of these things

614
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:53,519
are designed for ornamentals too yeah

615
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:56,240
yep you know uh you know points that

616
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:58,240
like the like the [ __ ] pgr [ __ ]

617
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,519
yeah right where everybody you know for

618
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,880
a while where if you were super

619
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:02,158
unethical and you wanted to get two or

620
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,799
three pounds of light and you didn't

621
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,000
care about quality you would pgr your

622
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:07,798
weed and it was

623
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,159
it had it had a bunch of names right

624
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:11,519
phosphoload or

625
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,280
you know there was there was a number of

626
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:14,639
companies that would all hide what it

627
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:16,319
actually was

628
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,759
and it's the same [ __ ] that makes like

629
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:19,678
when you walk into a grocery store

630
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:21,839
around christmas and all the poinsettias

631
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,440
are the same [ __ ] height to the inch

632
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:24,720
yeah that's because they got treated

633
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,120
with a pgr

634
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,839
yeah i mean i think i think the term pgr

635
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:32,079
has been demonized just like uh gmo or

636
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:34,639
anything like that whether it is sure

637
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:36,558
yeah i mean there are great pgrs and i

638
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,600
see people saying [ __ ] pgs you don't

639
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:39,200
even know what you're talking about

640
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:42,319
because there are actually pgrs that we

641
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,480
all use that are decent i will say

642
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:46,480
that uh a lot of the companies would

643
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,440
hide the the

644
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,360
[ __ ] uh what was on the label oh for

645
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,880
sure right sure and then eventually they

646
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:54,879
they got caught onto and they all got

647
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,320
pulled off the shelf or whatever

648
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,240
and uh

649
00:21:56,319 --> 00:22:00,558
sunlight supply came out with one that

650
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,720
they called doctor nodes

651
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:05,678
and it was fully vetted through all the

652
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:08,079
all the various agencies right yep so

653
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,840
i uh my my buddy had a shop and they got

654
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:12,960
all these samples and one of the samples

655
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:14,558
was this bottle of dr notes right

656
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,558
and i'm looking at it and it was a

657
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:17,918
bottle and it came in its own plastic

658
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:19,359
sheath that you kind of like almost like

659
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,000
a medicine thing that you had to rip

660
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:24,399
open and do that right yeah and one of

661
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,359
its warnings was pregnant women should

662
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,720
not touch the bottle

663
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:29,918
right

664
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,759
that's safe

665
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,200
that's pretty heavy but like on the same

666
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:36,480
on the same tip

667
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,279
uh a natural pgr is kelp

668
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,279
yeah

669
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:40,798
you apply too strong to kelp you'll plan

670
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:42,158
to do some weird [ __ ]

671
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:44,639
yeah so you're right in the sense that

672
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,159
it's just a term that exists yeah it's

673
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,600
but most

674
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:50,960
what most people are thinking of when

675
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:53,199
they think of pgrs and weed is like

676
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,038
exactly like possible and like the name

677
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,558
is this long and it's methyl ethyl and

678
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:58,000
it has a bunch of parentheses and

679
00:22:56,558 --> 00:22:59,839
hyphens

680
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,679
yeah yeah it's it's it's all it's all

681
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:03,678
kinds of bad [ __ ]

682
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,840
you know i think it's the other one

683
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,559
paccolo butanol

684
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:11,119
terrible yeah uh and in addition to in

685
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:13,519
addition to um making your weeds super

686
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:14,399
dense uh bushmasters yeah that's the

687
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:16,639
other one

688
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:20,640
it [ __ ] with your crystal content and

689
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:22,320
uh major weed uh b grade yeah definitely

690
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,000
and there's a lot of companies and this

691
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:24,960
is even [ __ ] up even if you weren't

692
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,279
evil

693
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,519
uh and use the [ __ ] sorry if you used it

694
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:31,359
and i just called you evil but

695
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:32,720
they didn't put it on the label on lots

696
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:34,240
of things and then there's other

697
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,319
companies that would put it into like

698
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,159
bud blasters and things like that and

699
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:41,439
they would just put small amounts for

700
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:43,360
that extra oomph yep

701
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,440
yep it's all part of that [ __ ]

702
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:48,000
nutrient game which yeah i mean after

703
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,080
making the spray um and and learning

704
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,880
about different nutrients how they're

705
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:55,278
sold how you get regulated how you get

706
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,880
you know omri listed all that stuff it's

707
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:59,759
just like to me like it was like

708
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,600
learning about the the vitamin

709
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:02,879
like like

710
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:04,798
what do they call it like when you go to

711
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,960
those muscle stores or whatever you can

712
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:08,798
buy all their supplements supplements

713
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,278
it's like stuff i'm sorry i have to i

714
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:13,839
have to interject too yeah uh you know

715
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:15,440
someone's couples couple people said uh

716
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:17,278
gravity and [ __ ] like that which is

717
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,679
definitely one of the things and then

718
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:22,720
someone was like yes it's illegal to not

719
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,000
have everything on the label yes

720
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,759
and you'll be shocked to know that

721
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,278
people making products for cannabis

722
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:29,679
people were willing to do something

723
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:29,679
illegal

724
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:34,639
and that not all of them had the highest

725
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,400
of ethical standards yeah but they got

726
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,480
that purple max though i mean that

727
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,000
gravity [ __ ] or whatever i i had a

728
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,440
friend uh

729
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,359
who literally was like an early

730
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,320
proponent of you know you'd probably

731
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:48,879
call living soil today yeah i was super

732
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:50,639
anal about inputs and all this different

733
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,760
stuff and so he comes in and he buys

734
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,799
some of that

735
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:55,919
uh and all it says on the label is kelp

736
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:58,240
yeah

737
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,759
but it had the full pack low in it i'm

738
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,839
sure and so he goes out there and he

739
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:03,440
makes a whole resi and he waters all his

740
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:05,678
beds

741
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,600
and he had those beds for like five six

742
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,798
years and had been developing them every

743
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:10,879
year and then he went and sprayed him

744
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:12,319
with paclo because it wasn't on the

745
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,960
it wasn't on the label he thought it was

746
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:17,200
killed and nobody knew to tell him

747
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,240
yeah you know

748
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,240
so

749
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,839
um yeah that some of that stuff was

750
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,000
insidious they were trying to sell you a

751
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:24,798
product that you'd buy again

752
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,960
yeah

753
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:28,319
yeah i mean and it's just like i look at

754
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,400
it like drug dealers who press their

755
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:31,839
pills and like you know double the the

756
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,038
strength of their xanax of course people

757
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:34,319
are going to go back to that [ __ ]

758
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:36,558
dude if they want to get all super

759
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:38,480
[ __ ] up and die so i mean there's even

760
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:39,359
there's even pesticides that have gotten

761
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,640
caught

762
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:42,879
right that have gotten pulled from the

763
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,720
shelves in california uh because they

764
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,120
listed you know clove oil and this and

765
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,038
that whatever to kill bugs and then they

766
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:51,359
test it and it's got avid it's got

767
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:53,440
abimectin in there yeah yeah it's got

768
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:54,558
it's got low amounts of something that

769
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,519
really works

770
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:57,278
yeah

771
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:59,200
you know and then they just figure is

772
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:01,278
someone actually going to analyze my

773
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,200
secret sauce

774
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:04,880
probably especially people do

775
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,400
you know eventually people do i mean

776
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,278
there was a there's there's been times

777
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,038
where

778
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:11,359
like uh weights and measures has come

779
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:13,839
into growth stores yeah i bet

780
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:16,240
and by law you know if it says it's 40

781
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:17,839
ounces it better be 40 ounces if it says

782
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,640
it's x amount of pounds it better be

783
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:20,798
that

784
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,159
yeah and they'll pull all their [ __ ] off

785
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:24,400
the shelves

786
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,520
oh yeah because it doesn't weigh right

787
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,679
yeah i think people are asking about

788
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:30,879
powers i know that's a um

789
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:33,440
ortho solicitor or monosolicit um

790
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,039
acid it's it's it's uh it's a

791
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,519
silic basically what it is is it's

792
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:40,079
silica in a form that's a lot more

793
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:41,119
absorbable for the plant yeah there's a

794
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:43,199
lot of [ __ ]

795
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:45,599
there's a lot of silica out there that

796
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,679
is not that easily plant absorbable yeah

797
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:50,480
it's not available for cannabis unless

798
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,798
you reuse your soil for you yeah and so

799
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,480
and so as a result uh

800
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:55,519
there's there's a number of cutting edge

801
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,159
has one

802
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:59,519
um power c is one there's a bunch of

803
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,919
them that put it basically in a

804
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:03,839
different in a different suspension yeah

805
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,159
lack of a better way to put it uh that

806
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:07,599
makes it uh that makes silicoic acid

807
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,200
that makes it a little bit easier for

808
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:10,158
the roots and the plant to actually

809
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,080
uptake

810
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,480
yeah that's one of the few products like

811
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:17,599
that that i really actually visually can

812
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,440
see change within 24 hours of using it i

813
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:22,240
i was a big fan of it

814
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,080
it's expensive as [ __ ] but yeah people

815
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,919
are talking about and there's enzyme

816
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:27,199
products on the market a lot longer

817
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,000
right now too

818
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,159
uh enzyme enzyme products are uh

819
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,440
um i use them a bunch actually there's

820
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:36,960
nukem and and dr zimes and all these and

821
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,519
they're all basically this they're

822
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:42,480
enzymes that [ __ ] with the the

823
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:44,720
ecoskeleton of the pl of the bug

824
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,558
and there's citric acid in there yeah

825
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,159
right and they're really gentle and a

826
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:51,278
lot of them are organic and they test

827
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:53,520
clean and they absolutely annihilate

828
00:27:51,278 --> 00:27:54,798
uh powdery mildew

829
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:55,918
and they do a pretty good job killing

830
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:58,079
mites too

831
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,799
yeah i'm still i'm still a big proponent

832
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:03,439
now because of you of the um

833
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:05,278
what's that [ __ ] called the micro

834
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,159
sulfur micronized sulfur micronized

835
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:09,919
sulfur yeah yeah that's a trophy

836
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,278
i mean micronized sulfur if you don't

837
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,520
use oils

838
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:14,880
yeah and you spray micronized sulfur i

839
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:17,440
learned that

840
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:20,960
you'll never uh you'll never have russet

841
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,880
mites uh or pm in your veg ever yeah

842
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,880
it's it was beautiful except when i used

843
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,840
them both together in the same bottle

844
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,278
like a absolute fool and burped up every

845
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:31,199
plant that i had

846
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:33,278
and well yeah they'll burn hairs though

847
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,960
that's why i said in veg yeah yeah for

848
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:38,240
sure you know you'll definitely uh

849
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,440
sulfur is a really uh distinctive aroma

850
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,839
and you definitely don't want to be

851
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,919
using sulfur for any reason much past

852
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:45,439
the first week of flight yeah once you

853
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:47,919
start saying to me

854
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,159
uh it's it's not a good idea but in veg

855
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:52,480
when it's just all sticks and stems

856
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:56,159
you know and and leaves it's organic

857
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:58,558
it's safe it's you know yeah

858
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,000
it uh it works really well

859
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:02,480
um i

860
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,200
totally got away from oils simply

861
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,919
because i like sulfur in the rotation as

862
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,919
a safety measure in the veg and plants

863
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,679
tend to like it a lot and i don't so i

864
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:14,159
don't use oils at all

865
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,519
because god help you if you got russets

866
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,399
or something like that

867
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:18,558
um

868
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:20,079
you know it'll it'll annihilate those

869
00:29:18,558 --> 00:29:22,079
yeah it's i think it's safe to use

870
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:23,519
indoor but i don't like put on masks

871
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:26,960
when i spray either so what the [ __ ] do

872
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:29,278
i know it is safe to use indoor um but i

873
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,519
put i would put on masks

874
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:32,880
you know yeah even smart people

875
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,158
there's a lot of stuff quote-unquote

876
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,960
that's safe

877
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:39,760
um that i might only put on like a

878
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,240
uh like a a snowboarding shell or

879
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:44,960
something to spray but i have a full

880
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,278
face mask with a visor and the whole bit

881
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,640
right yeah because it might be safe for

882
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:49,919
your plants but that doesn't mean your

883
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,520
lungs want it

884
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,799
yeah no i don't want to breathe in

885
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:54,319
wettables so i don't want to breathe in

886
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:56,720
anything

887
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:58,398
like on that level you know so i always

888
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,919
wear a mat i don't want in my eyes

889
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:01,119
either

890
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,559
yeah it's probably not good it's

891
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:05,439
probably why i'm [ __ ] blind to be

892
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:07,038
honest with you yeah i mean uh you know

893
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,480
it's uh

894
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:12,640
it i just i you know did i always do

895
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,679
that no as i got older

896
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,278
yes

897
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,240
yes as i've gotten older i've tried to

898
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:19,919
to be more i have a real nice i don't

899
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,240
know it's a two or three hundred dollar

900
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:25,360
full face mask or whatnot and even for

901
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:27,200
the most basic stuff i put it on

902
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:28,719
someone said they started using sulfur

903
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,200
because that guy who said so for us how

904
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,120
to get our gas turbs

905
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,600
i mean it'll definitely make your weed

906
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:37,599
smell and taste like a tire fire

907
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:39,278
yeah i mean if you use it wrong yeah if

908
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:41,519
you feed it

909
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:43,119
to the roots it does you know increase

910
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:45,759
terpenes whatever it has it's not going

911
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:48,158
to change somebody said yeah nukem nukem

912
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:49,599
and sulfur or nukem and dr zymes and

913
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,880
sulfur or whatever you can use them back

914
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:52,480
to back

915
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,080
there's not oil in there so you could

916
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,360
use it i've done it a bunch it's

917
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:57,199
completely safe

918
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:59,519
the only thing something happens when

919
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,519
you combine oil and sulfur it changes

920
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:04,880
the ph on the plant and it burns them to

921
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,679
[ __ ] yeah it murders them so

922
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,640
do you

923
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:11,278
uh sulfur is sulfur is very

924
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,200
uh very very safe

925
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:15,440
as long as now don't mix it with oil i

926
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,640
never usually do lines of um pure rocks

927
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,558
or wait i should say if it's over 90

928
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:23,840
degrees sulfur can really hurt your

929
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:25,038
plants yeah for sure so uh don't if you

930
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:27,678
know uh

931
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:30,640
we me me and uh our buddy and i we uh

932
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:32,480
one of the fires in 2019 i think it was

933
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,320
2018 maybe

934
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,360
uh we had sprayed sulfur the night

935
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:38,000
before

936
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:39,839
and then the next day one of the biggest

937
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,919
fires in california history started a

938
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:43,359
couple hills over from us

939
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,399
and the first thing it did was burn out

940
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:46,398
a bunch of power poles

941
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:50,639
it was 108 degrees

942
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,399
and the lighting went out but sort of

943
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,000
the air conditioning and all the fans

944
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:55,518
and everything we had because the power

945
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,919
poles bent and fell

946
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,839
yeah and it got real hot and we lost a

947
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,720
bunch of

948
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:03,599
moms um to sulfur yeah from the day

949
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,440
before

950
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:08,319
that's uh and there's a lot of things

951
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,840
that sucked about that fire but yeah i

952
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:12,798
mean we didn't have power at that spot

953
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:12,798
for almost two weeks

954
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,960
you know and it was june and you have a

955
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:20,798
debt and i mean there was problems there

956
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:22,159
was issues you know yeah um so

957
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:24,960
but yeah i mean

958
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:26,320
uh people uh trying to read and talk or

959
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,519
whatever but

960
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:29,278
i didn't even think we actually

961
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:31,759
bullshitted for on a totally different

962
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:33,200
direction yeah um that's all right yeah

963
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:34,319
don't get don't get sulfur on your

964
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,159
lights

965
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:38,798
you know um

966
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,320
but yeah sulfur sulfur works better than

967
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:41,278
anything i've ever seen against russet

968
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:44,079
mites

969
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:46,640
yeah it absolutely annihilates them

970
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:48,798
and it annihilates powdery mildew yeah i

971
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,640
never had rusted mites in my life so i

972
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:52,960
should knock on wood somewhere but

973
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,240
powdery mildew i you know was it's even

974
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,319
a problem in bakersfield where it's

975
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,319
super dry and i mean do you know that do

976
00:32:56,319 --> 00:33:00,319
you know that they consider uh russet

977
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:02,720
mites aerial plankton

978
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:05,278
no that's weird you ever heard that word

979
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,360
aerial plankton no because

980
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:09,679
so area so obviously plankton in the

981
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:11,359
ocean yeah they just get carried around

982
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:13,440
by the currents

983
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:15,759
yeah right

984
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,200
russets are so small

985
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:19,200
they can get just carried by wind

986
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,960
currents for long distances

987
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,960
yeah they're that's why they call them

988
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,960
aerial plankton because it's like living

989
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,759
things that are just getting carried

990
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,720
along by current in this case wind

991
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:30,480
current

992
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,159
so you could have a neighbor a couple

993
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,599
hills over

994
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,360
and the wind could be going the wrong

995
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:37,119
way and they could definitely start

996
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:39,199
blowing off their plants and right up

997
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:40,000
the hill and right up into your ship

998
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,919
yeah

999
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,759
and that's how a lot of people got them

1000
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:46,080
in mendo actually was they spread

1001
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:48,960
neighbor to neighbor farm to farm

1002
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:51,038
you'd be you'd be downwind from someone

1003
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,200
and about july august their garden would

1004
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:54,558
[ __ ] you yeah

1005
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,240
and so you could take all the

1006
00:33:54,558 --> 00:33:58,558
precautions in the world about

1007
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:01,839
quarantine and bringing in clean stuff

1008
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:04,319
and not allowing pests in you know

1009
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:06,480
and then they came in on the wind

1010
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:09,199
ain't that a [ __ ]

1011
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,119
so somebody just said uh spin assad i'm

1012
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,960
sure there's there's uh

1013
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:15,519
i'm sure there is

1014
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,838
spinosad is a cool story actually i

1015
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:21,039
don't know if you've ever heard it but

1016
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:24,719
spinosad is like a uh is basically a

1017
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:27,440
bug-killing uh fungus yeah right and

1018
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:28,239
they discovered it in the caribbean

1019
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,358
right

1020
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:33,759
uh there was an old uh rum mill

1021
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:35,440
and they went into this big old factory

1022
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,919
you know rum factory

1023
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,800
and they noticed there was no bugs

1024
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:42,638
yeah all there was like zero no spiders

1025
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,399
no bugs of any kind so they took soil

1026
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:48,720
samples and they found spinosad a and d

1027
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:51,118
yeah and uh that's what that's what when

1028
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,959
you buy spinosad that's what that's what

1029
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:55,200
it comes from it comes from them

1030
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,720
discovering this thing right yeah

1031
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,078
um but

1032
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:01,039
the reason why you shouldn't [ __ ] use

1033
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:04,320
it is that it is

1034
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:06,800
really it is terrible first bees

1035
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,240
yeah it is one of the most toxic things

1036
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,240
for bees

1037
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:12,319
um so it's safe for you and it's safe

1038
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:15,199
for people and and animals and all that

1039
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:17,680
type of stuff but it'll take out a whole

1040
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:21,199
beehive that sucks

1041
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:22,879
um so it's not it's not uh

1042
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:24,480
you know i mean i guess if you were

1043
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,720
indoor

1044
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,559
you could safely use it on your plants

1045
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:30,239
yeah um and you really wouldn't have too

1046
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:32,400
much risk or be or you know be an

1047
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:34,879
[ __ ] about it but yeah uh if you're

1048
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,400
gonna spray it on a bunch of your um

1049
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,240
your depths or your outdoors or

1050
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,119
something like that you'll put you might

1051
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:41,439
kill

1052
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:43,358
the natural bees all in your area

1053
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,039
you might just take them all out yeah

1054
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:46,799
and they have their own they have they

1055
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:48,480
have enough struggles going on right now

1056
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,119
bee populations with a lot of things

1057
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:54,320
that are [ __ ] with them so yeah um

1058
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:56,079
i would definitely i i could never in

1059
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,400
in good conscience recommend somebody

1060
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:00,560
use it in their depth or their outside

1061
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,519
yeah you know i don't want to hear some

1062
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:05,358
[ __ ] on og when we get to that sucka

1063
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:07,280
we're there i mean i don't know we just

1064
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:09,440
we just took it and we just took it in

1065
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,760
that direction uh but you know there's a

1066
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,838
bunch of people listening so if if we

1067
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,640
talked about certain things and and why

1068
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:18,000
not to use them that's cool too yeah uh

1069
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:20,078
and that's the reason when people say

1070
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,239
oklahoma or california there's testing

1071
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,280
for it it's not because it's harmful to

1072
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:25,679
humans

1073
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,320
it's because bees pollinate half of our

1074
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:30,159
food sources yeah and so we really

1075
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,200
really don't want them to die

1076
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:32,879
yeah

1077
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:34,239
and they are dying at a rapid rate and

1078
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,680
they're dying at a rapid rate from a

1079
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:37,679
bunch of different issues and from a

1080
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:40,719
bunch of exposure to toxins and

1081
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:43,519
pesticides and herbicides and other and

1082
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:45,039
other stresses or whatever and literally

1083
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:46,800
there's an immense amount of stuff that

1084
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:49,599
you eat that wouldn't get pollinated if

1085
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,960
it wasn't for bees yeah so spraying a

1086
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:53,280
[ __ ] ton of

1087
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:56,400
bee killer

1088
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,359
you know yeah it's a little rough

1089
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,400
so

1090
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:00,400
um

1091
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,200
all right so we can we can talk we can

1092
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,800
talk about kush uh oh this already just

1093
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:09,838
i just totally changed my mind and don't

1094
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,839
want to talk about it at all oh my god

1095
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,160
but yeah but i mean it it there could be

1096
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:16,879
there could be now that we've been

1097
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:18,480
chatting about it for a while yeah uh

1098
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,480
you know not right now but like our

1099
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,920
experiences in the future or people want

1100
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,760
to know about pesticide or or tech or

1101
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,680
how to beat certain things or what works

1102
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,359
or what doesn't

1103
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:30,799
living up here surrounded by growers i

1104
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:32,000
mean i've kind of seen about just about

1105
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,000
everything tried

1106
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,838
yeah and you start to poke around and

1107
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,079
what works and what doesn't what what

1108
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:41,358
are the downsides to this thing

1109
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,720
yeah because most things have downsides

1110
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:43,838
you know so you got to pick which ones

1111
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:46,319
you're okay with

1112
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:48,400
yeah you know

1113
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,640
definitely but

1114
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,720
if people want to hear about og

1115
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:54,400
yeah like a lot of things or like a lot

1116
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:56,879
of famous stories

1117
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,680
um it's not mine or math story

1118
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,000
no

1119
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:02,639
i have nothing to do with og

1120
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,960
by any means

1121
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:05,838
you know but we you know what we thought

1122
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,960
like

1123
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:08,480
so

1124
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,720
there's there's like the the most

1125
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,559
mysterious part about it is the is the

1126
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:14,480
florida history

1127
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:16,719
right it starts getting a little bit

1128
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:20,000
more definitive and understood once it

1129
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:21,598
got to california yeah yeah right so

1130
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,199
what we thought is like obviously this

1131
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,519
is like i mean there's been whole shows

1132

1133
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:29,358
origins of og and this and that and

1134

you know there's a story like he just

1154
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:13,440
said that you know frank is a guy that

1155
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:15,838
had a bunch of

1156
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,358
uh basically undergrounds and warehouses

1157
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:20,159
and big grows

1158
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:23,119
uh in the southwest uh you know uh

1159
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:25,440
united states arizona arizona and new

1160
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:28,240
mexico issue and all that and um

1161
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,880
there's rumor that it came from there uh

1162
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:33,279
it certainly seems guaranteed to have

1163
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,760
come from florida people

1164
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,000
coming out this way me and fatty did

1165
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,680
meet uh old dave richards he was there

1166
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,679
when when i met that guy and he was

1167
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:44,000
still he had a circle around him telling

1168
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:44,799
the tales of og and how he [ __ ] made

1169
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,599
it

1170
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,440
it's funny i mean i i've met i've met uh

1171
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:52,079
dave richards he's a character did you

1172
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:54,159
meet him yeah i met him he's he smokes

1173
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:56,880
black and milds on one of those [ __ ]

1174
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:58,799
things yeah yeah he's i liked him in

1175
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,000
person like there's i'm not even gonna

1176
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,920
lie like he's a funny dude like he's

1177
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,920
he's personable yeah he's personable

1178
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,920
it's hard not to like him but when i

1179
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:09,280
realized how much he was lying to me i

1180
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,079
was like okay

1181
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,160
come on dude like it was so easy to snap

1182
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:16,720
he's personable and so

1183
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:18,480
there's a there's an aspect where

1184
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:19,598
mark's castle yes that's another claim

1185
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,800
that's right

1186
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,480
anyway there's

1187
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,560
basically what it boils down to is that

1188
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,039
kush became

1189
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:30,000
one of those things that ended up being

1190
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:32,159
so famous and made so many people money

1191
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,079
that there's a lot of people invested in

1192
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:36,159
trying to be like

1193
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,880
you should give me rep because my crew

1194
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:40,239
or my family or my whatever my friends

1195
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,838
are the ones that brought this to the

1196
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:44,239
world yes

1197
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:45,519
and so people come out of the woodwork

1198
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:47,118
you know i mean

1199
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:49,440
uh and i'm not trying to call

1200
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:51,440
individuals out but it's like there's

1201
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,760
everything from those crazy stories we

1202
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,200
told you to the one that matt and i tend

1203
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,800
to believe which there was like an

1204
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:58,879
accident and a closet

1205
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,160
and it came out of some bag seed you

1206
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:04,079
know to

1207
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:05,838
uh ever changing story from tk origins

1208
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:08,079
uh with different years and different

1209
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:11,039
plants and different certainties

1210
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:13,760
you know um and you know it's also

1211
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:16,239
possible too that like it's you know

1212
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,839
it's it went it was it was strained by a

1213
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:21,679
different name

1214
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:24,000
and now we just know it is kush yes

1215
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:25,838
you know i mean we we you know neville

1216
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,440
told uh

1217
00:41:25,838 --> 00:41:29,039
neville told matt that he thought that

1218
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,159
most of the american cush stuff was

1219
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:34,400
based off his kush for nl2

1220
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:36,639
yes yeah you know and it was all just it

1221
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,318
was all just phenos of that he just

1222
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:40,719
thought it was nl2 expression out of

1223
00:41:38,318 --> 00:41:42,639
that yeah he thought this is nl2 this is

1224
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:44,480
mine obvious

1225
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:46,318
right and so you know and then you know

1226
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,400
there's so there's all these different

1227
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:49,759
things but what regardless of all that

1228
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,720
uh

1229
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,599
you know

1230
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:56,399
um yeah someone you know uh

1231
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:58,160
there's uh there's a bunch of rumor

1232
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,680
yeah and since we don't know any of the

1233
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:02,239
parents

1234
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:03,679
right it allows basically anyone to step

1235
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:05,838
in and say

1236
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:07,838
[ __ ] this is the story

1237
00:42:05,838 --> 00:42:10,559
well i mean i also think because the way

1238
00:42:07,838 --> 00:42:12,559
og expresses being long and lanky with

1239
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:15,039
dense nugs so it looks like what we

1240
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:17,199
would just consider traditionally as

1241
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:19,920
like a sativa because it's so long and

1242
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:22,559
lenky but then it has these dense

1243
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,318
nugs and resin like an afghani so it's

1244
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:26,318
really easy to just make up [ __ ] and

1245
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:28,639
be like that's a [ __ ] nepalese and

1246
00:42:26,318 --> 00:42:30,639
just some random sativa and some random

1247
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:33,118
afghani you know so maybe we'll go way

1248
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:34,879
the [ __ ] back for a second okay right

1249
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:36,640
start start at the back we'll start at

1250
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,760
the very beginning

1251
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:40,480
okay so

1252
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,319
the very beginning of kush in america

1253
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,719
and we have no idea if this relates to

1254
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:47,039
the cush that everyone is familiar with

1255
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:49,039
but people would bring back seed from

1256
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:51,199
the hindu kush mountain region of

1257
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:55,119
afghanistan and pakistan

1258
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:58,000
and those mountain valleys had the kush

1259
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:00,880
yes right and that was the first term

1260
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,559
sam skunk man had a hindu kush

1261
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,800
that was the hindu kush mountain region

1262
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:07,519
yeah the hindu kush mountain region uh

1263
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,400
the indian supposedly gave seattle greg

1264
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:12,719
a kush that got put into nl2

1265
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,519
um you know uh there's various ones

1266
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:14,399
right

1267
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:15,199
and

1268
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,680
so

1269
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:19,039
it used to be a generalized term for a

1270
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:21,919
region

1271
00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:23,599
yes right where now if you fast forward

1272
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:27,440
40 years today

1273
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:29,440
it basically goes back to you know uh

1274
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,800
the kush that went to la

1275
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,480
the tk

1276
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,160
that type of thing is like that's what

1277
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:37,119
everyone thinks of as kush

1278
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:39,199
yeah so it went from like a region and

1279
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:42,400
all these different afghans within that

1280
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:44,078
region yes to like a very specific

1281
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,200
phenoexpression

1282
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,280
and look

1283
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:49,358
yes was kush and so now if you talk

1284
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:52,160
about kush today you're not talking

1285
00:43:49,358 --> 00:43:52,960
about the region anymore with anyone

1286
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:55,598
right

1287
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:58,559
they're specifically talking about

1288
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:59,440
a specific phenotypic expression and a

1289
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:01,199
look

1290
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:04,159
and there's variance within that look

1291
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:06,159
but it's got some key characteristics

1292
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:08,078
and one second i i just for everyone

1293
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:10,078
that keeps mentioning the packy lemon

1294
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:12,240
tie i will tell the actual story behind

1295
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:13,680
how that how that came to be and you it

1296
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:16,399
you'll laugh your ass off so let's

1297
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:18,480
continue so so anyway so it started off

1298
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,440
as it started off as a region

1299
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,119
right

1300
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,400
and maybe we should talk about the

1301
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,960
region for just a second because it

1302
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:27,358
might interest people right okay so

1303
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:29,679
i i have this theory and i've and i've

1304
00:44:27,358 --> 00:44:31,199
seen it in some different places and all

1305
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:32,239
that and

1306
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:33,838
like

1307
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:36,399
and we've bounced it around and i would

1308
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:38,159
so i wouldn't say it's like a a theory

1309
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,599
that's like you know you couldn't poke

1310
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:41,279
holes in but i think it can hold

1311
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,920
generally true

1312
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,519
where if you look at afghanistan there

1313
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,519
is parts of afghanistan that are

1314
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:50,559
anywhere from sea level all the way up

1315
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:53,440
to 10 000 feet yeah right there's a lot

1316
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:55,440
of different elevations so like mazar

1317
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,960
uh that region that's maybe only 800

1318
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,200
feet above sea level

1319
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:01,199
yes but there's areas in the hindu kush

1320
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:02,639
valleys that are five six seven thousand

1321
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:05,919
feet where they grow vegetables and

1322
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:09,199
wheat yeah and so what tends to be is

1323
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:11,280
that when you get the lowland afghans

1324
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:13,598
that are in the the foothills or the

1325
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:17,440
plains or sea level in pakistan or

1326
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:18,480
afghanistan they tend to be these squat

1327
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,000
bigger

1328
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,199
like fluffier

1329
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,519
plants with much wider leaves

1330
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:28,239
right they're not as dense

1331
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:30,079
um they're growing in more humid areas

1332
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:31,439
right a little bit

1333
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:34,240
and they're lower to the ground and they

1334
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,679
have these big fat wide leaves and then

1335
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:37,118
you get up into these high mountain

1336
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:39,440
regions

1337
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:42,160
okay which also has afghans and those

1338
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,760
afghans kind of sound a lot like what

1339
00:45:42,159 --> 00:45:46,078
matt described with the kush that

1340
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:48,640
everyone's familiar with yeah skinny

1341
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:50,960
leaves but indica

1342
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:53,838
right not not big fat wide leaves but

1343
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:56,400
skinny leaves golf ball type much

1344
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:58,000
tighter type nugs right yeah and you

1345
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:02,480
think about the environment that they're

1346
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:05,280
in very cold colder drier a lot more uv

1347
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:07,920
right yeah and so the leaves are smaller

1348
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:10,960
because catching all that uv is bad

1349
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:12,400
yes the intensity is more i think i

1350
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,400
think well i was talking about this with

1351
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,480
csi because i don't have a lot of uh

1352
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:19,599
experience with outdoor other than a few

1353
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:20,559
you know like uh depth runs in san diego

1354
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:23,039
but

1355
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:24,480
i noticed that even with the nl5s

1356
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:26,960
they're expressing way more narrow

1357
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:29,280
outdoors and it's just a trait that

1358
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,679
outdoors because of humidity and other

1359
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,839
other things and transpiration they're

1360
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:35,519
just naturally more narrow there's gonna

1361
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:37,279
be there's the plants gonna have a range

1362
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:40,159
of expressions based on all kinds of

1363
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:42,480
factors yeah uh and you know uh he

1364
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:44,799
homely just said you know uv protection

1365
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,719
the higher up you go in elevation the

1366
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:49,200
less atmosphere there is

1367
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:50,879
the less uv is filtered out

1368
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:53,199
yeah right

1369
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,800
and so obviously even though the plant

1370
00:46:53,199 --> 00:46:56,480
might come from afghanistan if it

1371
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:59,119
developed in a valley that's six or

1372
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:01,599
seven thousand feet above sea level

1373
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:03,519
and it's a mountain region that kind of

1374
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:04,640
cold and day night temperatures and a

1375
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:06,318
lot of things it's going to have

1376
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:08,559
different breeding pressures and

1377
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:11,199
different plants that are successful

1378
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:14,078
yeah versus a lowland plant from the

1379
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:15,838
plain that gets you know moisture off

1380
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:16,880
the ocean

1381
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:17,759
that's going to be a different kind of

1382
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,039
plant

1383
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,040
yeah and i think there's a lot of

1384
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:22,880
misconception where people think all

1385
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:25,039
thin leaf is sativa

1386
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:28,880
and the broader and fatter it is the

1387
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:31,599
more indica it is yeah you can have

1388
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,559
narrow leaf pure indica

1389
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,318
yeah

1390
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:36,960
you know it just happens to it's just

1391
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:39,358
usually highland weed yeah

1392
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,800
not lowland weed

1393
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:42,558
you know and i think that's a big

1394
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,480
misconception

1395
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:45,760
yeah for a lot of people

1396
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,159
yeah i think that as a major

1397
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,160
misconception yeah is is all indica and

1398
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:53,118
all afghan the broader the broader is

1399
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:55,199
the more afghan and the narrowers the

1400
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:56,960
more sativa yeah

1401
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:59,679
you know and maybe if you cross the

1402
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:02,000
broadleaf afghan to a narrow leaf sativa

1403
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:03,679
that would be true in the children

1404
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,400
yeah

1405
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:07,519
you know um and so now we're so so

1406
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,480
anyway so

1407
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:10,480
there's

1408
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,480
highland afghan there's a lot of there's

1409
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,240
a lot of mountain valley weed

1410
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,800
yeah and there was a lot there was a

1411
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:19,118
bunch of weed coming over to america

1412
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,800
called hindu kush

1413
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:23,358
because that was the big mountain range

1414
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:26,400
and all the valleys that uh that it came

1415
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:27,920
from yeah and dirty old sag is saying

1416
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,838
there's hash plants because those were

1417
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:32,079
all hash plants all those i love

1418
00:48:29,838 --> 00:48:34,558
lebanese my red leaf that i had was also

1419
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:36,640
narrow leaf but it grew like a big

1420
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:39,599
afghan sideways it was real [ __ ]

1421
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:41,519
weird yeah yeah and so there's just you

1422
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:43,838
know like a lot of times and it makes

1423
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:46,800
sense like you read books and you see

1424
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:48,799
what you're familiar with in america

1425
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,240
right and there's certain assumptions

1426
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,359
that get made but they're not always the

1427
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:52,639
true ones

1428
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:55,279
yeah

1429
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:57,759
you know um and

1430
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,920
you know and and you know narrow and and

1431
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,760
what i mean by narrow leaf is just like

1432
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,200
obviously there's a range

1433
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:05,119
yeah bodhi has a lot of really good

1434
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:07,039
narrow leaf afghanis and pakis he's put

1435
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:09,200
out if people are interested

1436
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:10,480
yeah and so it's just and and so a lot

1437
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:12,639
of times i

1438
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:14,639
i believe very strongly i can't say it's

1439
00:49:12,639 --> 00:49:16,799
a 100 fact but i believe very strongly

1440
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:20,960
that almost all those narrow leaf indica

1441
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:22,800
types developed in high altitude regions

1442
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:25,920
of those mountain ranges where they

1443
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:27,440
didn't need as much leaf to capture

1444
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,519
light

1445
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:31,920
they needed less of it right because

1446
00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:34,000
each leaf has a job right yeah it's

1447
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,838
there to transpire water and it's there

1448
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,800
to catch sunlight

1449
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:41,199
pet trees and water transportation

1450
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,160
yeah if it if it uh

1451
00:49:41,199 --> 00:49:43,598
um

1452
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:45,279
on my buddy i was visiting my friend

1453
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:47,119
yesterday and he was showing me an

1454
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:49,200
afghan and it was thin leafed and fluffy

1455
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:51,039
as hell yeah yeah so you know the leaf

1456
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:52,639
has a job and if it's way up there in

1457
00:49:51,039 --> 00:49:54,400
the mountain valleys and it can do its

1458
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:55,920
job on a skinny leaf then it's not going

1459
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,440
to put a bunch of effort into growing a

1460
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,400
big fat

1461
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,079
thick leaf

1462
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,680
yeah

1463
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:03,839
is there a narrow leaf indica type or

1464
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:05,279
hybrid oracle expresses many different

1465
00:50:03,838 --> 00:50:06,960
ways i've seen it be narrow and i've

1466
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,800
seen it be broad

1467
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,119
so one of those that it depends on the

1468
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:13,440
room the environment how how

1469
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:16,559
narrow or broad it is so just as a

1470
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:18,800
general thing um a lot of times people

1471
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:21,200
you know people judge narrow or wide

1472
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:22,960
based on and and make guesses based on

1473
00:50:21,199 --> 00:50:24,719
how sativa or how indica but that's not

1474
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,720
the whole story yeah and i honestly

1475
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:28,239
think that can tell the story about the

1476
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:30,159
packy and the tie

1477
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:31,279
yeah i honestly think some of the some

1478
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:32,879
of the

1479
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:35,200
the kush that we're familiar with some

1480
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:38,400
of its narrow leaf characteristics

1481
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:41,279
um led people to believe there was

1482
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,880
sativa in it

1483
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:44,319
yeah i think i think the stretchiness

1484
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:46,240
and all that [ __ ]

1485
00:50:44,318 --> 00:50:48,719
and definitely it wasn't as broad as a

1486
00:50:46,239 --> 00:50:50,159
lot of afghans despite the density but

1487
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:51,679
the story

1488
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:53,199
originated from

1489
00:50:51,679 --> 00:50:55,358
there were two brothers back in the day

1490
00:50:53,199 --> 00:50:57,358
that went by brothel brothers

1491
00:50:55,358 --> 00:50:59,679
and one would call himself kailua kid

1492
00:50:57,358 --> 00:51:01,519
and the other called himself nyc kid

1493
00:50:59,679 --> 00:51:03,440
both i think are still around i know nyc

1494
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:05,759
kid is still

1495
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,679
but back then

1496
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,200
kailua kid who also went later on to

1497
00:51:07,679 --> 00:51:10,000
start trichome kings and a few other

1498
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:11,679
things

1499
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,800
and paradise seeds mod was another name

1500
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:14,719
of his

1501
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:17,039
he made the claim that he bred og and

1502
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:17,919
that it was pakistani crossed a lemon

1503
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:20,318
thai

1504
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:22,240
lemon thai was a dutch flower strain

1505
00:51:20,318 --> 00:51:23,599
and i mean there are ties that are

1506
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:25,598
lemony but the one he was referring to

1507
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:28,800
was a dutch flower strain and he's not

1508
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:30,240
in [ __ ] og kush um is this that's one

1509
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:32,960
of the oldest stories that's been shot

1510
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:35,199
down more than almost any og kush origin

1511
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:37,679
story but to this day

1512
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:38,719
to this day people still [ __ ] repeat

1513
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:40,639
that [ __ ]

1514
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:42,639
ad nauseam because they don't know that

1515
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:45,598
the guy was a major scammer that started

1516
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:47,039
the story he's [ __ ] all of us all of

1517
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:48,720
us back in the day

1518
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:50,239
but he made a lot of claims about asian

1519
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:51,919
fantasy and all kinds of other stupid

1520
00:51:50,239 --> 00:51:53,279
[ __ ] it was just what he did uh i

1521
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,960
remember at one point he was selling

1522
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,000
seeds he called

1523
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:58,318
dog

1524
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,318
dog bud s ones and then i kind of called

1525
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:03,119
him out on he's like well [ __ ] i don't

1526
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:05,920
know man i got him in a bag labeled dog

1527
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:06,960
doggy doggy budweed you know close

1528
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,800
enough

1529
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:10,240
so this is the guy that they're relying

1530
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,839
on for that story

1531
00:52:10,239 --> 00:52:13,519
uh the the second story that we were

1532
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:15,759
talking about the frank gigaff story it

1533
00:52:13,519 --> 00:52:18,239
was started by a guy named dave richards

1534
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:20,079
um and he told the story on adam dunn he

1535
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:22,719
came out he actually i believe adam dunn

1536
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:25,200
at one of the adam dunn cups gave him a

1537
00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:28,159
lifetime achievement award for breeding

1538
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:30,318
and and bringing og kush to the masses

1539
00:52:28,159 --> 00:52:31,679
um unfortunately dave richards made a

1540
00:52:30,318 --> 00:52:33,838
lot of mistakes one of the first ones

1541
00:52:31,679 --> 00:52:35,440
was that it was a hot it was a hash

1542
00:52:33,838 --> 00:52:38,480
plant thai afghani which he kept

1543
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:40,639
referring to as htf now htaf is an old

1544
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,880
term from dj short referring to highland

1545
00:52:40,639 --> 00:52:44,719
thai afghani so he was confabulating

1546
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:46,880
different stuff to make his story he

1547
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:48,799
also said that frank gigas left a book

1548
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:51,440
behind um

1549
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:53,119
with the breeding tips on og kush and

1550
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:55,280
everything about it when i spoke to

1551
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:56,720
frank gigaax directly and his daughter i

1552
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,480
went to lunch with his daughter and

1553
00:52:56,719 --> 00:53:00,959
breakfast we went to a few different

1554
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:03,039
things but um i talked to frank g gax

1555
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,800
over the phone and he said that he wrote

1556
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:07,039
that book as a grow book for dummies in

1557
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,079
prison because he had nothing else to do

1558
00:53:07,039 --> 00:53:10,159
so

1559
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:11,839
dave's story and also frankie got said

1560
00:53:10,159 --> 00:53:14,078
they never bred there it was only

1561
00:53:11,838 --> 00:53:15,519
commercial production and it was he gave

1562
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:17,519
a few different lines i want to say it

1563
00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:19,519
was like nl

1564
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:20,880
for something weird that i don't think

1565
00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:23,039
he probably had

1566
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,400
big budge skunk one and something else

1567
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:25,599
he said we did no breeding there

1568
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:27,358
whatsoever

1569
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:30,160
and he completely smashed that story to

1570
00:53:27,358 --> 00:53:32,719
smithereens um but still people again

1571
00:53:30,159 --> 00:53:35,118
repeat it constantly to this day as

1572
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:36,879
truth because it was aired once on a

1573
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:38,240
show you know

1574
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,640
but those are the probably two of the

1575
00:53:38,239 --> 00:53:42,558
biggest ones the the third being

1576
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:44,960
uh the creepy story

1577
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:46,480
and that's just silly like i mean i

1578
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,159
i don't think anybody that's been around

1579
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:50,079
a long time even gives that dude any

1580
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:52,480
kind of

1581
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:53,839
credit yeah it's not even worth the

1582
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,760
dressing to be honest with you on the

1583
00:53:53,838 --> 00:53:57,119
crippy thing

1584
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:59,440
i mean what you know and then there's

1585
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:01,440
there's there's the story of how you

1586
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,800
know there was accidental pollinations

1587
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:05,679
in florida

1588
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:07,519
um and so really what it seems like

1589
00:54:05,679 --> 00:54:09,358
it does seem

1590
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:10,480
to me at least

1591
00:54:09,358 --> 00:54:12,239
is that

1592
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,719
i do believe that there was multiple

1593
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:16,318
people that brought kush from florida to

1594
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:17,358
california

1595
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:19,519
yeah

1596
00:54:17,358 --> 00:54:21,679
i think that's factual

1597
00:54:19,519 --> 00:54:23,119
right yeah um

1598
00:54:21,679 --> 00:54:25,440
you know we're you know because

1599
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:27,039
obviously people know about cornbread

1600
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,519
ricky and tk

1601
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:32,159
yes right he sent that out before he

1602
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:34,239
came out physically himself to the state

1603
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:35,039
yeah um people know about

1604
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:38,639
uh

1605
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:40,880
uh matt bubba and uh and uh bubba kush

1606
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:42,719
and uh josh d

1607
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,720
i'll say i'll say

1608
00:54:42,719 --> 00:54:46,239
flat out when i when i first talked to

1609
00:54:44,719 --> 00:54:47,439
matt i thought he was full of [ __ ]

1610
00:54:46,239 --> 00:54:48,959
because he comes off like a little bit

1611
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,358
of a used car salesman when you talk to

1612
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:53,679
him he's very friendly but it's his it's

1613
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:56,078
like his nature so i didn't believe him

1614
00:54:53,679 --> 00:54:58,719
but everything that i've ever

1615
00:54:56,079 --> 00:55:01,039
researched and found is he has not been

1616
00:54:58,719 --> 00:55:02,558
wrong once and and as much as i was

1617
00:55:01,039 --> 00:55:04,079
biased against him i've told him dude

1618
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:05,519
like i can't poke holes in your story

1619
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:08,240
unfortunately like i don't believe you

1620
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:10,400
but i can't poke holes in it so i'm left

1621
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:13,118
with a truth as well so

1622
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:14,880
so there's an aspect where and bubba

1623
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:18,240
bubba and that kush that went to la

1624
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:20,000
became very famous tk became very famous

1625
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:22,719
uh there's a strain that got sent to the

1626
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,239
bay uh that we called the florida uh

1627
00:55:22,719 --> 00:55:25,759
that i've chatted about before and i

1628
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:29,279
posted about

1629
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:31,359
um that went into cookie uh and so

1630
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:34,640
what we don't know for sure

1631
00:55:31,358 --> 00:55:36,639
uh uh irene irene comes a little bit

1632
00:55:34,639 --> 00:55:38,960
later but that's another beautiful kush

1633
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:41,679
strain um but

1634
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:44,240
there are there were multiple people

1635
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:47,279
that got kush to california to different

1636
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:49,118
people at different years we don't know

1637
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,559
huh slow down real quick because i think

1638
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:52,400
i think people would be interested in

1639
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:53,280
the irene story a little bit don't you

1640
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:56,400
think

1641
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:58,880
sure 100 yeah well so irene i'll let you

1642
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,960
tell it because yeah go for it so the

1643
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,640
original irene is as as best i can

1644
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:05,599
remember i wish rude boy was here right

1645
00:56:02,639 --> 00:56:07,279
now but um the original irene was picked

1646
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:09,920
from a bag of weed that went from

1647
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:11,760
california to atlanta and what was kind

1648
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:13,838
of cool was that we were able to link up

1649
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:16,319
resin lung and his crew with the atlanta

1650
00:56:13,838 --> 00:56:17,920
crew and how they were shipped i'm not

1651
00:56:16,318 --> 00:56:19,599
going to say it i think we've said it a

1652
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:21,119
few times but you can figure it out

1653
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:23,200
anyway they shipped it a certain way and

1654
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:24,798
it was so unique that when they were

1655
00:56:23,199 --> 00:56:26,159
both telling the story it was like holy

1656
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:27,440
[ __ ] there's no way they just made that

1657
00:56:26,159 --> 00:56:30,078
one up it was something that nobody

1658
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:32,079
would think of um it was originally from

1659
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:34,559
a bag of weed and i want to say

1660
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:37,839
either the first irene was from a bag of

1661
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:39,680
larry og or the second irene that they

1662
00:56:37,838 --> 00:56:41,440
picked after they lost the first irene

1663
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:43,279
they picked another selection that was

1664
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,880
the most similar to the first one and

1665
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:47,440
that came out of lario g if i remember

1666
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,798
correctly but that's the rough story the

1667
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,559
irene that we have now is what you would

1668
00:56:48,798 --> 00:56:52,480
consider irene two

1669
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:54,480
and that's the one almost everyone has

1670
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:56,079
grown only a few people like smoked a

1671
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:59,119
herb and rude boy

1672
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:01,839
really experienced the first i read

1673
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:05,519
so yeah so there's so basically

1674
00:57:01,838 --> 00:57:06,719
if you move past the uh the the origin

1675
00:57:05,519 --> 00:57:09,119
stories

1676
00:57:06,719 --> 00:57:11,679
right of who's responsible for it or

1677
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:12,798
where it came from yeah of which there

1678
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:15,519
are many

1679
00:57:12,798 --> 00:57:16,960
um there was it does seem like the stuff

1680
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:19,440
that we know of

1681
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:22,480
uh made its way from

1682
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:23,599
florida to california yeah and we don't

1683
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:26,400
know

1684
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:28,640
exactly if all those things were the

1685
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:31,200
same cut

1686
00:57:28,639 --> 00:57:33,199
or there was multiple cuts that came out

1687
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:35,519
or there is possibility that there's a

1688
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:37,118
cut that shared a name and was called

1689
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:39,599
different things by different crews

1690
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:40,640
those are totally possible right yeah

1691
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:42,960
but

1692
00:57:40,639 --> 00:57:46,078
uh what really happened is

1693
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:48,079
you know uh uh bubba kush matt bubba he

1694
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:50,240
brought he him and josh d brought out

1695
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:54,318
bubba and that and a couple other

1696
00:57:50,239 --> 00:57:57,199
strains from florida to uh uh a

1697
00:57:54,318 --> 00:57:59,599
neighborhood out in l.a right

1698
00:57:57,199 --> 00:58:00,879
and um they started growing some rooms

1699
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:03,200
of it

1700
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:06,318
yeah right and

1701
00:58:03,199 --> 00:58:09,279
what happened i think in la is that

1702
00:58:06,318 --> 00:58:11,838
la is such a is such a hype town

1703
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:14,400
and it's it's it's so about flash and

1704
00:58:11,838 --> 00:58:17,358
it's so about like who has what whether

1705
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:19,760
it's alcohol or cars or watches or

1706
00:58:17,358 --> 00:58:22,239
clothes or whatever

1707
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:23,680
that yeah kush caught on with a certain

1708
00:58:22,239 --> 00:58:25,598
clientele

1709
00:58:23,679 --> 00:58:27,759
and then everybody had to have it

1710
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:28,720
yeah and then so demand went through the

1711
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,599
roof

1712
00:58:28,719 --> 00:58:31,199
and

1713
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:32,480
you know there was only so much of it

1714
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:35,679
being grown

1715
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:36,400
uh and so wholesale became crazy

1716
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:38,159
right

1717
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:40,480
yeah and then so it became worth a lot i

1718
00:58:38,159 --> 00:58:42,159
mean what was what was uh

1719
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:47,039
you know what what was it going for back

1720
00:58:42,159 --> 00:58:47,039
like 7200 yeah it was wholesale okay

1721
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:50,880
you know

1722
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:55,200
six six to eight k right yeah and so and

1723
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:58,000
if and it gave you status if you had it

1724
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:59,679
right and so it just became this craze

1725
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,679
yep in a sense and in the beginning

1726
00:58:59,679 --> 00:59:03,358
there wasn't very many

1727
00:59:01,679 --> 00:59:05,358
right yeah and

1728
00:59:03,358 --> 00:59:06,880
the nature of la we've talked about this

1729
00:59:05,358 --> 00:59:08,400
before with seed companies but the

1730
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:10,000
nature of la

1731
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:12,639
uh to everybody

1732
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,318
to pop up with their own [ __ ] nobody

1733
00:59:12,639 --> 00:59:16,558
down there wanted to give anybody else

1734
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:17,759
credit for how they got theirs yeah of

1735
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:21,280
course so

1736
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:23,200
the [ __ ] and the and the stories

1737
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:25,200
started happening immediately

1738
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:27,279
yeah you know and the bubba just so

1739
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:28,798
everybody knows the bubba that that matt

1740
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:31,040
bubba brought out

1741
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:33,280
it died by 98

1742
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:35,920
yeah the bubba that everybody has now is

1743
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:39,200
not the first bubba that came to

1744
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:41,599
came out there uh luckily bubba is is

1745
00:59:39,199 --> 00:59:43,039
such a specific type and breed's so true

1746
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:43,838
it probably is something similar but

1747
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:45,838
yeah

1748
00:59:43,838 --> 00:59:47,440
so i mean they found the i believe the

1749
00:59:45,838 --> 00:59:49,279
story is it might even be somebody like

1750
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:52,159
rascal or somebody like that someone

1751
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:54,000
found someone tied in found

1752
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:55,838
bag seat

1753
00:59:54,000 --> 01:00:00,400
in original bubba

1754
00:59:55,838 --> 01:00:01,279
huh i don't know not shaw no i uh

1755
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,280
they

1756
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:05,040
well i think the thing is is that and i

1757
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:07,200
think that's why i got named bubba kush

1758
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:08,239
because they thought kush pollinated the

1759
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:09,838
bubba

1760
01:00:08,239 --> 01:00:11,439
yeah i think matt bubba's story if i

1761
01:00:09,838 --> 01:00:13,440
remember correctly you know he can

1762
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:15,760
correct me on this is that bubba is a

1763
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:18,639
hybrid bubba kush is a hybrid of bubba

1764
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:20,799
and og nog kush yes yeah so the original

1765
01:00:18,639 --> 01:00:23,199
order lights so the original bubba that

1766
01:00:20,798 --> 01:00:24,880
came out is no more yeah

1767
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:25,838
everybody has

1768
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:27,200
everybody

1769
01:00:25,838 --> 01:00:29,358
regardless of how you want to believe

1770
01:00:27,199 --> 01:00:31,519
the story according to matt who brought

1771
01:00:29,358 --> 01:00:34,400
it out they lost the first plant that

1772
01:00:31,519 --> 01:00:38,159
they called bubba yes and bubba kush is

1773
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:39,599
a hybrid of that plant yeah

1774
01:00:38,159 --> 01:00:42,639
right yeah

1775
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:45,440
yeah it's a hybrid that's kind of it and

1776
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:48,639
so to get really confusing

1777
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:50,639
within five or ten years of this plant

1778
01:00:48,639 --> 01:00:52,798
hitting la

1779
01:00:50,639 --> 01:00:54,960
there was a whole family of what you

1780
01:00:52,798 --> 01:00:57,599
call purecush

1781

that there's

1796
01:01:25,838 --> 01:01:29,119
and all of a sudden the names start

1797
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:30,880
proliferating right

1798
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:32,480
yeah to the point where

1799
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,720
i don't know by

1800
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:37,760
you know

1801
01:01:33,719 --> 01:01:39,838
0.050607 um there was probably mo the

1802
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:42,000
clubs and it was so popular that

1803
01:01:39,838 --> 01:01:43,838
probably most of what club sold in los

1804
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,239
angeles was kush

1805
01:01:43,838 --> 01:01:48,000
yeah and there was probably 20 or 30

1806
01:01:46,239 --> 01:01:49,279
different kush's on the menu

1807
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,159
yeah

1808
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:53,760
and so we really don't know how many

1809
01:01:52,159 --> 01:01:55,038
original things these things started

1810
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:58,079
from

1811
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:59,839
i mean yeah we have a buddy uh that uh

1812
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:01,599
that came to uh

1813
01:01:59,838 --> 01:02:04,078
um came to our one of our canned

1814
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:07,200
illuminati parties right remember and he

1815
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:09,039
was telling the story about about how

1816
01:02:07,199 --> 01:02:11,279
he had bought a couple of pounds of kush

1817
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:12,079
for 8 000 bucks

1818
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:14,240
right

1819
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:15,760
and he brought it home and he starts

1820
01:02:14,239 --> 01:02:18,000
breaking up the weed and a couple of

1821
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:20,720
seeds fall out yeah and then he's

1822
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,239
looking at two seeds from an eight

1823
01:02:20,719 --> 01:02:23,118
thousand dollar pound that nobody can

1824
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:25,759
get

1825
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:29,039
yeah and so he spent the next two days

1826
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:31,440
looking at every bud for a seat

1827
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:34,880
and that became i think the poison og

1828
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:36,240
oh yeah casas yeah yeah yeah poison but

1829
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:39,119
that's what he said he said he bought

1830
01:02:36,239 --> 01:02:40,479
two pounds for 16 000 bucks that's yeah

1831
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:42,400
and he goes dude i'm just rolling my

1832
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:44,079
first joint at home and i hear a seed

1833
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,440
hit the table and roll

1834
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:47,119
and i'm looking at this seed and i'm

1835
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:48,559
like i just spent

1836
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:49,358
eight grand a pound

1837
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:51,440
yeah

1838
01:02:49,358 --> 01:02:53,358
wonder if there's more seeds

1839
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:56,720
what if the weed looks like this

1840
01:02:53,358 --> 01:02:58,318
yeah and so every every seed you know

1841
01:02:56,719 --> 01:03:00,879
and we have a good buddy

1842
01:02:58,318 --> 01:03:04,318
um who got the kush

1843
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:06,400
in 99 we think right yeah yeah he's 99

1844
01:03:04,318 --> 01:03:08,798
somewhere between 99. he's tied into

1845
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:11,519
some of the first people outside of

1846
01:03:08,798 --> 01:03:13,838
outside of matt and josh d that got it

1847
01:03:11,519 --> 01:03:15,838
yeah in los angeles and it was one of

1848
01:03:13,838 --> 01:03:17,358
the guys mansion cruise yeah and one of

1849
01:03:15,838 --> 01:03:19,199
the guy and one one of the people

1850
01:03:17,358 --> 01:03:20,480
intimately involved in running it very

1851
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:23,598
early on

1852
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:25,039
um and uh so we heard a lot of a lot of

1853
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:26,720
tales from him

1854
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:28,559
about uh

1855
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:30,719
sort of like how it spread and how it

1856
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:33,119
started and what it was like and

1857
01:03:30,719 --> 01:03:35,358
the politics and the clubs

1858
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:36,960
right a lot of times clubs would name

1859
01:03:35,358 --> 01:03:38,798
something

1860
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:40,079
because they wanted to be the only club

1861
01:03:38,798 --> 01:03:42,000
with the louie

1862
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:43,599
or the only club with this and he has

1863
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,039
this funny story i can't tell it like

1864
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:46,640
him and he has a great accent i could

1865
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:49,599
never tell anything like that there was

1866
01:03:46,639 --> 01:03:51,199
someone there was some armenian that

1867
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:53,200
you know he would always joke about and

1868
01:03:51,199 --> 01:03:54,598
like he would be like

1869
01:03:53,199 --> 01:03:57,519
and he would be like

1870
01:03:54,599 --> 01:03:59,359
250 000

1871
01:03:57,519 --> 01:04:02,798
that's what he wanted for one rooted

1872
01:03:59,358 --> 01:04:04,078
snip of his og that he had yeah right

1873
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:06,079
and uh

1874
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:08,880
you know and so

1875
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:10,318
um you know it uh

1876
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:12,160
yeah but imagine paying eight thousand

1877
01:04:10,318 --> 01:04:14,239
dollars a pound and you find it seeded

1878
01:04:12,159 --> 01:04:16,318
to him that just meant he was going to

1879
01:04:14,239 --> 01:04:18,479
be able to grow

1880
01:04:16,318 --> 01:04:20,880
some of those seeds yeah and grow his

1881
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:23,199
own eight thousand dollar pounds yeah he

1882
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:25,519
was excited as all [ __ ] get out

1883
01:04:23,199 --> 01:04:27,118
yeah you know he was stoked

1884
01:04:25,519 --> 01:04:28,559
because that gave him away where it's

1885
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:30,240
like before it was like there was you

1886
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:32,640
think about the demand of la and how

1887
01:04:30,239 --> 01:04:34,719
many people live in los angeles

1888
01:04:32,639 --> 01:04:36,719
yeah and how much wealth there is and

1889
01:04:34,719 --> 01:04:39,439
when there's only a few garages or a few

1890
01:04:36,719 --> 01:04:41,598
rooms of these things cracking

1891
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:42,400
it goes [ __ ] lickety-split

1892
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:44,559
yeah

1893
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:47,519
yeah there's there's way more demand and

1894
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:49,440
so changed weed for from then on

1895
01:04:47,519 --> 01:04:51,838
and so maybe we should maybe we should

1896
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:52,880
take a step back from the story because

1897
01:04:51,838 --> 01:04:54,880
you know there's lots of people that

1898
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:56,240
like to talk specifics about the origins

1899
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:57,680
and how they're tied into it and all

1900
01:04:56,239 --> 01:04:59,118
that [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah whatever

1901
01:04:57,679 --> 01:05:00,719
specific cuts

1902
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:03,039
but what happened is is because that

1903
01:05:00,719 --> 01:05:05,679
weed was worth so much money

1904
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:08,400
and because it became so popular in this

1905
01:05:05,679 --> 01:05:11,838
area that had like 25 million humans

1906
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:14,318
yeah and it's sort of like a pop culture

1907
01:05:11,838 --> 01:05:15,679
like you know melting pot for lack of a

1908
01:05:14,318 --> 01:05:17,038
better term right

1909
01:05:15,679 --> 01:05:19,440
yeah um

1910
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:21,440
[ __ ] blew up

1911
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:23,200
and then all of a sudden all these

1912
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:25,119
different names popped up

1913
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:27,838
and everyone wanted to have their own

1914
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:29,680
and then what that also started doing

1915
01:05:27,838 --> 01:05:31,679
was because brokers could make more

1916
01:05:29,679 --> 01:05:34,000
money off kush

1917
01:05:31,679 --> 01:05:36,399
they started pushing all these people

1918
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:39,199
800 miles away in mendocino and humboldt

1919
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:41,358
and stuff county right yeah to grow weed

1920
01:05:39,199 --> 01:05:43,598
that they could make more money off

1921
01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:45,598
yep and they didn't want

1922
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:47,838
i mean you know like my buddy who gave

1923
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:50,640
me the flowrider

1924
01:05:47,838 --> 01:05:52,880
he didn't do it out of generosity

1925
01:05:50,639 --> 01:05:55,440
he did it because i was giving him the

1926
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:58,079
super dog and the dog and the maui and

1927
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:59,760
the super skunk and different things

1928
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:01,599
and he had this kush that he could make

1929
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:02,480
way better margin on

1930
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:05,359
yeah

1931
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:06,639
so he was like give me that grow this he

1932
01:06:05,358 --> 01:06:07,759
didn't tell me he was gonna make way

1933
01:06:06,639 --> 01:06:09,519
more money

1934
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:11,599
yeah i didn't even know that that was

1935
01:06:09,519 --> 01:06:14,318
the rate down there

1936
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:17,280
right yeah but what it did is it pushed

1937
01:06:14,318 --> 01:06:19,440
a lot of people to start growing similar

1938
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:21,519
stuff to feed the market

1939
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:23,519
yeah and the purple the purple craze

1940
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:25,440
that we talked about before with caleb

1941
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:27,199
and all that that sort of started like

1942
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:29,200
the do you have this clone only and you

1943
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:30,960
better have it and if you have this

1944
01:06:29,199 --> 01:06:33,679
specific clone only i'll buy all your

1945
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:35,358
wheat and if you don't it's going to be

1946
01:06:33,679 --> 01:06:36,159
less and maybe maybe i will maybe i

1947
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:38,639
won't

1948
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:40,239
yeah right and kush was another wave

1949
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:43,038
just like that

1950
01:06:40,239 --> 01:06:44,239
yeah you could sell every gram of kush

1951
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:46,240
you had

1952
01:06:44,239 --> 01:06:47,759
and so brokers started going around and

1953
01:06:46,239 --> 01:06:50,639
started trying to giving their i mean

1954
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:53,359
like who [ __ ] ghost right there was

1955
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:55,038
people that sold cuts of kush for thirty

1956
01:06:53,358 --> 01:06:56,400
to fifty thousand hundred thousand two

1957
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:59,119
hundred thousand dollars

1958
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:00,480
yeah and people saying it yeah because

1959
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:02,400
they could then they could fill rooms

1960
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:05,199
with it and it was like an investment

1961
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:07,039
yep there was violence over cush

1962
01:07:05,199 --> 01:07:08,399
which is how the you know i mean i don't

1963
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:11,039
we don't really like to tell that story

1964
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:13,358
too much but it does seem like the what

1965
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:14,400

the cush crew yeah and there was some

1969
01:07:18,719 --> 01:07:22,078
stress and some violence and some

1970
01:07:20,159 --> 01:07:23,519
whatever and they fled the they fled to

1971
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:25,280
the bay

1972
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:26,719
and they wanted to call it something

1973
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:27,440
else so they didn't get in trouble for

1974
01:07:26,719 --> 01:07:30,480
it

1975
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:31,280
yep and they chose the name headband

1976
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,280
right

1977
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:34,559
uh you know and then

1978
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:36,319
you know there's a lot of people that oh

1979
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:37,599
well what what cut we should talk about

1980
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:40,480
this too

1981
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:44,880
i firmly believe that the cut that josh

1982
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:46,639
brought to la first with matt

1983
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:48,640
it's really hard to figure out the

1984
01:07:46,639 --> 01:07:50,558
lineage

1985
01:07:48,639 --> 01:07:51,759
what do you mean as far as like what's

1986
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:53,440
actually in it yeah there's a bunch of

1987
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:54,720
people that think when they get ghost

1988
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:56,240
that that's it

1989
01:07:54,719 --> 01:07:58,239
yeah oh yeah yeah there's a bunch of

1990
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:59,838
people that think when they get 92 og

1991
01:07:58,239 --> 01:08:02,399
that that's it there's a bunch of people

1992
01:07:59,838 --> 01:08:03,358
that think when they pop josh d og seeds

1993
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,960
that it's

1994
01:08:03,358 --> 01:08:06,639
but forget about that one for a minute

1995
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:08,960
i'm just saying

1996
01:08:06,639 --> 01:08:11,598
some people think sfv

1997
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:15,119
some people think josh some people think

1998
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:17,520
ghost some people think 92 right someone

1999
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:19,600
mentioned that earlier again you know

2000
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:21,600
um and our buddy said he doesn't think

2001
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:22,960
any of those are it

2002
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:25,520
yeah

2003
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:26,560
right yeah so what happened in la is

2004
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:27,679
everybody came up with all these

2005
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:29,679
different names it's not even like

2006
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:31,520
there's one sfb there's a few that float

2007
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:33,679
around oh yeah

2008
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:35,600
there's not just one there's not one

2009
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:38,079
tahoe not one larry yeah for sure

2010
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:40,719
there's multiples so what you consider

2011
01:08:38,079 --> 01:08:42,479
is like sfv is it

2012
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:44,079
there might have been one time when it's

2013
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:45,919
when it was called it but a lot of

2014
01:08:44,079 --> 01:08:48,158
what's currently circulated right now is

2015
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:50,880
that isn't it yeah

2016
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:53,198
and some of the people that bought ghost

2017
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:55,279
off ghost like 20 years ago for high

2018
01:08:53,198 --> 01:08:56,079
dollar they don't think the ghost cut is

2019
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:57,520
it

2020
01:08:56,079 --> 01:08:59,600
does get passed around that's not what

2021
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:01,440
they got 20 years ago

2022
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:03,359
well the guy that goes around his ghost

2023
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:05,759
now that people talk about is not the

2024
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:07,838
same ghost that had the cut and traded

2025
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:09,439
with oregon kid from michigan most

2026
01:09:07,838 --> 01:09:11,519
people confused this cali guy with the

2027
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:12,399
original guy yeah there's a lot of first

2028
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:14,400
go

2029
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:15,519
the ghost cut right now isn't the first

2030
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:17,358
ghost cut

2031
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:18,960
and what everybody knows is ghost grow

2032
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:20,960
isn't the first ghost that passed the

2033
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,920
ghost cut who now lives in the midwest

2034
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,759
again

2035
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:25,600
yeah i don't even know if ghost grows

2036
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:27,520
the same one as the one that

2037
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:28,798
was going around calling himself kelly

2038
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:30,400
kush farms

2039
01:09:28,798 --> 01:09:31,679
that wasn't the michigan ghost the

2040
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:33,519
michigan ghost

2041
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:35,359
i talked to one of his buddies and he

2042
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:37,199
has to be put back in touch with oregon

2043
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:38,798
kid and that's the first time i realized

2044
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:40,559
that the ghost that was kind of hanging

2045
01:09:38,798 --> 01:09:42,000
around oregon kid wasn't the same ghost

2046
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:43,759
that passed the cut

2047
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,759
so i put him back in touch but i don't

2048
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:47,119
know what happened from there so people

2049
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:48,560
are people are ripping through the

2050
01:09:47,119 --> 01:09:50,238
stories or whatever right and it's

2051
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:52,400
because

2052
01:09:50,238 --> 01:09:54,319
the first people that the first people

2053
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:56,000
that brought it out sometimes with

2054
01:09:54,319 --> 01:09:57,279
certain strains you lose chain of

2055
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,198
custody

2056
01:09:57,279 --> 01:10:00,238
yeah you know i mean there was an issue

2057
01:09:59,198 --> 01:10:02,479
where

2058
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:04,000
freaking uh you know

2059
01:10:02,479 --> 01:10:06,000
i don't think josh will get too mad if i

2060
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,600
say this but like josh lost the cut in

2061
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,279
an accident

2062
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:10,960
and none of his friends in la wanted to

2063
01:10:09,279 --> 01:10:13,039
give it back to him

2064
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:14,800
and he had another story and he had to

2065
01:10:13,039 --> 01:10:16,800
go to a friend in the bay that he had

2066
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:18,079
stashed it with to get it back

2067
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:20,719
yeah

2068
01:10:18,079 --> 01:10:22,319
right yeah that's typical weed yeah

2069
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:23,679
because people were like oh it didn't

2070
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:25,759
even matter that he was the guy that

2071
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:27,760
they got it from it was profit

2072
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:31,360
yeah oh a lot of these original guys

2073
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:33,280
that had it they lost it right and

2074
01:10:31,359 --> 01:10:34,559
um and there's an aspect where it's like

2075
01:10:33,279 --> 01:10:36,158
and i don't mean i'm not saying that

2076
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:38,480
like people have fake ghosts what i'm

2077
01:10:36,158 --> 01:10:41,599
saying is is that there's four or five

2078
01:10:38,479 --> 01:10:42,799
cuts out there that all claim to be

2079
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:45,760
the cut

2080
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:47,440
that matt and josh brought to l.a that's

2081
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:49,280
what yeah exactly and they're different

2082
01:10:47,439 --> 01:10:51,359
and those cuts if you grow them side by

2083
01:10:49,279 --> 01:10:52,719
side they're not the same cut

2084
01:10:51,359 --> 01:10:54,158
yeah

2085
01:10:52,719 --> 01:10:55,760
like i don't and i don't mean like not

2086
01:10:54,158 --> 01:10:57,920
the same cut that they first brought i

2087
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:59,840
mean not the same cut to each other in

2088
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,719
the same room at the same time

2089
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:02,719
yeah

2090
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:07,359
so then how do you know how do you know

2091
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:09,679
what you know and nobody called 92 92

2092
01:11:07,359 --> 01:11:11,839
yeah that that's a more recent

2093
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:13,840
adaptation to the name that's a more

2094
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:16,000
recent adaptation the first name there

2095
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:17,760
was no going back to like when it was

2096
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:20,719
first around for a number of years no

2097
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:22,320
one called it 92. yeah

2098
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:24,000
that came later

2099
01:11:22,319 --> 01:11:25,039
yeah you know

2100
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,399
and so

2101
01:11:25,039 --> 01:11:28,560
you know we don't people don't know i

2102
01:11:26,399 --> 01:11:30,960
don't know if the 92 hollywood hills cut

2103
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:33,120
is the same as the flow rider

2104
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:35,119
we don't know

2105
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:37,359
could the flowrider be the exact same

2106
01:11:35,119 --> 01:11:41,279
cut that josh brought out to california

2107
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:43,759
to la it could i don't know

2108
01:11:41,279 --> 01:11:46,399
yeah you know i got that one early but i

2109
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:47,760
didn't get the josh cut early and i

2110
01:11:46,399 --> 01:11:49,439
didn't get it with provenance that i

2111
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:50,800
would know for sure

2112
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:53,039
yeah they don't know

2113
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:55,760
huh i see people keep asking about the

2114
01:11:53,039 --> 01:11:57,359
suge knight and the kush war that story

2115
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:59,119
is a bag of worms that no one wants to

2116
01:11:57,359 --> 01:12:01,119
touch because nobody has any facts

2117
01:11:59,119 --> 01:12:02,079
really around it so i'll leave it alone

2118
01:12:01,119 --> 01:12:03,679
but yeah

2119
01:12:02,079 --> 01:12:06,640
there's rumors going around that they

2120
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:08,640
might have some relation and one

2121
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:10,800
the one that you think would came first

2122
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:13,920
might not be the one that actually

2123
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:15,920
is the first one between the two

2124
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:18,000
yeah

2125
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:19,039
you know so so there's a lot there's

2126
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,719
basically

2127
01:12:19,039 --> 01:12:22,719
i bet there's a bunch of people that

2128
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:25,279
have different named og's out there that

2129
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:28,158
are the same og

2130
01:12:25,279 --> 01:12:31,439
and one guys one guy's larry could be

2131
01:12:28,158 --> 01:12:33,759
another guy's sfv could be another guy

2132
01:12:31,439 --> 01:12:35,599
yeah right because these names became

2133
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:37,360
interchangeable and then you start

2134
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:39,679
adding names and then you start getting

2135
01:12:37,359 --> 01:12:43,039
louie and fire and

2136
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:45,039
you know diablo and yeah and da da da da

2137
01:12:43,039 --> 01:12:46,560
da then there's all the pure cush names

2138
01:12:45,039 --> 01:12:48,000
and all those riffs and then there's the

2139
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:49,679
master cushes

2140
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,840
and two or three of the master cushes

2141
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:53,840
looked like bubba kushes

2142
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:56,239
yeah and one of them that i used to have

2143
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:57,360
was tall and lanky and dark and very

2144
01:12:56,238 --> 01:12:59,599
stringy

2145
01:12:57,359 --> 01:13:01,279
i still think two dogs i still think two

2146
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:03,600
dog has the [ __ ] socal master every

2147
01:13:01,279 --> 01:13:05,359
time i see it it looks exactly like it

2148
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:06,239
hell's angels and then yeah they'll say

2149
01:13:05,359 --> 01:13:07,359
that

2150
01:13:06,238 --> 01:13:09,198
you know yeah you could you could

2151
01:13:07,359 --> 01:13:11,198
probably name and there was probably a

2152
01:13:09,198 --> 01:13:13,678
10-year period where like you could walk

2153
01:13:11,198 --> 01:13:15,919
into a club and they would have 20 25

2154
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:17,359
different names on the menu of cush

2155
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:19,840
yeah

2156
01:13:17,359 --> 01:13:22,719
right oh yeah yeah some some some

2157
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:25,039
collectors out here were only ogs and

2158
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:26,640
that was their [ __ ] like we only carry

2159
01:13:25,039 --> 01:13:29,359
ogs it would be a [ __ ] list of like

2160
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:31,199
40 different ogs yeah and what's funny

2161
01:13:29,359 --> 01:13:32,559
is that you know [ __ ] dude ghost grow

2162
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:34,319
or whatever he rages because there's

2163
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:36,480
people in la that their entire career

2164
01:13:34,319 --> 01:13:39,119
has just been learning how to grow kush

2165
01:13:36,479 --> 01:13:42,079
yeah and selling it for high dollar

2166
01:13:39,119 --> 01:13:45,198
yeah and it had such a long successful

2167
01:13:42,079 --> 01:13:47,279
popular run before things changed

2168
01:13:45,198 --> 01:13:49,198
that some people's entire careers have

2169
01:13:47,279 --> 01:13:50,479
just been cropping kush

2170
01:13:49,198 --> 01:13:54,799
yeah

2171
01:13:50,479 --> 01:13:56,639
you know um but there's no like there's

2172
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:59,039
so there's this aspect where because

2173
01:13:56,640 --> 01:14:00,400
it's one of the most famous families of

2174
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:02,880
weed out there

2175
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:05,198
yeah there's a bunch of origin stories

2176
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:07,039
and there's a bunch of claims and

2177
01:14:05,198 --> 01:14:09,519
probably most of the cuts that came out

2178
01:14:07,039 --> 01:14:10,560
of la are bad seat

2179
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:12,880
yeah

2180
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:14,239
one would think

2181
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:15,760
and then sometimes that's what i've

2182
01:14:14,238 --> 01:14:17,039
always thought and then sometimes a

2183
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:18,719
different crew would get it and they'd

2184
01:14:17,039 --> 01:14:21,279
throw a different name on it yeah or

2185
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:22,960
just renames and bag seeds yeah

2186
01:14:21,279 --> 01:14:24,639
yeah and then you know i mean i like

2187
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:26,640
josh or whatever but josh did the stupid

2188
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:31,520
[ __ ] thing where he took

2189
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:33,840
he took like uh what h a og and and

2190
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:35,280
something else and something and crossed

2191
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:37,039
it all together and then called it

2192
01:14:35,279 --> 01:14:39,039
original josh d

2193
01:14:37,039 --> 01:14:41,840
no that was karma who did that

2194
01:14:39,039 --> 01:14:44,319
that was karma yeah i was karma's doing

2195
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:47,039
not not just yeah oh god well then yeah

2196
01:14:44,319 --> 01:14:48,960
karma can suck it uh yeah because

2197
01:14:47,039 --> 01:14:50,079
because there's an obvious play to tie

2198
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,920
it to

2199
01:14:50,079 --> 01:14:55,279
yeah you know yeah use like triangle

2200
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:56,960
kush and oh yeah oh and and h-a-o-g and

2201
01:14:55,279 --> 01:14:59,840
something else

2202
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:02,079
[ __ ] yeah yeah

2203
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:03,440
you know but yeah and so we never heard

2204
01:15:02,079 --> 01:15:05,519
when was the first time you even heard

2205
01:15:03,439 --> 01:15:07,759
the word 90 did you even hear the term

2206
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:10,159
92 og the first 10 years you heard about

2207
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:12,960
og i didn't really hear that until like

2208
01:15:10,158 --> 01:15:15,039
four or five years ago the 92 attachment

2209
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:16,800
that specific year

2210
01:15:15,039 --> 01:15:18,319
yeah and so now people are like oh well

2211
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:19,920
is this this should be the first one

2212
01:15:18,319 --> 01:15:20,960
right it's the 92 it's the one that

2213
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:22,319
started it

2214
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:24,239
yeah

2215
01:15:22,319 --> 01:15:25,439
and it's like one of the more recent og

2216
01:15:24,238 --> 01:15:26,399
names

2217
01:15:25,439 --> 01:15:27,919
yeah

2218
01:15:26,399 --> 01:15:29,359
you know how did the louis get started

2219
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:31,119
how did the fire get started how did

2220
01:15:29,359 --> 01:15:33,759
this get started like it's hard to find

2221
01:15:31,119 --> 01:15:36,079
these stories yeah because people don't

2222
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:37,600
have a a interest in honesty what they

2223
01:15:36,079 --> 01:15:38,399
were trying to do

2224
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:40,880
is

2225
01:15:38,399 --> 01:15:43,198
sell a different kush for a high dollar

2226
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:45,440
oh there you go yeah here you go nature

2227
01:15:43,198 --> 01:15:47,119
farm has all those old something and

2228
01:15:45,439 --> 01:15:49,919
they aren't dutted there you go so now

2229
01:15:47,119 --> 01:15:52,559
you know now you know yeah

2230
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:54,960
he's got k f cures duds i've seen his

2231
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:57,360
movie yeah we've seen his movie he's got

2232
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:59,119
everything you want

2233
01:15:57,359 --> 01:16:01,759
you know he doesn't do any like negative

2234
01:15:59,119 --> 01:16:02,640
testing or anything like that but

2235
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:05,039
you know

2236
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:07,119
he just knows he's just got the sense

2237
01:16:05,039 --> 01:16:10,640
you know um

2238
01:16:07,119 --> 01:16:12,399
but yeah fire og is rascal sfv or maybe

2239
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:13,360
fire og to somebody else is something

2240
01:16:12,399 --> 01:16:15,359
different

2241
01:16:13,359 --> 01:16:16,158
fire og is a clone

2242
01:16:15,359 --> 01:16:18,799
um

2243
01:16:16,158 --> 01:16:20,559
it came out of a tray of clones

2244
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:22,560
and it wasn't i don't know which

2245
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:24,320
specific og it was but and i don't think

2246
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:26,239
he was told anything more than og and it

2247
01:16:24,319 --> 01:16:28,960
was fire so he called it fire og that

2248
01:16:26,238 --> 01:16:30,000
was it and then later on um swerve made

2249
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:32,000
a cross

2250
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:34,719
of fire og and something else very

2251
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,479
correctly and called it raskology

2252
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:39,198
yeah and so it's one of those things

2253
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:42,319
that one of the biggest things about og

2254
01:16:39,198 --> 01:16:44,879
is that og og and sauer but especially

2255
01:16:42,319 --> 01:16:48,158
og are is probably one of the first

2256
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:51,119
strains that like it just dominated

2257
01:16:48,158 --> 01:16:52,559
breeding and hybrids for so long

2258
01:16:51,119 --> 01:16:55,599
yeah

2259
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:57,520
you know and what's interesting is like

2260
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:58,800
for a long time

2261
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:00,640
maybe we should talk about this for a

2262
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:03,119
second but for a long time

2263
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:04,960
um people would work ogs and they would

2264
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:05,679
breed with ogs that they would s one

2265
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:06,880
them

2266
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:08,560
and

2267
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:10,079
kind of the best pheno would be the one

2268
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,880
that looked like mom

2269
01:17:10,079 --> 01:17:12,800
yeah

2270
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:15,039
right yep it was really weird it was

2271
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:17,119
like you wouldn't find a bunch of [ __ ]

2272
01:17:15,039 --> 01:17:19,920
and uh the good ones would be the ones

2273
01:17:17,119 --> 01:17:24,399
that look exactly like the parent

2274
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:26,719
and then caleb uh reversed the tk

2275
01:17:24,399 --> 01:17:28,639
and he got a much wider variety of cool

2276
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:31,439
phenos

2277
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:33,600
yeah and he found ghost in there

2278
01:17:31,439 --> 01:17:35,759
and he found he found ones that looked

2279
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:37,760
like a lot of popular ones

2280
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:39,920
and that's that's like one of those ways

2281
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:41,760
for a breeder if you're a breeder to

2282
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:45,119
know that you have

2283
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:48,159
like uh you have a mother type situation

2284
01:17:45,119 --> 01:17:50,000
of a bunch of other cuts is when you s1

2285
01:17:48,158 --> 01:17:51,839
it and you're seeing all those sister

2286
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,800
and brother or finos popping out of what

2287
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:54,800
you just

2288
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:56,880
made and that's how you kind of get the

2289
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:59,520
idea that triangle might be the

2290
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:02,480
predecessor so it's it's interesting

2291
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:04,400
because if if you know if there was bag

2292
01:18:02,479 --> 01:18:07,119
seed and there was multiple

2293
01:18:04,399 --> 01:18:08,639
cush strains found in that bag seed

2294
01:18:07,119 --> 01:18:10,719
yeah then the initial bag seed would

2295
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:13,600
probably be a hybrid maybe

2296
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:15,520
right uh and you know it seems like

2297
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:17,360
there's there's at least one maybe a few

2298
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:19,840
cushions out there that throw much wider

2299
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:21,679
phenos than most of them yeah so it

2300
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:23,679
almost leads it it almost leads you to

2301
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:25,440
believe that a lot of these cushes are

2302
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:27,679
lucky bag seats

2303
01:18:25,439 --> 01:18:30,559
yeah that people found and named but

2304
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:32,560
because it's an s-1 of cush already

2305
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:33,600
it kind of looks like itself for the

2306
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:35,199
most part

2307
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:37,840
yeah it's one of the it's one of the

2308
01:18:35,198 --> 01:18:40,879
reasons why caleb and i believe that the

2309
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:43,679
chem dog the 91 itself might be an s1

2310
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:44,880
yeah because it throws such a narrow

2311
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:46,719
band

2312
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:48,640
yeah of phenos

2313
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:50,239
like there's a bunch of there's a bunch

2314
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:51,440
of physically it doesn't look very

2315
01:18:50,238 --> 01:18:54,399
different

2316
01:18:51,439 --> 01:18:55,759
um potency-wise it can vary quite a bit

2317
01:18:54,399 --> 01:18:57,519
in some flavor

2318
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:59,280
but there's a really narrow band of

2319
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:02,239
physical expression

2320
01:18:59,279 --> 01:19:04,319
yeah and a lot of cushions are like that

2321
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:05,439
yeah probably because they're backseat

2322
01:19:04,319 --> 01:19:07,198
yeah

2323
01:19:05,439 --> 01:19:11,039
you know and it's also interesting too

2324
01:19:07,198 --> 01:19:13,039
that like um you know i mean the

2325
01:19:11,039 --> 01:19:13,760
the two of the most famous strains out

2326
01:19:13,039 --> 01:19:16,719
there

2327
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:19,520
um the kush and the sour diesel

2328
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:20,800
neither one of them reverse very easily

2329
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:23,760
yeah

2330
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:24,800
a lot of failure with those

2331
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:27,199
right

2332
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:29,039
yep yeah they suck they say they suck so

2333
01:19:27,198 --> 01:19:31,198
a lot of times a lot of times things get

2334
01:19:29,039 --> 01:19:32,640
reversed onto them

2335
01:19:31,198 --> 01:19:34,158
yeah

2336
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:35,760
you know that's that's usually how it

2337
01:19:34,158 --> 01:19:38,079
goes the only

2338
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:40,800
the only real ogs i'm seeing people like

2339
01:19:38,079 --> 01:19:42,079
regularly reverse or og hybrids and they

2340
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:43,760
they have to get lucky and find

2341
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:45,840
something that'll reverse well but most

2342
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:47,679
of these old og cuts be it you know bad

2343
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:50,960
seats and back seats and we're finding

2344
01:19:47,679 --> 01:19:53,440
that like s2s s3s [ __ ] like that doesn't

2345
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:55,520
reverse well for whatever reason it's

2346
01:19:53,439 --> 01:19:57,678
really hard to reverse like a

2347
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:59,840
multiple self or multiple backseat

2348
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:02,239
generations and that makes sense for og

2349
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:04,000
it makes sense for a lot of these ogs

2350
01:20:02,238 --> 01:20:06,238
you know so it's like yeah they they

2351
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:08,479
ended up getting outcrossed

2352
01:20:06,238 --> 01:20:10,718
and then people would would reverse some

2353
01:20:08,479 --> 01:20:12,319
of them looking for better [ __ ] and the

2354
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:13,520
best [ __ ] that they would find was the

2355
01:20:12,319 --> 01:20:14,719
[ __ ] that looked like the [ __ ] they

2356
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:16,000
already had

2357
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:18,800
yeah

2358
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:20,319
and i got kind of over og

2359
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:22,159
because while i think it is an amazing

2360
01:20:20,319 --> 01:20:23,519
strain and i'm not here trying to dis it

2361
01:20:22,158 --> 01:20:25,119
or anything like that

2362
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:26,800
i don't think that its genetic

2363
01:20:25,119 --> 01:20:29,359
expression is wide enough that you would

2364
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:31,119
need to keep 20 different ones yeah and

2365
01:20:29,359 --> 01:20:32,960
you're like this one's earthy this one's

2366
01:20:31,119 --> 01:20:34,880
lemony this one has a slight hint of

2367
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:36,399
this this one's more tennis balls this

2368
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:39,119
one's darker

2369
01:20:36,399 --> 01:20:41,679
you know yeah uh look at that matt

2370
01:20:39,119 --> 01:20:42,960
someone wants you to s1 the hogs breath

2371
01:20:41,679 --> 01:20:45,119
yeah i've done it before i'll do it

2372
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:46,719
again i haven't i haven't i haven't run

2373
01:20:45,119 --> 01:20:48,158
it again once it started getting past i

2374
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:50,319
dropped it so somebody asked an

2375
01:20:48,158 --> 01:20:52,000
interesting question why does s2 and s3

2376
01:20:50,319 --> 01:20:54,479
and all that get harder

2377
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:57,279
um because what happens is is you're

2378
01:20:54,479 --> 01:20:59,839
selfing so there's only one set of genes

2379
01:20:57,279 --> 01:21:02,158
and so every time you self you increase

2380
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:04,639
the propensity of recessive traits that

2381
01:21:02,158 --> 01:21:07,439
are negative to be able to pop

2382
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:10,000
yeah right and so the deeper you go into

2383
01:21:07,439 --> 01:21:11,599
selfing the more narrower you're putting

2384
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,359
the genetic pool

2385
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:14,639
yeah and that's when issues start

2386
01:21:13,359 --> 01:21:16,079
happening

2387
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:17,520
that's why there's rules against

2388
01:21:16,079 --> 01:21:19,600
anything

2389
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:21,199
for humans you're not allowed to bang

2390
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:23,440
your sister or your first cousin doesn't

2391
01:21:21,198 --> 01:21:27,279
go well or your mom or your uncle or you

2392
01:21:23,439 --> 01:21:29,439
let me tell you from personal experience

2393
01:21:27,279 --> 01:21:31,039
yeah that [ __ ] sucks bro

2394
01:21:29,439 --> 01:21:32,559
yeah i mean it took out the whole royal

2395
01:21:31,039 --> 01:21:33,359
families of europe

2396
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:35,600
yeah

2397
01:21:33,359 --> 01:21:37,279
they needed some outcrossing

2398
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:38,880
yeah they kept selfing essentially

2399
01:21:37,279 --> 01:21:40,880
almost yeah

2400
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:43,199
so that's why and then and then you know

2401
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:45,600
as things get as things get more narrow

2402
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:48,079
a lot of times s3 s4

2403
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:50,000
it starts getting a lot weaker

2404
01:21:48,079 --> 01:21:51,519
it starts getting a lot more prone to

2405
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:54,880
lack of vigor

2406
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:56,719
stress other aspects and there's a lot

2407
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:57,760
of regular breeding

2408
01:21:56,719 --> 01:21:59,840
um

2409
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:02,639
there's a lot of regular breeding

2410
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:04,719
that uses selfing successfully

2411
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:06,800
but it does agriculture in normal

2412
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:08,719
agriculture absolutely selfing is a

2413
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:11,600
massively used technique with great

2414
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:15,279
success yeah in cannabis it seems to

2415
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:17,280
have negative connotations taken

2416
01:22:15,279 --> 01:22:19,198
maybe maybe people have a different idea

2417
01:22:17,279 --> 01:22:20,880
but for me at least

2418
01:22:19,198 --> 01:22:22,719
what it seems like selfing the biggest

2419
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:24,639
thing is is because most of the things

2420
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:26,960
that we have are our

2421
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:29,520
individual cuts and not seed lines

2422
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:31,679
anymore yeah it allows you to see what

2423
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:33,679
else is in the genetics besides that one

2424
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:36,560
expression yes

2425
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:38,960
you know if if you had you know a

2426
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:41,120
hundred seeds of what og kush came out

2427
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:42,319
of and it was males and females you'd

2428
01:22:41,119 --> 01:22:45,519
have a line

2429
01:22:42,319 --> 01:22:47,759
yeah but if you have a cut

2430
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:49,760
then how do you how do you see what it

2431
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:51,520
is pure not outcrossed

2432
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:53,840
yeah

2433
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:55,920
so a lot of times i mean caleb talks all

2434
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:57,679
the time like if people are looking for

2435
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:58,719
consistency in

2436
01:22:57,679 --> 01:23:00,960
in um

2437
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:02,399
in seed then the way to go is some of

2438
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:04,000
his outcrosses

2439
01:23:02,399 --> 01:23:07,439
yeah a lot of the um

2440
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:09,439
the the feminized hybrids yeah feminized

2441
01:23:07,439 --> 01:23:11,759
hybrids

2442
01:23:09,439 --> 01:23:14,479
if you're looking for specific phenoes

2443
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:16,320
but you're willing to tolerate more junk

2444
01:23:14,479 --> 01:23:18,238
yeah go to the s-ones

2445
01:23:16,319 --> 01:23:19,840
yeah but the s-ones are gonna have a

2446
01:23:18,238 --> 01:23:21,678
certain amount of recessive stuff in

2447
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:24,480
there that's undesirable

2448
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:27,039
yeah does it bread with itself

2449
01:23:24,479 --> 01:23:29,119
so the outcrosses you know urkel

2450
01:23:27,039 --> 01:23:32,079
reversed onto kush would will be more

2451
01:23:29,119 --> 01:23:34,079
consistent than urkel onto urkel

2452
01:23:32,079 --> 01:23:36,399
that's why again why like when i talk

2453
01:23:34,079 --> 01:23:37,679
about the blue bonnet and despite what

2454
01:23:36,399 --> 01:23:39,679
was said about it that it was a pure

2455
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:41,440
blueberry line i still think to this day

2456
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:43,520
that it's hybrid because all those

2457
01:23:41,439 --> 01:23:45,839
recessive traits that blueberry usually

2458
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:48,719
carries uh when you further inbreed it

2459
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:50,800
are gone completely erased and i talked

2460
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:53,039
before about how i didn't like the the

2461
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:55,039
pure blue lines very much at all yeah

2462
01:23:53,039 --> 01:23:57,119
yeah um but then you outcross them to

2463
01:23:55,039 --> 01:23:58,079
different other amazing things and those

2464
01:23:57,119 --> 01:24:00,079
kids

2465
01:23:58,079 --> 01:24:02,000
came out way better than the parent in

2466
01:24:00,079 --> 01:24:04,158
my opinion exactly and i think it just

2467
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:07,039
it's i think it was massive inbreeding

2468
01:24:04,158 --> 01:24:09,599
going on in such a small environment and

2469
01:24:07,039 --> 01:24:12,158
the constant crossing of two

2470
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:14,400
uh two distinctly different

2471
01:24:12,158 --> 01:24:16,799
expressions like crossing indica to

2472
01:24:14,399 --> 01:24:18,238
sativa or whatever most people don't

2473
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:19,679
breed like that they breed in this

2474
01:24:18,238 --> 01:24:21,039
direction most people don't keep

2475
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:22,800
constantly in

2476
01:24:21,039 --> 01:24:24,960
crossing two different types through

2477
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:27,119
generations and that that causes a weird

2478
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:29,439
inbreeding to go on and and

2479
01:24:27,119 --> 01:24:32,880
and not all the best traits to be a

2480
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:35,039
parent dj is really unusual dude

2481
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:37,920
because if you believe in what he says

2482
01:24:35,039 --> 01:24:41,840
he basically took four plants

2483
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:43,840
and never added anything else yeah yeah

2484
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:46,239
and everything that he has comes from

2485
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:47,199
those four plants yeah right it was like

2486
01:24:46,238 --> 01:24:50,718
a

2487
01:24:47,198 --> 01:24:53,599
oregon purple tie and a juicy fruit tie

2488
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:55,760
and an honey and an afghani yeah and

2489
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:57,520
maybe something else or that's it

2490
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:59,760
the the the oregon purple tie was

2491
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:00,880
chocolate thai wahawk and gold so it's

2492
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:03,039
like yeah

2493
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:06,159
yeah okay count those two but if you

2494
01:25:03,039 --> 01:25:07,840
count those two it's four yeah exactly

2495
01:25:06,158 --> 01:25:10,079
you know and then a lot of times all

2496
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:11,440
those things were only used once

2497
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:13,920
according to him

2498
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:16,000
never never back crossed to again or

2499
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:18,719
reintroduced and he just lied and he

2500
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:20,079
just worked within the lines yeah

2501
01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:22,079
and so you know

2502
01:25:20,079 --> 01:25:24,840
uh camara has talked about how he kind

2503
01:25:22,079 --> 01:25:28,479
of views all of dj's stuff as this big

2504
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:30,000
mangled inbred specific thing

2505
01:25:28,479 --> 01:25:32,399
yeah but at least that's cool because

2506
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:35,279
you never mixed anything else into it

2507
01:25:32,399 --> 01:25:40,000
yeah but that's really unusual it is

2508
01:25:35,279 --> 01:25:43,519
it's everything about how he made

2509
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:45,760
i i agree like i spent i spent several

2510
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:49,360
thousand dollars on on those specific

2511
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:51,679
seeds and i had to really work to find

2512
01:25:49,359 --> 01:25:52,880
things that were good blueberry terps

2513
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:55,119
because that just wasn't what i was

2514
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:58,480
seeing in the line i told you i ran 400

2515
01:25:55,119 --> 01:25:59,279
and 450 of four of his lines yeah you

2516
01:25:58,479 --> 01:26:01,678
know

2517
01:25:59,279 --> 01:26:02,880
and uh i wish i was bragging about

2518
01:26:01,679 --> 01:26:04,560
keepers

2519
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:05,840
yeah but you know like i wouldn't have

2520
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:07,600
loop on it without those lines so

2521
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:09,119
there's great potential in those lines

2522
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:10,800
but i think like you said it's it's in

2523
01:26:09,119 --> 01:26:12,399
the hybridization

2524
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:14,000
it's in the hybridization you know it's

2525
01:26:12,399 --> 01:26:15,519
kind of like that thing with like you

2526
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:18,238
know the closest thing that we have to

2527
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:20,320
uh to an actual ibl people throw around

2528
01:26:18,238 --> 01:26:22,879
ibl all the time it drives yeah nine

2529
01:26:20,319 --> 01:26:25,198
nuts yeah ibl's

2530
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:26,560
yeah right because an ibl is essentially

2531
01:26:25,198 --> 01:26:28,638
something that's been bred so

2532
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:29,920
consistently that it just is what it is

2533
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:31,199
yeah it is what it is everything's

2534
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:32,639
looking like clones of each other from

2535
01:26:31,198 --> 01:26:34,158
something and everything looks like

2536
01:26:32,639 --> 01:26:35,520
clones of each other so if you have some

2537
01:26:34,158 --> 01:26:38,638
kind of ideal where you're trying to

2538
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:40,239
grow fields of exact replicas it might

2539
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:42,880
be a good tech

2540
01:26:40,238 --> 01:26:44,479
if you want to breed all of the genetic

2541
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:45,920
diversity out of your [ __ ] and

2542
01:26:44,479 --> 01:26:47,519
everything that you cross with it is

2543
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:50,960
going to look like it

2544
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:53,120
yeah then you know [ __ ]

2545
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:56,480
yeah you know but i mean that that g

2546
01:26:53,119 --> 01:26:58,319
that 88 g13 hash plant kind of throws

2547
01:26:56,479 --> 01:26:59,279
phenos that are just like it

2548
01:26:58,319 --> 01:27:01,519
yeah

2549
01:26:59,279 --> 01:27:03,279
junk you cross things the jeep chunk and

2550
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:05,520
it's very deep chunkish

2551
01:27:03,279 --> 01:27:07,599
yeah yeah well though gene did point out

2552
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:10,080
that like there are so

2553
01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:12,239
i when i refer to ibl's i do think a

2554
01:27:10,079 --> 01:27:14,079
deep chunk because visually it is it is

2555
01:27:12,238 --> 01:27:17,198
very uniform i mean there's like two

2556
01:27:14,079 --> 01:27:18,559
phenos like two uh uh

2557
01:27:17,198 --> 01:27:21,359
visually

2558
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:22,480
expressive phenos that look

2559
01:27:21,359 --> 01:27:24,479
distinct

2560
01:27:22,479 --> 01:27:26,718
but when you smoke it some have a much

2561
01:27:24,479 --> 01:27:28,799
better hive than the others so true

2562
01:27:26,719 --> 01:27:30,960
and that i i when i was speaking about

2563
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:33,119
it i was only speaking visually when it

2564
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:34,960
when in fact a true ibl would be for all

2565
01:27:33,119 --> 01:27:37,198
traits across the board but that's why

2566
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:39,600
it drives matt and i nuts because there

2567
01:27:37,198 --> 01:27:40,638
are no ibl's in cannabis yeah you just

2568
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,520
can't

2569
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:43,760
and so

2570
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:47,120
and so an ibl is basically something

2571
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:48,719
that breeds true for all traits yeah and

2572
01:27:47,119 --> 01:27:51,519
all the seeds are going to be very

2573
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:53,840
narrow within that tiny little band yeah

2574
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:56,400
you can have a true breeding stream

2575
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:58,319
that's only true breeding for one trait

2576
01:27:56,399 --> 01:28:00,559
yeah like the bonnet it's true breeding

2577
01:27:58,319 --> 01:28:02,639
for blueberry terps and that's it

2578
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:04,159
right or you know you could have you

2579
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:06,079
could have something like skunk one

2580
01:28:04,158 --> 01:28:08,799
that's true breeding for

2581
01:28:06,079 --> 01:28:11,279
you know improving calyx to leaf ratio

2582
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:13,920
or you know bud structure or this or

2583
01:28:11,279 --> 01:28:16,479
that but it has a variety of terps or

2584
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:17,600
you know things in it you know so true

2585
01:28:16,479 --> 01:28:19,919
breeding

2586
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:21,679
and ibl is like the furthest example of

2587
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:24,719
true breeding it's like when all the

2588
01:28:21,679 --> 01:28:26,880
characteristics are the same yeah

2589
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:29,119
and true breeding is just one or more of

2590
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:30,800
the characteristics you can count on

2591
01:28:29,119 --> 01:28:32,880
seeing in the project

2592
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:34,400
yeah so when someone the other day i

2593
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:36,960
can't recall who it was it was i think

2594
01:28:34,399 --> 01:28:38,960
it was a lady was saying that um

2595
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:40,319
that they have an f2 ibl

2596
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:41,760
and people are like what the [ __ ] that

2597
01:28:40,319 --> 01:28:43,679
doesn't make any sense and that lady was

2598
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:45,280
like no it makes sense it doesn't make

2599
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:47,199
sense to have an f2 ibo it's not

2600
01:28:45,279 --> 01:28:49,119
possible no and so there's a lot of

2601
01:28:47,198 --> 01:28:52,000
terms that are thrown around ibl is the

2602
01:28:49,119 --> 01:28:53,920
worst one because yeah um you should be

2603
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:56,399
able to buy a hundred seeds of an ibl

2604
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:58,719
and see less than two percent variation

2605
01:28:56,399 --> 01:29:01,198
yeah and i think i think uh what where

2606
01:28:58,719 --> 01:29:03,520
the miscommunication is is that a line

2607
01:29:01,198 --> 01:29:06,000
being inbred is not the same thing as an

2608
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:07,840
inbred line and line breeding is not the

2609
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:10,880
same thing as an ibl

2610
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:13,840
you know ibl so specific and line

2611
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:17,199
breeding and in breeding in a line

2612
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:19,279
don't denote an ivl it is a process to

2613
01:29:17,198 --> 01:29:20,559
getting towards an ivl but i think

2614
01:29:19,279 --> 01:29:22,319
that's where where a lot of confusion

2615
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:26,400
lies yeah if there's if there's a bunch

2616
01:29:22,319 --> 01:29:28,399
of variation of of any traits at all in

2617
01:29:26,399 --> 01:29:30,399
your weed it's not an ibl

2618
01:29:28,399 --> 01:29:32,638
yeah

2619
01:29:30,399 --> 01:29:35,119
you know exactly ibl's is basically a

2620
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:37,039
way to an agriculture to grow clones of

2621
01:29:35,119 --> 01:29:38,960
each other from seed stock

2622
01:29:37,039 --> 01:29:40,719
yeah that's its goal

2623
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:42,319
yeah so you know if you're going to grow

2624
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:43,520
an ibl for weed it's like you're going

2625
01:29:42,319 --> 01:29:45,198
to breed

2626
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:46,480
all the cool [ __ ] out of it and it's not

2627
01:29:45,198 --> 01:29:48,559
going to be worth breeding with once

2628
01:29:46,479 --> 01:29:50,158
it's an ibl for the most part because

2629
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:51,440
it's going to have such a narrow range

2630
01:29:50,158 --> 01:29:52,719
it's going to make everything look like

2631
01:29:51,439 --> 01:29:54,319
itself

2632
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:56,560
yeah and so hopefully you know so if you

2633
01:29:54,319 --> 01:29:57,599
made an ibl maybe it would be just you

2634
01:29:56,560 --> 01:29:59,039
know if it was something that was just

2635
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:00,320
so incredible but it'd probably be a

2636
01:29:59,039 --> 01:30:02,079
bunch of words

2637
01:30:00,319 --> 01:30:03,279
yeah it'd probably be a bunch of work

2638
01:30:02,079 --> 01:30:04,238
and it would suck

2639
01:30:03,279 --> 01:30:06,639
yeah

2640
01:30:04,238 --> 01:30:08,399
you know realistically speaking and it's

2641
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:11,039
in in cannabis another reason it's very

2642
01:30:08,399 --> 01:30:12,479
hard to to make ibl's is because males

2643
01:30:11,039 --> 01:30:14,319
express different than females even if

2644
01:30:12,479 --> 01:30:16,158
they are the same expression males are

2645
01:30:14,319 --> 01:30:18,880
all even if they're the same

2646
01:30:16,158 --> 01:30:20,319
uh general phenotype they the male

2647
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:21,920
always grows taller than the female so

2648
01:30:20,319 --> 01:30:22,799
they don't look identical so trying to

2649
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:25,359
choose

2650
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:27,600
the male expression of a female line

2651
01:30:25,359 --> 01:30:29,599
that you want to find is very [ __ ]

2652
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:31,520
hard to do you know that's why it's much

2653
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:32,560
easier and faster to do it through

2654
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:33,920
selfing

2655
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:35,120
and there's an aspect too where someone

2656
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:37,039
was like well what if you just picked a

2657
01:30:35,119 --> 01:30:39,920
really good plant to ibl

2658
01:30:37,039 --> 01:30:42,319
that's assuming that all those traits

2659
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:44,239
will be the dominant trait yeah the more

2660
01:30:42,319 --> 01:30:46,000
that you breat and breed into itself and

2661
01:30:44,238 --> 01:30:48,799
you're not gonna lose them

2662
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:50,800
by inbreeding yeah

2663
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:52,960
you know um

2664
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:54,719
you know so so there's an aspect there

2665
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:56,399
where it's like it someone just said

2666
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:57,760
that's a good question i missed whatever

2667
01:30:56,399 --> 01:30:59,839
the question was yeah i was trying to

2668
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:02,400
list for it just now i don't if matt if

2669
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:04,079
you can find it or someone wants to uh

2670
01:31:02,399 --> 01:31:07,439
you know um

2671
01:31:04,079 --> 01:31:09,039
the whole thing there is no cubed term

2672
01:31:07,439 --> 01:31:12,638
the only [ __ ] that ever used the

2673
01:31:09,039 --> 01:31:15,760
term cute like like the c99 really cubed

2674
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:18,639
that was a mr soul thing that was sort

2675
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:20,400
his own terminology for he still has his

2676
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:22,239
and he even after this he still has his

2677
01:31:20,399 --> 01:31:24,879
[ __ ] training wheels he needs to slow

2678
01:31:22,238 --> 01:31:27,039
down oh my god but yeah there's no

2679
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:28,800
cubing was just like he found some bag

2680
01:31:27,039 --> 01:31:30,880
seed and he started inbreeding it to

2681
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:33,279
itself a bunch

2682
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:35,760
you know um which was already probably

2683
01:31:33,279 --> 01:31:37,599
inbred but yeah it's not only lock in

2684
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:38,480
shitty traits it's like

2685
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,840
you know

2686
01:31:38,479 --> 01:31:41,519
one of the reasons why they don't want

2687
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:43,520
you to bang your sister

2688
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:45,520
um is because the [ __ ] that happens to

2689
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:47,440
you when you start breeding humans too

2690
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:49,760
close is a lot of

2691
01:31:47,439 --> 01:31:51,919
mental issues physical issues various

2692
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:54,880
kinds of things start popping up that in

2693
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:57,840
normal humans are never dominant

2694
01:31:54,880 --> 01:32:00,960
yeah but if you inbreed enough you can

2695
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:02,880
combine those two not dominant genes and

2696
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:04,399
it'll pop dominant

2697
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:07,039
oh

2698
01:32:04,399 --> 01:32:08,638
that question he said what about this

2699
01:32:07,039 --> 01:32:10,560
isn't a real question what about

2700
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:13,520
recombinant infrared line like tony

2701
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:15,679
green and gg4 rio i can't even answer

2702
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:17,199
that like without laughing stop guys

2703
01:32:15,679 --> 01:32:18,800
please

2704
01:32:17,198 --> 01:32:21,198
you know and i think that's the guy who

2705
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:23,360
who was talking [ __ ] about um caleb and

2706
01:32:21,198 --> 01:32:24,799
said he was at like f12 or some [ __ ]

2707
01:32:23,359 --> 01:32:26,639
nothing

2708
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:28,400
there's an aspect where it's like let's

2709
01:32:26,639 --> 01:32:30,800
let's let's be honest it's like there's

2710
01:32:28,399 --> 01:32:32,799
a lot of there's a lot of terms that get

2711
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:34,400
loosely applied to cannabis

2712
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:36,400
yeah and they're not that well

2713
01:32:34,399 --> 01:32:37,839
understood and it's not anybody's fault

2714
01:32:36,399 --> 01:32:40,238
because it's not like there's seminars

2715
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:42,880
on this [ __ ] and a lot of information

2716
01:32:40,238 --> 01:32:44,238
gets passed through friendships

2717
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:46,480
and a lot of times some of those

2718
01:32:44,238 --> 01:32:49,198
friendships like aren't passing the most

2719
01:32:46,479 --> 01:32:50,319
reliable information about things

2720
01:32:49,198 --> 01:32:51,359
yeah

2721
01:32:50,319 --> 01:32:54,079
right

2722
01:32:51,359 --> 01:32:55,519
yeah you know that's what it is they're

2723
01:32:54,079 --> 01:32:57,439
hoping that people don't know what the

2724
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:59,360
term means and it sounds like they've

2725
01:32:57,439 --> 01:33:01,439
done work if they put stupid-ass terms

2726
01:32:59,359 --> 01:33:03,359
at the end of it f12 like if you really

2727
01:33:01,439 --> 01:33:06,079
think that some dude that that's been

2728
01:33:03,359 --> 01:33:07,679
around not that long is it f12 then you

2729
01:33:06,079 --> 01:33:09,439
do not understand breeding or how long

2730
01:33:07,679 --> 01:33:11,039
it takes to make it through generations

2731
01:33:09,439 --> 01:33:12,559
and to do real breeding to make sure

2732
01:33:11,039 --> 01:33:14,158
that generation is correct and if you've

2733
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:15,760
made an error to go back to the previous

2734
01:33:14,158 --> 01:33:17,439
generation keep working because you're

2735
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:20,239
never going to hit it right 12 times in

2736
01:33:17,439 --> 01:33:22,238
a row guaranteed so implying that he has

2737
01:33:20,238 --> 01:33:23,919
worked something like 12 generations to

2738
01:33:22,238 --> 01:33:25,599
is asinine to people who actually do

2739
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:27,440
that and there's friends of ours that

2740
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:29,120
are breeders that are like dude i had

2741
01:33:27,439 --> 01:33:30,799
this awesome line

2742
01:33:29,119 --> 01:33:33,439
and then i did this thing to it and i

2743
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:36,079
didn't end up keeping enough seed from

2744
01:33:33,439 --> 01:33:38,559
before i did that thing yeah and then i

2745
01:33:36,079 --> 01:33:40,639
[ __ ] it up yeah i did that just get

2746
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:42,320
rid of it to get rid of that seed and go

2747
01:33:40,639 --> 01:33:44,319
one to two gens back and go in a

2748
01:33:42,319 --> 01:33:46,799
different direction but i didn't keep

2749
01:33:44,319 --> 01:33:48,719
the seed and i [ __ ] it up and it's not

2750
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:51,119
as good as it was before and i can't

2751
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:52,719
make it the way it was before because i

2752
01:33:51,119 --> 01:33:55,760
didn't keep that gen

2753
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:57,920
so it's basically like a misstep

2754
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:59,360
yeah right you can make a mistake

2755
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:01,279
if you don't save

2756
01:33:59,359 --> 01:34:02,238
if you don't save seed from every single

2757
01:34:01,279 --> 01:34:05,599
rip

2758
01:34:02,238 --> 01:34:07,039
you know and when people say f2 f3 f4 i

2759
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:09,120
mean what that means is that you're

2760
01:34:07,039 --> 01:34:11,279
supposed to grow up a bunch of seed

2761
01:34:09,119 --> 01:34:13,519
pick males and females

2762
01:34:11,279 --> 01:34:15,920
right that exhibit traits that you want

2763
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:17,440
cross them and then breed them

2764
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:19,039
okay here's a question and i'm gonna

2765
01:34:17,439 --> 01:34:20,719
address it just because me and me and

2766
01:34:19,039 --> 01:34:22,000
csi were talking about like an hour ago

2767
01:34:20,719 --> 01:34:23,679
right right before we started this

2768
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,439
anyways um

2769
01:34:23,679 --> 01:34:28,000
but is crossing an elite to an elite

2770
01:34:25,439 --> 01:34:28,799
breeding or pollen chucking

2771
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,960
i

2772
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:33,840
consider regular breeding like using a

2773
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:36,158
male i consider that vacation and taking

2774
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:38,480
days off like that is the easiest [ __ ]

2775
01:34:36,158 --> 01:34:40,079
to do you don't have to do anything you

2776
01:34:38,479 --> 01:34:41,599
just they they make their seeds

2777
01:34:40,079 --> 01:34:44,319
themselves you don't have you might have

2778
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:48,159
to shake it around that's about it um

2779
01:34:44,319 --> 01:34:49,920
breeding using reversal techniques is a

2780
01:34:48,158 --> 01:34:51,519
lot more

2781
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:54,319
involved

2782
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:55,840
it's it's a lot more unpredictable um

2783
01:34:54,319 --> 01:34:57,679
you can make a lot more errors a lot

2784
01:34:55,840 --> 01:35:00,079
real fast i mean you could you could

2785
01:34:57,679 --> 01:35:00,880
take something and isolate it and make

2786
01:35:00,079 --> 01:35:02,960
it

2787
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:05,279
more true breeding really fast but you

2788
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:08,079
can also make huge errors right away and

2789
01:35:05,279 --> 01:35:09,359
very rarely does a pollination go where

2790
01:35:08,079 --> 01:35:11,760
you can just like hit something and

2791
01:35:09,359 --> 01:35:13,359
shake it in a reversal and the seeds

2792
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:15,119
make themselves that just doesn't really

2793
01:35:13,359 --> 01:35:16,960
happen that often a lot of times you

2794
01:35:15,118 --> 01:35:19,039
have to get in there with [ __ ]

2795
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:21,118
tweezers tweeze out each one shake the

2796
01:35:19,039 --> 01:35:22,560
[ __ ] pollen out half of that [ __ ]

2797
01:35:21,118 --> 01:35:23,439
won't be good and it's just because

2798
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:25,600
that's

2799
01:35:23,439 --> 01:35:28,158
that's how it goes you know so there's

2800
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:30,239
an aspect too which i should mention and

2801
01:35:28,158 --> 01:35:32,000
that's the reason why matt said

2802
01:35:30,238 --> 01:35:34,559
you're not going to do 12

2803
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:36,238
12 readings that all make sense

2804
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:37,840
and what he means by that is that let's

2805
01:35:36,238 --> 01:35:40,879
say you're at f3 and you grew up a bunch

2806
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:42,639
of f3s and you're ready to make your f4s

2807
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:43,920
and then you realize that you don't like

2808
01:35:42,639 --> 01:35:45,679
that combo

2809
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:48,239
yeah and you want to go back one

2810
01:35:45,679 --> 01:35:50,480
generation earlier and try again

2811
01:35:48,238 --> 01:35:53,039
yeah because you didn't like

2812
01:35:50,479 --> 01:35:56,079
that selection so yeah you're like in

2813
01:35:53,039 --> 01:35:58,238
order to get to f12 that means 12 times

2814
01:35:56,079 --> 01:36:00,399
you would have to grow up seeds

2815
01:35:58,238 --> 01:36:02,638
like what you see pick

2816
01:36:00,399 --> 01:36:04,879
females and males of each one

2817
01:36:02,639 --> 01:36:06,880
cross them together grow up their

2818
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:08,960
children and just keep doing that and

2819
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:11,039
every single time every single f-gen

2820
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:12,880
you're like [ __ ] yeah i won yeah [ __ ]

2821
01:36:11,039 --> 01:36:14,079
yeah i'm good where a lot of times

2822
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:15,359
you're gonna get somewhere and be like

2823
01:36:14,079 --> 01:36:17,760
oh that went in the direction i don't

2824
01:36:15,359 --> 01:36:20,799
like that nearly as much as the f4

2825
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:25,280
this f5 sucks i gotta go back to f4

2826
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:27,520
again i i did a green crack the x1 and i

2827
01:36:25,279 --> 01:36:29,279
you know i was one of the early growers

2828
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:31,360
and breeders with green crack i love

2829
01:36:29,279 --> 01:36:33,039
that [ __ ] strain i don't know why

2830
01:36:31,359 --> 01:36:34,319
it's just nice and mangoey it was really

2831
01:36:33,039 --> 01:36:35,439
beautiful purple and i'm sucker for

2832
01:36:34,319 --> 01:36:38,399
purples

2833
01:36:35,439 --> 01:36:40,399
but um in the bx1 i had crossed it to

2834
01:36:38,399 --> 01:36:44,000
and actually done a few but the one that

2835
01:36:40,399 --> 01:36:45,279
i ran with was the platinum banana og um

2836
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:47,840
as the male

2837
01:36:45,279 --> 01:36:50,079
from it and outcrossed to that back to

2838
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:52,560
the green crack and

2839
01:36:50,079 --> 01:36:54,238
all i found was a lot of platinum banana

2840
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:55,679
og plants and not many green cracks and

2841
01:36:54,238 --> 01:36:57,599
i didn't expect that because usually

2842
01:36:55,679 --> 01:36:59,520
green crack breeds dominant but that was

2843
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:01,199
one of those cases where it's like okay

2844
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:02,960
even though it's a bx1 and it sounds

2845
01:37:01,198 --> 01:37:05,279
like it should be super green cracky

2846
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:07,439
that's not how it played out in

2847
01:37:05,279 --> 01:37:09,519
in practice it was only in theory so it

2848
01:37:07,439 --> 01:37:11,839
kind of was an epic fail and now this is

2849
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:14,000
why breeding is such a [ __ ] because you

2850
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:15,679
spend all this time and energy doing it

2851
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,359
and then you're like oh i don't like

2852
01:37:15,679 --> 01:37:19,520
that that choice

2853
01:37:17,359 --> 01:37:21,920
back to that drawing go back go back you

2854
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:23,280
know go you know slide slide back down

2855
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:24,079
and start over

2856
01:37:23,279 --> 01:37:25,920
yeah

2857
01:37:24,079 --> 01:37:27,359
uh and so there's a lot of missteps and

2858
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:29,039
there's a lot of things that you hope

2859
01:37:27,359 --> 01:37:31,198
will happen like i'm gonna take this and

2860
01:37:29,039 --> 01:37:32,880
cross it to this and i'm hoping these

2861
01:37:31,198 --> 01:37:34,638
traits come together and you're and then

2862
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:36,719
you're like oh that's a horrible

2863
01:37:34,639 --> 01:37:38,400
yeah i gotta back up

2864
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:40,960
uh and that's why so many people just

2865
01:37:38,399 --> 01:37:42,238
like to make one one-off outcrosses to

2866
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:44,319
different things

2867
01:37:42,238 --> 01:37:46,479
not test it and just release it and just

2868
01:37:44,319 --> 01:37:48,000
move on to something else yeah

2869
01:37:46,479 --> 01:37:49,839
because you can spend a bunch of time

2870
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:51,600
[ __ ] around

2871
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:53,360
and that spit so much time i mean there

2872
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:56,320
was there's an aspect where bodhi was

2873
01:37:53,359 --> 01:37:59,439
telling me when when he first got the 88

2874
01:37:56,319 --> 01:38:03,519
g13 hash plant right

2875
01:37:59,439 --> 01:38:05,599
from uh ndn guy seeds yeah

2876
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:06,880
he didn't realize that they were already

2877
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:08,239
f4

2878
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:09,520
yeah so

2879
01:38:08,238 --> 01:38:12,079
he kept

2880
01:38:09,520 --> 01:38:13,600
the first he kept males and females of

2881
01:38:12,079 --> 01:38:15,039
the first round

2882
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:17,920
and didn't lose him

2883
01:38:15,039 --> 01:38:19,039
but then he took it three more gens

2884
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:21,359
yeah right

2885
01:38:19,039 --> 01:38:22,238
and it got shittier and shittier every

2886
01:38:21,359 --> 01:38:24,960
gen

2887
01:38:22,238 --> 01:38:27,599
yeah and what he ended up using

2888
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:30,480
was the very first seeds that he popped

2889
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:32,320
from the initial seeds that he got yeah

2890
01:38:30,479 --> 01:38:34,638
and that's what and that's what's in all

2891
01:38:32,319 --> 01:38:37,039
those hybrids that people buy from him

2892
01:38:34,639 --> 01:38:39,199
is because those those moms and dads

2893
01:38:37,039 --> 01:38:41,679
made way better crosses

2894
01:38:39,198 --> 01:38:43,198
yeah than any of the intentional work he

2895
01:38:41,679 --> 01:38:45,199
did after because he thought he was

2896
01:38:43,198 --> 01:38:47,279
getting it kind of raw so he's like oh

2897
01:38:45,198 --> 01:38:48,399
i'll open pollinated a couple times and

2898
01:38:47,279 --> 01:38:50,158
i'll but

2899
01:38:48,399 --> 01:38:52,879
yeah you know and he spent all this time

2900
01:38:50,158 --> 01:38:54,960
three doing going three gens that's a

2901
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:56,880
lot of time that is a lot of time a lot

2902
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:58,319
of effort and it's not rewarded yeah and

2903
01:38:56,880 --> 01:39:00,560
then you're like and then he's like each

2904
01:38:58,319 --> 01:39:02,639
one of these gems sucks ass and i'm not

2905
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:04,960
gonna use them yeah i'm just gonna stick

2906
01:39:02,639 --> 01:39:07,840
with this first [ __ ] i have over here

2907
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:08,880
yeah i could have saved myself a year

2908
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:11,119
yeah

2909
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:13,840
you know and so that [ __ ] happens

2910
01:39:11,118 --> 01:39:16,639
and i can guarantee you uh after being

2911
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:18,319
in this business this long that

2912
01:39:16,639 --> 01:39:19,760
what's what's sad what a lot of people

2913
01:39:18,319 --> 01:39:22,238
have noticed that that are in this

2914
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:23,679
business is that they're the how quickly

2915
01:39:22,238 --> 01:39:26,479
things sell

2916
01:39:23,679 --> 01:39:27,840
it how much work you put into it has no

2917
01:39:26,479 --> 01:39:29,678
reliance on that

2918
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:32,400
it's all in the name it's all in the

2919
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:34,960
hype it's all in that kind of stuff so

2920
01:39:32,399 --> 01:39:38,000
there's no real reward to putting in all

2921
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:40,719
that extra work to then fail

2922
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:42,880
and spend a lot of money doing it or to

2923
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:44,480
then succeed and still

2924
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:46,400
not be able to outsell something else

2925
01:39:44,479 --> 01:39:48,000
that's being hyped so

2926
01:39:46,399 --> 01:39:49,599
when people when people make comments

2927
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,840
about like i don't see braiders doing

2928
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:54,719
long work anymore there's a reason it's

2929
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:57,039
just not financially viable uh anymore

2930
01:39:54,719 --> 01:39:58,960
and as as bad as it sucks to hear that

2931
01:39:57,039 --> 01:40:00,960
as bad as it sucks to say it that's

2932
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:02,000
where it's at and that's why most

2933
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:04,079
breeders

2934
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:06,800
if you were to ask them

2935
01:40:04,079 --> 01:40:09,279
like you know to sh like

2936
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:10,960
people breed and they put in a bunch of

2937
01:40:09,279 --> 01:40:12,559
crosses and then they make a bunch of

2938
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:14,880
packaging and stuff and i'm not dissing

2939
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:16,719
it by any means but i'm just saying that

2940
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:20,239
they don't have time

2941
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:23,118
to test every round of everything

2942
01:40:20,238 --> 01:40:25,198
you just can't anymore before release

2943
01:40:23,118 --> 01:40:27,279
you know it's not it's not it's not

2944
01:40:25,198 --> 01:40:28,559
feasible you know you can you might look

2945
01:40:27,279 --> 01:40:31,439
through the things that you're the most

2946
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:32,719
interested in always but yeah and see

2947
01:40:31,439 --> 01:40:34,799
and be like oh i really want to see

2948
01:40:32,719 --> 01:40:36,719
what's in this hybrid you know

2949
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:37,760
even that is the minimum i can think of

2950
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:39,679
like

2951
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:41,199
seven people that do even that much you

2952
01:40:39,679 --> 01:40:42,560
know what i mean it's very it's very

2953
01:40:41,198 --> 01:40:43,599
difficult and then there's an aspect

2954
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:45,600
where

2955
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:47,760
you know i mean matt and i when we were

2956
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:49,679
researching like uh i guess you'd call

2957
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:51,280
it last season's podcast that we were

2958
01:40:49,679 --> 01:40:53,440
doing and we were doing a bunch of

2959
01:40:51,279 --> 01:40:56,880
neville work you could go through the

2960
01:40:53,439 --> 01:40:58,799
scentsy catalog from 91 to 95

2961
01:40:56,880 --> 01:41:00,000
and it barely changed

2962
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:02,400
yeah

2963
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:04,319
barely at all just little tiny things

2964
01:41:02,399 --> 01:41:06,638
barely changed you know some some names

2965
01:41:04,319 --> 01:41:09,118
here and there one or two things but

2966
01:41:06,639 --> 01:41:11,840
maybe in five years they added three or

2967
01:41:09,118 --> 01:41:12,639
four things to the catalog yeah

2968
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:13,600
right

2969
01:41:12,639 --> 01:41:14,800
and

2970
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:17,440
now

2971
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:20,000
it's like people come out with 20 or 25

2972
01:41:17,439 --> 01:41:22,238
new strains every crop ev every time

2973
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:24,238
they make make a drop

2974
01:41:22,238 --> 01:41:26,000
yeah a lot of the times and then when

2975
01:41:24,238 --> 01:41:28,319
they make another drop six months later

2976
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:29,600
it's a totally different set of [ __ ]

2977
01:41:28,319 --> 01:41:31,519
yeah

2978
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:33,360
so it's become vastly different people

2979
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:35,920
used to be able to get away with simon

2980
01:41:33,359 --> 01:41:38,880
from serious seeds

2981
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:41,760
for 20 years he sold six things

2982
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:43,039
yeah right that don't work no more no

2983
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:45,199
white russian

2984
01:41:43,039 --> 01:41:48,079
chronic ak

2985
01:41:45,198 --> 01:41:49,759
collie missed a bubble gum

2986
01:41:48,079 --> 01:41:51,198
and uh

2987
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:53,039
one more

2988
01:41:51,198 --> 01:41:55,759
one more than i'm forgetting yeah anyway

2989
01:41:53,039 --> 01:41:57,760
he sold he sold six lines

2990
01:41:55,760 --> 01:42:00,719
yeah and he made those six lines over

2991
01:41:57,760 --> 01:42:02,639
and over hey now i said ak i think but

2992
01:42:00,719 --> 01:42:03,439
we could look it up but there maybe i i

2993
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:05,600
think

2994
01:42:03,439 --> 01:42:07,839
it was six though i named five off the

2995
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:09,199
top of my head it was six for sure but

2996
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:12,000
it was six but

2997
01:42:09,198 --> 01:42:14,719
you know 15 years of just making i'm

2998
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,679
gonna make these same hybrids again yeah

2999
01:42:14,719 --> 01:42:16,560
i'm going to make them i'm going to make

3000
01:42:15,679 --> 01:42:18,158
them i'm going to make them i'm going to

3001
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:19,679
make them and it was like they didn't

3002
01:42:18,158 --> 01:42:22,079
have to change that much sensei's

3003
01:42:19,679 --> 01:42:23,600
catalog the first five or six years was

3004
01:42:22,079 --> 01:42:25,198
pretty consistent and then the last

3005
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:28,320
three or four years in the 90s they

3006
01:42:25,198 --> 01:42:31,118
added four five or six more things yeah

3007
01:42:28,319 --> 01:42:32,000
but then it stayed consistent after that

3008
01:42:31,118 --> 01:42:34,639
yeah

3009
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:36,880
and now it's like that's not what

3010
01:42:34,639 --> 01:42:38,719
breeders or growers or anyone expects

3011
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:39,600
it's got to be all new [ __ ]

3012
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:41,840
yep

3013
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:43,440
yeah i mean even with me early on i

3014
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:44,880
would like to do clock the clockwork

3015
01:42:43,439 --> 01:42:47,439
orange i'd always keep that in stock and

3016
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:49,279
like the white russian four big ones i

3017
01:42:47,439 --> 01:42:51,279
think you did say that maybe i said

3018
01:42:49,279 --> 01:42:54,000
russian i don't know yeah i don't know

3019
01:42:51,279 --> 01:42:55,519
but it kept it in stock man over the

3020
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,359
years you realize that's not even viable

3021
01:42:55,520 --> 01:43:00,880
to do anymore because people want new

3022
01:42:57,359 --> 01:43:03,279
and now and new and now at all times and

3023
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:06,239
not everyone obviously but the the

3024
01:43:03,279 --> 01:43:08,158
majority of the seed people buying seeds

3025
01:43:06,238 --> 01:43:10,238
that's how it goes and if you don't do

3026
01:43:08,158 --> 01:43:12,799
that you it's not a bible company

3027
01:43:10,238 --> 01:43:14,000
anymore and so matt and i laugh because

3028
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:16,159
we read

3029
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:18,238
all this stuff about what people think

3030
01:43:16,158 --> 01:43:19,599
breeders act most a lot of breeders are

3031
01:43:18,238 --> 01:43:20,479
actually doing

3032
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:22,800
yeah

3033
01:43:20,479 --> 01:43:24,399
versus what they actually do

3034
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:25,840
yeah and they're like oh these guys are

3035
01:43:24,399 --> 01:43:27,279
testing this and that and they're

3036
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:28,800
looking for herms and they're looking

3037
01:43:27,279 --> 01:43:30,319
for this and they're doing this and that

3038
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:32,320
and they're making choices and

3039
01:43:30,319 --> 01:43:33,679
selections and they're

3040
01:43:32,319 --> 01:43:35,920
not most of them

3041
01:43:33,679 --> 01:43:37,840
yeah because the the most profitable way

3042
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:40,000
right now to make seeds is just to like

3043
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:42,719
blow off a room

3044
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:44,399
d you know collect the seeds

3045
01:43:42,719 --> 01:43:45,760
i think it's even worse than that i

3046
01:43:44,399 --> 01:43:47,920
think the most profitable way to make

3047
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:49,760
seeds like with compound guys like that

3048
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:51,920
they buy seeds from other people already

3049
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:53,600
made and label them something they're

3050
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:55,520
hyping there's a bunch of stuff that

3051
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:57,039
goes on with like people would be

3052
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:59,119
shocked to know

3053
01:43:57,039 --> 01:44:01,198
you know how many how many of their like

3054
01:43:59,118 --> 01:44:03,359
some of their favorite cali people

3055
01:44:01,198 --> 01:44:05,039
got their seeds made in spain

3056
01:44:03,359 --> 01:44:06,960
yeah yeah

3057
01:44:05,039 --> 01:44:09,039
you know or have some dude that they

3058
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:10,639
know that has a tent make seeds and act

3059
01:44:09,039 --> 01:44:12,639
like they're blowing up their facilities

3060
01:44:10,639 --> 01:44:14,800
yeah yeah and so there's a lot of

3061
01:44:12,639 --> 01:44:16,319
there's a lot of fakery there you know

3062
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:18,159
and people eat it up and they've

3063
01:44:16,319 --> 01:44:19,599
realized that they with ig and with

3064
01:44:18,158 --> 01:44:21,279
these things they can control the

3065
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:23,679
narrative and hype

3066
01:44:21,279 --> 01:44:24,559
and people never see behind the screen

3067
01:44:23,679 --> 01:44:26,719
door

3068
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:27,840
yep and so the amount that they think

3069
01:44:26,719 --> 01:44:29,760
that they're

3070
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:31,600
uh yeah people most aren't even germ

3071
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:34,239
testing most aren't even taking 100 or

3072
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:36,480
200 seeds and spending two or three days

3073
01:44:34,238 --> 01:44:38,559
and making sure they get a good pop rate

3074
01:44:36,479 --> 01:44:39,919
yeah no and that's what [ __ ] candy

3075
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:41,679
rain

3076
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:43,118
and they didn't even pop you know and he

3077
01:44:41,679 --> 01:44:44,480
sold them they sold them for like 800

3078
01:44:43,118 --> 01:44:46,158
bucks a piece

3079
01:44:44,479 --> 01:44:49,279
or 800 bucks a pack or something like

3080
01:44:46,158 --> 01:44:50,399
that you know um and but so there's all

3081
01:44:49,279 --> 01:44:52,238
these things that they think their

3082
01:44:50,399 --> 01:44:55,439
breeders are like these mad scientists

3083
01:44:52,238 --> 01:44:56,799
like really putting in the work

3084
01:44:55,439 --> 01:44:58,638
and most and that's how they present

3085
01:44:56,800 --> 01:45:00,960
themselves yeah and then the people that

3086
01:44:58,639 --> 01:45:03,199
do put in work and but don't show it

3087
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:05,039
that much for various reasons they get

3088
01:45:03,198 --> 01:45:06,960
called out for being the big guys that

3089
01:45:05,039 --> 01:45:08,639
aren't doing the work yeah

3090
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:10,079
all the time and you're like dude your

3091
01:45:08,639 --> 01:45:13,199
hero

3092
01:45:10,079 --> 01:45:15,279
is like paying some kids to do the work

3093
01:45:13,198 --> 01:45:17,359
while doing photo ops

3094
01:45:15,279 --> 01:45:19,840
while while ordering half of it from

3095
01:45:17,359 --> 01:45:20,799
dinafem in spain

3096
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:22,480
right

3097
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:25,119
yeah and you think he's been carefully

3098
01:45:22,479 --> 01:45:26,079
working on it for the past 12 12 months

3099
01:45:25,118 --> 01:45:27,759
yeah

3100
01:45:26,079 --> 01:45:29,439
you know and he's just putting his name

3101
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:31,440
on it

3102
01:45:29,439 --> 01:45:34,238
it's literally a re-label

3103
01:45:31,439 --> 01:45:36,399
yeah that's how it goes it's how it goes

3104
01:45:34,238 --> 01:45:38,718
you know and and there's not a lot of

3105
01:45:36,399 --> 01:45:40,799
pressure so i'm not and so there's just

3106
01:45:38,719 --> 01:45:42,840
and so what matt was basically saying is

3107
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:46,159
that there's not

3108
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:48,639
incentive or for financial survival for

3109
01:45:46,158 --> 01:45:50,479
most people to do

3110
01:45:48,639 --> 01:45:51,600
what the customer base would like them

3111
01:45:50,479 --> 01:45:53,678
to do

3112
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:55,199
yeah

3113
01:45:53,679 --> 01:45:56,719
in my opinion

3114
01:45:55,198 --> 01:45:58,079
yeah no there isn't

3115
01:45:56,719 --> 01:45:59,520
it's just not there it's not there

3116
01:45:58,079 --> 01:46:01,279
anymore unfortunately it used to be

3117
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:03,119
there and i think a lot of us would

3118
01:46:01,279 --> 01:46:06,079
rather just quit than

3119
01:46:03,118 --> 01:46:08,079
join the stupid [ __ ] parade yeah i mean

3120
01:46:06,079 --> 01:46:11,359
think about it for a minute you know

3121
01:46:08,079 --> 01:46:14,399
think about how many people out there

3122
01:46:11,359 --> 01:46:17,198
can do what our buddy csi does

3123
01:46:14,399 --> 01:46:19,279
yeah which is show pictures of rooms

3124
01:46:17,198 --> 01:46:22,079
regularly of what was running and show

3125
01:46:19,279 --> 01:46:24,079
pictures of seeds that he made

3126
01:46:22,079 --> 01:46:25,439
that there's 200 phenos growing in a

3127
01:46:24,079 --> 01:46:26,479
room

3128
01:46:25,439 --> 01:46:28,158
yeah

3129
01:46:26,479 --> 01:46:30,000
you know and you can go years and years

3130
01:46:28,158 --> 01:46:32,638
and years back of he hasn't he hasn't

3131
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:34,560
popped everything he's made that's crazy

3132
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:36,239
yeah but he's constantly popping stuff

3133
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:37,840
that he's made

3134
01:46:36,238 --> 01:46:42,158
and looking through it and that kind of

3135
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:42,159
dedication is like uber rare

3136
01:46:42,238 --> 01:46:46,319
you know

3137
01:46:43,118 --> 01:46:48,000
um it's like him and a few other and

3138
01:46:46,319 --> 01:46:50,479
you know few other people

3139
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:52,079
and some hobbyists who are doing it for

3140
01:46:50,479 --> 01:46:54,959
love

3141
01:46:52,079 --> 01:46:55,840
uh and most of the famous people no

3142
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:56,719
yeah

3143
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:57,840
no

3144
01:46:56,719 --> 01:46:59,118
definitely not

3145
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:00,719
because it's just not financially

3146
01:46:59,118 --> 01:47:02,399
feasible and they don't have the space

3147
01:47:00,719 --> 01:47:03,760
and they don't really have any goals

3148
01:47:02,399 --> 01:47:05,519
either they're trying to just make much

3149
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:08,159
money off a seed drop

3150
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:09,040
yeah caleb caleb i can guarantee you

3151
01:47:08,158 --> 01:47:10,960
will

3152
01:47:09,039 --> 01:47:13,760
spend every time doing it right because

3153
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:15,600
he's so ocd and autistic about how he

3154
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:18,639
gets it done and well he's very

3155
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:20,800
admirable he also his favorite part of

3156
01:47:18,639 --> 01:47:23,440
the whole process is seeing what's in

3157
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:24,239
the hybrids he makes oh yeah yeah that's

3158
01:47:23,439 --> 01:47:26,399
actually

3159
01:47:24,238 --> 01:47:28,158
testing that's actually the part that

3160
01:47:26,399 --> 01:47:30,559
keeps him going the rest of it is kind

3161
01:47:28,158 --> 01:47:33,039
of a soul-drenching grind

3162
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:34,000
yeah but that he gets excited about

3163
01:47:33,039 --> 01:47:35,760
yeah

3164
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:37,840
so that's cool i've never met a man more

3165
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:39,039
excited about genetics and seeds than

3166
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:40,480
that man

3167
01:47:39,039 --> 01:47:42,479

01:47:49,439 --> 01:47:54,238
and just talk about genetics and and our

3174
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:55,440
wives all hate it i'm sure yeah

3175
01:47:54,238 --> 01:47:57,279

here and there

3182

anywhere

3184
01:48:11,279 --> 01:48:15,679

the only people that had mustaches were

3228
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:43,360

70s stashes and [ __ ] but it was like

3235
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:56,880
it went out of style like the station

3236
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:58,960
wagon

3237
01:49:56,880 --> 01:50:00,639

finland character when he has the full

3240
01:50:02,880 --> 01:50:05,279

3241
01:50:07,198 --> 01:50:12,399

3242
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:14,399
before we're done super dog okay uh we

3243
01:50:12,399 --> 01:50:16,719

3244
01:50:14,399 --> 01:50:18,799
um but i will people but we're bugging

3245
01:50:16,719 --> 01:50:21,679
so i will give a brief synopsis of

3246
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:23,599
superdog so let's do it matt sent me

3247
01:50:21,679 --> 01:50:26,719
some stuff that like blew my head off

3248
01:50:23,599 --> 01:50:26,719
about superdog

3249
01:50:27,198 --> 01:50:30,799
in some forum posts and stuff like that

3250
01:50:29,279 --> 01:50:32,158
that we won't get into

3251
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:33,599
yeah but

3252
01:50:32,158 --> 01:50:34,479
needless to say

3253
01:50:33,599 --> 01:50:36,480
um

3254
01:50:34,479 --> 01:50:39,919
i i think what happened is is that

3255
01:50:36,479 --> 01:50:42,079
there's a there's a few versions and

3256
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:42,960
there's a few things that happened over

3257
01:50:42,079 --> 01:50:43,840
time

3258
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:44,719

3259
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:46,960

01:50:52,079 --> 01:50:56,719
bunch of his story really but yeah

3264
01:50:55,039 --> 01:50:59,679
um

3265
01:50:56,719 --> 01:51:02,880
you know uh the story starts i guess

3266
01:50:59,679 --> 01:51:05,599
with he gave the super skunk to

3267
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:09,520
uh chem dog to greg yeah right

3268
01:51:05,599 --> 01:51:12,000
and and 93-ish i think and um

3269
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:14,000
94-ish greg calls him up and he's super

3270
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:16,479
excited because

3271
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:18,000
the super skunk had permed onto the chem

3272
01:51:16,479 --> 01:51:20,079
dock

3273
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:22,719
right and he got a bunch of seed and he

3274
01:51:20,079 --> 01:51:25,198
grew this seed up and he said

3275
01:51:22,719 --> 01:51:27,039
this seed is so amazing

3276
01:51:25,198 --> 01:51:29,198
i'm growing this stuff instead of the

3277
01:51:27,039 --> 01:51:32,719
chem dog

3278
01:51:29,198 --> 01:51:34,960
it's unbelievable right yeah and so

3279
01:51:32,719 --> 01:51:37,198
there was this aspect where gat where my

3280
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:38,560
buddy staten island thought

3281
01:51:37,198 --> 01:51:40,319
okay

3282
01:51:38,560 --> 01:51:41,520
maybe we could blend these two things

3283
01:51:40,319 --> 01:51:44,238
together

3284
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:46,719
yeah but we didn't know [ __ ] he didn't

3285
01:51:44,238 --> 01:51:49,279
know [ __ ] about sts or reversals or

3286
01:51:46,719 --> 01:51:50,960
anything like that back here right yeah

3287
01:51:49,279 --> 01:51:53,198
this is so pre-pre that it's

3288
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:54,319
unbelievable so yeah

3289
01:51:53,198 --> 01:51:57,118
homie

3290
01:51:54,319 --> 01:51:58,559
3000 miles away just had an accident and

3291
01:51:57,118 --> 01:52:00,960
got some seat

3292
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:02,320
yeah and so homie out here thought oh

3293
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:04,800
maybe i'll have an accident maybe he'll

3294
01:52:02,319 --> 01:52:07,679
do this but he basically started the

3295
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:09,840
project and he took a a

3296
01:52:07,679 --> 01:52:11,440
a hawaiian plant and crossed it to the

3297
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:13,599
super skunk cut

3298
01:52:11,439 --> 01:52:16,719
yeah and then he got he got like a super

3299
01:52:13,599 --> 01:52:19,840
skunk line for lack of a better term

3300
01:52:16,719 --> 01:52:21,118
right bred that a couple of times

3301
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:23,599
and then

3302
01:52:21,118 --> 01:52:25,598
he took a he took some males of that

3303
01:52:23,599 --> 01:52:28,480
and tossed it on the

3304
01:52:25,599 --> 01:52:31,679
we tossed it on the the chem 91

3305
01:52:28,479 --> 01:52:32,479
yeah and the super dog was born

3306
01:52:31,679 --> 01:52:34,800
right

3307
01:52:32,479 --> 01:52:36,879
um and i was helping him a little bit in

3308
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:38,880
the middle of that and then him and i

3309
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:41,118
worked together on hunting through a

3310
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:44,639
bunch of superdog itself

3311
01:52:41,118 --> 01:52:45,439
right yeah and doing further outcrosses

3312
01:52:44,639 --> 01:52:48,319
so

3313
01:52:45,439 --> 01:52:50,479
there was some stuff on the east coast

3314
01:52:48,319 --> 01:52:52,079
uh that might have had a similar name

3315
01:52:50,479 --> 01:52:53,598
that came about in a very different

3316
01:52:52,079 --> 01:52:55,279
fashion

3317
01:52:53,599 --> 01:52:57,039
you know but no

3318
01:52:55,279 --> 01:52:58,399
get the [ __ ] out of here yes you know

3319
01:52:57,039 --> 01:53:01,760
what i'm going to tell i'm going to tell

3320
01:52:58,399 --> 01:53:03,839
one real quick story and so

3321
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:05,280
i i was obsessed with finding that super

3322
01:53:03,840 --> 01:53:07,599
dog cut because i was a big fan of

3323
01:53:05,279 --> 01:53:09,359
diesel and supposedly they were similar

3324
01:53:07,599 --> 01:53:12,480
genetics one was cam 91 super skunk

3325
01:53:09,359 --> 01:53:14,799
supposedly one was supposedly chem d

3326
01:53:12,479 --> 01:53:16,718
super skunk according to the canon bible

3327
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:18,719
at the time so i i had already had

3328
01:53:16,719 --> 01:53:20,639
diesel and i loved it and the super dog

3329
01:53:18,719 --> 01:53:22,000
really interest me and and i wasn't sure

3330
01:53:20,639 --> 01:53:25,199
if maybe they got it wrong and it's the

3331
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:26,639
same cut so i remember asking greg back

3332
01:53:25,198 --> 01:53:29,279
then chem dog

3333
01:53:26,639 --> 01:53:31,039
about it and he kind of inferred that he

3334
01:53:29,279 --> 01:53:34,399
had read it and then i saw another post

3335
01:53:31,039 --> 01:53:36,560
today where he again infer he read it so

3336
01:53:34,399 --> 01:53:37,920
the fact that it was the same genetics

3337
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:40,639
as your guys's

3338
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:42,319
out in the west coast

3339
01:53:40,639 --> 01:53:44,239
and there's still no pictures no

3340
01:53:42,319 --> 01:53:46,079
provenance nothing for it and every time

3341
01:53:44,238 --> 01:53:48,479
i ask for any info about it all i get

3342
01:53:46,079 --> 01:53:51,359
even and with diesel as well all still

3343
01:53:48,479 --> 01:53:53,759
all i get is let me check my notes

3344
01:53:51,359 --> 01:53:55,439
and and i i like to do a lot i like kim

3345
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:57,599
dog a lot he's a good dude i've met his

3346
01:53:55,439 --> 01:53:59,198
wife she's really cool um

3347
01:53:57,599 --> 01:54:02,159
but yeah that's that's as far as i can

3348
01:53:59,198 --> 01:54:04,079
get with it i do think in my opinion

3349
01:54:02,158 --> 01:54:05,759
i think

3350
01:54:04,079 --> 01:54:07,198
they didn't know much about superdog

3351
01:54:05,760 --> 01:54:09,280
they heard about it and that he may have

3352
01:54:07,198 --> 01:54:11,118
taken credit for it back then

3353
01:54:09,279 --> 01:54:14,079
and it was probably what was going on

3354
01:54:11,118 --> 01:54:14,960
with gabby and you yeah so

3355
01:54:14,079 --> 01:54:16,559
so

3356
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:18,000
we did a bunch of work on it and it took

3357
01:54:16,560 --> 01:54:19,440
us a night we and you know it's like

3358
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:21,439
there's a lot of projects like that

3359
01:54:19,439 --> 01:54:24,238
where when you don't have some specific

3360
01:54:21,439 --> 01:54:26,079
goal in terms of like timing or anything

3361
01:54:24,238 --> 01:54:27,839
it's like we popped off a rip here and

3362
01:54:26,079 --> 01:54:30,319
then four months later six months later

3363
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:32,000
we did another stage of it over here and

3364
01:54:30,319 --> 01:54:33,359
then you know it's kind of like that

3365
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:36,399
you're doing it along while you're

3366
01:54:33,359 --> 01:54:38,158
growing and yeah um we ended up what

3367
01:54:36,399 --> 01:54:39,679
happened is what most people what most

3368
01:54:38,158 --> 01:54:41,679
people know of is we started picking

3369
01:54:39,679 --> 01:54:42,639
phenos like the seven the three the

3370
01:54:41,679 --> 01:54:45,279
thirty

3371
01:54:42,639 --> 01:54:47,840
um there's some pictures of it in the

3372
01:54:45,279 --> 01:54:50,880
can of bible yeah i started spreading it

3373
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:54,079
around i started giving out uh selected

3374
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:55,760
cuttings to friends and we crossed it uh

3375
01:54:54,079 --> 01:54:57,118
there was a time when we did you know we

3376
01:54:55,760 --> 01:54:58,480
were trying to do

3377
01:54:57,118 --> 01:55:00,479
um

3378
01:54:58,479 --> 01:55:03,279
i don't know what you'd call it it's not

3379
01:55:00,479 --> 01:55:05,678
quite open pollination okay but we

3380
01:55:03,279 --> 01:55:07,679
basically took out of out of hundreds of

3381
01:55:05,679 --> 01:55:09,440
seeds we took like our four or five

3382
01:55:07,679 --> 01:55:11,840
favorite males

3383
01:55:09,439 --> 01:55:14,000
yeah combined with about seven or eight

3384
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:15,440
of our favorite females

3385
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:18,158
yeah and we put them in a room and we

3386
01:55:15,439 --> 01:55:19,839
bloomed them and then we threw in

3387
01:55:18,158 --> 01:55:21,118
literally

3388
01:55:19,840 --> 01:55:23,199
every good

3389
01:55:21,118 --> 01:55:24,319
cutting that we had at the time

3390
01:55:23,198 --> 01:55:27,759
so

3391
01:55:24,319 --> 01:55:32,158
actual chem 91 actual super skunk the

3392
01:55:27,760 --> 01:55:35,599
warlock my black domina cut the maui uh

3393
01:55:32,158 --> 01:55:36,638
the the mendo perps

3394
01:55:35,599 --> 01:55:39,599

3395
01:55:36,639 --> 01:55:42,079
the crippy no no we didn't have this was

3396
01:55:39,599 --> 01:55:43,679
before i didn't have a kush um yeah i

3397
01:55:42,079 --> 01:55:46,000
didn't have a kush quite yet or anything

3398
01:55:43,679 --> 01:55:47,760
like that but uh but we so we did

3399
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:49,439
basically just like it was like bread

3400
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:51,599
amongst itself

3401
01:55:49,439 --> 01:55:54,500
yeah and then we bred it to like every

3402
01:55:51,599 --> 01:55:56,880
fire cut we had at the time

3403
01:55:54,500 --> 01:56:01,599

01:56:14,639 --> 01:56:18,400
one besides um

3412
01:56:16,639 --> 01:56:20,800

like to chat in public or whatever but

3417
01:56:26,639 --> 01:56:31,440
he probably uh um my buddy from staten

3418
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:33,599
island is probably should get the most

3419
01:56:31,439 --> 01:56:35,839
credit for the superdog because he put

3420
01:56:33,599 --> 01:56:38,560
the most time into it uh him and i did

3421
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:40,560
do projects with it together and then it

3422
01:56:38,560 --> 01:56:42,560
was the projects that him and i were

3423
01:56:40,560 --> 01:56:44,320
doing together that ended up getting

3424
01:56:42,560 --> 01:56:46,080
spread out and getting photographed and

3425
01:56:44,319 --> 01:56:47,679
getting traded to people and that's kind

3426
01:56:46,079 --> 01:56:50,319
of i think where

3427
01:56:47,679 --> 01:56:52,319
it started popping up on the forums

3428
01:56:50,319 --> 01:56:55,198
yeah and people started talking about it

3429
01:56:52,319 --> 01:56:59,039
and seeing it i gave a bunch of superdog

3430
01:56:55,198 --> 01:57:00,638
hybrids to mandelbrot uh and that's kind

3431
01:56:59,039 --> 01:57:03,039
of the basis of the males that he

3432
01:57:00,639 --> 01:57:05,199
started with his uh emerald emerald

3433
01:57:03,039 --> 01:57:07,840
mountain seed company and all that

3434
01:57:05,198 --> 01:57:09,198
um so that so it started it got it got

3435
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:10,880
mixed into some other things that are

3436
01:57:09,198 --> 01:57:13,118
pretty famous too

3437
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:15,440
um but we won't go into that right here

3438
01:57:13,118 --> 01:57:17,439
but it what we were trying to do

3439
01:57:15,439 --> 01:57:19,039
is we were trying to get the density and

3440
01:57:17,439 --> 01:57:21,359
the potency

3441
01:57:19,039 --> 01:57:22,800
of the chem 91

3442
01:57:21,359 --> 01:57:25,439
combined with

3443
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:27,679
the the color and the crystal content

3444
01:57:25,439 --> 01:57:30,559
and the nose of the skunk

3445
01:57:27,679 --> 01:57:31,840
yeah so we wanted potency and density

3446
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:34,159
from over here

3447
01:57:31,840 --> 01:57:36,960
and we wanted a little bit better looks

3448
01:57:34,158 --> 01:57:37,759
and frost and terp from over here

3449
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:39,599
yeah

3450
01:57:37,760 --> 01:57:41,679
and it worked pretty well make sense it

3451
01:57:39,599 --> 01:57:43,279
was killer you know and honestly it

3452
01:57:41,679 --> 01:57:45,679
probably would have it probably would

3453
01:57:43,279 --> 01:57:48,399
have taken off a bunch more if

3454
01:57:45,679 --> 01:57:50,880
the purple and then kush

3455
01:57:48,399 --> 01:57:52,638
and diesel craze hadn't started

3456
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:54,719
where everyone wanted to grow the exact

3457
01:57:52,639 --> 01:57:56,560
same strains to get the dollar

3458
01:57:54,719 --> 01:57:57,520
yeah for sure

3459
01:57:56,560 --> 01:57:58,719
you know

3460
01:57:57,520 --> 01:58:00,880
um

3461
01:57:58,719 --> 01:58:04,399
yes the super dog would have been in in

3462
01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:06,639
disposed in 2001 in the bay 100

3463
01:58:04,399 --> 01:58:07,519
uh that would definitely be an era that

3464
01:58:06,639 --> 01:58:08,800
uh

3465
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:10,960
that would definitely be an era where

3466
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:13,039
you could have gotten uh a lot of super

3467
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:14,480
dog went to the bay

3468
01:58:13,039 --> 01:58:15,439
a whole bunch

3469
01:58:14,479 --> 01:58:17,678
you know

3470
01:58:15,439 --> 01:58:20,000
um and you know

3471
01:58:17,679 --> 01:58:21,599
uh

3472
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:23,118
you know i've talked before about how

3473
01:58:21,599 --> 01:58:24,960
we've lost it and some of the different

3474
01:58:23,118 --> 01:58:26,319
things and been hunting for it for a

3475
01:58:24,960 --> 01:58:28,319
long time

3476
01:58:26,319 --> 01:58:29,599
um it uh

3477
01:58:28,319 --> 01:58:30,880
you know it exists in a bunch of

3478
01:58:29,599 --> 01:58:33,199
children

3479
01:58:30,880 --> 01:58:36,719
um and you know

3480
01:58:33,198 --> 01:58:37,919
skunk and chem seem to be a great combo

3481
01:58:36,719 --> 01:58:40,800
yeah

3482
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:44,239
in general i know i know that at least

3483
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:46,560
in 2000 let's say 11 or 12

3484
01:58:44,238 --> 01:58:48,399
that maui superdog was still being grown

3485
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:50,400
up north that weird i don't know if you

3486
01:58:48,399 --> 01:58:52,879
know karnak the weirdo oh dude so

3487
01:58:50,399 --> 01:58:54,879
there's there's phenos i have friends

3488
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:57,199
from trinity county that grew for years

3489
01:58:54,880 --> 01:59:01,039
and their boss his favorite strain was a

3490
01:58:57,198 --> 01:59:03,198
maui super dog yeah uh a maui superdog

3491
01:59:01,039 --> 01:59:05,359
hybrid um

3492
01:59:03,198 --> 01:59:07,439
you know some of the maui super dog uh

3493
01:59:05,359 --> 01:59:09,359
mandelbrot wrote about it a bunch

3494
01:59:07,439 --> 01:59:10,799
but he found out of seeds that i gave

3495
01:59:09,359 --> 01:59:12,079
him something he ended up calling the

3496
01:59:10,800 --> 01:59:14,320
truth

3497
01:59:12,079 --> 01:59:16,158
yeah yeah which was maui by superdog

3498
01:59:14,319 --> 01:59:17,759
that just a straight maui by super dog

3499
01:59:16,158 --> 01:59:19,039
so i think bitter is still holding that

3500
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:20,639
cut for you too by the way and so

3501
01:59:19,039 --> 01:59:22,399
there's there's a number there's a

3502
01:59:20,639 --> 01:59:23,440
number of phenos of that that float

3503
01:59:22,399 --> 01:59:24,879
around

3504
01:59:23,439 --> 01:59:26,238
yeah and there's some other stuff we

3505
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:28,800
won't get into right now because that's

3506
01:59:26,238 --> 01:59:31,118
a whole other movie where it's in

3507
01:59:28,800 --> 01:59:32,320
um so it's it's it's blended into

3508
01:59:31,118 --> 01:59:34,799
different things

3509
01:59:32,319 --> 01:59:37,118
um but it's one of those gigs where it's

3510
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:38,320
like weed reinvents itself every five or

3511
01:59:37,118 --> 01:59:40,158
ten years

3512
01:59:38,319 --> 01:59:42,399
and people only like to grow it's easy

3513
01:59:40,158 --> 01:59:44,559
and popular and it would probably knock

3514
01:59:42,399 --> 01:59:47,118
people's socks off today but it came out

3515
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:48,480
at a time when it wasn't able to get as

3516
01:59:47,118 --> 01:59:49,519
famous

3517
01:59:48,479 --> 01:59:50,879
yeah

3518
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:54,480
you know because it was coming out in

3519
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:56,239
2000 2001 2002 2003 you know it's just

3520
01:59:54,479 --> 01:59:58,718
that was just like a different era

3521
01:59:56,238 --> 02:00:00,718
yeah things didn't get like naturally

3522
01:59:58,719 --> 02:00:01,920
hyped very easily well it just couldn't

3523
02:00:00,719 --> 02:00:03,760
spread

3524
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:05,760
yeah people that couldn't communicate as

3525
02:00:03,760 --> 02:00:07,840
much uh clones didn't spread as much

3526
02:00:05,760 --> 02:00:10,159
there wasn't clone trading going on very

3527
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:13,039
much there wasn't clone mailing

3528
02:00:10,158 --> 02:00:15,359
anything like that you know so um so

3529
02:00:13,039 --> 02:00:17,840
there's an aspect to that that

3530
02:00:15,359 --> 02:00:19,279
someone's asking if you uh what did you

3531
02:00:17,840 --> 02:00:20,480
all find out did you find a line on

3532
02:00:19,279 --> 02:00:22,960
anything that you thought was lost

3533
02:00:20,479 --> 02:00:24,879
recently not so

3534
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:28,480
that i thought was lost

3535
02:00:24,880 --> 02:00:30,639
yeah i mean i uh there's you know

3536
02:00:28,479 --> 02:00:32,000
we did get something that i consider to

3537
02:00:30,639 --> 02:00:33,118
be the trinity

3538
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:35,279
or at least

3539
02:00:33,118 --> 02:00:37,118
you know extremely extremely close to

3540
02:00:35,279 --> 02:00:39,840
the the right cut

3541
02:00:37,118 --> 02:00:42,079
you know um so and we that was lost for

3542
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:44,159
15 or 18 years to us

3543
02:00:42,079 --> 02:00:46,000
and i'm still not sure if it's the exact

3544
02:00:44,158 --> 02:00:47,759
right thing um

3545
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:49,520
but if it's even the people that seem to

3546
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:52,480
think it might be not

3547
02:00:49,520 --> 02:00:54,960
think it's incredibly closely related

3548
02:00:52,479 --> 02:00:57,279
yeah like it on s1 or you know something

3549
02:00:54,960 --> 02:01:00,480
like that but i think it's the real one

3550
02:00:57,279 --> 02:01:02,319
um and now what gets hard is that

3551
02:01:00,479 --> 02:01:04,399
uh because old things are becoming

3552
02:01:02,319 --> 02:01:06,840
popular again everyone's coming out of

3553
02:01:04,399 --> 02:01:10,399
the woodwork with old things

3554
02:01:06,840 --> 02:01:11,840
yeah that that goes back to the [ __ ]

3555
02:01:10,399 --> 02:01:15,519
question that dude had about a smear

3556
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:17,119
campaign i absolutely considered diesel

3557
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:19,520
chem skunk weed

3558
02:01:17,118 --> 02:01:22,319
yes yes 100

3559
02:01:19,520 --> 02:01:25,440
yeah like super to me diesel and sour

3560
02:01:22,319 --> 02:01:27,118
diesel and all that is is kemp is is

3561
02:01:25,439 --> 02:01:28,319
chem skunk blend

3562
02:01:27,118 --> 02:01:31,198
okay and

3563
02:01:28,319 --> 02:01:32,319
before we close it down i want uh

3564
02:01:31,198 --> 02:01:34,000
someone wanted you to talk about

3565
02:01:32,319 --> 02:01:36,880
francine they kept they kept mentioning

3566
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:39,439
it so i wanted to so francine was an

3567
02:01:36,880 --> 02:01:42,000
extremely tasty indica

3568
02:01:39,439 --> 02:01:44,319
um and obviously that's that's the cut

3569
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:45,599
that facilitated the the trade for the

3570
02:01:44,319 --> 02:01:47,679
super skunk

3571
02:01:45,599 --> 02:01:49,520
um and uh

3572
02:01:47,679 --> 02:01:51,039
my buddy ended up we ended up letting it

3573
02:01:49,520 --> 02:01:52,639
go

3574
02:01:51,039 --> 02:01:55,920
because like a lot of

3575
02:01:52,639 --> 02:01:56,880
amazing afghans uh it had horrific raw

3576
02:01:55,920 --> 02:01:58,319
issues

3577
02:01:56,880 --> 02:02:00,239
yeah

3578
02:01:58,319 --> 02:02:02,319
and it could it could grow all these big

3579
02:02:00,238 --> 02:02:04,079
beautiful colas

3580
02:02:02,319 --> 02:02:05,439
and then there'd be gray rot running up

3581
02:02:04,079 --> 02:02:07,760
the center stem

3582
02:02:05,439 --> 02:02:09,919
yeah and a lot of people had fine had

3583
02:02:07,760 --> 02:02:12,639
had issues with

3584
02:02:09,920 --> 02:02:15,199
breeding a lot of early afghans because

3585
02:02:12,639 --> 02:02:17,840
afghans bred in rock

3586
02:02:15,198 --> 02:02:19,678
yeah because they grew up in in a dry

3587
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:21,520
cold afghan environment and then they

3588
02:02:19,679 --> 02:02:24,000
get brought to like moderate sort of

3589
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:25,679
humid california at times

3590
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:28,399
and they just they just couldn't handle

3591
02:02:25,679 --> 02:02:30,000
it yeah so it was it's one of those

3592
02:02:28,399 --> 02:02:33,519
things where it's part of the lore but

3593
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:35,760
it was intentionally dropped for issues

3594
02:02:33,520 --> 02:02:37,040
and it was dropped long before any of us

3595
02:02:35,760 --> 02:02:38,639
thought that any of this weed that we

3596
02:02:37,039 --> 02:02:40,238
were growing would matter

3597
02:02:38,639 --> 02:02:42,400
yeah i'm sure

3598
02:02:40,238 --> 02:02:43,598
too you know

3599
02:02:42,399 --> 02:02:46,799
so

3600
02:02:43,599 --> 02:02:50,000
