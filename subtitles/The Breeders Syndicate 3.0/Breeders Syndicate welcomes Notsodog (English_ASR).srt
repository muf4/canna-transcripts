uh these shows at the warfield right

117
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,039
correct

118
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:14,560
so skunk bob being being from virginia

119
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:16,240
right a lot of his old crew and mentors

120
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,519
and various things like that were east

121
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,038
coast right

122
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:21,680
yeah so one time some of these guys came

123
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:24,959
out

124
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,918
and from the east coast and uh

125
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:29,839
they uh were partying with all those

126
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:33,038
guys at the warfield

127
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:36,079
okay okay um

128
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:37,360
so skunk violence mutual friend

129
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:39,519
used to have this strain called the

130
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,280
francine all right

131
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:43,038
and then tell us about granting a little

132
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:43,758
offset but tell us about francine a

133
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:47,120
little bit

134
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,960
francine is a mystery indica that

135
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,560
uh we didn't use the term at the time

136
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:54,000
but it was about as terpy as

137
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,439
terpy gets yeah um eventually dude

138
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,600
dropped it because

139
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:59,439
like a lot of afghans um it had a

140
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,479
horrific mold problem

141
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:04,319
yeah and as you know you know when you

142
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:05,680
uh when you grow things uh that

143
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,280
horrifically look beautiful and

144
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,680
horrifically mold

145
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:10,478
at times it's very depressing harvest

146
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,400
time

147
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:14,800
oh yeah happened to you a few times with

148
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:18,399
a cut you can get ptsd

149
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,800
and decide to drop it you know like

150
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:23,519
get people get emotional about it so

151
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,918
what does she smell like

152
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:26,799
you know it it was a really good

153
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:30,240
combination

154
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:33,680
of like that like that afghan kind of

155
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:37,120
acrid funk yeah right but with

156
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,600
with like a fruity aspect but not like

157
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,478
the tropical sativa kind of fruit it

158
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,080
just had like

159
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:46,959
a really deep like like foot funk fruit

160
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:47,758
kind of flavor to it i think oh wow so

161
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:51,279
anyway so

162
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:54,639
these dudes loved it yeah right and

163
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:57,519
uh um they loved it so much

164
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,360
they were willing to trade this skunk

165
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:02,560
that they had for it

166
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,800
okay so separately to all this story and

167
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,038
uh skunk vas kind of talked about this

168
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,800
extensively on his on his podcast so

169
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:12,318
i'll just briefly touch on it

170
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,160
but chem dog wouldn't give out the dog

171
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,240
which is what we call it to anyone

172
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,360
right he held it super tight he didn't

173
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,038
want anybody

174
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,479
in his circle getting it he didn't want

175
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:23,120
to get cut off

176
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:24,478
you know um or have other people sell it

177
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,840
but when homie moved

178
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:30,318
to california he agreed

179
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:31,119
look i'll give it to you if you just

180
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,240
don't ever

181
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,478
share it with anybody back east yeah

182
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,160
right yeah don't want to compete markets

183
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:40,800
totally don't make sense

184
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,360
don't share it so basically what

185
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,439
happened

186
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,560
is that skunkva arranged with his

187
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:48,160
buddies

188
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:52,079
to trade the francine for the skunk

189
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,479
okay yeah dude decided to make a double

190
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:55,279
trip

191
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:56,000
where he would bring the francine out to

192
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:57,519
virginia

193
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,439
and he would trade it for the skunk and

194
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,318
then he would drive up to massachusetts

195
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:03,279
and he would

196
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,240
get the chem dog that was promised to

197
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:06,959
him right

198
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,120
dude that's committed that is committed

199
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:11,439
in 1993

200
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,639
uh homie drove across a bunch of shady

201
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:15,918
ass states

202
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:18,000
with little plants uh you know

203
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:19,198
not very many and small but still you

204
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,800
know still yeah

205
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,560
fancy if he got pulled over he probably

206
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,598
would have had to eat them you know or

207
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,280
something

208
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:26,719
yeah yeah and we have their state

209
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:28,719
checkpoints you gotta

210
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,560
do all kinds of you know this was

211
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,120
actually pre-pre

212
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,839
uh to use the term we joke about most

213
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,000
yeah

214
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,200
the highway 80 drug checkpoints and

215
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,200
stuff like that yeah

216
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,120
this was in 93 so they really hadn't

217
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,839
gotten wise to that too much

218
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,158
oh good if you took the middle route uh

219
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,399
you

220
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:47,679
you were pretty much safe for the most

221
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,480
part i mean you could still get pulled

222
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:51,199
over

223
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,240
you know and he definitely looked like a

224
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,879
hippie

225
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,399
i bet like he wasn't yeah no secret

226
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:58,399
sauce or anything like that he didn't

227
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:02,639
look like a young republican or anything

228
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:06,080
yeah yeah and so so he drives out to

229
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:09,360
virginia and uh and

230
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,240
meets um what we just learned actually

231
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,320
recently

232
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,519
ended up being dude's actual worker

233
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,360
because the dude had already kind of

234
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,959
gone on the run for a bit

235
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:22,320
and was weaving and so he gets this

236
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,879
this super skunk cut and i want to

237
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,640
interject

238
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:27,120
as far as we know the person we're

239
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:27,919
referring to um not by name the staten

240
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,240
island guy

241
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:31,519
yeah um that as far as we know this is

242
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,680
scumfier's mentor

243
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,560
so this is how close we can put skunk va

244
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:36,639
to the

245
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:38,239
beginning of this cut as far as we know

246
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:40,159
the guy that agreed to do it is the

247
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,759
mentor but apparently

248
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:43,679
the guy that actually did the trade is

249
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,838
one of his workers exactly

250
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:48,000
um but i asked when all this confusion

251
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:51,519
came up a few years ago i read i

252
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,958
asked staten island um

253
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:57,200
do you remember the exchange well enough

254
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:58,000
to be absolutely sure what did he call

255
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,959
it

256
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,559
yeah if you fast forward to like when i

257
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,679
became friends with these guys in the

258
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:06,078
late 90s

259
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:07,120
it was always called super skunk right

260
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:10,958
yeah

261
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:13,360
so staten island uh he gets

262
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:16,000
you know he told me that straight up

263
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,200
dude said this is a super skunk cup

264
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,159
okay so he gets it straight forward

265
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,920
yeah so he trades he gets it then he

266
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:26,480
drives to massachusetts

267
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:28,159
okay and he meets up with chemdawg and

268
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,079
he gets the 91.

269
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:32,319
uh we all call the dog but you know

270
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:34,479
everybody on the internet calls it skunk

271
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,640
pho cut or 91 or whatever so

272
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,079
yeah um but everybody back then it was

273
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:39,519
just the dog

274
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:42,078
a bunch of these dudes were organic

275
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,240
growers and so even though it was

276
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:46,559
chem dog they didn't want to put him on

277
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,200
it yeah my buddy they weren't super into

278
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:49,359
calling it

279
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,240
chem dog because they grew fully organic

280
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,278
so

281
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,360
um so we destroyed the dog and amongst

282
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,480
all of us long before it got famous or

283
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,639
anything like that

284
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,320
that's just kind of the shorthand you

285
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:01,439
know i've been writing that on labels

286
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,640
now for

287
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:08,000
two decades right so so

288
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:09,199
he got an extra cut or two of this super

289
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,440
skunk

290
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:16,879
okay okay and he gave one to chem dog

291
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,120
okay okay so that's not so

292
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:20,480
chem dog got it basically by accident

293
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,278
yeah he got it by proxy

294
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,079
just like by accident by proxy he got it

295
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:26,078
because

296
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:27,519
homie decided to go to virginia before

297
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:29,679
massachusetts

298
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,600
that's crazy what a what a wild what

299
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:33,199
yeah he could have reversed it and gone

300
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,000
massachusetts virginia

301
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,680
home yeah but he went virginia

302
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,720
massachusetts home

303
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:42,958
that's enough it changed a lot that

304
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,240
act that choice in my opinion i mean

305
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:46,078
we've talked about this a bunch or

306
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,320
whatever that ended up

307
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:50,319
leading to a whole series of accidental

308
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:54,399
events that became super important

309
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:56,959
right right yeah so um

310
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,679
you know so then he drives back home

311
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:00,638
right

312
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:01,599
yep now he's got super skunk in the dog

313
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,399
okay

314
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,560
and if you went to warfield shows in san

315
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,639
francisco to see jerry band

316
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,078
you probably could have seen him

317
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,560
slinging all that

318
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:13,439
in front of the show every single month

319
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:17,039
yeah

320
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,040
yeah oh um

321
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,959
so skunk fall took a different tact and

322
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:23,200
he could speak to this for himself but

323
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:28,159
he kept touring basically

324
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:30,320
right so when jerry died in august

325
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:31,919
uh this next week here we call this the

326
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,000
days between

327
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:35,360
because jerry's birthday is on the 1st

328
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,919
of august and

329
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,440
his death is on the is in a week now or

330
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:42,078
something like that and so these are

331
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,880
like easter for hippies yeah it's sort

332
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:44,479
of like the

333
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,320
yeah it's the it's the easter week or

334
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,480
whatever so

335
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,000
uh you know skunk vod decided to settle

336
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,600
down after

337
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,440
jerry passes right and that's when he

338
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,519
started growing

339
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,959
now because obviously to grow you have

340
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,639
to be semi-stable

341
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:02,000
it's not a really dramatic lifestyle

342
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,240
right so yeah

343
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,360
um so those pictures that he's been

344
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,120
posting

345
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,039
of polaroids and everything like that or

346
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,959
after our buddy gave him

347
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:12,480
the cut from his friends in virginia and

348
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:17,119
he started growing it

349
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:19,200
yes right yep um so that's basically how

350
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,120
that's basically how this this cut from

351
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:25,120
virginia made its way to

352
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:27,039
sonoma county the bay and massachusetts

353
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,720
and see and then this is a great intro

354
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:29,759
too to the kem dog story as well which

355
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,639
we will cover

356
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:34,078
in our podcast which will eventually be

357
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,399
here soon

358
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:37,838
so so that's the start of that's the

359
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,519
start of the super skunk

360
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:44,399
movie um you know i uh

361
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,440
i met uh i didn't know them then

362
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,639
personally

363
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:52,240
uh a couple years after that um

364
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:55,440
and uh my you know my uh my buddy

365
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,278
uh he fell in love with the mendo p

366
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,199
yeah a couple other things or whatever

367
00:13:57,278 --> 00:13:59,679
and so he ended up giving me the super

368
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:03,198
skunk

369
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:05,679
and the dog for safekeeping you know

370
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:07,359
and uh and that's in the late 90s and

371
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:10,319
that's kind of how i got it

372
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,240
and you've had it well like not the

373
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,160
super skunk but the chem 91 and it

374
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,320
stayed with you ever since yep i've had

375
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:19,919
that since i never lost it no

376
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:23,278
unfortunately the super skunk was lost

377
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:24,000
uh but we'll get to that uh yeah okay so

378
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:27,360
you know

379
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:31,198
so we have this stuff right and uh

380
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:34,240
you know this is obviously um

381
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:36,719
what is it you know so late 90s 2000

382
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,639
2001 this whole little era right then

383
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,759
so you've got like the internet is in

384
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,799
it's like infancy

385
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:45,278
essentially right overgrow had just

386
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:48,719
began in 98.

387
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:50,240
yeah so there really wasn't any internet

388
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,079
fame

389
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,480
yeah right all these things that have

390
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:55,679
become super famous and like holy grails

391
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,360
and all these people trying to figure

392
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:01,759
out stuff right

393
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,839
uh most of the stories that i believe

394
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:05,919
that i've heard about this stuff comes

395
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,839
from that era

396
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:08,958
because that was when there was nobody

397
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,959
gave a [ __ ]

398
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:12,638
yeah in the sense so there's no reason

399
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:14,719
to bull about any of it there was no

400
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,799
fame associated with it there was no rap

401
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,759
there was no i mean it was literally

402
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:20,240
like

403
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,360
there was like four people in california

404
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:26,159
who had it

405
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:27,360
yeah exactly there was me skunk bar our

406
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:30,480
buddy

407
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:34,079
and uh uh icy collective

408
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,720
yes i see collective yes right who was

409
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:37,359
really close friends with skunk bar you

410
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,639

411
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,560
uh yeah and and greg and that and he

412
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,720
and he ended up like uh moving in with

413
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:46,799
skunkva and that's how he got the cut so

414
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,920
there was literally like four of us

415
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:51,758
yeah um so not very big and now

416
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:53,439
back then you had enormous rooms or

417
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,959
anything like that you know

418
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,639
yeah there really wasn't very much of it

419
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:58,078
even being produced

420
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,320
yeah you're blowing it up with the four

421
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:03,599
lighter essentially you're blowing it

422
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:06,839
mostly mostly

423
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,000
spiders oh okay you guys are slinging

424
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:11,120
hard

425
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,078
12 lighters or whatever but yeah um

426
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,720
but yeah you know and so uh so just to

427
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:20,239
keep it back on the super skunk tip

428
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:23,120
um you know obviously it's been

429
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:25,198
quite a long time um but here here's

430
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:30,000
what i know for sure

431
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:30,000
um it was uh

432
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,720
i never ever heard it called anything

433
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:36,479
but super skunk

434
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,079
obviously we've had some debate amongst

435
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,360
friends oh sure

436
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:41,439
there's a whole different thing we can

437
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,320
get into later about whatever about some

438
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,399
different

439
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,320
different names and stuff and yeah or

440
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,600
may not be the exact same thing through

441
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,000
different crews or whatever

442
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,040
but as far as as far as my little group

443
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,759
goes

444
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:54,319
um that's what it was always called

445
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,720
right

446
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,759
straight super skunk and so buddy from

447
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,720
staten island

448
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,159
okay he would love like when we'd have

449
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,000
trimmers over

450
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:07,119
you could pull side branches of that

451
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,439
thing and you could hold it up to the

452
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,639
the picture in the catalog of the 90

453
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,759
seed bank

454
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,400
right and it was like a dead ringer yeah

455
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:17,519
you would you could find buds on the

456
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,798
plants

457
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:21,199
that like match that look exactly yeah

458
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:23,918
it was

459
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,720
very very uniform witnessed him dozens

460
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,759
of times

461
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,360
over multiple crops right

462
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:32,319
just because he was just so cool because

463
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:34,639
it's like yeah exactly like the picture

464
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:35,359
in the catalog right yeah and he could

465
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,520
show you hey

466
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:39,439
this really is super skunk you're buying

467
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:42,480
you know and so

468
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,840
uh you know in a lot of ways you know it

469
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,839
was a sketchy plan

470
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:50,399
um yeah that was you know that was the

471
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:52,399
very beginning of the 215 era

472
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,080
right um but it wasn't really you know

473
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,519
215 had like multiple

474
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:59,678
eras right the first five or six 215

475
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:00,879
like the cops the courts everything it

476
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,880
was still pretty much

477
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,880
underground yeah yeah you're still

478
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,799
getting [ __ ] people hadn't grown

479
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,320
to like let's have a greenhouse outside

480
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:10,960
my back door

481
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:12,798
yeah none of that thrilling uh indoor

482
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,200
was still sketchy it was still not the

483
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:16,960
jam

484
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:19,840
you know yeah so um

485
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,759
so the super skunk you know the last two

486
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:23,678
or three weeks it literally people joke

487
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:26,319
about carbon filter killer

488
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,280
right yeah it was the only strain i've

489
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:29,918
ever grown

490
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:33,759
that um absolutely defeated every

491
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:35,280
opportunity i ever had to win

492
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:36,798
i don't even know any other way to

493
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:38,480
describe it the amount yeah

494
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:40,240
burn it would give me like i would pull

495
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,038
up with two weeks to go in front of my

496
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,519
house

497
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:44,079
in summer and it would smell like a dead

498
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:46,798
skunk

499
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:47,439
in my driveway yeah i know the feeling

500
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:50,000
not with

501
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,679
skunks but yeah every direction out and

502
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,839
and so you know back then you're just

503
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:58,160
like oh my god you know that is yeah

504
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:59,759
be nerve-wracking and so at which i had

505
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,840
obviously people know on this on this

506
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:04,160
thing what scrubbers are i had a

507
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:05,519
co2 scrubber with a fan scrubbing the

508
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,320
room

509
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:10,160
i had uh or a carbon filter sorry not

510
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:13,279
co2 i had a carbon filter

511
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,038
right yeah and um so that's scrubbing

512
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,480
the room and then i had a carbon filter

513
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:18,720
on the exhaust

514
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,240
and then i had one of those huge uv on

515
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:24,400
air double

516
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:27,679
uh yeah um you know ozone generators

517
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,400
yes even did the recommended 25 or 30

518
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,919
feet

519
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,320
of tubing before it went out the

520
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:35,038
building to make sure it had time to mix

521
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:39,839
yeah and it still smelled like i was

522
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:39,839
slaughtering skunks in my backyard

523
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:46,960
that's kind of how it was you know so

524
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:50,558
uh it was trippy in that regard um

525
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:53,679
and you know it it was it was

526
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:55,599
i don't know it looked dense

527
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,679
even when it looked dense it was still

528
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:59,839
it's still weighed light

529
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,840
yeah it was just those things where like

530
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:02,798
you you know you put a nug on there and

531
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:04,798
you're like oh this is going to be

532
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:07,119
impressive and you're like oh

533
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:07,839
no it's hollow how did they make hollow

534
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:10,079
weed

535
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:11,678
it was like solid but it was fluffy it's

536
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:13,199
like almost like ice cream or something

537
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,640
that had a bunch of air whipped into it

538
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,240
you know

539
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:20,559
and uh um you know and

540
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,359
the terp the weird thing about the terp

541
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:24,000
is that

542
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:24,479
it was super volatile in my opinion like

543
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,279
it didn't

544
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,839
really stink until the last bit and then

545
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:29,759
it

546
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:31,359
dunked for about a month or five weeks

547
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:34,960
after you cut it

548
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:37,519
yeah if you let super skunk go too long

549
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,440
in your jar or whatever it would have

550
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:41,359
eventually kind of smelling semi to

551
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,558
generic green butt

552
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:47,038
oh yes yeah that makes sense

553
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:48,720
i could crack a jar in the other room

554
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:50,798
and someone would walk in and ask me

555
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,038
what was going on

556
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:53,918
like you would have to like crunch the

557
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:56,798
[ __ ] out of it

558
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,919
and deeply smell to try to get a whiff

559
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:02,079
yeah that makes sense

560
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:04,640
but fresh it reaped yeah

561
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,759
um you know and you know it's kind of

562
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,000
hard to trim

563
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:08,960
it was it could be sparse you know when

564
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,960
it didn't

565
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,720
uh you know i mean for most people um

566
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,159
probably the easiest way to think about

567
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,880
it is

568
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,640
uh you know real old-school sour has a

569
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,640
lot of similarities to it

570
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,400
yes you know so when sour doesn't want

571
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,000
to come out the right way

572
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,000
it's a [ __ ] to trim you know like

573
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,599
people lose people start

574
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
you know your your crew gets

575
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:32,719
disheartened oh my god i got a trim

576
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,038
diesel

577
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,558
you know yeah right now i posted some

578
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:38,720
stuff for you the other night

579
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:40,480
uh that i sent you where like my old

580
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,519
sour diesel cutting

581
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,159
it looks like those tops those colas

582
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:48,000
they really

583
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:51,280
oh yeah see those same super skunk

584
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,038
tops that skunk bob posts yeah

585
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:55,599
you can really see the similarity in it

586
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:58,158
you know um so the other thing that

587
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:59,519
that uh so it had unbelievable terps i

588
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,559
mean when people talk about

589
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:06,319
rks terps or whatever else it was

590
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:09,678
the terpest skunkiest rankest thing

591
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:12,798
imaginable you know uh

592
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:16,000
it really was um and uh

593
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:19,279
you know it also you know uh

594
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,119
it also harmed like a [ __ ] yeah

595
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:22,639
that's that's like really the first

596
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:24,959
thing i ever heard about

597
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,000
mass super when i first started getting

598
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,759
into the scene and

599
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
learning the history and stuff that that

600
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:31,200
[ __ ] was a herm bomb it was a herm bomb

601
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,359
it could harm

602
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,480
um you know we would pull it about eight

603
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:37,759
weeks

604
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,279
sometimes you would um you know you

605
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:41,038
would try to take it longer because you

606
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:44,240
think maybe it needed to be done

607
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:46,960
more and they would hurt for sure

608
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,558
yeah but the other thing is and this is

609
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,679
kind of weird about it

610
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:54,879
is that it hurt early too

611
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:58,159
because well as a breeder right

612
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:01,280
yeah yeah full if you let's say you pull

613
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:04,240
the super skunk at 58 days

614
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:04,798
and you find tiger striped beans in it

615
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,038
yeah

616
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:08,960
when were those beans made yeah you know

617
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:11,038
they're early on

618
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,279
they're probably primordial they had to

619
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:14,558
be arrogant because it takes a good four

620
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:17,038
to six weeks

621
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:18,000
yes to mature it to like fully mature

622
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:19,839
and get that dark

623
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,279
tiger striping that looks all healthy

624
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:23,599
and stuff you know sure

625
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:24,399
um so you pull a strain at 58 days just

626
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:27,439
by the law

627
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,519
of how beans grow

628
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,798
yeah had the pot you know it something

629
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:36,319
bad bad had to happen in three weeks

630
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:38,319
yeah yeah but that act that

631
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:39,759
in my opinion you know and there's a

632
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:41,678
certain amount of you know

633
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:42,960
we can get to opinions about it but that

634
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,480
factor

635
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,240
created a whole bunch of weed that we

636
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,000
like yeah i did

637
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,960
that's that's the crazy part craziest

638
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,319
part about all of it through live harms

639
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:57,759
yeah and so okay so you know in the

640
00:23:54,319 --> 00:24:00,720
in the uh you know uh

641
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:03,359
the the buddy from staten island right

642
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:07,038
he was not very into sharing

643
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:10,079
yeah no um i uh you know when i got

644
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:12,158
when i got the dog i had to promise

645
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:13,678
that i wouldn't give it out you know

646
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,440
which i didn't for forever

647
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,880
you know yeah and i would have like we

648
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,679
would have like really good friends of

649
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,960
ours

650
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,480
that would um beg me for it

651
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,278
and i'd be like you know who you have to

652
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,720
talk to get him to call me and say that

653
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:27,759
you can have it and i'll take cuts for

654
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,839
you tomorrow

655
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:30,879
yeah but otherwise like i'm not breaking

656
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:32,639
my word

657
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,159
yeah of course because like we're all

658
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,278
good friends and he's gonna know you

659
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,559
have it

660
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:38,480
and then that makes me look like an

661
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:41,278
[ __ ] you know so no

662
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,839
you know issues and it's like well this

663
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:43,919
is the

664
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:45,599
you know this is what i had to do so he

665
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,200
wasn't as strict about the skunk but he

666
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:49,278
kind of felt the same way

667
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,798
you know and you know me like i try to

668
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:54,319
be as like

669
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:54,720
as etiquette as oh yeah possible with

670
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:56,399
cuts

671
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,319
yeah i don't even like to pressure

672
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,320
people i'm just not into it like

673
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:02,960
yeah have their own vibe and their own

674
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:06,399
energy about why they come to you or not

675
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:09,440
you know sure and so you know so

676
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:12,400
what sucks about that is that

677
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,080
we didn't spread it very far yeah right

678
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,759
like we weren't on forums or anything

679
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:19,119
like that or whatever

680
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:22,480
um staten island buddy is not weasel

681
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:24,319
clop glass no no no he's not

682
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,480
i'm not paying very much attention to

683
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:28,480
the words at the bottom of the screen so

684
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,079
it's all right as anything maybe mac can

685
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,038
say it or repeat it again or something

686
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:35,278
but yeah

687
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:38,480
he's totally not it's totally not him um

688
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:40,480
so uh you know so the fact

689
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,159
there's two things right is obviously

690
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,720
back then most people are growing for

691
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,278
profit

692
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,960
you know on some level and so having a

693
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:50,319
cut that reeks the high heaven

694
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,440
and scares your neighbors and herms on

695
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:53,759
you

696
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,200
uh you know it made it dicey on people

697
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:58,319
holding it

698
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:01,278
yeah and so you know we never

699
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:02,079
you know skunk von myself you know our

700
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:03,599
buddy

701
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:06,240
we never really spread it we weren't

702
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:08,079
trading we weren't active on the forums

703
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,798
you know we weren't swapping cuts out

704
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:13,678
right and left and stuff and so

705
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:15,200
you know uh that's uh you know that's a

706
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,880
different discussion but as you know

707
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,278
like every time

708
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,600
my opinion is like every single time a

709
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:23,839
famous named cut happened

710
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:24,959
yeah like purple craze with urkel and

711
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:27,678
gdp

712
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,679
the sour the cushes whatever a whole

713
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,480
bunch of amazing diversity just goes to

714
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,880
[ __ ]

715
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,558
yeah because people want to fill their

716
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,240
room or their greenhouse or their

717
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:37,440
whatever with something that some guy is

718
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,079
going to come and

719
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,558
snap it from them right yeah they want

720
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:42,000
the

721
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:44,319
the ship that's going to sell not for

722
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,519
the most so even amongst most of my

723
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:46,960
close friends

724
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:49,599
i've always had a [ __ ] of a time

725
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,319
getting people to back things up for me

726
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:55,119
yeah people want one or two plants that

727
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:56,798
they're currently doing for production

728
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:58,239
and they don't hold on to a bunch of

729
00:26:56,798 --> 00:27:00,798
stuff that they're doing for

730
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,919
safe keeping or heads or whatever you

731
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:04,158
know

732
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,080
um so it wasn't that easy for me to get

733
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:09,278
it to be backed up anywhere

734
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:10,798
right particularly because uh

735
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:12,400
you know when it comes to you know

736
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:15,440
production and stuff like that some

737
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,440
broker finding seeds is [ __ ] doom

738
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,960
um so like hey do you want to grow this

739
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,000
thing that could potentially lightly or

740
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,000
heavily seed your room

741
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:28,558
no not at all not not really no

742
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:33,519
right you know so

743
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:35,759
you know i mean uh so we all grew it

744
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:36,558
um and sorry i'm sorry i just had to

745
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:38,079
boot someone

746
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:39,759
i didn't want to but he was being a

747
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:42,398
jackass and being real rude

748
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:45,200
so oh i have no i i wasn't even paying

749
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:45,199
attention it's all good

750
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:49,038

751
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,640

uh i have no idea like you know what

769
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,880
happened with chemdawg in massachusetts

770
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:30,000
you know who when how he shared what

771
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,120
with you know all

772
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,200
that type of stuff um you know

773
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:36,719
as far as as far as the actual super

774
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,120
skunk cut goes

775
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,919
yeah you know but it's one of those

776
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:43,359
things where

777
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,480
like you know uh nobody wanted it until

778
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:47,278
it became

779
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,960
sort of this legendary famous thing and

780
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:50,480
then everybody started poking around

781
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,278
trying to figure out who might have kept

782
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:55,839
it

783
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:57,759
you know so yeah uh staten island and i

784
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:59,678
um we had this thing where like two of

785
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:01,839
our favorite strains were obviously the

786
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:05,440
super skunk and the chem dog right

787
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:08,879
yeah and the super skunk had the

788
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,720
the lime green and the frost uh i mean

789
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,000
you know from the chem du you know from

790
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,399
dog dog

791
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,398
isn't particularly gorgeous it's not

792
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:18,959
super frosty compared to

793
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:20,798
grains it's darker cut you know it

794
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,278
cannibalizes its own leaves

795
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:23,918
it doesn't even always taste great you

796
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:25,599
know

797
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,200
sometimes it can taste amazing and i

798
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:28,959
love the flavor but like

799
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,319
i could grow it all year long and only

800
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,200
two crops out of five

801
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:34,240
be happy with its flavor at times yeah

802
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,600
you know and why

803
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,079
exactly um why why exactly that is i

804
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:41,519
don't know

805
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:42,480
so we had this idea um and this is long

806
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:44,079
before

807
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,319
you know i mean there was no real

808
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:47,839
american seed companies or anything like

809
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:49,200
that right so

810
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:50,558
we were we were doing a bunch of

811
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,759
breeding but we were doing a bunch of

812
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:54,798
breeding that was literally

813
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:56,558
for our taste buds like it was not for

814
00:29:54,798 --> 00:29:58,720
public consumption at best it was going

815
00:29:56,558 --> 00:30:01,200
to be grown by us and spread out

816
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,558
yeah you know we created this we created

817
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,798
this thing over time

818
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:06,079
uh staten island started it and i came

819
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:08,079
on and helped

820
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:09,839
uh and you know we did some work on it

821
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:11,199
together uh that we eventually called

822
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:12,959
the superdog

823
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,240
uh which is in the can of bible the

824
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,840
second one i think

825
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,599
yes um that was my first that was my

826
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:23,918
first experience with

827
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:24,959
kind of uh really finding a strain that

828
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,840
i wanted to

829
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,240
hunt and right there even though i got

830
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:32,079
along quite well with jason who wrote it

831
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,000
um and i gave him a bunch of accurate

832
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:37,199
information a lot of that

833
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,558
got twisted and turned into some of his

834
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,480
entries about

835
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:42,319
the the dog and the chem dog and the

836
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,720
super and all that type of stuff you

837
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:45,439
know

838
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,759
so be that as it may what we were trying

839
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,480
to do is we were trying to

840
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:51,679
combine the terps and the look of super

841
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,399
skunk

842
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,120
with the potency and some of the density

843
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:58,479
and some of the

844
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:59,599
the niceness of the dog sure you know

845
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,839
and it was like a

846
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:05,199
you know and so um you know and

847
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:07,119
strangely uh and this is another thing

848
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,440
of why i think maybe it disappeared as

849
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:12,879
we we've talked about this recently too

850
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:16,159
i i tend to believe that the skunk

851
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:18,640
and the herm is related yes

852
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,799
like i i can't say for certain but i

853
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:24,559
think it might be a linked trait

854
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:26,480
i i and there's a lot of uh um

855
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:27,678
evidence for that yeah you know and as

856
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,079
you know um

857
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,440
you know there's there's very few traits

858
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:33,839
that people breeding

859
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,480
have you know more prejudice against

860
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:37,359
than

861
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,919
uh banana banana sacks with herminem you

862
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:41,038
know

863
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:44,960
yeah and so i think inadvertently

864
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:47,359
uh people bred away from the skunk

865
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,200
yeah without realizing it because you

866
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:50,879
know you breed some stuff it's a hermit

867
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,640
mess it reeks you're like oh god that's

868
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,799
a hermit mess i'm gonna get you know

869
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,880
i'm not gonna breed towards that side

870
00:31:54,798 --> 00:31:57,918
and the idea that you could have a

871
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,919
linked trait

872
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,159
where you have a very desirable trait

873
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:05,519
and a not so desirable trait

874
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:06,880
uh together you know is the biggest

875
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,960
breeder pain in the ass

876
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,880
ever is a link trait with undesirable

877
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,720
traits he's like oh all the potency

878
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,519
comes in these low yielding ones that

879
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,240
suck

880
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,839
you know all these huge donkey dicks and

881
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,200
like have the structure is incredible

882
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:22,319
they're all bland

883
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:25,360
you know yep and so

884
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:27,119
you know uh the problem is is that you

885
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:28,639
know you have a situation it's like it's

886
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:30,239
kind of the same thing

887
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,759
like you know like i told you about with

888
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,519
the trinity right where the trinity

889
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:36,319
didn't spread very far

890
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,679
and so when we lost it and i kept trying

891
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:41,119
to get it back

892
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:42,798
um people would give me fakes yeah

893
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:44,959
it's not because they were dicks most of

894
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:46,720
the time but because they never had it

895
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,000
back in the day so when they got it from

896
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,519
someone they didn't

897
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,038
they had no way of knowing that it

898
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,200
wasn't it yeah

899
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:54,960
of course yeah um and so then i would

900
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,440
have to be the bearer of bad news

901
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,120
you know and be like no this isn't it

902
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,679
yeah and people hate the bear of bad

903
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:01,359
news

904
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,880
and that's kind of what's happened with

905
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:04,639
this super skunk right

906
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,799
is that yeah there's obviously this

907
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,880
desire in the community

908
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:10,960
to have these these road killed terps

909
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,679
come back right

910
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,360
everyone who finds super skunk has a

911
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:18,320
current seed company

912
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:19,439
and is making seeds to sold to the

913
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:22,480
public

914
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:25,919
no one ever shows up to

915
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:28,319
events with a couple jars of fresh skunk

916
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,360
and lets the proof be in the pudding

917
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:31,359
yeah right

918
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:32,798
they get the cut they advertise the cut

919
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:33,599
here's the cut we're breeding with the

920
00:33:32,798 --> 00:33:36,079
cut

921
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:36,879
buy my seeds find the amazing terps in

922
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:40,000
the cup

923
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,640
right or they get kinks you know yeah

924
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,599
and so

925
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,799
so you don't know you don't know if if

926
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:47,439
they're lying

927
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:48,398
because i don't know or whatever or they

928
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,120
just have no id

929
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:52,158
they just never had it in the past you

930
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:55,678
know to know that

931
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:59,519
to know what skunk is yeah but actual

932
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:01,600
to what the actual skunk cut is you know

933
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:04,480
and so you know by the early to mid

934
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:07,519
2000s it had been dropped enough

935
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:10,000
um that uh you know uh

936
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,639
various people had lost it through you

937
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,800
know

938
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,240
lots of the same reasons that everybody

939
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,519
loses cuts

940
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:20,078
fires busts accidents breakups

941
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:21,759
you know people not returning it um i

942
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,359
had backed up with a couple people they

943
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,919
refused to give it back to me at one

944
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:26,639
point

945
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:28,559
uh and then lost it in the future and um

946
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,679
i had some stuff happen and i lost it

947
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:30,960
and we've been

948
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,280
you know we've been hunting it ever

949
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,358
since and uh

950
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,839
you know i mean we're both obviously

951
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:40,878
friends with skunk bar

952
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:43,358
um all these new school super skunk

953
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:43,358
finds

954
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,960
i mean what are you gonna say they just

955
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:49,599
end up they end up not looking

956
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,320
i mean what's awesome is that he's got

957
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,399
these

958
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,480
he's got these you know uh these

959
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:57,519
pictures these polaroids

960
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:00,159
that are undisputable

961
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:02,559
that was the cut i had that is so big

962
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:03,598
that he has those pictures we're buddies

963
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:05,358
we got it from you know

964
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,880
it came from the same place the story

965
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:10,559
was the same thing

966
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:13,280
you know so um you know it's it's it

967
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:13,838
and you know you have all these other

968
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,640
shorter

969
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:17,519
squatter afghan all these other

970
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:19,920
different looking

971
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:20,960
you know super skunk cuts and then the

972
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,440
other part of it too

973
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,838
is that you have people that like okay

974
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,838
so this guy had the super skunk at once

975
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:30,480
right well then as soon as that dude

976
00:35:28,838 --> 00:35:32,559
verifies

977
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,559
right yeah well then all of a sudden

978
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:35,920
okay we have it now we can trade bait it

979
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:38,799
now we can get spread out

980
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,000
now this person has the cut and you know

981
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,119
that's the problem

982
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,358
and that's the problem you know and so

983
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:47,519
you know i mean before everybody who's

984
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:48,799
listening holy [ __ ] we're up to 242

985
00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:52,000
people on this thing

986
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,440
but uh yeah the super skunk was not a

987
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,838
perfect cut

988
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,079
you know like it wasn't in my opinion it

989
00:35:55,838 --> 00:36:01,199
wasn't the holy grail did it have

990
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:04,240
crazy rare skunk terps absolutely

991
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:05,118
it had that spades was it enjoyable to

992
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:08,078
smoke

993
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,880
sure right i don't think it held a

994
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:12,480
candle

995
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,480
to the dog the d some of the cushes

996
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,320
a lot of the modern cuts right now that

997
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,358
we would consider to be elite

998
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:22,559
you know you would consider it to have

999
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:25,440
moderate potency at best yes

1000
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:27,519
you know it wasn't it you know i mean

1001
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,838
you know various cuts have various

1002
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:31,358
uh qualities and and yeah and other

1003
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:34,880
things and you know and so

1004
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:36,719
it didn't check all the boxes yeah

1005
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,320
was it a great cut or was it worth

1006
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:40,078
having yes uh

1007
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:42,640
was it a pain in the ass to grow at

1008
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:45,359
times yes

1009
00:36:42,639 --> 00:36:47,838
yes think about but you know and you

1010

1011
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:52,239
i think you know i mean obviously you

1012
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,559
know all of

1013
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:57,199
uh chem dogs early breedings were all

1014
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:57,199
accidental

1015
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,280
right yeah you know that as far as we

1016
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:02,879
know that's the correct yeah

1017
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,119
but he was well i mean the thing is that

1018
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,760
nobody was reversing back then

1019
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,119
no jesus [ __ ] christ right and yeah

1020
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,200
noah's making feminists

1021
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,320
on purpose feeds back then and so you

1022
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:14,159
only you know

1023
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,440
so you know the only way you're crossing

1024
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:18,639
two female cuts

1025
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:21,280
is accidentally yes you know

1026
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:22,000
and those accidents you know um they led

1027
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,680
to some of the best

1028
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:28,320
weed ever yeah you know uh yeah

1029
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:29,919
in many people's opinion yeah and you

1030
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,359
know i mean that's that's like a whole

1031
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,200
nother

1032
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:35,279
uh thing that steps you know maybe it

1033
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:37,199
steps on toes or doesn't to talk about

1034
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,480
all those kind of theories about various

1035
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:42,480
things but

1036
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:45,679
um i have not seen the real super skunk

1037
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:48,400
um since i i lost it um

1038
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:50,399
which has been you know uh quite a while

1039
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:54,240
at this point yeah

1040
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:57,280
we've been hunting it for a long time um

1041
00:37:54,239 --> 00:38:01,598
you know i i don't think it exists

1042
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:04,000
you know there's always the possibility

1043
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:06,079
there are still pockets in america

1044
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,079
where um you know people aren't really

1045
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:10,480
connected they're not on the internet

1046
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,680
they're not dialed in to like the scene

1047
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,838
so to speak

1048
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:15,118
so yeah i mean obviously just like we

1049
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:18,480
know right so

1050
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:20,480
to jump on a european trip everybody

1051
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:24,079
thought the a52 was lost

1052
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:27,358
for well over a decade yeah right

1053
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:30,160
yeah at least yeah nobody could find it

1054
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:33,119
and then karma found a guy that was

1055
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:36,000
holding on to this cut for neville

1056
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,838
neville told him not to tell anybody and

1057
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,000
it was the a52

1058
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:41,838
yeah and karma wasn't even sure what he

1059
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,199
had right so he had to give it to

1060
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:48,400
yosemite who grew with neville forever

1061
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:51,679
to grow it out and confirm it was it

1062
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,680
so it's possible right it is absolutely

1063
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:55,759
possible exactly and i think we are all

1064
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:58,078
desperately hoping that happens too

1065
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,720
no yeah it's possible that that could

1066
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:03,599
exist because the a5 was lost

1067
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:05,039
for a long time i mean a short period of

1068
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,680
time that it was lost i mean

1069
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:09,920
i i think it's i think it got lost in

1070
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:12,480
the switzerland raids

1071
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,280
um when they shut down shanti and those

1072
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,960
different

1073
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,800
and stuff and it got lost in holland

1074
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,920
during the bust eras

1075
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,960
and then it was lost for you know

1076
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,800
10 12 14 years

1077
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,720
something like that until it just popped

1078
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,599
up within the last few

1079
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:30,159
last few and now losing friends fast

1080
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,160
over it

1081
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:33,199
everybody's [ __ ] arguing over it real

1082
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:34,960
fast

1083
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:36,559
i mean yeah it's cool that we were that

1084
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:39,679
people are still fighting over

1085
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:41,358
over cannabis made in in the late 80s i

1086
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:43,679
know right

1087
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:45,440
to how good it is and it's you know it's

1088
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:46,879
also not only as a testament to how good

1089
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,519
it is but like people want to make money

1090
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,640
off it too

1091
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:53,199
some people so if you've got rare and

1092
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:54,719
and you've got rare access and you can

1093
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:56,480
bring some things you know you're

1094
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:58,480
you're you're a breeder who operates in

1095
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,240
the market so if you've got something

1096
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,320
nobody else does

1097
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:03,919
and you can hype it and it's worthy and

1098
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:05,680
you can you know

1099
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,519
i mean that's what all these super skunk

1100
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:09,199
people are trying to do right

1101
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:10,559
right exactly what's going on yeah they

1102
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:12,318
make they're trying to make a bunch of

1103
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:13,920
money before people realize they don't

1104
00:40:12,318 --> 00:40:16,079
have what they have

1105
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,519
correct and that's that's the jam you

1106
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,079
know a lot of people want to sell seeds

1107
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:20,480
or

1108
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,680
pass cuts or do this and that and you've

1109
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,318
got a good

1110
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:25,519
at a minimum four months three months um

1111
00:40:24,318 --> 00:40:28,318
before you're gonna get

1112
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:30,000
any kind of pushback now the other

1113
00:40:28,318 --> 00:40:32,159
problem is that i've noticed

1114
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,760
when people either invest in buying that

1115
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:36,159
cut or they've invested

1116
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,000
um emotionally in that cut at that point

1117
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:39,759
now they think they've got

1118
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,679
a really rare cut that's gonna you know

1119
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:45,920
bring some kind of value to their life

1120
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:48,399
however they see fit and um they're now

1121
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:50,079
in that mindset where this is it if it's

1122
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,880
not yet i don't have

1123
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:54,318
whatever agenda purpose that i had like

1124
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,079
i was saying with the trinity people

1125
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:58,960
would get butt hurt at me sometimes when

1126
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:00,720
i would be like politely that's not it

1127
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,720
and they would do a whole thing and you

1128
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:05,279
don't know what i traded to get it

1129
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:07,358
and da da da da da and i'd be like well

1130
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,440
you know i'm sorry about all that like i

1131
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:12,159
have nothing to do with any of that but

1132
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,800
yeah remains to be seen it's still not

1133
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:16,239
it

1134
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:18,560
it just isn't it you know yeah and so

1135
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:20,000
you know uh it's gotten to a point where

1136
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:23,920
there's a narrow group of

1137
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,400
people who had stupor skunk it

1138
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:29,119
you know and some of them had longer

1139
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,559
relationships with it than others

1140
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,119
and so some of them are a little bit

1141
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:36,239
better at identifying than others

1142
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:38,960
yes exactly you know yeah

1143
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:40,719
without um naming names or stepping on

1144
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,199
toes or doing anything like that you

1145
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:43,279
know

1146
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:44,318
we've had issues in the past in the

1147
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,720
community

1148
00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:50,159
with people that you know are you know

1149
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:54,000
well thought of or respected that verify

1150
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:56,239
yes then once it's verified right

1151
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,838
well that's all that's all she wrote

1152
00:41:56,239 --> 00:42:01,199
that's it it's verified

1153
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:03,119
you know and then you know i you know i

1154
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:04,239
hit up you know skunk vod or something

1155
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:07,119
and i'll be like what about that

1156
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:09,439
verified cut and he's like it's not

1157
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:10,160
it absolutely isn't it i don't know if

1158
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,200
they ever had

1159
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:15,838
it if they think that's it yes right

1160
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:18,078
and so you know like if he tells me if

1161
00:42:15,838 --> 00:42:18,480
he hits me up and he tells me i think i

1162
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,839
found

1163
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,318
it i'm gonna get excited yeah absolutely

1164
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:24,799
because he's

1165
00:42:22,318 --> 00:42:25,599
i i tend to think him above everyone

1166
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,560
else is gonna

1167
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:30,000
know that cut really really intimately

1168
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:30,318
being that it came from his mentor and

1169
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,719
he

1170
00:42:30,318 --> 00:42:33,920
worked with it for so long i mean you

1171
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:36,399
know the the fact

1172
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,280
the fact remains is that him our buddy

1173
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:40,480
and myself

1174
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:42,240
we cropped it quite a bit for three

1175
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,159
years so you do that

1176
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:45,919
you do crop after crop after crop for

1177
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:48,559
that a bit you run anything for a number

1178
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:50,400
of years is your is your main squeeze

1179
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:53,039
you know you learn a lot about it

1180
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,559
absolutely uh when my buddy and i were

1181
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:57,519
i mean that's the thing too and you know

1182
00:42:54,559 --> 00:43:00,799
we've talked about this before is that

1183
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:01,599
since we bred with it a bunch i got to

1184
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,280
see

1185
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:04,880
you know that's one of the things that i

1186
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,240
really respect about you know

1187
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:11,280
uh say like uh csi or

1188
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:13,838
archive who i see on here you know um

1189
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,519
where there's only so many breeders out

1190
00:43:13,838 --> 00:43:16,719
there right now that actually test their

1191
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:19,519
own gear

1192
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:20,399
sure so don't test your own gear you

1193
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:23,280
don't really know

1194
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:25,119
what uh you don't really know what

1195
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,079
traits your clones pass

1196
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,318
yeah you're never going to see it

1197
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:30,880
firsthand never you don't see

1198
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:32,559
what how they breed did they breed clean

1199
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,480
do they breed a mess did they throw

1200
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:36,719
consistent phenotypes do they

1201
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:39,358
you know growing a bunch of growing a

1202
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:42,399
bunch of um

1203
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:44,078
uh oh man uh

1204
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,240
truth man someone's asking about truth

1205
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:49,839
band band yeah that's that's a horrible

1206
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:54,239
subject so um but uh

1207
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:56,078
um yeah you know but so we grew uh

1208
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:58,318
you know buddy from staten island and

1209
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:01,839
myself we grew out hundreds

1210
00:43:58,318 --> 00:44:03,599
of you know uh dog and and skunk and

1211
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:06,838
other various skunk hybrids

1212
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:08,720
you know and um and we saw what it

1213
00:44:06,838 --> 00:44:10,719
passed

1214
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:11,919
you know you see what it throws out you

1215
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:14,719
know and

1216
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:15,760
so a lot of the the various like

1217
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:18,078
semi-proven

1218
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,359
semi-unproven theories i have about

1219
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,000
certain things we've talked about a

1220
00:44:19,358 --> 00:44:22,400
bunch

1221
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,920
are just on my observation of like not

1222
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:27,760
very many people

1223
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:29,838
like have had both parents yeah

1224
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,359
my buddy myself we're like literally in

1225
00:44:29,838 --> 00:44:35,440
like a handful

1226
00:44:31,358 --> 00:44:39,199
of people um that probably had both

1227
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:42,480
yeah and we're familiar with both yes so

1228
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:46,879
and all that and so um

1229
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:49,760
you know uh i mean

1230
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:52,160
you know uh the the skunk definitely

1231
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:54,880
seemed to be connected to herms

1232
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:55,199
yeah and the you know when we were doing

1233
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,599
the

1234
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:59,358
the superdog stuff if we bred away from

1235
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:01,440
the herms we brought away from some of

1236
00:44:59,358 --> 00:45:03,279
the stuff we liked

1237
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:06,000
so then the trick was to try to find

1238
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,880
like a minimal or acceptable amount of

1239
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,400
herms

1240
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:11,599
yeah or okay like say take the chem d

1241
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:15,119
for instance

1242
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:17,200
yes md herms like crazy at times if it

1243
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:19,440
gets a little test especially in depth

1244
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:20,879
sure you know not as much as indoor but

1245
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,079
in depth certainly or if it gets a

1246
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,559
little stressed

1247
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:25,920
sure but it's not live pollen yeah it's

1248
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:28,400
not it's not it's sterile

1249
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,240
it throws bananas but there's not really

1250
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,800
live pollen in those bananas

1251
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:34,159
you know um so then you're looking for

1252
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,240
you're looking for

1253
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:38,559
you know one throws herms and has the

1254
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:41,919
stink but doesn't have the danger

1255
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:45,358
inherent in um in all that

1256
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:46,960
you know yeah uh it was a long and an

1257
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:50,078
expensive breeding project

1258
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:52,240
uh because back then uh

1259
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:54,318
you know obviously herb went for a lot

1260
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:57,199
more and it was a lot riskier

1261
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:58,159
um so anytime you dedicated rooms or

1262
00:45:57,199 --> 00:45:59,759
areas

1263
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:02,159
to constant breeding that could have

1264
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,520
been just some kind of production run

1265
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:04,879
and then you're not even selling the

1266
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:06,000
beans they're just for you and your

1267
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:09,039
friends

1268
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,880
um you know but uh

1269
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:12,639
but you know we had we always had dual

1270
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,760
stuff like we always had this goal of

1271
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:15,838
trying to like

1272
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,280
you know improve the gene pool a little

1273
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:19,920
bit you know

1274
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,040
and create more weed that we liked and

1275
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,119
so now it's like

1276
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:25,440
most most people's breeding is like take

1277
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:27,680
two famous things that people want

1278
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,720
mash them together and then sell the

1279
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:31,199
name

1280
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:32,000
yeah right where it's like we were like

1281
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:34,559
okay like

1282
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,280
we we like the skunk smell and we like

1283
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:37,440
the color

1284
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,519
and we like the the you know the

1285
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:41,519
quickness and all that can we marry that

1286
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:44,159
to the dog's potency

1287
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:45,440
and feeling and warm happy buzz and all

1288
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:48,639
that is there some

1289
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:50,559
hybrid that we can create that marries

1290
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:52,719
those two things together

1291
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:54,078
sure and so that's obviously the classic

1292
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:55,598
way to breed is you look at two

1293
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,839
different things and you're like

1294
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:00,079
i want traits from this and traits from

1295
00:46:57,838 --> 00:47:03,679
this to end up in its progeny

1296
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:04,880
yeah right you know and uh so that's

1297
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:09,118
that's really the gig

1298
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:12,000
so um you know it uh

1299
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:13,838
you know sadly it seems like a bunch of

1300
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,559
the stuff that got passed it got passed

1301
00:47:13,838 --> 00:47:17,679
around in

1302
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:19,599
massachusetts quite a bit more

1303
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:21,199
but it seems like from what we've been

1304
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:24,240
able to determine

1305
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:27,679
that it uh maybe

1306
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:30,078
it the actual cut itself wasn't passed

1307
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:33,759
around nearly as much as people think

1308
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:35,599
maybe in that one maybe bag seed maybe

1309
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,280
something different got passed out and

1310
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:38,000
it got called super skunk and it was

1311
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:41,519
from

1312
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,358
said dude so of course it's it

1313
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:45,519
and then you're off to the races and

1314
00:47:43,358 --> 00:47:48,000
then that thing gets spread around

1315
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:49,519
and then the more you know i mean we've

1316
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,159
we talked about this before too

1317
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:53,039
but like you know rez calling his

1318
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:56,159
[ __ ] line

1319
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:58,960
sour diesel yes yes because

1320
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:01,358
they [ __ ] everything up a named cut and

1321
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:04,079
then makes a [ __ ] line out of it

1322
00:48:01,358 --> 00:48:05,679
finding the actual named cut once

1323
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:09,119
there's a whole bunch of

1324
00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:10,799
of you know yeah other stuff out there

1325
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:13,599
that has the same name

1326
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,640
is problematic yeah and it became damn

1327
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:17,760
near impossible

1328
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:21,440
in some cases with that you know and uh

1329
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:24,480
you know and so i mean uh you know

1330
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:27,280
the uh i think

1331
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,800
the super skunk has a semi there's

1332
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:31,119
obviously there's some pretty famous

1333
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:33,519
people in the weed community that had it

1334
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:35,200
so that means like some gravitas to the

1335
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:37,440
fact that it was killer

1336
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:40,159
and then they was killer and then it

1337
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:43,358
comes from this 90s historical era

1338
00:48:40,159 --> 00:48:45,519
obviously right and you know and then on

1339
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:47,598
top of that it probably

1340
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:49,519
is in a bunch of other things that

1341
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:51,838
people don't realize it's in

1342
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:53,838
right correct and everybody knows what a

1343
00:48:51,838 --> 00:48:55,440
rank skunk smells like everybody in

1344
00:48:53,838 --> 00:48:56,159
america for the most part is probably in

1345
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,800
america yeah

1346
00:48:56,159 --> 00:49:01,039
ones you know and all that and so it's a

1347
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:04,240
really distinctive terp

1348
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:04,960
yeah right and it doesn't expire it does

1349
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:07,199
not

1350
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,960
you know i mean some people on here know

1351
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:10,719
some people don't but i got lucky enough

1352
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,760
and i cracked them and what became known

1353
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:14,480
as the mendo p

1354
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:15,119
you know and what's interesting about

1355
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,000
that cut

1356
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:19,680
is that like if that cut didn't exist

1357
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,280
there's no other

1358
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:25,279
line that i know of that has those terps

1359
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,960
yeah like those terps are in cannabis

1360
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,240
obviously yeah they're obviously in

1361
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,800
cannabis but it's very unique

1362
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:32,959
the modern cannabis and anything you

1363
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:35,519
find that ends up smelling like that

1364
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:36,159
you discover it was descended from that

1365
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:40,000
yeah

1366
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:43,199
right and so you know um

1367
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,239
you know the the skunk knows in my

1368
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:47,598
opinion

1369
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:51,039
really only pops out here and there in

1370
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:52,160
its descendants on occasion yes that's

1371
00:49:51,039 --> 00:49:55,199
the mendo perps

1372
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:59,279
yes mendo purple indeed um

1373
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:59,759
so um you know and so it just doesn't

1374
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:02,640
even

1375
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:04,400
it it uh nobody's found it nobody's

1376
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:05,598
nobody's made the terps nobody's found

1377
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,440
the terps nobody's

1378
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:08,720
been able to produce seed lines or

1379
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:11,599
cuttings

1380
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:13,199
anytime because if they did it would be

1381
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:13,920
announced they would be it's they would

1382
00:50:13,199 --> 00:50:16,159
be at

1383
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,440
conventions or you know emerald cup or

1384
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:20,159
whatever with jars

1385
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:22,400
and they would be you know it's a lost

1386
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:25,838
terp that people want back

1387
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:28,880
anyone who can capture that that

1388
00:50:25,838 --> 00:50:29,920
terp into a seed line that reliably

1389
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:33,200
produces it and

1390
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:35,760
and let it stay in the bud form is

1391
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:36,399
is going to master it you know so um so

1392
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:40,880
it's obviously

1393
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:42,480
a lot of constituents of it um

1394
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,720
but man trying to get something that

1395
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:47,920
really hangs with that smell

1396
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:50,000
past flower is very very hard to do

1397
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:52,318
yeah and and you know and so everybody

1398
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,079
ever it's got universal recognition of

1399
00:50:52,318 --> 00:50:56,079
what it should smell like

1400
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:57,519
yes there's a whole bunch of fake cuts

1401
00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:00,880
that people try to pretend

1402
00:50:57,519 --> 00:51:04,480
smell like it right it really

1403
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:07,760
did smell like it you know and so

1404
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:10,880
with it there's no faking the funk

1405
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:13,839
unless you have skunk

1406
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,559
oil and you can rub it on a jar i mean

1407
00:51:13,838 --> 00:51:16,078
yeah and all

1408
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,079
and all that and all that regular it's

1409
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:19,280
it's like it's like the scientific

1410
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:21,200
method right

1411
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:23,200
like if somebody can't grow it and

1412
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:26,879
produce the same smell

1413
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:27,199
it's not there yeah exactly it wasn't

1414
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,440
like

1415
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:31,358
you had to do a bomber job of growing it

1416
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:33,760
dude you know i mean

1417
00:51:31,358 --> 00:51:35,039
you know obviously in the 90s uh we've

1418
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,000
all gotten quite a bit better at

1419
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:37,759
gardening

1420
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,760
oh yeah yeah older you get more

1421
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,680
experienced you learn more

1422
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,200
there's way cooler products that make

1423
00:51:41,679 --> 00:51:46,399
your life easier

1424
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:47,358
you know um and i mean we used to mix

1425
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:50,400
soil in a

1426
00:51:47,358 --> 00:51:51,519
[ __ ] cement mixer yeah from raw

1427
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,920
amendments

1428
00:51:51,519 --> 00:51:56,239
yeah yeah all these biological

1429
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:59,280
amendments there wasn't all these like

1430
00:51:56,239 --> 00:51:59,838
you know inoculants and booze and teas

1431
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,000
and this

1432
00:51:59,838 --> 00:52:03,119
and that like there is now it was like

1433
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,079
it was like gh

1434
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:07,838
and you know earth juice and i mean the

1435
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:09,440
even just the stuff that you could get

1436
00:52:07,838 --> 00:52:11,519
and and like you were and you were just

1437
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:14,159
happy that the store carried

1438
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:15,199
yeah sure pretty limited compared to now

1439
00:52:14,159 --> 00:52:19,118
you know

1440
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:23,039
um and so that terp just it just existed

1441
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:24,720
you grew it uh you grew it um

1442
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:27,920
someone's saying about the mendo perps

1443
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:30,239
it is not from the pacific northwest no

1444
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:32,159
think about that question for a second

1445
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:34,639
think about that question

1446
00:52:32,159 --> 00:52:36,879
is mendo purp from the pnw i mean you

1447
00:52:34,639 --> 00:52:38,719
know it's too it's cool dude any ques

1448
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,079
whoever asked that any question is no

1449
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:42,239
he's turpin bird is cool

1450
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:43,839
you know yeah and it really down to it

1451
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:46,558
like most that's the thing right

1452
00:52:43,838 --> 00:52:47,920
is that just so you know like you know

1453
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:48,319
matt and i are going to do uh we're

1454
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:51,440
going to

1455
00:52:48,318 --> 00:52:52,400
we're going to do a a podcast pretty

1456
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,720
soon here

1457
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:56,000
and chat about history and really what

1458
00:52:54,719 --> 00:52:57,519
it boils down to for me

1459
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,119
is like without the i don't really give

1460
00:52:57,519 --> 00:53:00,318
a [ __ ] about fame or rep or anything

1461
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:02,079
like that

1462
00:53:00,318 --> 00:53:04,000
most of our history in the cannabis

1463
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:05,839
community is oral

1464
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,440
you know passed down from people to

1465
00:53:05,838 --> 00:53:09,279
people and there are people

1466
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,480
that have heard the real deal and have

1467
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:13,680
verified and cross

1468
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:15,280
verified type stuff you know um

1469
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:17,358
but it can be really hard for people to

1470
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:19,680
come along later or don't have

1471
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:22,719
personal connection to something i mean

1472
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:25,358
[ __ ] spreads like wildfire at times

1473
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:25,919
you know and certain people have vested

1474
00:53:25,358 --> 00:53:29,119
interests

1475
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:31,838
in in spreading [ __ ] and so

1476
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:32,720
you know counteracting that with truth

1477
00:53:31,838 --> 00:53:37,440
um

1478
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:37,439
and uh you know so

1479
00:53:38,239 --> 00:53:42,000
but yeah you know it really is it is

1480
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:42,639
it's an underground it was an

1481
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,679
underground

1482
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:47,358
illegal venture and lots of little

1483
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:50,159
individual groups

1484
00:53:47,358 --> 00:53:51,199
um you know like passing on knowledge to

1485
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:54,239
each other

1486
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:57,118
you know and it just so happens that

1487
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:58,879
you know like uh the grateful dead uh

1488
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,599
and the kids that followed the grateful

1489
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,599
dead

1490
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:03,680
um that was probably like the greatest

1491
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:05,039
open-air weed market in american history

1492
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:07,199
at a certain point oh yeah

1493
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:08,400
after them after jerry died started

1494
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:11,358
growing weed

1495
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:13,200
because it kept the lifestyle going and

1496
00:54:11,358 --> 00:54:13,759
for a while now it's not it's not true

1497
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:15,279
