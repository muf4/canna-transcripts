1
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:26,399
what's up everyone

2
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:34,238
sorry i'm still getting uh set up here

3
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,759
waiting for everyone to show up to

4
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:38,959
we will be

5
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:40,479
joined shortly by not so and to me

6
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,840
genomics

7
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:44,718
and we will be doing

8
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,359
our

9
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,359
um talk on hplv

10
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:51,200
so i'm pretty stoked

11
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:52,799
we made it here

12
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,199
to this moment

13
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:58,319
i've been sick all week so apologize i'm

14
00:00:55,198 --> 00:01:00,718
a little [ __ ] slow today i've tried

15
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,480
my best i really am and i didn't want to

16
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,280
miss out on this because it's important

17
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:07,679
to me that everybody gets this

18
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,680
info

19
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:10,560
so yeah

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,560
my fans allowed

21
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,799
i think friends in here maybe bryn can

22
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,200
help with that

23
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,200
let's see

24
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,560
i'll grab it

25
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:28,559
you can okay

26
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:34,719
okay

27
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:34,719
got natso coming in

28
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:38,399
maybe if this works like it should there

29
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:40,639
we go

30
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,079
i'm here what's up now i just have to

31
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,640

there we go now i can invite

37
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:02,000
and she can jump in

38
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:05,519
i have a whole bunch of notes

39
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,040
do you i do

40
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:08,878
really i'm

41
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,280
i am semi prepared

42
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,120
hi casa nice to see you yeah good to see

43
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,680
you can you can you guys hear me all

44
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,159
right absolutely

45
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,000
i'm matthew this is not so dog and we

46
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:22,239
are the reader syndicate

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
nice to meet you guys nice to meet you

48
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,120
thanks for inviting me on tonight this

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,639
is awesome

50
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,400
no i think i think the whole community

51
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:31,039
needs to know more about what's going on

52
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,760
which the with the hplv how it's being

53
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:36,079
transmitted through clones how rampant

54
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:38,719
it is or isn't and how scared they

55
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,680
should or shouldn't be all of the above

56
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:41,840
so

57
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,080
i don't know in a in a conversation like

58
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,360
this do you want to start with

59
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,599
where would you want to start a patient

60
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,840
zero or do you start with what we're

61
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:51,759
dealing

62
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,878
with um well maybe the best place to

63
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:56,959
start is to just kind of explain what a

64
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:59,199
vibroid is what that's a great place

65
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,360
thyroid is that was one of my questions

66
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:05,119
i thought would be a good place to begin

67
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:08,159
yes perfectly yeah so um so what is a

68
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,319
viroid um viroids are

69
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:12,399
one of the simplest forms of life that

70
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:13,679
exists on the planet if we can even call

71
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,280
it life

72
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,480
um as opposed to other organisms like

73
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,759
bacteria

74
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:24,719
or fungus or even viruses they don't

75
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:27,280
have anything on the outside to protect

76
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:31,519
their genetic material so most organisms

77
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:35,199
have like a fat layer or a protein layer

78
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:37,360
viroids are simply a free-floating tiny

79
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,878
piece of genetic information and that's

80
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,360
all that they are

81
00:03:38,878 --> 00:03:44,079
so when i say tiny

82
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,680
the human genome has about 3 billion

83
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,519
letters or

84
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,920
base pairs um

85
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,480
viroids have 250.

86
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:54,798
so we're talking about a really really

87
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:57,438
small

88
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,840
life form and a lot of people actually

89
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:01,759
refer to them as

90
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,479
fossils that are left over from

91
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:07,759
basically the beginning of life when the

92
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,878
theory is that it was just rna

93
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:10,639
and so

94
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:13,359
they're kind of a remnant of that

95
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:16,399
primordial earth time when all life was

96
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,840
replicating rna um and these tiny little

97
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,719
things are really infectious in plants

98
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,039
yeah

99
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,680
yeah are they are they then considered

100
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,840
are they parasites

101
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,079
because they

102
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:32,478
can't i mean they can't exist without

103
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,879
contacting some other more complex form

104
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:38,079
of life right and infecting it

105
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:40,719
exactly there are they are 100 dependent

106
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:42,719
on the plant metabolism to

107
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,720
replicate it to help it you know

108
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,240
transport all around the plant to do

109
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,560
everything that it does

110
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,400
um so they're the tiniest molecular

111
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,918
parasite uh that we know of yep

112
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:57,679
and what we're working with with this

113
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:59,918
current uh hops latent

114
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,360
virus or viroid i should say because

115
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:02,639
there is a difference right there a

116
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,280
major difference

117
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,280
yes yeah so so just to clarify and

118
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:09,119
because there is actually a hot platen

119
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:12,478
virus also

120
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,600
just to make things confusing

121
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:18,079
but viruses have an some type of outside

122
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,919
protection for their dna um and it's

123
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:22,478
often like a protein coat that goes

124
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:24,319
outside viroids are just the naked

125
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:26,079
genetic information so they are two

126
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,478
distinct things

127
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:29,279
and viruses are more complex

128
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:31,680
than

129
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,758
right they have more of those they're

130
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,600
they're viroids are even smaller than

131
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:39,520
viruses correct yes exactly so um

132
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,639
viruses not only do they have that

133
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:45,758
outside coat but they actually encode

134
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:48,160
information that forces the cell to make

135
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,319
special little molecular machines called

136
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:54,400
enzymes that will that will help the

137
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:57,199
virus to replicate viroids do not encode

138
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:59,519
even for a special machine so they are

139
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,240
completely dependent on hijacking the

140
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:04,560
machines in the plant and forcing them

141
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,280
to replicate the viroid instead of doing

142
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,759
what they're supposed to be doing

143
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:11,519
so very simple

144
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,280
i mean maybe another part of the

145
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:14,719
beginning and like you you could talk

146
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:16,879
about the beginning for you but i

147
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,880
thought maybe it would be interesting to

148
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:19,680
talk about the beginning for us

149
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,800
okay

150
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,800
so

151
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,800
there was there was an aspect like you

152
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,919
know because i'm old or whatever like in

153
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,879
the 90s

154
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:28,079
um

155
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:29,918
none of the stuff that we're probably

156
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:31,599
going to talk about later

157
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:34,079
as far as like you know preventing

158
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,400
transmission was used people used the

159
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:38,719
same razor blades there wasn't very much

160
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:40,000
disease there wasn't very much worry

161
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,199
going on

162
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,879
a lot of these things were kind of

163
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,240
unheard of and because it was a

164
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:47,918
clandestine thing and very small circles

165
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,160
even if a circle got infected with

166
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:51,038
something it didn't spread that much

167
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,439
so

168
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:55,439
during like the ig period

169
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,879
we had some good friends of ours that's

170
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:59,519
that you know they would you know clone

171
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:00,959
trading happens and all that right and

172
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,879
all of a sudden people started

173
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,000
experiencing something that we call

174
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:04,800
dudding

175
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,120
yes

176
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,800
right duds all of a sudden the plant

177
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,478
went from being healthy and happy to

178
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,400
unhappy

179
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:13,839
and for a long time we didn't know if it

180
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:15,519
was one thing

181
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:16,799
we didn't know if it was a multitude of

182
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:19,758
things

183
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,598
we just observationally could see that

184
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,479
some plants resin production would go

185
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:26,159
way down their health would go way down

186
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:28,000
we had some friends before they even

187
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,960
knew it almost reminded me a little bit

188
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,918
of like

189
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:34,318
um like when the early part of the aids

190
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:36,079
epidemic but in plants where people

191
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,160
didn't know how it was transmitted

192
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:39,199
people didn't know it existed

193
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,759
people didn't know how to take

194
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,400
precautions for it and then by the time

195
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,160
that we figured out like what it was

196
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,799
and we can start talking to people like

197
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:53,120
you it's everywhere

198
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:55,038
yeah yeah exactly i so um hoplin vibrate

199
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,800
itself was characterized in hops in the

200
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:57,598
80s

201
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,840
and

202
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:02,959
because hops plants are so genetically

203
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:05,679
similar to cannabis at some point the

204
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:08,079
viroid sort of came into cannabis but

205
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,000
nobody knows exactly when this happened

206
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:13,519
and just like you said i suspect it's

207
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,759
been circulating for a really long time

208
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:17,918
and the negative about that of course is

209
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,879
that by the time we realized it like you

210
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:22,719
said it's everywhere um and you know

211
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,479
it's just been going unchecked for so

212
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,879
long that it's really become

213
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,159
like a cannabis pandemic and you know

214
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,919
that's going to lead to a lot of

215
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,759
questions for me actually because i

216
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:33,679
think there's like there's like two

217
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,320
things here one there's like the the

218
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:38,239
aspect of figuring out what it does

219
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,800
right and then there's like best

220
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,639
practices for how we can slow it down

221
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,319
you know and one of the interesting

222
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:45,679
aspects is like is that there's a

223
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,959
there's a thing that matt and i called

224
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:49,120
bro science

225
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,119
yes

226
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,600
bro science where you know there's a lot

227
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,399
of rumors because cannabis has been in

228
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,519
the shadows for a long time um it hasn't

229
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,600
had the ability for like uc davis or the

230
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,600
university of iowa or various scientists

231
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,240
to study these things so we have to make

232
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,959
we have to like observe and guess

233
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,560
right and so then there's um so then at

234
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,759
times then there's there's a i think

235
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:13,278
there's a lot of

236
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,879
uh

237
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:16,879
you know i watched a previous interview

238
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:18,480
that you were in and i think enormous

239
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,799
amounts of people were shocked when you

240
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:24,159
said that like 99 alcohol does nothing

241
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:26,000
to it yeah that was a big shocker yeah

242
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:28,079
right and then i've been i've been in

243
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
greenhouses where they had like the

244
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,480
torches attached to the end of like

245
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,958
propane canisters and they were cleaning

246
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,399
their tools in between and then you were

247
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:39,439
like oh that doesn't do anything very

248
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,720
much either right yeah yeah yeah and so

249
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,480
not that we need to go into all that

250
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,040
right this second but i just mean that i

251
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,720
think there's a lot of misinformation

252
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:49,039
right and just like any other kind of

253
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,080
virus or anything going around the best

254
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:53,838
way to figure it out is so people know

255
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,720
what works and what doesn't

256
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,920
how

257
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,759
how do you even get infected you know

258
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:01,838
can bugs infect you

259
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:02,958
you know can touching plants infect you

260
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,959
is it just

261
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,799
run off in razor blades is it there's a

262
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:09,119
whole host of stuff that i think most

263
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:10,159
people are still pretty ignorant of

264
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,639
yeah um

265
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:15,199
and uh it might be it might change over

266
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:16,879
time but you know you seem to be

267
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,120
someone that like has some real

268
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:20,159
experience and like what is actually in

269
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,799
testing

270
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:26,639
turning out to be effective how did how

271
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:28,078
did to me come into testing um for hplp

272
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:29,679
how did you come into testing for

273
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:33,120
cannabis anything

274
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:34,958
yeah so um so basically i can just give

275
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,120
you a really like quick two-minute

276
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:39,838
background on the company um

277
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,240
so we uh started tumi genomics about two

278
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,800
and a half years ago and it was actually

279
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,720
um started originally by myself and my

280
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:48,639
husband who is also one of the

281
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,399
scientists in the company and one of our

282
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:52,159
entrepreneurial friends

283
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,720
um and basically we were both at the end

284
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:58,159
of our post docs we kind of decided

285
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,000
academia wasn't for us and um we wanted

286
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:01,838
to take what we knew how to do like all

287
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
of this inventive you know cutting edge

288
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,839
science that was going on in academia

289
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,320
and bring it into an industry or a

290
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,000
geography that really needed that the

291
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,360
tools we could make or the information

292
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,320
that we could share

293
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,959
um

294
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,959
yeah and so we started the company and

295
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:19,599
then about a month after we started

296
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:21,278
covet hit and everything stopped and we

297
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,720
all the plans that we had made for our

298
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:23,759
brand new startup were completely

299
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,639
squished

300
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:28,480
so um we said well okay we'll just

301
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:29,519
jump into cobit and see if we can help

302
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,360
out

303
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,000
and we started doing that we made a

304
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,399
covid diagnostic kind of a point of care

305
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,639
or an on-site test and we ran a cobia

306
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,799
lab for the university and kind of at a

307
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:42,879
similar time we had somebody contact us

308
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:44,799
who had to grow and she was having

309
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:46,159
issues with hotplate and viroid and she

310
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:47,439
couldn't find

311
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:50,000
uh you know a place where she could

312
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,839
reliably test or whatever and she asked

313
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,839
if we could help out

314
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,760
so we designed a test for her kind of at

315
00:11:53,839 --> 00:12:00,000
the same time that we're also doing like

316
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:01,759
a ton of qpcr testing for kovid um and

317
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,720
it just kind of grew from there by word

318
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:06,879
of mouth but um once we got into the

319
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,639
industry and i started you know meeting

320
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:10,879
the people and understanding what was

321
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,278
going on i was like cannabis is

322
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:15,759
absolutely the industry for us because

323
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:17,679
yeah um we wanted to make a difference

324
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:19,360
we wanted to take what we knew how to do

325
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:21,759
and help people and i think in this

326
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,600
industry you know we can add a lot of

327
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:24,799
good insight and tools to really help

328
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,079
people out

329
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:28,958
and that so that was kind of how we

330
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,719
ended up here um my husband's overjoyed

331
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:33,599
because we've had a tent in our basement

332
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,440
for like a decade and that's always yeah

333
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,600
this has always been his favorite hobby

334
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,839
and now he's like ah now it's my career

335
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,759
so um well that's gotta be awesome for

336
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,920
him for sure

337
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:48,000
he's he's always down there taking notes

338
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:48,000
and stuff so and and now he doesn't

339
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,919
i mean

340
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:53,838
you know there's i mean this hop blatant

341
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:55,439
is just one aspect of it but i do think

342
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,000
it's interesting that

343
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,800
you know um you look at other crops and

344
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,958
you get to stand on decades of research

345
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:04,479
um there's a lot of information that's

346
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:07,359
out there there's a lot of breeding

347
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,560
there's a lot of resources for people um

348
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,839
and then all of a sudden you have this

349
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:12,000
thing that's trying to make legal and

350
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,079
it's a multi-billion dollar crop and

351
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,958
nobody knows anything about it other

352
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:16,638
than

353
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,159
like in terms i don't mean anything i

354
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,399
just mean in the sense that like the

355
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:21,679
type of money and energy that gets

356
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,039
brought to bear

357
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:27,919
on other agricultural crops

358
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:30,879
in the infancy of hemp and cannabis

359
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:32,719
being looked at at all in that fashion

360
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:35,519
yeah yeah all the other crops have had

361
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,519
decades of research federal funding you

362
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,519
know lots of grants and money and

363
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,440
academic institutions supporting them

364
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,839
and you know cannabis doesn't really get

365
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,600
to benefit from much of that so

366
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,399
we have a lot of work to do a lot of

367
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,040
research to do and i think sadly too i

368
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,519
think the onset of legalization is

369
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:55,759
really what cr and even like maybe

370
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,440
medical in the 215 era is really what

371
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:59,838
created the problem

372
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,760
um and what i mean by that is that in

373
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,320
the original era that i was in like i

374
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:06,240
said you either made your own clones or

375
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,160
started your own seeds or got them from

376
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,680
a close associate and it was very small

377
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:11,838
circles

378
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:13,599
once you started being able in the 215

379
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,360
era in the medical era with a medical

380
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,920
card to go into dispensaries or go to

381
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,399
nurseries and buy your clones

382
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:21,838
right and now especially in the legal

383
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,159
market like in

384
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,480
california but in other places too where

385
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:28,480
they've mandated that you sort of have

386
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,159
to get you have to have a nursery

387
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,600
license to even provide plant matter to

388
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:36,719
most farms

389
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,320
they sort of centralized that aspect

390
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,079
which meant that when some of these

391
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,160
diseases got into some of those

392
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:44,799
centralized nurseries

393
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:46,639
it went everywhere like really quickly

394
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:48,240
right and so

395
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,919
um and then you know one of the things

396
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,399
we don't know

397
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:54,479
is for instance like how long can it

398
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,799
persist on surfaces how long can it

399
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,159
persist in soil you know all these

400
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:00,000
different types of things because what's

401
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:01,600
happening to people is that they're

402
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,679
getting they're getting clones from a

403
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,519
nursery and they're to me to my

404
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,638
knowledge there is no regulation or

405
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,879
penalties

406
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:12,879
for a nursery selling you

407
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:14,559
diseased or infected products yeah right

408
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:16,879
yeah i mean that's another thing the

409
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:18,239
canada's industry you know i suffers

410
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:20,159
from is that a lot of these other

411
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,000
industries these these pathogens are

412
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,159
highly regulated and they're you know

413
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,559
there's government mandates of what to

414
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:29,360
be tested and how to be tested and how

415
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:31,838
to decide if the testing lab is is good

416
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,759
enough or has done enough validation but

417
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,160
um yeah there's no requirements right

418
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:38,559
now in cannabis which which means that

419
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:40,399
you know lots of stuff is going on that

420
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:41,599
lots of stuff's going on and that i

421
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,600
think i don't think

422
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,639
with regulation they intended for that

423
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,278
to happen

424
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,519
but it was simply like an outgrowth of

425
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:50,799
forcing everyone to go to a few

426
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,959
nurseries

427
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:54,479
and then this gets into a few nurseries

428
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:56,000
and they're cloning for everyone and

429
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,320
they're not changing their equipment

430
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,399
they're not taking precautions and so it

431
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,920
spreads from maybe one or two varietals

432
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,519
through their whole thing

433
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,799
and then everyone is getting infected

434
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,440
plants

435
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:09,599
yeah and um you know and so

436
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,759
um there's definitely been already legal

437
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,399
farms that have failed

438
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,159
uh because being infected and reduced

439
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,879
yield reduced quality

440
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:21,198
uh you know that type of thing so

441
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:22,879
um i guess maybe we should go on to like

442
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:24,240
maybe the first thing

443
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:26,000
that we should we should we could

444
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,399
discuss is like

445
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
um because there's a lot i was i was

446
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,679
thinking of but like

447
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,600
what's the best way like let's say that

448
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:36,239
you have a plant in your garden that has

449
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,320
it like a mom plant what's the best way

450
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,000
to keep it from spreading

451
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,240
because you might not know that you have

452
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,198
it so you might as well act like you do

453
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,519
right

454
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:47,599
exactly yeah i mean that one thing i was

455
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,919
going to say is that you know

456
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,519
kind of above or throughout all of the

457
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,519
recommendations to keep it from

458
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,879
spreading the most important people

459
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,078
thing that people can do is to

460
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:59,120
acknowledge

461
00:16:56,078 --> 00:17:01,198
that this is everywhere and nobody is

462
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,320
immune from it and

463
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:04,480
it's not

464
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,959
you know a them problem

465
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,640
you know it's it's it's a ubiquitous

466
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,558
issue and in order for it to be

467
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,839
addressed the first thing you have to do

468
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:13,119
um i guess

469
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:14,958
i don't want to sound like an addiction

470
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,879
counselor or whatever or but is to admit

471
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,720
that there's a problem yeah for real

472
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,559
yeah for real all of us need to be

473
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,318
taking precautions you know from home

474
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:24,078
grower all the way up to multi-state

475
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:25,759
operator mso

476
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:28,159
um to make sure that we're not spreading

477
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:30,960
it through the industry you know passing

478
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:35,279
it on to other people that kind of thing

479
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:38,798
um so um the most important precautions

480
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:40,960
to keep it from spreading would be um

481
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:42,558
sterilization so that's one of them

482
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,038
that's very critical

483
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:46,639
um so you need to be sterilizing your

484
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:48,960
tools and

485
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,038
um there's a lot of information out

486
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,160
there flying around about what works and

487
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:56,160
what doesn't and um i've even heard a

488
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,840
scientist contradicting each other which

489
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,600
i'm sure is super frustrating for

490
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:01,519
everybody out there i'll hear one thing

491
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:02,558
in one podcast and then another thing in

492
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:05,200
another

493
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:06,879
um so i actually went through all of the

494
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,960
literature and

495
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,120
consolidated into one document which you

496
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,840
guys can find on our website if you want

497
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:14,558
to

498
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:15,439
um and they basically tried 53 different

499
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:18,240
things

500
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,558
um in the literature uh with scientific

501
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,400
experiments and there were only five of

502
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:24,079
the chemicals or treatments that worked

503
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,240
and there was only one where they were

504
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:29,119
able to show worked on multiple viruses

505
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:32,480
or viroids in multiple crop species and

506
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:34,959
that was bleach uh 10 to 20 bleach 60

507
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,599
seconds um i know i sail it all the time

508
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,160
so here i'm saying it again use bleach

509
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:43,599
um so you want to sterilize your tools

510
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,919
as you move from plant to plant

511
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:47,918
you can have a couple pairs of you know

512
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,360
scissors or razor blades or whatever all

513
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,200
sitting in the bleach and just pull a

514
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:53,279
clean one out do your cuts put it back

515
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,880
in the bleach and grab a different one

516
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:58,798
for the next plant

517
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:00,400
if you get sap or whatever on your hands

518
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:02,319
you are going to be want to be wearing

519
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,160
gloves and you can get put some bleach

520
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:05,918
into spray bottles play your hands and

521
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,000
rub it around just like you put on hand

522
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:11,360
sanitizer or something like that and you

523
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,240
said 60 seconds 60 seconds for the tools

524
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,079
yes

525
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,679
and does that include your hands like if

526
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:17,038
you had gloves on and you're rubbing it

527
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,038
does that mean like

528
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:20,879
similar to covet if you if you wash your

529
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:23,119
hands that long

530
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,840
it's going to kill it

531
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:27,759
so so basically if you spray it on your

532
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:29,359
gloves and rub it around and just leave

533
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:31,599
it there it's going to end up sitting

534
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:33,119
there for 60 seconds anyway so you don't

535
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,439
have to rinse it off your hands you can

536
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:37,119
just let it dry on there and that's

537
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,558
exactly how we do it in the lab to be

538
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:41,359
honest too because you know

539
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:44,639
contamination there is also an issue so

540
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:47,359
um you know if you get plant matter on a

541
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,960
table or whatever just sterilize it

542
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:51,199
clean it up really quick quick you can

543
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,440
use some bleach there too

544
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,880
don't let debris and whatnot sit around

545
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,798
on the floor or on the tables um

546
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,720
so make sure to be sterilizing all those

547
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:02,240
surfaces let me let me throw in let me

548
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,558
throw in another question that might be

549
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,720
slightly technical or whatever but does

550
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:09,200
it matter what kind of bleach

551
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,519
because i have i have heard that for

552
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,960
instance say that like sodium like

553
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:15,599
normal household bleach for your

554
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,440
clothing or whatever sodium you know is

555
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:18,879
um is a little bit more unstable and if

556
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,600
it gets a little bit dirty it can get

557
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,000
inert fairly fast i've heard that like

558
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:27,519
pool bleach is stronger and more

559
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,599
effective and it's more stable right so

560
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,960
um there's different types of bleach i

561
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:32,879
guess you could go to the store and you

562
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,919
could get you know splashless bleach

563
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,440
versus cheap bleach versus pool bleach

564
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,440
you know some of them are calcium

565
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,360
chloride some of them are so i just

566
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,759
wondered if if there was a difference

567
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:46,798
there or you had a preference like in

568
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:49,279
your lab what would you use

569
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:50,960
yeah so in our lab we use good old

570
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:54,158
sodium hypochlorite which is your

571
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,240
regular household bleach

572
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,240
the critical point here is not the kind

573
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,279
of bleach or the splashless or whatever

574
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:04,720
it's um the the concentration of the

575
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:07,839
active ingredient so um you want to make

576
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,839
sure that the the final concentration of

577
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:13,439
the bleach the active ingredient is

578
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:15,678
above point zero or point five percent

579
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,679
so that means if you're making a one to

580
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,000
ten or a ten percent solution the

581
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,960
household bleach needs to have at least

582
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,759
five percent of the active ingredient

583
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,440
um and most of them do in fact i think

584
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:29,038
the lowest one

585
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,759
that i know of is

586
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:34,319
two 5.25 percent so if you're in a one

587
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:36,000
to ten solution or a one to nine which

588
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:38,319
would make a ten percent solution should

589
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,839
be the right concentration

590
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:42,639
because i see a lot of people out there

591
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:44,079
going and using pool bleach or different

592
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,240
forms of bleach because they thought

593
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:48,319
that the household bleach was inferior

594
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,200
and wasn't as strong or didn't work as

595
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:53,038
well and it was risky to only use that

596
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,000
and so i just thought like some clear

597
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:58,240
direction on um it seems like it seems

598
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,400
like you know cheap available household

599
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,200
bleach will be fine

600
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,640
yes and almost all of the studies um in

601
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,919
fact i think all of the studies have

602
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,919
used sodium hypochlorite so

603
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,400
um you do want to make it up fresh every

604
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,640
day because you are correct it does lose

605
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,038
um effectiveness especially if it sits

606
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,360
at a dilute solution if it gets really

607
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:20,798
saturated with plant material it'll also

608
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:22,558
start to lose effectiveness so you're

609
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:24,480
just going to want to you know dump it

610
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:26,240
out of whatever your little jar is and

611
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,599
fill it up with some more 10 percent

612
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,319
bleach

613
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:32,399
you can also make it up at that 20

614
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:34,399
concentration which would be four parts

615
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,880
water one part bleach

616
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,240
um and then it'll last a little bit

617
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,679
longer

618
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,640
just to make people feel more

619
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:44,798
comfortable they actually did do a study

620
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,960
where they asked how long it was

621
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:49,119
effective for and they made a dilute

622
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,720
solution of 20 bleach and it was still

623
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:54,399
inhibiting transmission up to 30 days

624
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,640
this was not saturated with plant

625
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,720
material it was just kind of hanging

626
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,280
around now so you could make a spray

627
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,200
bottle for instance of 20

628
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:05,200
and and it would be and it would be

629
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,880
staying you know contained it wouldn't

630
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,960
be getting contaminated by plant

631
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,960
material and you could use that to spray

632
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,400
your gloves or whatever for quite some

633
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,798
time is what you're saying

634
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,440
yeah now i i would definitely recommend

635
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:18,960
making it up fresh but if you know there

636
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,400
was a miscommunication or you weren't

637
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,519
sure when it was made there is some

638
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:26,240
flexibility there leech is cheap

639
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:28,400
leech is cheap and it's very effective

640
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,240
because i remember i first saw that

641
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,480
interview with you where i was at i was

642
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,839
we were i was at a good friend's nursery

643
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,798
and like i said they were all heat

644
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:38,319
sterilizing their tools yeah and then i

645
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:40,639
just watched you and you were like oh

646
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:42,079
that doesn't work and i was like oh no

647
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,400
because they're out there trying to do

648
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:45,759
best practices and do what they can to

649
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,640
make sure it doesn't work and then all

650
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:48,400
of a sudden they're doing something

651
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,320
that's ineffective

652
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:53,360
yeah yeah so that that was actually

653
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:55,839
tried in the literature six seconds in a

654
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:58,240
propane blow torch um and it reached an

655
00:23:55,839 --> 00:24:00,639
average temperature of 430 degrees

656
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,000
fahrenheit um and it did not stop the

657
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,120
transmission

658
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,960
um so

659
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:07,038
i mean now this i should i should

660
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,960
qualify all of this

661
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:11,278
almost in fact none of these experiments

662
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,880
were done with hot latent thyroid all

663
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:14,720
the viroids have a very similar

664
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,559
structure and

665
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,038
metabolism in the cell

666
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:20,798
so um we're extrapolating information

667
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:22,480
from other viroids because a lot of

668
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:24,879
research has been done

669
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,558
in other plants that makes sense i was

670
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,640
there was one of my other questions is

671
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:30,639
how because there's not there's not a

672
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,200
lot of money yet coming into this type

673
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,520
of stuff like how much specific research

674
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,919
is even going into it

675
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:40,079
yes yeah and that's uh not much right

676
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,919
now um we're we are trying to bridge

677
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:44,720
that gap we actually started a

678
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,960
collaboration with texas a m um and we

679
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,038
are we're starting research

680
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,278
into some of the really basic questions

681
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:53,119
um seed transmission

682
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:55,519
you know levels around the plant that

683
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:58,319
kind of thing um so we're trying to

684
00:24:55,519 --> 00:25:00,960
encourage more academic uh cooperation

685
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:03,759
and and more research so

686
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,159
maybe we could ask a series of of

687
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:08,960
questions and you could say i know i

688
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,240
don't know or explain

689
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,278
so

690
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,880
obviously it seems like sterilizing

691
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:16,960
tools is very important so like if

692
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:20,000
you're taking cuttings that would be a

693
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,519
primary method of transmission right is

694
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,079
um what about

695
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:25,278
uh what about runoff from watering

696
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:27,918
plants

697
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:29,119
yes so um what i'm going to tell you is

698
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:31,360
what's been

699
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:32,079
demonstrated in the literature

700
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:33,278
so

701
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:36,079
um

702
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:38,240
for a viroid called potato spindle tuber

703
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:40,240
viroid which is in the same family as

704
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,679
hotplate and thyroid with a very similar

705
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,000
structure

706
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:46,320
they showed that the viroid isn't high

707
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,720
level in the roots and that's the same

708
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:51,278
in hops plants for hoplite and viroid

709
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:54,079
the viroid leaks from the roots into the

710
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:56,558
water and if they water tomato plants

711
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:58,000
with thyroid-containing water

712
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:00,798
those plants

713
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,679
became infected with the viroid they

714
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:05,679
also showed in that paper that the virus

715
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,880
remained infectious for up to seven

716
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,440
weeks

717
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,200
so in the water

718
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,440
so

719
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,038
that research wasn't done in cannabis it

720
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,120
wasn't done with hot plate and viroid

721
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:18,798
but i think there is enough demonstrated

722
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:22,158
evidence in the literature for it to be

723
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:23,038
a concern yeah okay but think about it

724
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,880
so

725
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:26,400
that i was going to ask how long can it

726
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,440
persist you're saying that it could

727
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,919
persist up to i mean like seven weeks is

728
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,798
a long time seven weeks is a long time

729
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,799
yes um on surfaces they've done these

730
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:39,440
experiments and they've tested it out to

731
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:42,960
24 hours and shown that it does survive

732
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:45,440
for 24 hours on most common surfaces um

733
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,880
unfortunately they didn't go beyond 24

734
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:51,200
hours so it could be longer but um it

735
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,360
can persist for that long

736
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,400
um what about

737
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:57,678
uh

738
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,519
for instance um insect vectors

739
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:02,400
things like thrips

740
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:04,319
mites root aphids you know i mean i know

741
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,400
obviously we can catch malaria from a

742
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:08,319
mosquito we can get lyme disease and

743
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:11,440
other stuff from ticks

744
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:13,759
how worried are you about um

745
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,880
bugs spreading it from one plant to

746
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:18,400
another

747
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:21,360
yes so i would not be at all surprised

748
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,679
if that was a method of transmission um

749
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:25,439
as far as i'm aware there was only one

750
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,679
study in the literature done with

751
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,840
hoplate and viroid on bug transmission

752
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,640
and it was done with aphids

753
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:35,278
and hops plants and they were unable to

754
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,720
show vector insect vector transmission

755
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:38,480
with aphids

756
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,000
now that does not mean that aphids

757
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,240
wouldn't spread it in cannabis it

758
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,480
doesn't mean that other types of insects

759
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,200
wouldn't spread it and a lot of viroids

760
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,200
are

761
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,080
spread by insects

762
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,600
the research just isn't there yet to

763
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:53,439
one way or the other as to whether or

764
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:56,158
not it can be spread by insects for

765
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,399
hotly thyroid and cannabis because to me

766
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,320
especially like as a um

767
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:01,439
you know as somebody who uses the sun

768
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:04,158
quite often

769
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,880
um i was i was talking about it with

770
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,960
some other farmers and you know we can

771
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,799
you can do all these best practices and

772
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,038
you can do all these things yourself and

773
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:15,359
be very self-contained and have your

774
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:16,960
mother room be perfect and then you know

775
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:18,479
some thrips blow over from the

776
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,880
neighbor's garden

777
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,679
and you're and you're in trouble

778
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,960
exactly yes and i mean i should say when

779
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,798
we're talking about hapleton thyroid

780
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,919
right now but there are viruses in

781
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:30,319
cannabis

782
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,799
um out that affect outdoor more and

783
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:35,918
those are spread by insects so

784
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:37,679
um like pearly top coming from leaf

785
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,360
hoppers and stuff like that

786
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,679
yeah so you definitely want to be

787
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:43,759
concerned about insects um because they

788
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:46,399
are a big vector for a lot of different

789
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:46,398
pathogens

790
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,278
um

791
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:50,398
the seed the seed one's probably going

792
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:51,759
to be the one that we're going to hear

793
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:53,359
the most and leading up to this

794
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:55,679
interview for

795
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:58,240
like since i announced it i have heard

796
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,440
so many answers on so many people so

797
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,278
confident

798
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,759
on the exact percentage of

799
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:05,839
transmissibility in cannabis seeds for

800
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:08,158
sure

801
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:10,720
and wildly different percentages that

802
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:13,919
they think are proven as well yes some

803
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:16,159
very low some quite much higher

804
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,600
um so it's you know we

805
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,919
what are your what is studies that

806
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:21,439
you're seeing uh show as far as seed

807
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,320
transmission

808
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,640
yes so there is one study in hops

809
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:28,480
showing that c transmission of hot plate

810
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,840
and thyroid in hot plants is eight

811
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,360
percent

812
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:33,918
um

813
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:36,879
we have started preliminary studies so

814
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:38,399
this is very preliminary and um we still

815
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,799
are working with texas a m because

816
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:42,398
they're they're growing out the plants

817
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:45,679
but um

818
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:46,959
what we are finding is that it's

819
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:50,159
variable

820
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:53,038
based on the cultivar based on how

821
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:55,840
infected the mom was and so

822
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:57,278
um my gut is that these people are

823
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:58,798
claiming wildly different numbers

824
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:01,200
because it's going to be wildly

825
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:03,440
different for each batch of seeds each

826
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,000
cultivar and you know obviously if your

827
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,759
plant is on fire with hop latent thyroid

828
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,759
that that percent transmission might be

829
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:12,158
higher than a low-level infection maybe

830
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:13,519
you see nothing or or zero percent

831
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,360
transmission so

832
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:17,519
pretty par for the course with cannabis

833
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:19,839
like anybody who tries any serious

834
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:21,038
scientific studies into cannabis sexual

835
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:22,480
expression

836
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:25,278
via ethylene

837
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,120
production or inhibit inhibition they

838
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:29,200
find that it's just so variable in every

839
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:30,158
single it's not down to strain it's down

840
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,840
to

841
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,320
not just the plant it's down to the

842
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:36,079
plant in that specific environment and

843
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:37,918
it's just there's so much variability to

844
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:39,439
even be taking steps at numbers like

845
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,600
that until there's like this

846
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,120
wide-ranging study that just hasn't been

847
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:45,439
allowed to be done yet

848
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:47,278
so seed transmission you would probably

849
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,200
it's fair to say is just

850
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:51,919
um it's

851
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,840
variable or requires a lot more study

852
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:56,000
before we know it's sort of an educated

853
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:58,558
guess at best at this point

854
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,798
yes i would say um there's probably

855
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:01,759
enough evidence to say seed transmission

856
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:04,558
happens

857
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:07,359
or can happen but there is not enough

858
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:10,158
studies out there and and high enough

859
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:11,278
numbers to come up with a percentage

860
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,520
um and that's going to take a lot of

861
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:15,440
research and certainly not in cannabis

862
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:17,679
specifically right like the studies work

863
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,200
done in hops so canvas is a completely

864
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,519
different beast even though they're very

865
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,319
similar in structure i was almost you

866
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:26,398
know uh i'm by no means a scientist but

867
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:28,558
when i was reading about the the viroids

868
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:30,879
trying to like prepare for talking about

869
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:32,319
tonight it almost made me think of like

870
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,320
some of these viroids have some

871
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:36,558
similarities with enzymes

872
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:38,240
and then like they're not actually alive

873
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:40,158
they're sort of like waiting for a

874
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,558
reaction to happen like to encounter

875
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,760
something that then triggers what they

876
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:45,119
can do

877
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:46,960
yeah

878
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:48,639
that's exactly so

879
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,720
they um

880
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:53,278
you know one of one of the aspects that

881
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,759
you know uh

882
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:57,119
so like it you know can if it persists

883
00:31:55,759 --> 00:32:00,558
then it can just be sitting there in a

884
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:02,079
seed or it can be it can be you know do

885
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:04,319
you think people can transmit it by

886
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:06,480
touching

887
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:06,480
so

888
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:12,079
potentially um the way that the virus so

889
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:15,519
the vibroid needs to gain access via a

890
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:17,199
break point so if for example you're

891
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,880
trimming your plants and you have goo on

892
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,558
your hands and then you touch another

893
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,799
plant and you even if there's a little

894
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:24,879
micro tear or you know just a little

895
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:26,798
breakage of a stem as you're touching

896
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,519
you can spread it like that

897
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:31,918
um but it there needs to be

898
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:34,558
like some sap exchange between a sick

899
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,559
plant and an a healthy plant that has a

900
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:39,038
little opening for this for the sick for

901
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:40,798
the infected sap to get in so for lack

902
00:32:39,038 --> 00:32:43,278
of a better way to look at it like

903
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:45,679
healthy skin would prevent you would

904
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:47,440
have to have a cut or abrasion or

905
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,759
something like that in order to give

906
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,600
them a vector for it to go in

907
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:53,679
correct yeah there has to be some type

908
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:56,079
of even miniature mechanical damage for

909
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:57,278
it to access the plant

910
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:59,599
okay

911
00:32:57,278 --> 00:32:59,599
um

912
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,000
one of so i guess

913
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:06,319
do you know anything about because this

914
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
is the other part of it that is really

915
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:09,678
harmful is obviously like cannabis is

916
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,480
under a lot of financial pressure right

917
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:13,120
now

918
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:15,038
legalization has not been smooth

919
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:17,518
there's a lot of odd regulations going

920
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:19,278
on and people are really feeling it um

921
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:22,240
and you know one of the biggest aspects

922
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:23,759
of hop latent um is the expense of

923
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,880
trying to figure out how to deal with it

924
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:29,278
once you have it right yes um

925
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,120
and you know there's there's also you

926
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:32,480
know one one of the one of the groups

927
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:35,038
that spread it a bunch one of the

928
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,558
nurseries then later came out with a

929
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:39,440
cure

930
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:42,480
right um of you know oh i've seen a lot

931
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,080
of stuff about tissue culture meristem

932
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,440
heat treatments

933
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:49,678
various um to be honest very expensive

934
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,000
and time-consuming treatments

935
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,519
um that you know p some people have been

936
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,440
jumping on because they have a favorite

937
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,798
cultivar they have a favorite strain

938
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,960
they don't know where they can get it

939
00:33:56,798 --> 00:34:01,278
again and it's infected

940
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:02,960
and so there's a big push to like i want

941
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:05,278
to save this thing

942
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,399
rather than just throw it away and and

943
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:07,839
give up

944
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:09,519
right

945
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:11,279
but i see a lot of conflicting

946
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:13,280
information on whether or not this stuff

947
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,919
actually works

948
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:19,440
yes yeah so um

949
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:21,838
tissue culture can work it is not

950
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,200
a hundred percent effective it's not

951
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:25,440
going to work

952
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:26,319
the same on every cultivar so here we go

953
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,039
again

954
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,480
and it's gonna depend on how infected

955
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:32,320
the plant is

956
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,039
um when people are doing this heat

957
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:37,760
treatment thing so it was shown in hops

958
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:38,800
that if you subject the plant to high

959
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,200
heat

960
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,119
like 35 degrees celsius i think is the

961
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:45,838
temperature they use

962
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:48,159
the level of the viroid will decrease it

963
00:34:45,838 --> 00:34:50,320
doesn't go away completely but it goes

964
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:53,280
down enough that when they dissect the

965
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,838
apical meristem

966
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:58,480
they have a higher chance of not getting

967
00:34:55,838 --> 00:35:00,078
any infected material along with the

968
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,440
apical meristem

969
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,560
um

970
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,119
it so

971
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:07,679
you can clean it with tissue culture it

972
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:10,240
is a lengthy process and it takes a long

973
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:12,078
time and and not everyone works so if

974
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:14,319
you if they i mean what they do is they

975
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:16,000
clean it then they you know they they

976
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,760
grow a bunch up and they have to test

977
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,239
each of them get rid of the ones where

978
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,000
it didn't work and just keep on testing

979
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:24,239
and that they usually are testing for a

980
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,800
really long time before they can be sure

981
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:28,799
that they've cleaned it completely

982
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,680
and that's because the the apical

983
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,599
meristems not in the vascular system is

984
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:35,358
that why the virus isn't just there and

985
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,119
that's what they try to keep it like

986
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:39,920
that little bit from any kind of

987
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:42,400
contamination on the sides and

988
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,280
okay yes yeah so it is excluded from

989
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:48,160
that region that the the

990
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,480
like the stem cells in there but you do

991
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:51,838
it you have to be super careful and know

992
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,280
exactly what you're doing to get rid of

993
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:54,799
all that vascular tissue because that

994
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,800
tissue does have uh hopefully

995
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,880
environment in it so

996
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,079
i'll uh maybe that leads to another

997
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,720
question then

998
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:05,200
um because i've seen people who

999
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:06,078
have had inconclusive testing

1000
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:07,519
um

1001
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,280
you know when it comes to testing for

1002
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:10,880
hot blatant which is obviously extremely

1003
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,480
frustrating because

1004
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,920
you want to get a negative test then you

1005
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,800
want to be like okay i'm in the clear

1006
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,039
right my plan is clean um but what what

1007
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,039
it seems like is that almost like with

1008
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:23,279
covet or something else if you're

1009
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:25,358
heavily infected it's almost always a

1010
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,880
yes that it'll pick it up

1011
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:29,279
but maybe if you're only lightly

1012
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:32,000
infected it could come back negative

1013
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,920
right and you might so how many

1014
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,760
what maybe walk us through like if

1015
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,280
somebody was worried that their plant

1016
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,720
wasn't performing the right way or

1017
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:42,800
looked a little sickly um how many tests

1018
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:45,439
how far apart what protocol should they

1019
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,599
have to like ascertain whether or not

1020
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,358
they're infected or not

1021
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:52,240
yes okay so um so first to understand

1022
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:53,119
why

1023
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:55,118
you

1024
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:56,720
there's such a frustration with you know

1025
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,320
getting a negative test in the positive

1026
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:59,759
test or part of the plant's positive and

1027
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,240
part of its negative

1028
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,920
um is understanding how viroids actually

1029
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:07,759
move through the plant

1030
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:09,200
so when a plant gets infected the viroid

1031
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,599
moves through the tissue until it

1032
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:13,759
reaches the vascular system once it's in

1033
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:16,480
the vascular system it basically has to

1034
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:19,280
hitch a ride on the movement of the sap

1035
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:21,519
of the plant so where it's going to go

1036
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:24,320
is dependent on where the sap from that

1037
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:26,400
branch is currently traveling

1038
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:29,440
so viroids are going to move for what

1039
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,280
they call a source to sink type movement

1040
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,119
so they're going to move towards areas

1041
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,680
of the plant that are experiencing

1042
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:38,240
active growth at the time the plant was

1043
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:39,598
infected so you can imagine if it's a

1044
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:41,838
middle branch

1045
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,838
and it travels to the vascular system

1046
00:37:41,838 --> 00:37:46,400
it's going to move up towards the new

1047
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:49,440
growth but those lower branches are less

1048
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,280
likely to receive fibroid so

1049
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,480
not every part of the plant is going to

1050
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:57,119
get the same load at the same time

1051
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,119
um so the reason that they say oh submit

1052
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,480
multiple samples is we don't you don't

1053
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:03,358
since you don't know when the plant was

1054
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:05,599
inoculated and what the source to sink

1055
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:07,119
you know flow was at the time

1056
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,440
you have to grab a bunch of different

1057
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,680
spots of the plant um

1058
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,519
to feel confident that you've cased

1059
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:15,039
enough areas that the statistical

1060
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:16,880
probability of catching it is high

1061
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:19,358
enough

1062
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:22,320
i will say we did run a little study

1063
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:25,358
it's not quite ready for uh publication

1064
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:27,599
yet or putting on our website um but

1065
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:29,598
capricorn nursery was gracious enough to

1066
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:31,680
take in a couple positive four positive

1067
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,599
plants actually and they took samples

1068
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:37,358
for us all over the plant you know new

1069
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:39,440
growth old growth stems roots everything

1070
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:42,000
and the part of the plant that was the

1071
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,358
most predictive of infection was the

1072
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,519
roots

1073
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:47,679
we got a hundred percent success rate

1074
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:48,639
when we tested the roots

1075
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:50,078
um

1076
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:51,838
and if you think about it this makes a

1077
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:54,160
lot of sense because the roots are

1078
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:56,000
always growing and you're always going

1079
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:57,920
to have nutrients from the foliage

1080
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,800
moving into the roots

1081
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:03,358
um so it i would say if you were going

1082
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:06,880
to pick a part of the plant to pick

1083
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:08,880
some root tissue as well as um some

1084
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,519
petiole tissue around the plant just

1085
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,599
because this was a preliminary study it

1086
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:15,599
was for plants and i don't want to base

1087
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,920
someone's diagnostic on

1088
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:20,000
you know a small study like that but i

1089
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,519
think it's suggestive enough to also be

1090
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,079
submitting root tissue

1091
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:26,400
one of the one of the ways um we had a

1092
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:29,119
good friend of ours who experienced at

1093
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:32,639
the time what we call dudding uh which

1094
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:35,119
you know uh i'm a collector of of old

1095
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:38,639
and rare and unpopular things and so for

1096
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:40,640
people like us uh it's really scary

1097
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:42,000
you know because in cannabis there's not

1098
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:44,799
very many people that are willing to

1099
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,480
hold on to a wide diversity of genetics

1100
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,960
especially if they're not currently

1101
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:51,119
profitable right

1102
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,639
and so to have something like this

1103
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:55,200
ripped through your collection of

1104
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:57,199
possibly old unpopular not backed up by

1105
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:58,559
very many people sometimes not backed up

1106
00:39:57,199 --> 00:40:00,159
by anyone

1107
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:02,960
is pretty scary and one of the things

1108
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:05,118
that he learned or he guessed was that

1109
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,519
it was his runoff

1110
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:09,680
on sharing on trays and things like that

1111
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:11,679
was that it was infecting things and so

1112
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:14,559
he instituted a program where like every

1113
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:16,159
single mom was elevated

1114
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:18,480
and drained away

1115
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:20,078
so that no runoff would ever touch

1116
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,519
another plant

1117
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:23,920
yeah right

1118
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:25,679
and i i think that's that's a good idea

1119
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,599
and it's not just for hotplate and

1120
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:29,679
viroid there's a lot of root fungal

1121
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,359
pathogens that spread through the water

1122
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:33,679
and um

1123
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:35,279
shared water if you're trying to prevent

1124
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:37,598
pathogens um

1125
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,359
is not recommended because it's it's an

1126
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:42,240
excellent way for a bunch of pathogens

1127
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:44,880
to move around i i can tell you that um

1128
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:47,598
before we ever heard the term hop latent

1129
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:50,559
uh a lot of us were considering dutting

1130
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:53,359
to be an aggressive form of fusarium

1131
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:54,799
yeah you know uh and and we were you

1132
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:56,480
know there was a lot of there was a lot

1133
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:59,119
of like you know

1134
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,719
uh our research going into like well how

1135
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,920
do you cure that how do you get rid of

1136
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:03,279
that because

1137
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,318
we couldn't do the testing we didn't

1138
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,960
know what it was we were just

1139
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:08,480
observationally seeing what was going on

1140
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,440
um and

1141
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,159
uh

1142
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,079
so

1143
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:14,078
basically i guess what you're saying is

1144
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,519
you think is it fair to say that you

1145
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:17,920
think that the vast majority of

1146
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:21,519
transmission is happening via runoff and

1147
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,440
via cloning with contaminated tools

1148
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:25,519
so i would say

1149
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:29,119
the vast majority is happening via

1150
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:31,358
mechanical transmission with tools um i

1151
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,760
suspect that there is a percentage of

1152
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:35,759
transmission going along with water

1153
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,079
transmission although

1154
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,400
i don't have published evidence to show

1155
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,519
that right um sure we did we did take

1156
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,680
some

1157
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:45,599
tubing from a water admitter from a

1158
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:48,399
facility that had an outbreak and we

1159
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:50,960
just used the tube itself in the pcr and

1160
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,240
we were able to amplify hotplate viroid

1161
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,199
from the tube

1162
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:54,959
so

1163
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:56,960
it was in there and it was stuck to the

1164
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,199
rubber on the inside of the tube whether

1165
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,159
or not it was sufficient to infect a

1166
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:03,679
plant

1167
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:05,920
you know i don't know but it lived there

1168
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:08,239
it was it was there yeah and i i want to

1169
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:11,599
make sure that i answer the question how

1170
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:13,919
many times to test your plant um yes

1171
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:16,800
certain that it's negative you need to

1172
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:19,920
test it at least at least twice

1173
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,519
um three to four weeks apart so that if

1174
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,920
it was missed because it was a very

1175
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:26,079
early infection you give that plant long

1176
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:28,159
enough to have enough of a systemic

1177
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:30,240
infection and a high enough load that

1178
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:31,358
you can you can catch it the second time

1179
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:32,639
around

1180
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:35,279
um and

1181
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:36,879
honestly i would i think people if you

1182
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,920
know they're you're really trying to be

1183
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,599
careful

1184
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,000
um i would test your mother plants

1185
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:45,039
periodically you know on a continual

1186
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:48,000
basis on a routine basis not everyone

1187
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:49,759
has the ability to do this yeah um and

1188
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,960
it's difficult but we

1189
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:55,760
in in recent years uh with the influx of

1190
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,519
just a bunch of horrific things um

1191
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:00,480
that started getting spread around not

1192
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:03,920
just hop latent but rude aphids

1193
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:06,159
um you know we call them super mites

1194
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,800
which are basically two spotted mites

1195
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:11,759
that have been trained for decades to

1196
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:14,560
grow resistant to many pesticides

1197
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,480
every every pesticide yeah well you know

1198
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:18,880
over over just like any other thing

1199
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,719
overuse of certain kind like you know

1200
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,880
like overuse of antibiotics or whatever

1201
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:23,759
and all of a sudden you have so you know

1202
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,358
there's

1203
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,960
um

1204
00:43:25,358 --> 00:43:28,318
basically i guess what i'm saying with

1205
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,920
that is that

1206
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:31,759
you know you would recommend let's say

1207
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,519
that you bring in something new or old

1208
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,160
that you're excited about and you

1209
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:38,159
quarantine it you would recommend at

1210
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:40,799
least two tests

1211
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:42,960
four weeks apart and get both of those

1212
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:45,119
negative before you would feel confident

1213
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,519
to even want to move that plant into

1214
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:49,599
your larger safer mother room of

1215
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:52,639
hopefully clean genetics

1216
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:55,760
yes absolutely i think strict quarantine

1217
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:58,078
for anything new two tests

1218
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,319
for economically critical pathogens and

1219
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,599
i would probably add fusarium oxy sporum

1220
00:44:00,318 --> 00:44:03,279
to that list

1221
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:05,599
because you don't want that floating

1222
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,200
around your grow either

1223
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:09,359
separate tools you don't want to be

1224
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:11,358
using the same tools and

1225
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:13,920
if you're thinking about the workflow in

1226
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:15,679
your facility obviously don't start in

1227
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,680
the quarantine room

1228
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:19,679
and then move to your mom room

1229
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:21,838
sure

1230
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:23,679
so this is um yeah and this is exactly

1231
00:44:21,838 --> 00:44:25,440
what the us government does right when

1232
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:27,279
when plants come in they go in strict

1233
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,280
quarantine and they're tested and

1234
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,400
observed before they're allowed into the

1235
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,839
country

1236
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,519
so um

1237
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:36,000
this is about protecting your borders

1238
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:37,519
another another aspect of that that i i

1239
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,599
find interesting and i'd love some

1240
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:40,719
clarification on is that

1241
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:42,559
um

1242
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:44,639
you know when people are doing clones

1243
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:46,960
right and obviously especially like in

1244
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:49,199
commercial instances where you're taking

1245
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,720
hundreds or even thousands of clones on

1246
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:51,519
a work shift

1247
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:53,679
right

1248
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:55,119
you can do stuff like you can do what we

1249
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:57,039
talked about earlier where you could

1250
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:59,519
have bleach and you could have rotating

1251
00:44:57,039 --> 00:45:01,679
tools and you can clean all that and you

1252
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:03,920
can have you know fresh starting

1253
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:05,199
material whether it's rockwool or plugs

1254
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,159
or whatever

1255
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:07,679
but

1256
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:10,719
one of the things that i know about

1257
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:12,318
cannabis that everyone does is

1258
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:14,719
most of the time

1259
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:17,119
every single stem goes in that rooting

1260
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:19,118
gel or goes in that dip and grow or goes

1261
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:22,160
in that hormone right

1262
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:24,720
and trying to figure out how to isolate

1263
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:27,358
hormone or rooting gel or whatever for

1264
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:28,799
each specific plant themselves and not

1265
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:33,039
mixing that

1266
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:34,400
that is a bottleneck and so um you know

1267
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:36,800
it's expensive

1268
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:39,119
yeah how how risky is it to d let's say

1269
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:41,519
you dip a clone into dip and grow for

1270
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:44,400
three or four seconds

1271
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:46,480
how much and but it's a fresh wound

1272
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:49,039
right yeah you just cut

1273
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,800
how much risk is that and how and what

1274
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:51,920
what practices could people even

1275
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,240
institute

1276
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:56,559
um in order to not make that a vector

1277
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:58,159
for transmission

1278
00:45:56,559 --> 00:46:00,639
yeah so

1279
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:03,039
unfortunately if you cut a clone you

1280
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:05,920
know and and you have this huge open

1281
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:07,599
wound it's and it's it's infected it's

1282
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:10,159
going to be seeping

1283
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:12,559
hot plate and thyroid into that solution

1284
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:14,399
and um if you get a clone that's

1285
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:16,559
infected and you dip another one in that

1286
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,720
solution you're you've basically created

1287
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:20,880
an inoculum and you're using it to

1288
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:22,959
inoculate every clone after that that's

1289
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,200
dipped into that solution

1290
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,079
um that's definitely

1291
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:27,838
yeah

1292
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:30,240
i mean just to be honest you know i get

1293
00:46:27,838 --> 00:46:33,199
it's the reality of it but it just

1294
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:35,199
it just leads to a whole series of it's

1295
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:37,199
basically like you want to have a

1296
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:41,358
different vessel

1297
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:43,199
for um for cloning material uh for every

1298
00:46:41,358 --> 00:46:45,199
single plant

1299
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:46,799
yeah yeah and i mean i don't know if you

1300
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:48,399
know maybe you can put it in an egg

1301
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,240
carton you know so you just have a

1302
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,160
little bit in each each spot or

1303
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:54,318
something something i mean

1304
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:57,279
i i hate to break in but like it even

1305
00:46:54,318 --> 00:46:58,719
goes down to like even different parts

1306
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,200
of the goddamn plant if it's a big

1307
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:03,598
enough plant because some of that might

1308
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:05,838
have more viral load than the bottom

1309
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:08,000
half and you may actually

1310
00:47:05,838 --> 00:47:09,838
increase your chance of

1311
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,599
inoculating it when you might otherwise

1312
00:47:09,838 --> 00:47:13,920
not have and got grabbed a clean branch

1313
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:16,000
somewhere left i mean i was almost

1314
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,920
thinking of like uh i mean you could

1315
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,440
have permanent you could have like you

1316
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:22,800
know 20 different glass shot glasses

1317
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,559
that you have a little bit of different

1318
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,240
grow or a little bit of your hormone or

1319
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:27,920
whatever in each one and then as soon as

1320
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:29,439
you're done with it you dump the excess

1321
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,480
out into something and you drop it into

1322
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:32,000
bleach

1323
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,159
and you move on to the next one and then

1324
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,079
by the time but something like that

1325
00:47:34,159 --> 00:47:37,920
would have to be because

1326
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:39,440
you could sterilize it and just wait a

1327
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,519
minute or two

1328
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:44,240
right and it would be clean

1329
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:47,039
yes so if you had say 10 shot glasses

1330
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:48,078
you could go from plant to plant and not

1331
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:50,159
spread it

1332
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:52,480
because i will tell you

1333
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:54,879
that 99 of people out there

1334
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,838
um that are taking precautions are still

1335
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,318
using

1336
00:47:55,838 --> 00:47:59,519
a centralized dipping solution of some

1337
00:47:58,318 --> 00:48:01,199
kind

1338
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:03,039
that's just the industry standard that's

1339
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:05,039
just how it how it works

1340
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:06,639
yeah that would that's definitely if you

1341
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:08,960
are concerned at all that any of your

1342
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:10,879
plants have hot thyroid then you you're

1343
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,119
not going to want to be sharing anything

1344
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:15,760
that has touched sap and then dip

1345
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:16,960
another plant in it with a gaping wound

1346
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,440
um because

1347
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:23,119
you're just going to spread it

1348
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:25,440
that makes that makes excellent sense so

1349
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:26,318
i have a question um

1350
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,920
so

1351
00:48:26,318 --> 00:48:30,079
you see a lot of plants probably that

1352
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:32,240
come in that are negative

1353
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:35,039
for obsolete and vibrate but people

1354
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:37,439
suspect them of being dutted now

1355
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:39,119
when you see this negative thing pop up

1356
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,119
for the hops layton what

1357
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:44,079
i mean do you test it for what else it

1358
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:46,720
could be and at that point what is the

1359
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:48,640
next most common form of things that

1360
00:48:46,719 --> 00:48:50,239
people are calling duded

1361
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:51,920
that you're seeing

1362
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:54,479
yeah so

1363
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,240
beyond hoplaton viroid

1364
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,400
the

1365
00:48:56,239 --> 00:49:00,479
percentage of plants that have other

1366
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,639
viruses you know at least that we know

1367
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:04,639
of is pretty low it's usually hot plate

1368
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:05,920
and vibrate if they're seeing viral like

1369
00:49:04,639 --> 00:49:08,799
symptoms

1370
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:12,000
um other things can cause stunted growth

1371
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:13,760
like fusarium pythium right because

1372
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,079
these things are chewing on the roots

1373
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:18,480
and so you're going to see slow growth

1374
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:20,079
or it'll look like a nutrient deficiency

1375
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,079
kind of yeah

1376
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:24,720
so we're definitely seeing those

1377
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:27,440
pathogens also and

1378
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:29,759
just a little sidebar

1379
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:31,358
we're also seeing that

1380
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,200
those pathogens can come in through

1381
00:49:31,358 --> 00:49:35,119
people's water sources

1382
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:36,239
especially if you're not chained like

1383
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:38,079
you know following all the

1384
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:41,519
recommendations for how your water is

1385
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:44,240
filtered yeah um so i would highly

1386
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:46,880
recommend that people test their water

1387
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:48,399
systems periodically um just to make

1388
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,000
sure that they don't have anything

1389
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,000
growing in there and they're you know

1390
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,760
watering their plants with like pythium

1391
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,559
water

1392
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:58,319
so yeah that is i mean that's something

1393
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:01,440
i haven't done this in a long time but

1394
00:49:58,318 --> 00:50:02,639
20 years ago i was a mostly hydroponic

1395
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,159
person

1396
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:06,318
and when you're growing with water

1397
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:08,799
culture and like nutrient film technique

1398
00:50:06,318 --> 00:50:11,039
and stuff you learn about pythium

1399
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:13,280
you learn about water temperature how it

1400
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:16,960
can grow how it can replicate

1401
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:19,760
um so if let's say you had a 50 gallon

1402
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:21,519
drum for the sake of argument right and

1403
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,880
you were worried about your water what

1404
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:23,920
would be what would be the way that you

1405
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,160
would think would be the best way to

1406
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:28,480
sterilize it and then how long would you

1407
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:30,399
have to wait before you could use it

1408
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:33,280
could you add a certain amount of bleach

1409
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:36,960
stir it for 10 minutes an hour two hours

1410
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:38,559
and then go or do you have data on that

1411
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:41,119
so

1412
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:43,359
i'm not gonna say for sure because i'm

1413
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:45,680
not exactly sure at what concentration

1414
00:50:43,358 --> 00:50:47,279
i'm comfortable with that what time i

1415
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:49,199
don't i don't wanna

1416
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,359
no i get it there's i figured there was

1417
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:52,960
gonna be you have you have certainty you

1418
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:54,880
have uncertainty and you have i don't

1419
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,240
know which is

1420
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,559
that's where we're at

1421
00:50:56,239 --> 00:51:00,959
yeah i i'm not sure how

1422
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:03,519
how effective it could be to actually

1423
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:06,159
sterilize the water that's in that tank

1424
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:08,800
um i can say if you want to test it you

1425
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:10,719
should take the stuff from the bottom

1426
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,480
the the stuff where all the material

1427
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:13,838
might settle and grab whatever that

1428
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,838
sludge is

1429
00:51:13,838 --> 00:51:17,838
um and we can usually find it if it's

1430
00:51:15,838 --> 00:51:20,480
there because we for the water testing

1431
00:51:17,838 --> 00:51:22,558
we grow it out on plates um so it's not

1432
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,880
like a 24-hour thing like testing for

1433
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:26,240
the viroid but um then we can grow it up

1434
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:28,880
and look at all the fuzzy stuff that

1435
00:51:26,239 --> 00:51:30,239
grows and do a pcr test on each colony

1436
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,599
to see if you got something going in

1437
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:33,039
there um

1438
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:34,720
so another thing

1439
00:51:33,039 --> 00:51:36,239
that uh

1440
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:38,000
maybe would be really important for

1441
00:51:36,239 --> 00:51:39,118
people is that obviously there's some

1442
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,039
growers

1443
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:43,200
that start with fresh

1444
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:45,599
material every time they grow whether

1445
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:47,598
that's rock wool or coconut fiber or you

1446
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:49,359
know peat moss perlite whatever but then

1447
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:52,079
there's also a growing movement of

1448
00:51:49,358 --> 00:51:54,880
people uh certainly outdoor

1449
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:58,079
but also moving more indoor you know all

1450
00:51:54,880 --> 00:52:00,318
kinds of living soil or multi-cycle

1451
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:04,000
grows that type of thing

1452
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:06,000
and so um you know we did a uh i had a

1453
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,519
commercial thing we were working on and

1454
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,199
we got some plants that did absolutely

1455
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:11,759
horrible from a nursery

1456
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:15,039
uh and we tested the soil

1457
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:17,520
um about three months after harvest

1458
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:18,558
and it came up positive

1459
00:52:17,519 --> 00:52:19,679
yeah so

1460
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:22,079
perhaps

1461
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:23,519
yeah so i'm curious if you could tell

1462
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:24,400
because there's a lot of people right

1463
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:25,759
now

1464
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:28,318
that want to move to more like

1465
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:31,119
regenerative practices that want to be

1466
00:52:28,318 --> 00:52:33,199
reusing their medium um either from an

1467
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:35,760
expense per you know perspective or

1468
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:37,919
maybe like uh you know what just

1469
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,920
whatever it might be right and there's a

1470
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:43,119
lot that are trying to reuse their soil

1471
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:44,800
reuse their mix do multiple cycles in it

1472
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:46,559
um so

1473
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:48,160
you know basically what it what's really

1474
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:49,760
scary for people like them is that if

1475
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:51,279
they get infected

1476
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,359
it's a lot more expensive for them to

1477
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:55,040
just throw it out and start over than it

1478
00:52:53,358 --> 00:52:57,759
is for someone that just buys six inch

1479
00:52:55,039 --> 00:53:00,400
rockwell every crime every time right

1480
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:02,880
yeah yeah so what do you recommend i

1481
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:04,720
mean obviously sterilizing soil is its

1482
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,559
whole thing do you have any data or

1483
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:07,838
anything like that on how long it can

1484
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:10,559
persist

1485
00:53:07,838 --> 00:53:14,000
in soil if you plant inflict infected

1486
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:15,280
plants after you've killed them

1487
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,400
yeah so

1488
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,240
um

1489
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:21,039
once again these experiments have not

1490
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:24,879
been done in cannabis um in hops they

1491
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:27,759
can show that the viroid overwinters

1492
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:29,838
um but that's a perennial plant so it's

1493
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:32,400
not it's not a very good you know

1494
00:53:29,838 --> 00:53:34,318
comparison because it has living roots

1495
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:37,358
and stuff that it can stain

1496
00:53:34,318 --> 00:53:40,079
yeah um i will say uh it's

1497
00:53:37,358 --> 00:53:42,000
even in in cannabis from you know the

1498
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:44,559
limited studies that we've done it's in

1499
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:47,119
very high concentration in the roots

1500
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:49,359
so if you have an infected plant and

1501
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:52,240
there's still root material left in that

1502
00:53:49,358 --> 00:53:53,838
soil if you plant another plant in that

1503
00:53:52,239 --> 00:53:55,838
root material

1504
00:53:53,838 --> 00:53:58,799
i i think you're playing with fire as

1505
00:53:55,838 --> 00:53:59,920
far as getting infected plants

1506
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,559
um

1507
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:04,318
that's everyone that reuses their soil

1508
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:07,200
because they typically cut the plant

1509
00:54:04,318 --> 00:54:09,119
down and they're relying on biology and

1510
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:11,519
various things to break down the root

1511
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:13,599
mass in the system and return that

1512
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:16,318
energy or whatever to

1513
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:18,640
the soil food web so no one i mean it

1514
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:21,440
would be impossible even unless you like

1515
00:54:18,639 --> 00:54:24,400
micro screen to remove roots

1516
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:25,358
right right so i think you know you you

1517
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,720
if you

1518
00:54:25,358 --> 00:54:29,358
i mean i don't know what's cheaper

1519
00:54:26,719 --> 00:54:32,078
testing every plant or the you know the

1520
00:54:29,358 --> 00:54:34,799
some root decay left in the pot or just

1521
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:37,519
starting with new soil but um i would

1522
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:39,760
definitely not be reusing soil from a

1523
00:54:37,519 --> 00:54:41,280
plant that had hot plate and thyroid so

1524
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,839
basically what you're saying is anyone

1525
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:45,599
that uses the same soil year after year

1526
00:54:43,838 --> 00:54:48,000
in an outdoor situation or in a

1527
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:50,800
greenhouse or anyone that is in some

1528
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,239
sort of living soil organic regenerative

1529
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,519
thing where they're doing multiple

1530
00:54:52,239 --> 00:54:55,759
cycles

1531
00:54:53,519 --> 00:54:57,199
they would need to be even more militant

1532
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,599
than normal

1533
00:54:57,199 --> 00:55:02,399
yeah i mean i i think kind of what this

1534
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:04,640
comes down to is that you know all of

1535
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,720
these practices can be worked into a

1536
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:09,039
regular standard operating procedure as

1537
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:11,439
long as you're testing as long as you're

1538
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:14,800
constantly measuring you know the

1539
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:17,679
the biotic stress of your plants and so

1540
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:20,079
you know what's going on you your you

1541
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:21,919
know you can adopt your sops depending

1542
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:23,359
on what outbreaks or which types of

1543
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,680
pathogens

1544
00:55:23,358 --> 00:55:28,000
are there but if you're not collecting

1545
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:30,159
information then you can't make

1546
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,318
intelligent choices downstream about

1547
00:55:30,159 --> 00:55:33,679
what's safe and what isn't

1548
00:55:32,318 --> 00:55:35,358
so

1549
00:55:33,679 --> 00:55:37,199
if we're gonna get it under control

1550
00:55:35,358 --> 00:55:39,920
people need to be

1551
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:41,279
monitoring their plants all of the time

1552
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,358
to make sure that they don't have

1553
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:44,480
something you know spreading in there

1554
00:55:43,358 --> 00:55:46,000
and and

1555
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:48,639
because if you don't

1556
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,719
then you end up with catastrophic losses

1557
00:55:48,639 --> 00:55:52,239
or possibly you do

1558
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:54,719
so on that level

1559
00:55:52,239 --> 00:55:56,558
um that leads me to another question and

1560
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:58,879
it's related to something matt said you

1561
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:00,640
know you said earlier too that like in

1562
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,960
addition to hop layton you would also

1563
00:56:00,639 --> 00:56:06,159
test for a certain kind of fusarium you

1564
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:09,119
know matt was talking earlier about um

1565
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:10,719
you know other forms of dutting to use

1566
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:14,480
the common term

1567
00:56:10,719 --> 00:56:16,159
um you know i uh so for you since you

1568
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:18,880
offer these services or something like

1569
00:56:16,159 --> 00:56:21,759
that how how affordable is it

1570
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:23,599
like if if if we were to create a panel

1571
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:25,200
of hop layton with two or three other

1572
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:26,318
common things

1573
00:56:25,199 --> 00:56:27,759
right

1574
00:56:26,318 --> 00:56:29,519
how much does it how much is it gonna

1575
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:31,839
honestly cost somebody just like even

1576
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:34,480
just like a hobbyist who's concerned and

1577
00:56:31,838 --> 00:56:37,039
wants to test their little collection um

1578
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:39,838
to do like a one once a month

1579
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:42,798
uh on a plant for instance

1580
00:56:39,838 --> 00:56:44,400
yes so um i mean obviously every testing

1581
00:56:42,798 --> 00:56:47,838
lab is going to have a different price

1582
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:50,160
and whatever um our cost is 25 dollars

1583
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:52,480
for a test um

1584
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:55,039
specifically or for multiple things

1585
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:56,880
so that's for hot blatant specifically

1586
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:59,199
we're working on channels putting

1587
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,000
multiple things together um and then you

1588
00:56:59,199 --> 00:57:01,439
know

1589
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,119
kind of figuring out where where the

1590
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,200
cost of that will fall

1591
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:06,798
but um

1592
00:57:05,199 --> 00:57:08,879
even if you know if you're a really

1593
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:10,559
large or a larger facility and you want

1594
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,160
to get on some sort of regular testing

1595
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:14,559
schedule then there are you know bulk

1596
00:57:12,159 --> 00:57:17,519
deals and and kind of subscription type

1597
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:18,720
things where we can help with sops sure

1598
00:57:17,519 --> 00:57:20,318
and then and then it gets more

1599
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:21,279
affordable there

1600
00:57:20,318 --> 00:57:24,838
um

1601
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:26,880
because so matt uh not matt always he

1602
00:57:24,838 --> 00:57:28,880
never um

1603
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:30,480
you know uh people ask sometimes what

1604
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:33,200
the size of my collection is and he's

1605
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,960
always like you know don't but yeah you

1606
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:36,399
know in that regard for a variety of

1607
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:38,159
reasons but you can imagine let's say

1608
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:40,798
that someone does have a fairly

1609
00:57:38,159 --> 00:57:43,039
extensive collection right yeah and you

1610
00:57:40,798 --> 00:57:45,759
want to regularly get them tested

1611
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:47,838
um that could that could be a major

1612
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,599
expense for a normal person

1613
00:57:47,838 --> 00:57:50,880
right trying to stay on top of things

1614
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:53,519
that could run into the thousands of

1615
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:54,640
dollars a month perhaps

1616
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:56,480
yeah right i mean

1617
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:58,400
depending on your collection you know if

1618
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,838
it's if it's big enough it can be an

1619
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:02,960
expense for sure

1620
00:57:59,838 --> 00:58:05,440
um so then maybe maybe i could get like

1621
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:06,960
perhaps a little like political slash

1622
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,400
regulatory

1623
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,639
um

1624
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,240
so you know one of the one of the the

1625
00:58:10,639 --> 00:58:14,719
the equitable things or people talk

1626
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:16,159
about like social equity a lot uh in

1627
00:58:14,719 --> 00:58:17,919
cannabis because

1628
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:20,879
um a lot of the people that are

1629
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:23,680
traditional or legacy cannabis breeders

1630
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:25,920
um are you know sort of small outlaws

1631
00:58:23,679 --> 00:58:27,519
type folks and now you have a lot of big

1632
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,960
money you have a lot of investment you

1633
00:58:27,519 --> 00:58:30,318
have a lot of like people that never

1634
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,559
would have dealt with it before so the

1635
00:58:30,318 --> 00:58:34,000
culture is changing dramatically right

1636
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:36,880
yes sadly

1637
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,159
um the little guy has a lot harder time

1638
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,599
affording this

1639
00:58:38,159 --> 00:58:42,399
than the big guy

1640
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:45,200
uh when in my opinion as far as i've

1641
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:48,798
been able to determine it's unscrupulous

1642
00:58:45,199 --> 00:58:51,279
or simply poor practice big people and

1643
00:58:48,798 --> 00:58:52,798
that are spreading it everywhere

1644
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,559
right and then they have no

1645
00:58:52,798 --> 00:58:56,159
responsibility once it's gotten out

1646
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:58,480
there to do anything about it they don't

1647
00:58:56,159 --> 00:58:59,358
owe anyone anything right

1648
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:02,000
so

1649
00:58:59,358 --> 00:59:04,159
do you think then that there should be

1650
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:07,199
some kind of regulatory or political

1651
00:59:04,159 --> 00:59:10,078
change where you know clones sold

1652
00:59:07,199 --> 00:59:12,000
should come with a clean bill of health

1653
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:14,480
that that should be like an absolute

1654
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,719
standard because to me if you're paying

1655
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,599
all this money for instance i'll just

1656
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:18,959
use

1657
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:20,640
as an example but if you're paying a

1658
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:22,480
bunch of money up front for the right to

1659
00:59:20,639 --> 00:59:24,558
grow for your square footage and you're

1660
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:26,480
paying all these taxes and fees up front

1661
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:28,559
and you have all this cost

1662
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:30,719
and then you buy a thousand clones that

1663
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:33,200
ruin your season

1664
00:59:30,719 --> 00:59:34,959
and now your soil is infected and you've

1665
00:59:33,199 --> 00:59:37,199
got this massive issue

1666
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,798
uh the only person that has no liability

1667
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:40,960
is the person that happily took your

1668
00:59:38,798 --> 00:59:42,960
money

1669
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:45,199
to sell the clones they're free and

1670
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:47,199
clear they you don't have i don't think

1671
00:59:45,199 --> 00:59:49,679
there is any cases of being able like in

1672
00:59:47,199 --> 00:59:51,519
the regular agricultural system

1673
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:52,719
if you spread some kind of terrible

1674
00:59:51,519 --> 00:59:54,880
disease

1675
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:57,358
from your nursery to a big agricultural

1676
00:59:54,880 --> 01:00:00,798
people they'll come after you right

1677
00:59:57,358 --> 01:00:02,639
yeah yeah so i mean i think so this

1678
01:00:00,798 --> 01:00:04,880
problem

1679
01:00:02,639 --> 01:00:07,759
needs to be i mean this is my opinion

1680
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:10,079
attacked on multiple levels um i think

1681
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:11,760
it should be standard in the industry

1682
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:13,680
that you know if you're if you're

1683
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:16,400
selling clones that you're getting your

1684
01:00:13,679 --> 01:00:17,639
stuff tested and that you can provide

1685
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:20,639
some type of

1686
01:00:17,639 --> 01:00:23,039
documentation certification

1687
01:00:20,639 --> 01:00:25,440
um that you that it was tested and and

1688
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:28,318
these are the results like this mom was

1689
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:29,358
tested within 30 days of me taking this

1690
01:00:28,318 --> 01:00:31,759
clone

1691
01:00:29,358 --> 01:00:33,598
yes um and i think on the other end when

1692
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:35,839
people are buying clones they should

1693
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:37,838
have the right to say hey is this tested

1694
01:00:35,838 --> 01:00:40,239
and if the person says yeah i say

1695
01:00:37,838 --> 01:00:42,159
awesome can you give me the can you give

1696
01:00:40,239 --> 01:00:44,078
me the results and tell me what lab it

1697
01:00:42,159 --> 01:00:46,399
was tested through so you can do your

1698
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:48,160
own research and decide whether or not

1699
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,838
you believe the results you trust the

1700
01:00:48,159 --> 01:00:52,399
science um

1701
01:00:49,838 --> 01:00:54,960
you know you can you can get clones and

1702
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:56,798
um just do a quick screening yourself

1703
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:59,280
you know if you bought a thousand clones

1704
01:00:56,798 --> 01:01:00,960
you can you can bulk test

1705
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:03,519
you know maybe five or six clones per

1706
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:05,599
tube and just try to get like even even

1707
01:01:03,519 --> 01:01:06,719
like five percent of them and send them

1708
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:08,318
in to

1709
01:01:06,719 --> 01:01:09,598
your own i'll throw something out there

1710
01:01:08,318 --> 01:01:11,358
because this is

1711
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:13,119
this is maybe a little technical so i'm

1712
01:01:11,358 --> 01:01:14,960
not going to try to borrow anyone but

1713
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:16,880
with the rate with but you know honestly

1714
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:19,440
with the rate regulations exist or

1715
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:21,920
whatever in legal situations like a lot

1716
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:24,079
of a lot of you know licenses that have

1717
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:26,079
flowering rights you know you're

1718
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:28,480
supposed to move your plants into those

1719
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:30,640
areas within 24 hours

1720
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:33,199
you know you don't have like it's not

1721
01:01:30,639 --> 01:01:35,440
that easy to like just sit there take a

1722
01:01:33,199 --> 01:01:37,598
bunch of clones spend a few weeks

1723
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:40,159
testing them waiting for results making

1724
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:42,079
sure they're clean keeping them healthy

1725
01:01:40,159 --> 01:01:44,159
without transplanting them and then

1726
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:46,480
figuring out whether or not you need to

1727
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:47,759
buy more clothes because a lot of these

1728
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:49,838
nurseries

1729
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:51,359
you put your orders in in spring you

1730
01:01:49,838 --> 01:01:53,119
know you have a week that you get your

1731
01:01:51,358 --> 01:01:54,480
plants it's not like if if somebody

1732
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:56,240
screws you

1733
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:58,240
on you can go to another nursery and be

1734
01:01:56,239 --> 01:01:59,358
like hey i need 9 000 cuts and i'm

1735
01:01:58,239 --> 01:02:01,519
behind

1736
01:01:59,358 --> 01:02:03,358
they might not even so i i guess what

1737
01:02:01,519 --> 01:02:06,639
i'm saying is i don't know that putting

1738
01:02:03,358 --> 01:02:09,358
the the responsibility on the farmer is

1739
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:11,358
very effective for the farmer in terms

1740
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:13,838
of cost and just the way the regulations

1741
01:02:11,358 --> 01:02:16,078
are i almost it almost seems to me like

1742
01:02:13,838 --> 01:02:18,318
in uh i mean this is a crazy analogy or

1743
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:20,000
whatever but like you know um like you

1744
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:21,920
know uh people that work in the sex

1745
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,440
industry like in in movies and stuff

1746
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:24,798
they have to get tested every two or

1747
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,159
three weeks

1748
01:02:24,798 --> 01:02:27,759
right and they have to like before they

1749
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:30,000
go to work they have to provide a clean

1750
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:31,440
bill of health so it almost seems to me

1751
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,838
like the same thing should be done with

1752
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:36,000
nurseries like if you want to sell

1753
01:02:33,838 --> 01:02:38,318
thousands of clones to someone you

1754
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,318
should have a recent test

1755
01:02:38,318 --> 01:02:42,880
you know that shows that the mother that

1756
01:02:40,318 --> 01:02:44,480
came off this stuff was not infected

1757
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:45,680
because otherwise it's going to keep

1758
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:47,519
happening

1759
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:48,558
yes i absolutely agree i mean and i

1760
01:02:47,519 --> 01:02:51,679
think

1761
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:53,920
um we work with nurseries that test all

1762
01:02:51,679 --> 01:02:55,919
of the time i mean that test every you

1763
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:57,680
know they they cut they and they send in

1764
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:59,680
hundreds of samples to make sure that

1765
01:02:57,679 --> 01:03:02,078
they're not selling

1766
01:02:59,679 --> 01:03:03,838
positive plants to anybody and i think

1767
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:06,960
those are there's ethical people very

1768
01:03:03,838 --> 01:03:09,838
much so um shout out to our our friends

1769
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:12,480
uh at radio ridge who i know spend a lot

1770
01:03:09,838 --> 01:03:14,480
of money monthly um testing their stuff

1771
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:17,440
but there's other unscrupulous nurseries

1772
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:19,119
that don't waste any money on that

1773
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:21,519
and they end up spreading a lot of

1774
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:23,280
disease without realizing it

1775
01:03:21,519 --> 01:03:25,199
yeah yeah and honestly you know i think

1776
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:27,200
that the biggest responsibility that

1777
01:03:25,199 --> 01:03:29,358
would fall to the clone the person

1778
01:03:27,199 --> 01:03:30,558
buying the clones is to simply ask did

1779
01:03:29,358 --> 01:03:32,239
you test

1780
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:35,039
and you know you have the right to move

1781
01:03:32,239 --> 01:03:37,038
to a different person if you if that you

1782
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:38,880
know if they haven't been testing and

1783
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:40,720
you don't feel confident you know you

1784
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,838
can try to source them from elsewhere

1785
01:03:40,719 --> 01:03:45,759
but i i think

1786
01:03:42,838 --> 01:03:47,920
that moving forward that's gonna have to

1787
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:49,680
start to become the industry standard if

1788
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:51,760
we're gonna you know get this thing

1789
01:03:49,679 --> 01:03:55,038
under control everybody's gonna have to

1790
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:57,039
be testing i can tell you um having

1791
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:59,440
consulted and worked at multiple legal

1792
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:01,680
scenes especially ones that like are

1793
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:04,798
brand new and getting off the ground

1794
01:04:01,679 --> 01:04:06,480
um most of the bugs for talking of those

1795
01:04:04,798 --> 01:04:08,318
will stop talking about viroids for a

1796
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:10,639
second but most of the insects that come

1797
01:04:08,318 --> 01:04:12,400
under those onto those first grows come

1798
01:04:10,639 --> 01:04:14,400
from the nurseries

1799
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:16,639
they come with free root aphids or free

1800
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,760
cannabis aphids or free thrips or you

1801
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:20,000
know free

1802
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:22,000
free you know two spotted spider mites

1803
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,480
and there's no discount

1804
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:27,280
uh for that gift that comes along with

1805
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:30,079
that so um nurseries haven't done a very

1806
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:31,440
good job yet of providing problem-free

1807
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:32,400
plants

1808
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:34,000
um yeah

1809
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,280
i kind of want to rewind it a bit

1810
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,838
because i did notice some people were

1811
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:39,359
mentioning we didn't go over like

1812
01:04:37,838 --> 01:04:41,759
initial

1813
01:04:39,358 --> 01:04:43,519
reasons why someone would even suspect

1814
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,880
they have hops late like me and not to

1815
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:46,798
have seen a lot of plants with this so

1816
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:48,720
we know like we see one we're like oh

1817
01:04:46,798 --> 01:04:51,038
[ __ ] that's that's it it's like it's

1818
01:04:48,719 --> 01:04:52,798
obvious but a lot of people watching are

1819
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:54,559
going to be very confused on how they

1820
01:04:52,798 --> 01:04:56,639
would even begin to identify it so are

1821
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:58,240
there some some markers maybe you would

1822
01:04:56,639 --> 01:05:01,519
tell us to look out for

1823
01:04:58,239 --> 01:05:04,959
yeah so common symptoms are going to be

1824
01:05:01,519 --> 01:05:06,400
slow growth um you'll have branches that

1825
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:08,400
instead of them coming up like the

1826
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:10,720
normal angle they'll they'll go out more

1827
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:13,119
horizontal like this um yeah more of a

1828
01:05:10,719 --> 01:05:14,959
90 degree branch yes correct and they'll

1829
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:16,640
be brittle so you know if you if you

1830
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:19,440
like touch the plant like this you know

1831
01:05:16,639 --> 01:05:21,118
they'll break yeah um another common

1832
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:22,880
thing it's a little subtle but the

1833
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:25,358
leaves instead of kind of being

1834
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:27,920
separated will overlap a little bit and

1835
01:05:25,358 --> 01:05:30,639
that's another symptom you can also see

1836
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:32,240
things like leaf chlorosis

1837
01:05:30,639 --> 01:05:34,078
sometimes it'll like puff out and look

1838
01:05:32,239 --> 01:05:36,959
more like a christmas tree

1839
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:39,599
um like a christmas tree type growth

1840
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:42,480
um you know in in little clones you're

1841
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:44,000
gonna see a much slower slower growth

1842
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,920
and sometimes it looks kind of sparse

1843
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,719
and sickly but um

1844
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:51,200
you know and then obviously sometimes

1845
01:05:48,719 --> 01:05:53,358
the symptoms can be really subtle and

1846
01:05:51,199 --> 01:05:56,960
depending on when it was infected it's

1847
01:05:53,358 --> 01:05:58,480
not super easy to see it um until it

1848
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:00,960
flowers and then

1849
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:02,798
it's just super duper disappointing

1850
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:04,240
those are those are all i would i

1851
01:06:02,798 --> 01:06:07,038
wouldn't say all but i would say about

1852
01:06:04,239 --> 01:06:09,279
90 of what you mentioned especially the

1853
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:12,000
angle of the stem the brittleness of the

1854
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:14,559
stem and the on the small leaves

1855
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:18,079
are all stuff that we had noticed

1856
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:19,680
um among plants that were worrisome um

1857
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:21,119
before we even knew what the word hop

1858
01:06:19,679 --> 01:06:23,118
layton was

1859
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:24,960
yeah yeah i remember one of the others

1860
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:26,640
was the stem color

1861
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:28,318
uh there wasn't a lot of stem color i

1862
01:06:26,639 --> 01:06:29,920
don't know oh yeah that's a really good

1863
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:32,079
one so i don't know if you know about

1864
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:34,000
that but what we saw with infected

1865
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:35,839
plants is that

1866
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,920
most infected plants would be like a

1867
01:06:35,838 --> 01:06:40,400
uniform pale green

1868
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:42,400
they wouldn't have any red or purple or

1869
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:43,920
any kind of coloration they would almost

1870
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:45,440
be like a pure

1871
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:47,039
i don't want to say sickly green because

1872
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:48,720
that's not right but well their texture

1873
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:50,160
was different too it wasn't like the

1874
01:06:48,719 --> 01:06:52,558
normal texture that i would see it was

1875
01:06:50,159 --> 01:06:53,838
almost rubbery and when you would move

1876
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:55,200
your hands down the stem it would

1877
01:06:53,838 --> 01:06:57,199
definitely break because of its

1878
01:06:55,199 --> 01:06:58,879
different type of texture it was it

1879
01:06:57,199 --> 01:07:01,118
would basically be the the plant would

1880
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:03,760
look almost a unif the stem would be a

1881
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:05,680
uniform pale green it wouldn't have some

1882
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:07,920
of the variation we've come to expect

1883
01:07:05,679 --> 01:07:10,960
with you know as it gets woody or this

1884
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:12,240
or that and so yeah um you know one of

1885
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:13,679
uh

1886
01:07:12,239 --> 01:07:15,919
um

1887
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:16,719
but the other the other risk of that is

1888
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:18,720
that

1889
01:07:16,719 --> 01:07:20,480
uh maybe we can jump into this for a

1890
01:07:18,719 --> 01:07:22,798
minute is that the problem is is that

1891
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:23,920
you can be infected and be asymptomatic

1892
01:07:22,798 --> 01:07:25,519
correct

1893
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:27,680
yes you can have you can have an

1894
01:07:25,519 --> 01:07:30,000
infection that's young enough that it

1895
01:07:27,679 --> 01:07:32,719
hasn't started showing these deformities

1896
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,599
if you will right yeah yep

1897
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:36,480
so

1898
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:37,920
maybe you could explain

1899
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:39,358
you know and maybe you maybe you know

1900
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:40,960
maybe you don't know

1901
01:07:39,358 --> 01:07:42,880
but we you've mentioned a number of

1902
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:44,960
times where there's differences between

1903
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:46,720
the viroid just like exploding around

1904
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:48,798
through the plant versus a plant that

1905
01:07:46,719 --> 01:07:52,078
has less viroid

1906
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:54,559
um what are some things that can you

1907
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:56,880
know outside of just the plants health

1908
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:59,200
what are some things that slow or speed

1909
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:01,200
the plant being infected

1910
01:07:59,199 --> 01:08:03,679
in the sense of do you have any idea on

1911
01:08:01,199 --> 01:08:05,679
those aspects or ways to slow it down

1912
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:07,598
even if it might be infected

1913
01:08:05,679 --> 01:08:10,719
uh that type of thing

1914
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:12,960
yeah so um so it is mentioned in the

1915
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:16,079
literature that um

1916
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:16,960
higher temperatures and um more intense

1917
01:08:16,079 --> 01:08:19,198
light

1918
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:21,600
tends to speed up the

1919
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:25,198
replication of the viroid so it it so

1920
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:28,239
the plant's gonna have a higher load

1921
01:08:25,198 --> 01:08:31,198
you're going to see the symptoms more

1922
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:33,198
robustly if the plant gets stressed out

1923
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:36,000
so that doesn't mean that it isn't it

1924
01:08:33,198 --> 01:08:38,079
isn't in there replicating but

1925
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,279
if the plant gets stressed out dried up

1926
01:08:38,079 --> 01:08:42,079
or whatever

1927
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:44,239
um the stress response of the plant

1928
01:08:42,079 --> 01:08:45,838
isn't going to be functioning as well as

1929
01:08:44,238 --> 01:08:47,678
a healthy plant and so you're going to

1930
01:08:45,838 --> 01:08:49,359
see those symptoms come out really

1931
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:52,480
pronounced

1932
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:53,679
if the plant gets stressed out um you

1933
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:56,318
know it's

1934
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:59,679
it's tough but what you what you really

1935
01:08:56,319 --> 01:09:01,839
want to do is try to find it before the

1936
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:04,158
symptoms are super obvious because once

1937
01:09:01,838 --> 01:09:06,880
they're super obvious the plant is you

1938
01:09:04,158 --> 01:09:09,439
know really infected and the chances of

1939
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:12,319
it spreading are quite a bit higher

1940
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:14,639
um you know which is why i'm back to the

1941
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:16,560
you know screening thing because if you

1942
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:17,759
can catch it early on with a sensitive

1943
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:20,560
enough test

1944
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:23,039
um you can it's much easier to contain

1945
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:24,880
and and keep it from spreading like that

1946
01:09:23,039 --> 01:09:25,920
matt do you intentionally have comments

1947
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:27,440
off

1948
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:29,759
yes okay

1949
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:30,639
just just just to be clear so

1950
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:34,520
um

1951
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:34,520
there is a

1952
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:38,960
so basically what we're talking about is

1953
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:40,798
that we we've established there's a

1954
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:43,838
couple different things you can do that

1955
01:09:40,798 --> 01:09:45,600
really that really prevent spread

1956
01:09:43,838 --> 01:09:47,119
but the best thing is just to prevent it

1957
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,239
from coming in

1958
01:09:47,119 --> 01:09:51,679
yeah all

1959
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:55,279
right the ideal yes that's the ideal

1960
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:56,640
um and then you know so and you say that

1961
01:09:55,279 --> 01:09:58,238
uh because you know one of the things

1962
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:01,039
that i see a lot of these places when

1963
01:09:58,238 --> 01:10:03,359
they offer tc or meristem

1964
01:10:01,039 --> 01:10:04,560
this is uh four to six thousand dollars

1965
01:10:03,359 --> 01:10:06,479
often

1966
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:07,920
yeah and here's the price and it's it's

1967
01:10:06,479 --> 01:10:10,718
very pricey and you're saying and it

1968
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:13,199
takes months right and you're saying

1969
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:16,158
that it can be effective but the people

1970
01:10:13,198 --> 01:10:18,399
doing it have to be really talented at

1971
01:10:16,158 --> 01:10:20,158
actually removing all of the vascular

1972
01:10:18,399 --> 01:10:23,119
only getting it down to the meristem

1973
01:10:20,158 --> 01:10:25,039
itself and starting from that point and

1974
01:10:23,119 --> 01:10:26,238
there's some luck to it as well right

1975
01:10:25,039 --> 01:10:27,439
like

1976
01:10:26,238 --> 01:10:29,678
yes

1977
01:10:27,439 --> 01:10:31,359
yeah yeah some of it some of it's really

1978
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:33,039
know knowing what you're doing really

1979
01:10:31,359 --> 01:10:36,238
understanding the plant getting the

1980
01:10:33,039 --> 01:10:38,000
plant you know really healthy before you

1981
01:10:36,238 --> 01:10:40,238
you know even attempt the process you

1982
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:42,158
want to pick the right the right part of

1983
01:10:40,238 --> 01:10:42,959
the plant or the you know the healthiest

1984
01:10:42,158 --> 01:10:44,399
bit

1985
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:47,119
um and then it's not going to work on

1986
01:10:44,399 --> 01:10:48,479
every single one so you could do numbers

1987
01:10:47,119 --> 01:10:50,640
your tests so

1988
01:10:48,479 --> 01:10:52,319
maybe i could i i think i already know

1989
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:55,520
the answers to this but

1990
01:10:52,319 --> 01:10:58,399
um i have i'll just take you through uh

1991
01:10:55,520 --> 01:11:00,800
some bro science for a second on

1992
01:10:58,399 --> 01:11:02,399
what people are doing to cure it right

1993
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:04,320
so one of the one of the ways that

1994
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:06,399
people have heard you learn it

1995
01:11:04,319 --> 01:11:08,799
you know is you clone out of it

1996
01:11:06,399 --> 01:11:10,719
right you have a plant that you think

1997
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:12,640
has an issue you try to get it as

1998
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:15,760
healthy as humanly possible

1999
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:16,560
right you take some clones that was my

2000
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,679
my

2001
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:19,360
my method

2002
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:22,000
that was your method you you take the

2003
01:11:19,359 --> 01:11:24,238
healthiest clones you root it you get

2004
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:27,039
you you root it you take a clone off it

2005
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:27,839
very soon you throw that away you cycle

2006
01:11:27,039 --> 01:11:30,319
through

2007
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:33,039
repeatedly trying to like sort of outrun

2008
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:34,559
the viroid

2009
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:36,800
is this

2010
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:40,960
could be effective or is this sort of

2011
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:41,920
chasing your own tail and it's it's

2012
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:44,239
so

2013
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:46,158
um okay i'm not gonna say that it can't

2014
01:11:44,238 --> 01:11:48,799
work because i have not done the

2015
01:11:46,158 --> 01:11:51,039
experiment and i don't know and so

2016
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:53,199
you know this it could potentially work

2017
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:55,359
um

2018
01:11:53,198 --> 01:11:58,158
one of the problems with

2019
01:11:55,359 --> 01:12:01,039
the viroid is you don't need a lot to

2020
01:11:58,158 --> 01:12:03,359
get that infection again i mean one or

2021
01:12:01,039 --> 01:12:05,198
two copies um you're not going to see

2022
01:12:03,359 --> 01:12:07,119
much for a long time it's going to take

2023
01:12:05,198 --> 01:12:09,359
a while for it to build enough to even

2024
01:12:07,119 --> 01:12:11,599
be detectable on a test

2025
01:12:09,359 --> 01:12:14,158
but just a little bit and you're you're

2026
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:15,920
right back to an infected plant

2027
01:12:14,158 --> 01:12:17,759
um

2028
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:20,239
and the vibrate chases the new growth

2029
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:22,079
right like correct yeah so it's it

2030
01:12:20,238 --> 01:12:24,959
you're done it's definitely uh you're

2031
01:12:22,079 --> 01:12:26,238
you're playing a a chasing game right

2032
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:29,039
again

2033
01:12:26,238 --> 01:12:32,000
um if you think about it if if the plant

2034
01:12:29,039 --> 01:12:34,079
was just infected and it's moving down

2035
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,520
that first branch into the vascular

2036
01:12:34,079 --> 01:12:38,479
system and up

2037
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:41,440
if you can cut a clone off before it

2038
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:43,839
gets there like intellectually it should

2039
01:12:41,439 --> 01:12:44,799
be possible to grab a clone that doesn't

2040
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:45,679
have it

2041
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,840
um

2042
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:49,279
i don't you'd have to start the race

2043
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:51,920
before you knew that you should be

2044
01:12:49,279 --> 01:12:55,198
racing exactly in order

2045
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:55,920
in order to outrun it but then the next

2046
01:12:55,198 --> 01:12:57,039
step

2047
01:12:55,920 --> 01:13:00,719
of that

2048
01:12:57,039 --> 01:13:01,519
so it's it's it's it sounds unlikely

2049
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:04,319
um

2050
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:06,080
i tried that with the trend so hard on

2051
01:13:04,319 --> 01:13:08,158
the trinity and and

2052
01:13:06,079 --> 01:13:09,198
we i think we had it outdoors trying to

2053
01:13:08,158 --> 01:13:10,719
chase it

2054
01:13:09,198 --> 01:13:12,399
up and out that way it was growing

2055
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:14,158
vigorous taking the healthiest cuts

2056
01:13:12,399 --> 01:13:15,920
every time and over a period of year and

2057
01:13:14,158 --> 01:13:18,000
a half it just was not

2058
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:19,600
it looked great and then slowly but

2059
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,920
surely the traits would start showing

2060
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:24,079
back up again yeah so then there's

2061
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:26,560
there's some big companies out there

2062
01:13:24,079 --> 01:13:29,198
um that have claimed that they had

2063
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:32,239
dutting issues and they cured them by

2064
01:13:29,198 --> 01:13:35,039
you know dunking dunking plants and and

2065
01:13:32,238 --> 01:13:38,079
something like say xeritol or you know

2066
01:13:35,039 --> 01:13:40,560
uh putting stairs in a date sanitate uh

2067
01:13:38,079 --> 01:13:43,600
putting you know um soaking the roots so

2068
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:44,719
the roots uptake uh whatever sterolant

2069
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,960
it might be

2070
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:49,198
type of thing and that they have cured

2071
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:51,198
it and never seen it since

2072
01:13:49,198 --> 01:13:53,359
kind of gig

2073
01:13:51,198 --> 01:13:55,039
and uh you know there's a

2074
01:13:53,359 --> 01:13:58,479
there's a big push with any kind of

2075
01:13:55,039 --> 01:14:00,560
nursery or any kind of big big grow

2076
01:13:58,479 --> 01:14:01,919
if anyone in the community finds out

2077
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:03,360
that you have it

2078
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:05,520
uh they want to let everyone know as

2079
01:14:03,359 --> 01:14:08,479
soon as possible that they've solved it

2080
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:09,360
and then it's gone right and so

2081
01:14:08,479 --> 01:14:10,479
uh

2082
01:14:09,359 --> 01:14:12,639
you know i have a certain amount of

2083
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:15,039
skepticism that that would work from

2084
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:17,280
your experience that would not also not

2085
01:14:15,039 --> 01:14:19,359
be probably very effective

2086
01:14:17,279 --> 01:14:21,679
no no so

2087
01:14:19,359 --> 01:14:24,960
i guess to help people understand

2088
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:26,640
viroids are intercellular pathogens so

2089
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:29,520
what that means is they're not just in

2090
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:31,520
the plant tissue they're they're inside

2091
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:33,840
the cell and then once they get inside

2092
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:35,040
the cell there's actually another little

2093
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:37,360
tiny

2094
01:14:35,039 --> 01:14:40,000
organelle in there called the nucleus

2095
01:14:37,359 --> 01:14:43,279
and so they traffic all the way into

2096
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:45,439
where the dna of the plant is and they

2097
01:14:43,279 --> 01:14:48,238
they hijack the machine that's supposed

2098
01:14:45,439 --> 01:14:51,678
to be interpreting the dna for the plant

2099
01:14:48,238 --> 01:14:52,799
and they use it to replicate themselves

2100
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:56,880
and so

2101
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:59,760
any type of non-specific disinfectant

2102
01:14:56,880 --> 01:15:02,159
that would actually make its way all the

2103
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:05,199
way into the nucleus of the plant and

2104
01:15:02,158 --> 01:15:07,359
and non-specifically destroy rna would

2105
01:15:05,198 --> 01:15:09,759
kill the entire plant

2106
01:15:07,359 --> 01:15:13,920
because rna is used by the plant to do

2107
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:16,159
its own biology like it's essential so

2108
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:18,000
if basically you you could get it to

2109
01:15:16,158 --> 01:15:19,519
work by dropping your entire plant in

2110
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,719
bleach or something but it'll just be

2111
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:25,600
dead after like an hour or so right so

2112
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:27,279
there's no way for a topical or you know

2113
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:29,199
something that's being taken up that

2114
01:15:27,279 --> 01:15:32,000
that's a non-specific disinfectant to

2115
01:15:29,198 --> 01:15:34,158
get all the way into the nucleus and

2116
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:36,719
only destroy the viroid and not the rest

2117
01:15:34,158 --> 01:15:39,359
of the plant maybe i'll ask a related

2118
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:41,679
question but just more general

2119
01:15:39,359 --> 01:15:44,639
so in your experience the only thing

2120
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:48,319
that has a chance of curing it

2121
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:50,960
um but even that is variable would be a

2122
01:15:48,319 --> 01:15:54,079
high quality meristem

2123
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:56,719
uh tissue culture with

2124
01:15:54,079 --> 01:15:57,760
testing afterwards to select the healthy

2125
01:15:56,719 --> 01:16:00,560
ones

2126
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:03,440
um and to get rid of the ones that it it

2127
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:06,719
remained you haven't seen anything else

2128
01:16:03,439 --> 01:16:09,359
uh in you know so far that

2129
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:12,960
will lead to success

2130
01:16:09,359 --> 01:16:16,079
yeah so right now that is the only

2131
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:18,880
option for a reasonable cure that has

2132
01:16:16,079 --> 01:16:21,519
evidence that it works um that doesn't

2133
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:22,719
mean that there you know there are ways

2134
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:25,440
of

2135
01:16:22,719 --> 01:16:27,600
um obviously genetic modification uh

2136
01:16:25,439 --> 01:16:29,839
selecting for plants that are resistant

2137
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:30,800
there are there are things um that you

2138
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:33,520
can

2139
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:35,840
basically mutate or deactivate in the

2140
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:37,760
plant so that the thyroid can't traffic

2141
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:39,279
through the plant anymore it can't

2142
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:41,600
replicate

2143
01:16:39,279 --> 01:16:44,238
um and then there are

2144
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:46,239
they're more theoretical right now or

2145
01:16:44,238 --> 01:16:48,238
you know still in the literature kind of

2146
01:16:46,238 --> 01:16:50,639
research zone

2147
01:16:48,238 --> 01:16:51,678
some types of molecules that can

2148
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:54,640
actually

2149
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:57,440
encourage the secondary immune system of

2150
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:58,880
the plant to respond specifically

2151
01:16:57,439 --> 01:17:00,879
to the viroid

2152
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:02,719
and that would be by activating

2153
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:05,199
something called rnai

2154
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:07,520
which is uh the plant's version of the

2155
01:17:05,198 --> 01:17:09,439
secondary immune system now none of

2156
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:12,000
these things as far as i'm aware are

2157
01:17:09,439 --> 01:17:14,839
actual products um they they've just

2158
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:17,119
shown some success in

2159
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:18,719
academia in theory

2160
01:17:17,119 --> 01:17:20,640
yes yeah so they've shown they've shown

2161
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:23,359
some success you know in a in a

2162
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:24,960
scientific lab that's looking for for

2163
01:17:23,359 --> 01:17:26,719
things that could work but as far as i'm

2164
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:28,800
aware nothing's been turned into a

2165
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:30,640
product that people could

2166
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:32,480
i mean it almost seems to me like an

2167
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:34,640
analogy that i've kind of started

2168
01:17:32,479 --> 01:17:37,439
settling on as far as like

2169
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:38,480
what it's gonna take to stop this thing

2170
01:17:37,439 --> 01:17:41,678
is

2171
01:17:38,479 --> 01:17:43,439
um you almost need to start uh treating

2172
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:45,359
your plants like they're in a tattoo

2173
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:46,238
parlor

2174
01:17:45,359 --> 01:17:47,119
right

2175
01:17:46,238 --> 01:17:50,079
where

2176
01:17:47,119 --> 01:17:52,960
you know where where you know you have

2177
01:17:50,079 --> 01:17:54,079
every every plant you know is gets clean

2178
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:56,719
gear

2179
01:17:54,079 --> 01:17:59,198
yep you know people are you know uh

2180
01:17:56,719 --> 01:18:01,679
every time you know that that level of

2181
01:17:59,198 --> 01:18:03,839
because obviously all those practices

2182
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:06,079
um in tattoo parlors happen because we

2183
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:08,640
wanted to stop transmission of hiv and

2184
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:10,079
hepatitis and all these other things

2185
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:12,800
that you know because back in the day

2186
01:18:10,079 --> 01:18:14,479
that wasn't so so much a worry um and

2187
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:17,199
then it became a big worry and then

2188
01:18:14,479 --> 01:18:19,198
basically i believe not that i'm uh

2189
01:18:17,198 --> 01:18:21,359
you know familiar with tattoo regulation

2190
01:18:19,198 --> 01:18:23,519
but i pretty much believe that you have

2191
01:18:21,359 --> 01:18:25,679
to have like autoclaves you have to have

2192
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:27,440
a certain level of sterilization you

2193
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:30,399
can't even operate

2194
01:18:27,439 --> 01:18:32,079
um without these this gear

2195
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:33,359
yeah make sure that you're not going to

2196
01:18:32,079 --> 01:18:35,600
be a vector

2197
01:18:33,359 --> 01:18:37,839
for spreading issues

2198
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:39,360
yes yeah absolutely i think that the

2199
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:40,400
entire industry is going to have to

2200
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:42,319
adopt

2201
01:18:40,399 --> 01:18:44,960
standard operating procedures very

2202
01:18:42,319 --> 01:18:46,639
similar to that um and we actually to

2203
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:48,158
help people kind of

2204
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:49,600
remember what they need to do we've

2205
01:18:48,158 --> 01:18:51,759
actually kind of created this dorky

2206
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:54,480
little acronym called stop

2207
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:57,119
um like stop pathogens up that stands

2208
01:18:54,479 --> 01:18:59,359
for um you know sterile environment so

2209
01:18:57,119 --> 01:19:01,359
that's the sterilization of your tools

2210
01:18:59,359 --> 01:19:03,039
sterilizing between plants sterilizing

2211
01:19:01,359 --> 01:19:04,079
your pots you know the surfaces and

2212
01:19:03,039 --> 01:19:06,399
everything

2213
01:19:04,079 --> 01:19:08,000
testing regularly um so that you know

2214
01:19:06,399 --> 01:19:09,039
what's going on and you can catch stuff

2215
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,760
early

2216
01:19:09,039 --> 01:19:12,719
organizing your facility that's the oh

2217
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:15,119
like

2218
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:17,039
flow of the people organizing where your

2219
01:19:15,119 --> 01:19:19,119
clones are sitting so if a mom plant

2220
01:19:17,039 --> 01:19:21,359
pops positive you don't have to throw

2221
01:19:19,119 --> 01:19:23,599
out every tray because you don't know

2222
01:19:21,359 --> 01:19:26,000
where those plants are sitting that came

2223
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:27,840
from that positive mom so thinking about

2224
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,198
that um and then the p is to protect

2225
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:31,520
your borders right you don't let

2226
01:19:29,198 --> 01:19:33,039
anything in that hasn't been tested

2227
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:34,719
and make sure that you're keeping

2228
01:19:33,039 --> 01:19:36,158
infected stuff out

2229
01:19:34,719 --> 01:19:37,920
um so if you can if you can go through

2230
01:19:36,158 --> 01:19:40,719
that whole stop uh

2231
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:42,239
process then um you stand you know

2232
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:44,239
you're making the right corrections to

2233
01:19:42,238 --> 01:19:46,639
sort of keep the thing at bay and limit

2234
01:19:44,238 --> 01:19:48,559
your economic exposure to it

2235
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:50,400
so it's really it's basically

2236
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:53,039
you know one of the aspects that people

2237
01:19:50,399 --> 01:19:55,119
uh um people get mad about right where

2238
01:19:53,039 --> 01:19:56,800
they want to talk about like being a

2239
01:19:55,119 --> 01:19:59,760
libertarian or something like that you

2240
01:19:56,800 --> 01:20:03,119
know we should have no rules is that

2241
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:05,119
in positive aspect of regulation is it's

2242
01:20:03,119 --> 01:20:06,559
there to force people that would never

2243
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:08,399
do it

2244
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:11,520
to someone do it

2245
01:20:08,399 --> 01:20:14,079
yes you know um and so one of the one of

2246
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:16,080
the hard parts about regulation for me

2247
01:20:14,079 --> 01:20:18,800
right now is that because you don't have

2248
01:20:16,079 --> 01:20:21,600
federal legality on any level

2249
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:24,320
every state is its own island

2250
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:26,000
yep so you know if we you know obviously

2251
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:28,639
winning in california would be big

2252
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:30,719
because you know it's it's going to take

2253
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:32,560
much like hiv or something like that at

2254
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:34,000
this point it's it's so

2255
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:36,400
prevalent

2256
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:38,960
that it's going to take years and a

2257
01:20:36,399 --> 01:20:40,238
bunch of outreach and a bunch of

2258
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:43,119
knowledge

2259
01:20:40,238 --> 01:20:45,039
to sort of slowly beat back the tide for

2260
01:20:43,119 --> 01:20:46,800
how much it spread when it was invisible

2261
01:20:45,039 --> 01:20:49,279
and nobody could talk to people like you

2262
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:51,360
and figure out how it even moved around

2263
01:20:49,279 --> 01:20:53,279
yes yeah it's gonna it's gonna take a

2264
01:20:51,359 --> 01:20:55,599
long time and the entire industry

2265
01:20:53,279 --> 01:20:58,719
working together and you know i include

2266
01:20:55,600 --> 01:21:00,159
people like us in that as well because

2267
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:02,719
you know if you think about other

2268
01:21:00,158 --> 01:21:04,719
industries like human diagnostics or the

2269
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:06,640
rest of agriculture you know or even

2270
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:08,800
veterinary medicine there's a bunch of

2271
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:10,400
regulations and rules and standards for

2272
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:12,000
testing labs too

2273
01:21:10,399 --> 01:21:13,679
um you know you've got to validate your

2274
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,760
tests you need to show

2275
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:17,119
like level of detection

2276
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:20,079
you know all these things like

2277
01:21:17,119 --> 01:21:21,599
inclusivity and specificity and positive

2278
01:21:20,079 --> 01:21:23,279
predictive value and all these things

2279
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:25,600
that you're supposed to do

2280
01:21:23,279 --> 01:21:27,599
um and when we came into this we were

2281
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:29,199
used to working in human diagnostics

2282
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:31,199
where you know i mean there was like

2283
01:21:29,198 --> 01:21:32,158
this huge list of things you had to

2284
01:21:31,198 --> 01:21:34,879
prove

2285
01:21:32,158 --> 01:21:36,238
um and realize that here you know a lot

2286
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:38,000
of labs aren't doing any of those

2287
01:21:36,238 --> 01:21:40,718
experiments you know because there's no

2288
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:42,158
standards right now

2289
01:21:40,719 --> 01:21:44,399
we need to hold ourselves to a higher

2290
01:21:42,158 --> 01:21:46,079
standard too i just i just saw something

2291
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:47,439
proposed and i don't know if it's going

2292
01:21:46,079 --> 01:21:49,359
to i don't know exactly remember when

2293
01:21:47,439 --> 01:21:51,519
it's going to take effect but they're

2294
01:21:49,359 --> 01:21:54,719
starting to push for standardization of

2295
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:57,840
labs for thc and terpenes and stuff

2296
01:21:54,719 --> 01:22:00,480
um because there's a lot of shady

2297
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:02,319
business going on uh with that because

2298
01:22:00,479 --> 01:22:03,839
there's no standards that people have to

2299
01:22:02,319 --> 01:22:04,719
adhere to

2300
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:07,039
yes

2301
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:09,119
yeah and it's unfortunately i mean even

2302
01:22:07,039 --> 01:22:11,119
for for tissue culture and testing labs

2303
01:22:09,119 --> 01:22:13,679
because there's no standards

2304
01:22:11,119 --> 01:22:15,840
some of the you know it's not fair but

2305
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:18,239
some of the responsibility or way to

2306
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:20,400
protect yourself is to

2307
01:22:18,238 --> 01:22:22,799
know the right questions to ask you know

2308
01:22:20,399 --> 01:22:24,960
and if you if you find a testing lab and

2309
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:26,639
and they you know they wanna you know

2310
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:28,000
you're gonna send your plants there you

2311
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:30,239
can say hey can you send me your

2312
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,920
validation can you tell me the

2313
01:22:30,238 --> 01:22:33,919
experiments that you did to prove that

2314
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:35,520
your test is accurate or sensitive

2315
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:38,158
enough to detect it

2316
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:40,159
um and a good lab a lab that's that's

2317
01:22:38,158 --> 01:22:42,319
you know done its research should be

2318
01:22:40,158 --> 01:22:44,158
able to send you a document where it

2319
01:22:42,319 --> 01:22:46,559
spells out the experiments they did so

2320
01:22:44,158 --> 01:22:48,719
their stuff works i mean in all honesty

2321
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:51,600
having sourced clones for some pretty

2322
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:55,198
big scenes uh in the legal system most

2323
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:57,120
nurseries are only really prepping say

2324
01:22:55,198 --> 01:22:59,519
10 to 18

2325
01:22:57,119 --> 01:23:01,760
different strains for their season it's

2326
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:03,360
not like they might have a big library

2327
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:06,000
but they're only really they're only

2328
01:23:03,359 --> 01:23:08,238
picking so many things to mom up and

2329
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:10,158
offer numbers of

2330
01:23:08,238 --> 01:23:11,359
so it wouldn't be that prohibitively

2331
01:23:10,158 --> 01:23:13,439
expensive

2332
01:23:11,359 --> 01:23:15,519
like in winter for them to test these

2333
01:23:13,439 --> 01:23:17,759
things make sure the moms they're

2334
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:19,679
propagating are clean

2335
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:21,600
you know and it's not like they have to

2336
01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:23,840
put their entire collection through they

2337
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:26,639
just have to put what's in current

2338
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:28,639
production through correct yeah yeah i

2339
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:29,920
mean if you you know if you if you test

2340
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:31,520
your moms

2341
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:34,880
you know rigorously before you cut those

2342
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:37,120
clones um and then you know even if you

2343
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:39,279
do like a really small random sampling

2344
01:23:37,119 --> 01:23:40,800
of five percent of the clones

2345
01:23:39,279 --> 01:23:42,639
um

2346
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:44,960
all like the entire sop that we

2347
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:47,679
recommend is a couple bucks per plant or

2348
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:49,760
something like that and um

2349
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:51,279
like if you if you if you take all the

2350
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:53,679
costs together and calculate it per

2351
01:23:51,279 --> 01:23:56,079
plant and it's just totally worth it

2352
01:23:53,679 --> 01:23:58,639
to not you know to feel confident that

2353
01:23:56,079 --> 01:24:01,119
you're selling somebody a good product

2354
01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:03,119
because i think nurseries too want to

2355
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:05,920
feel good that they're giving people

2356
01:24:03,119 --> 01:24:07,599
high quality clones sure and be trusted

2357
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:09,920
and stuff like that

2358
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:11,679
as a breeder too like i think it's

2359
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:13,440
becoming more incumbent upon especially

2360
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:15,840
learning that there is even a remote

2361
01:24:13,439 --> 01:24:18,319
possibility of the transmission from

2362
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:19,679
mother plant to seed stock because right

2363
01:24:18,319 --> 01:24:21,198
now i mean

2364
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:23,920
it would be a great solution for the

2365
01:24:21,198 --> 01:24:26,000
current problem right now with clones

2366
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:27,520
and the mass you know i mean like people

2367
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,039
are all pretty much growing the same

2368
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:31,360
[ __ ] like whether

2369
01:24:29,039 --> 01:24:34,719
i mean it's all gelato cookies some form

2370
01:24:31,359 --> 01:24:38,000
thereof right but this could really

2371
01:24:34,719 --> 01:24:40,319
be a good advocate for more seeds more

2372
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:42,158
seed stock not relying on the same exact

2373
01:24:40,319 --> 01:24:45,039
clone more diversity

2374
01:24:42,158 --> 01:24:46,960
but that only is great if also the

2375
01:24:45,039 --> 01:24:49,198
breeders are also

2376
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:51,520
aspiring to the same level of

2377
01:24:49,198 --> 01:24:54,079
testing that everyone else is yeah and i

2378
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:57,040
mean with eight with potentially up to

2379
01:24:54,079 --> 01:24:58,960
eight percent transmission to seed

2380
01:24:57,039 --> 01:25:00,719
you know of course like just by the la

2381
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:02,960
murphy's law or whatever you know the

2382
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:05,279
one that you pick is your winner

2383
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:06,239
yeah it would be like eight percent or

2384
01:25:05,279 --> 01:25:07,759
something

2385
01:25:06,238 --> 01:25:09,439
you know you'd be like oh this is the

2386
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:11,679
one i want this has the terps this has

2387
01:25:09,439 --> 01:25:13,198
the high this oh it has the latent

2388
01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:15,279
but

2389
01:25:13,198 --> 01:25:17,839
yeah yeah i mean it's really gonna have

2390
01:25:15,279 --> 01:25:20,079
to be this the awareness of this the

2391
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:21,920
testing the you know the preventative

2392
01:25:20,079 --> 01:25:23,359
nature is gonna have to percolate into

2393
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:25,920
every faucet

2394
01:25:23,359 --> 01:25:27,439
of this entire industry in order for

2395
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:29,600
everybody as a collective to get the

2396
01:25:27,439 --> 01:25:32,719
thing under control breeders clone

2397
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:34,400
producers you know you know growers home

2398
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:36,480
growers um

2399
01:25:34,399 --> 01:25:37,920
i mean we grew a plant that had hot

2400
01:25:36,479 --> 01:25:40,799
plate environment in our basement you

2401
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:42,239
know with no idea just yeah it flowered

2402
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:45,279
and we're like what

2403
01:25:42,238 --> 01:25:47,279
it's gonna last a week right so um

2404
01:25:45,279 --> 01:25:49,039
so i mean it's it's it's the whole

2405
01:25:47,279 --> 01:25:50,960
industry as and we all take

2406
01:25:49,039 --> 01:25:52,719
responsibility together and then i think

2407
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:53,679
you know we can start making a dent in

2408
01:25:52,719 --> 01:25:55,039
it

2409
01:25:53,679 --> 01:25:58,319
yeah it's going to take a lot of

2410
01:25:55,039 --> 01:26:00,000
education for the actual um end user and

2411
01:25:58,319 --> 01:26:02,238
that's that's always been the hardest

2412
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,960
part when it comes to uh like we do a

2413
01:26:02,238 --> 01:26:08,319
lot of talk on on cannabis uh genetics

2414
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:10,399
history seed history what have you and

2415
01:26:08,319 --> 01:26:12,399
it's not always as important to everyone

2416
01:26:10,399 --> 01:26:14,399
like a lot of people have that genuine

2417
01:26:12,399 --> 01:26:16,799
idea that it's dank who gives a [ __ ]

2418
01:26:14,399 --> 01:26:18,399
what it's called or what what it is but

2419
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:19,840
when it comes to stuff like this there's

2420
01:26:18,399 --> 01:26:22,399
a reason that people care there's a

2421
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:24,000
reason that everybody takes is sets

2422
01:26:22,399 --> 01:26:26,799
these standards or aspires to these

2423
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,560
standards it's because

2424
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:30,960
we we give a [ __ ] we'd like to see these

2425
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:32,560
these genetics carry on in the form that

2426
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:33,679
they are we don't want to lose

2427
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:35,840
everything

2428
01:26:33,679 --> 01:26:38,158
and and not paying attention not giving

2429
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:40,719
a [ __ ] not caring not testing is a good

2430
01:26:38,158 --> 01:26:43,198
way to end up with

2431
01:26:40,719 --> 01:26:44,800
gelato for the rest of your life

2432
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:47,279
you know there's an issue with that and

2433
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:49,520
maybe maybe this is a this is a a good

2434
01:26:47,279 --> 01:26:51,920
time to bring it up or whatever but you

2435
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:54,320
know in in regards to other to other

2436
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:56,319
agriculture one of the things that matt

2437
01:26:54,319 --> 01:26:58,559
and myself and a number of our friends

2438
01:26:56,319 --> 01:27:01,599
are concerned about is that with the

2439
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:03,360
uneven rolling out of legalization right

2440
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:05,360
um not that many people like i said

2441
01:27:03,359 --> 01:27:07,920
before care that much about holding on

2442
01:27:05,359 --> 01:27:10,000
to old things right um and it's

2443
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:11,440
expensive and time consuming but it used

2444
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:14,000
to be that it was a little bit more

2445
01:27:11,439 --> 01:27:17,119
lucrative to do this and that allowed

2446
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:19,520
you to fund you know your passion if it

2447
01:27:17,119 --> 01:27:21,039
were right and so what i'm worried about

2448
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:22,159
is that as we grow into this big

2449
01:27:21,039 --> 01:27:23,198
industry

2450
01:27:22,158 --> 01:27:25,439
um

2451
01:27:23,198 --> 01:27:27,599
you know we could lose like the

2452
01:27:25,439 --> 01:27:29,759
legalization movement right now is

2453
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:32,320
probably a bigger threat to diversity

2454
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:34,880
than even prohibition was yeah

2455
01:27:32,319 --> 01:27:36,158
definitely in my opinion and then we

2456
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:38,239
could be looking for like you were

2457
01:27:36,158 --> 01:27:40,158
talking about uh like maybe five or ten

2458
01:27:38,238 --> 01:27:42,079
minutes ago and one of your answers

2459
01:27:40,158 --> 01:27:44,079
where you were saying you know we might

2460
01:27:42,079 --> 01:27:46,079
we can breed for resistance to certain

2461
01:27:44,079 --> 01:27:48,399
things we can bring you know you can

2462
01:27:46,079 --> 01:27:50,559
look at like the banana or other aspects

2463
01:27:48,399 --> 01:27:52,399
of agriculture where some disease came

2464
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:55,360
in and crushed it and they went and

2465
01:27:52,399 --> 01:27:57,920
found varieties that resisted that and

2466
01:27:55,359 --> 01:28:00,479
then those became the standard and so

2467
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:02,399
cannabis is going to in the next 10 20

2468
01:28:00,479 --> 01:28:04,000
30 40 years it's going to encounter

2469
01:28:02,399 --> 01:28:04,960
things that need to be dealt with like

2470
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,639
that

2471
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:08,319
yeah and we're not going to know where

2472
01:28:06,639 --> 01:28:11,039
the answer lies

2473
01:28:08,319 --> 01:28:13,519
but it probably lies in some plant that

2474
01:28:11,039 --> 01:28:15,760
if it gets lost in the next five years

2475
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:17,440
due to all these things happening

2476
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:19,600
we could end up i mean i was joking

2477
01:28:17,439 --> 01:28:21,839
about cookies and gelato you know even

2478
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:23,920
if those are your favorite strains they

2479
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:26,480
might lack genetic

2480
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:28,399
aspects that later on would be critical

2481
01:28:26,479 --> 01:28:30,879
for the survival of the plant as some

2482
01:28:28,399 --> 01:28:33,519
kind of bug or disease or viroid or

2483
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:35,199
whatever comes along i promise those

2484
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:36,639
those definitely will not be the ones

2485
01:28:35,198 --> 01:28:38,960
because they are so susceptible to

2486
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:40,639
everything because this is this this

2487
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:42,158
might sound a little nerdy or something

2488
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:43,520
but forgive me but i read this huge

2489
01:28:42,158 --> 01:28:45,599
article on why

2490
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:47,600
um you know 30 40 years ago like when i

2491
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:49,120
was a kid every lots of people hated

2492
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:51,280
brussels sprouts

2493
01:28:49,119 --> 01:28:54,319
because they had this really offensive

2494
01:28:51,279 --> 01:28:55,840
odor when cooked and so what they did is

2495
01:28:54,319 --> 01:28:57,439
they went back they figured out that

2496
01:28:55,840 --> 01:28:59,760
there was this one

2497
01:28:57,439 --> 01:29:01,759
substance within the brussels sprout

2498
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:04,159
right that led to that aroma so they

2499
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:05,920
went back and they started breeding all

2500
01:29:04,158 --> 01:29:07,679
these hundreds of varieties that were no

2501
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:10,719
longer in production but were still

2502
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:12,960
saved in these various banks yes they

2503
01:29:10,719 --> 01:29:15,679
grew them all out they looked for which

2504
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:18,079
ones had the least of this substance in

2505
01:29:15,679 --> 01:29:20,239
it they started breeding them together

2506
01:29:18,079 --> 01:29:21,920
and lo and behold this new improved

2507
01:29:20,238 --> 01:29:23,599
brussels sprout that doesn't have that

2508
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:26,000
funny cooked smell

2509
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:27,679
is now on your shelves in the store

2510
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,560
where does that [ __ ] exist i've never

2511
01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:32,239
seen it i guarantee you no you can you

2512
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:34,560
could type in it anyone could type it

2513
01:29:32,238 --> 01:29:36,638
into google and it'll pop up that they

2514
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:38,880
literally rebuilt brussels sprouts from

2515
01:29:36,639 --> 01:29:42,159
the ground up because they realize this

2516
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:43,600
aroma was really affecting its sales

2517
01:29:42,158 --> 01:29:47,039
and so they were able to go they were

2518
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:49,120
able to go back to the 50s 60s 70s 80s

2519
01:29:47,039 --> 01:29:50,880
and grow out hundreds of different

2520
01:29:49,119 --> 01:29:53,198
varietals of brussels

2521
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:54,880
looking for just low amounts of this one

2522
01:29:53,198 --> 01:29:56,238
compound

2523
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:57,520
and that's the type of stuff that's

2524
01:29:56,238 --> 01:29:59,759
going to happen in cannabis in the

2525
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:01,280
future and so we don't have a bunch of

2526
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:03,119
variety

2527
01:30:01,279 --> 01:30:05,439
we don't even know what we might need to

2528
01:30:03,119 --> 01:30:07,519
go hunt for later

2529
01:30:05,439 --> 01:30:08,879
yeah yeah i think that you know the fact

2530
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:10,560
that there isn't a bank like a

2531
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:12,800
centralized bank for all these strains

2532
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:14,320
and cannabis is you know that's one of

2533
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:16,079
the serious issues

2534
01:30:14,319 --> 01:30:18,399
right now because you know there's all

2535
01:30:16,079 --> 01:30:21,198
sorts of cool stuff out there being made

2536
01:30:18,399 --> 01:30:23,759
and unfortunately maybe strains being

2537
01:30:21,198 --> 01:30:25,759
lost you know and that all the time

2538
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:27,280
yeah yeah which is and you know hot

2539
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:29,360
plate and vibrates obviously making it

2540
01:30:27,279 --> 01:30:31,279
worse right because if you know if you

2541
01:30:29,359 --> 01:30:32,639
if it's infected and you you can't

2542
01:30:31,279 --> 01:30:34,479
afford tissue culture you don't want to

2543
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:36,639
go that route you know then

2544
01:30:34,479 --> 01:30:38,238
it's just kind of you know i have this

2545
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:40,719
thought while we have you on and i know

2546
01:30:38,238 --> 01:30:42,479
this isn't um tissue this isn't uh hop

2547
01:30:40,719 --> 01:30:44,158
late and related but it is somewhat

2548
01:30:42,479 --> 01:30:46,079
related to genetics and so i thought

2549
01:30:44,158 --> 01:30:48,319
maybe we could get your your opinion on

2550
01:30:46,079 --> 01:30:50,319
it and you can say i i know or i don't

2551
01:30:48,319 --> 01:30:52,079
know but there's been some there's been

2552
01:30:50,319 --> 01:30:53,119
some literature coming out where it used

2553
01:30:52,079 --> 01:30:55,840
to be

2554
01:30:53,119 --> 01:30:57,359
um for best practices for a long time

2555
01:30:55,840 --> 01:31:00,000
was when you were cloning and you were

2556
01:30:57,359 --> 01:31:02,960
taking new mother stock that you always

2557
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:05,600
went for the fast growing tops

2558
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:07,198
the tips of the plants all that and now

2559
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:08,480
there's been some research it seems like

2560
01:31:07,198 --> 01:31:10,799
that's been coming out that's been

2561
01:31:08,479 --> 01:31:13,279
talking about how the top of the plant

2562
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:15,039
might actually have more like

2563
01:31:13,279 --> 01:31:17,679
more mutations

2564
01:31:15,039 --> 01:31:20,079
and it would be safer to keep that plant

2565
01:31:17,679 --> 01:31:22,800
there would be less mutations lower down

2566
01:31:20,079 --> 01:31:24,960
on the plant on the lesser growth that

2567
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:27,920
as newer growth happens there's a

2568
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:30,880
greater chance of something odd

2569
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:33,279
right and for us for a long time you

2570
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:34,639
always went for the healthiest newest

2571
01:31:33,279 --> 01:31:36,719
growing tips

2572
01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:38,960
we called it the cult of our cut yeah

2573
01:31:36,719 --> 01:31:40,480
yeah and then and now it seems like

2574
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:42,800
there's been some evidence coming out

2575
01:31:40,479 --> 01:31:44,959
that maybe that's mistaken

2576
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:47,440
and that it might be safer to take new

2577
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:49,679
moms and new new genetic material from

2578
01:31:47,439 --> 01:31:51,439
the lower parts of the plant that have

2579
01:31:49,679 --> 01:31:53,119
less of a likelihood of some kind of

2580
01:31:51,439 --> 01:31:54,719
mutation happening

2581
01:31:53,119 --> 01:31:57,039
um is that something you're familiar

2582
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:58,639
with and seen and you could speak on or

2583
01:31:57,039 --> 01:32:01,279
no

2584
01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:02,800
so i mean i so i've read you know some

2585
01:32:01,279 --> 01:32:05,840
of the literature i'm not going to speak

2586
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:08,079
with extreme confidence sure um i don't

2587
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:10,000
know that that body of literature as

2588
01:32:08,079 --> 01:32:12,880
well um

2589
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:15,359
i do know that you know so when you're

2590
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:18,239
cutting plants clonal wise you're taking

2591
01:32:15,359 --> 01:32:20,559
somatic tissue so somatic tissue is

2592
01:32:18,238 --> 01:32:22,000
everything that isn't the germline um

2593
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:24,880
and it the

2594
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:27,119
the the genome of somatic tissue is not

2595
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:29,600
protected in the same way

2596
01:32:27,119 --> 01:32:31,679
as um if you were to go through seed

2597
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:32,880
right because yeah germline is is really

2598
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:35,119
protected

2599
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:38,159
um and so those tissues are going to

2600
01:32:35,119 --> 01:32:41,119
accumulate more mutations and

2601
01:32:38,158 --> 01:32:43,359
when you're cloning a mom you're not

2602
01:32:41,119 --> 01:32:45,920
getting a new plant you're you're

2603
01:32:43,359 --> 01:32:47,679
actually have the same old plant you

2604
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:49,679
know with the same somatic tissue and

2605
01:32:47,679 --> 01:32:52,840
you're just continuing to propagate this

2606
01:32:49,679 --> 01:32:55,920
extremely old muscle right yeah um and

2607
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:57,920
so that those somatic mutations over

2608
01:32:55,920 --> 01:33:00,719
time will accumulate

2609
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:02,800
um i you know the the people if you're

2610
01:33:00,719 --> 01:33:07,039
trying to take the apical meristem area

2611
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:09,600
that area contains new stem cells and so

2612
01:33:07,039 --> 01:33:11,840
uh beyond somatic mutation beyond actual

2613
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:14,079
changes in the base pairs you also have

2614
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:16,480
these things called epigenetic changes

2615
01:33:14,079 --> 01:33:20,079
which um they're like edits if you think

2616
01:33:16,479 --> 01:33:22,319
of of the dna sequence as as letters and

2617
01:33:20,079 --> 01:33:24,399
words um epigenetics is like

2618
01:33:22,319 --> 01:33:26,158
highlighting in a capital letter maybe

2619
01:33:24,399 --> 01:33:29,039
you scratch out a word

2620
01:33:26,158 --> 01:33:31,839
so it's stuff overlaid on top

2621
01:33:29,039 --> 01:33:34,319
so a lot of those epigenetic changes are

2622
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:37,520
are reset in stem cells especially the

2623
01:33:34,319 --> 01:33:38,960
freshly made ones and so you can get if

2624
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:41,600
you grab that top

2625
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:43,920
part or you use those stem cells you can

2626
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:46,079
reinvigorate the plant

2627
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:48,560
um whether or not there's a big

2628
01:33:46,079 --> 01:33:50,399
difference in somatic mutations like

2629
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:52,080
point mutations in the dna like the

2630
01:33:50,399 --> 01:33:53,920
changes of the letters

2631
01:33:52,079 --> 01:33:56,399
dramatic enough to make a difference in

2632
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:57,520
the vigor from the top to the bottom i

2633
01:33:56,399 --> 01:33:58,638
don't know

2634
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:00,400
if there's

2635
01:33:58,639 --> 01:34:02,079
and what kind of research there is

2636
01:34:00,399 --> 01:34:03,839
around that

2637
01:34:02,079 --> 01:34:06,238
the ideal of course would be to take a

2638
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:09,039
really healthy vigorous

2639
01:34:06,238 --> 01:34:11,839
mom plant and preserve that plant

2640
01:34:09,039 --> 01:34:14,479
um you know in tissue culture and stasis

2641
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:16,960
yeah and then you you bring out you take

2642
01:34:14,479 --> 01:34:19,039
the cuts and you bring it out and grow

2643
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:20,800
it up and then what you know take your

2644
01:34:19,039 --> 01:34:22,639
clones or whatever and then toss that

2645
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:24,639
and always go back to that plant in

2646
01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:27,119
stasis because you're gonna have less

2647
01:34:24,639 --> 01:34:29,440
somatic mutations um if it's just kind

2648
01:34:27,119 --> 01:34:32,000
of hanging out at four degrees yeah

2649
01:34:29,439 --> 01:34:34,879
growing that makes sense super ideal

2650
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:37,760
maybe i could get one more non-viroid

2651
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:38,800
question in and see if if what you think

2652
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:41,039
so

2653
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:42,719
in in relation to that i mean keeping

2654
01:34:41,039 --> 01:34:45,039
moms healthy and stuff like that there's

2655
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:48,399
a lot of talk in our community about oh

2656
01:34:45,039 --> 01:34:51,039
the plant got tired or it got cloned too

2657
01:34:48,399 --> 01:34:53,119
much and it suffered genetic drift

2658
01:34:51,039 --> 01:34:55,519
or things of that nature

2659
01:34:53,119 --> 01:34:57,279
matt and i both have i mean i i have a

2660
01:34:55,520 --> 01:35:00,960
number of things that at this point are

2661
01:34:57,279 --> 01:35:03,439
you know 20 15 20 25 even 30 years old

2662
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:04,960
right so pretty ancient in cannabis

2663
01:35:03,439 --> 01:35:07,519
terms right

2664
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:10,158
um do you feel that that kind of like

2665
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:12,080
when you're taking clones

2666
01:35:10,158 --> 01:35:14,559
do you think that if a plant starts to

2667
01:35:12,079 --> 01:35:16,479
not perform the way you want to it's

2668
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:18,800
because there's some mutations that

2669
01:35:16,479 --> 01:35:21,359
happened or there was some of what you

2670
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:23,679
just spoke about do you believe in it

2671
01:35:21,359 --> 01:35:26,880
and do in the genetics itself you know

2672
01:35:23,679 --> 01:35:28,880
some some um undesirable changes may

2673
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:30,239
have happened do you think plants get

2674
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:32,960
old

2675
01:35:30,238 --> 01:35:34,959
do you think they get tired

2676
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:37,279
if you will i realize that's that's a

2677
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:40,000
bro term but it's thrown around

2678
01:35:37,279 --> 01:35:42,079
enormously like the plants just tired

2679
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,760
the plant got genetic drift you didn't

2680
01:35:42,079 --> 01:35:45,760
clone off it when it was healthy enough

2681
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:48,639
and you ruined it forever it's not the

2682
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:49,840
same as it was it's not like it was five

2683
01:35:48,639 --> 01:35:52,480
years ago

2684
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:54,239
um and so if you could talk a little bit

2685
01:35:52,479 --> 01:35:56,158
if that's within your knowledge base on

2686
01:35:54,238 --> 01:35:57,919
what you think about that kind of thing

2687
01:35:56,158 --> 01:35:58,638
that would be very helpful for people as

2688
01:35:57,920 --> 01:36:01,520
well

2689
01:35:58,639 --> 01:36:04,000
because it's thrown around enormously

2690
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:06,400
yes yes so um

2691
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:09,119
there will be somatic mutations that

2692
01:36:06,399 --> 01:36:11,519
happen now this is not

2693
01:36:09,119 --> 01:36:13,198
going to be happening on a massive scale

2694
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:15,440
all right so it's

2695
01:36:13,198 --> 01:36:16,960
i mean there there can be mutations here

2696
01:36:15,439 --> 01:36:18,799
and there but it's not like it's going

2697
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:21,439
to take a completely healthy plant and

2698
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:22,880
turn it into a total diet you know

2699
01:36:21,439 --> 01:36:24,399
really fast

2700
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:25,760
um

2701
01:36:24,399 --> 01:36:28,000
i've heard a lot of people say things

2702
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:30,560
like that too like it stopped taking up

2703
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:32,399
nutrients or you know like somehow the

2704
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:34,080
plant randomly decided i'm just not

2705
01:36:32,399 --> 01:36:35,119
gonna eat anymore whatever

2706
01:36:34,079 --> 01:36:37,439
um

2707
01:36:35,119 --> 01:36:39,439
i think a lot of times the decline has

2708
01:36:37,439 --> 01:36:41,439
to do with pathogens

2709
01:36:39,439 --> 01:36:43,198
that you don't know we're in there if

2710
01:36:41,439 --> 01:36:45,678
you're if you're experiencing a serious

2711
01:36:43,198 --> 01:36:47,919
decline i think it's much more likely to

2712
01:36:45,679 --> 01:36:49,279
be some type of pathogen than it is to

2713
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:52,000
be

2714
01:36:49,279 --> 01:36:53,599
you know completely suicidal plant yeah

2715
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:55,359
exactly

2716
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:57,440
it's hard to come across that i'm sure

2717
01:36:55,359 --> 01:36:59,198
well i mean for us it's like you know

2718
01:36:57,439 --> 01:37:03,118
for humans right

2719
01:36:59,198 --> 01:37:05,359
we have a you know we have a lifespan

2720
01:37:03,118 --> 01:37:07,359
you know so if you if i obviously you

2721
01:37:05,359 --> 01:37:08,960
can't clone a person but you know you

2722
01:37:07,359 --> 01:37:10,799
clone a teenager and they're they're

2723
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:12,079
very healthy you clone an 80 year old

2724
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:14,159
and they're not that healthy and i

2725
01:37:12,079 --> 01:37:15,039
realize it's not the same thing at all

2726
01:37:14,158 --> 01:37:17,839
but

2727
01:37:15,039 --> 01:37:20,479
i just wonder like you know these plants

2728
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:21,920
are theoretically in nature they survive

2729
01:37:20,479 --> 01:37:24,319
a season

2730
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:27,199
yeah and i have clones i have clones

2731
01:37:24,319 --> 01:37:30,399
that were are from the early 90s

2732
01:37:27,198 --> 01:37:32,000
and so they've survived you know 32

2733
01:37:30,399 --> 01:37:34,719
seasons

2734
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:37,279
right yes yeah i mean mutations will

2735
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:39,039
accumulate in you know older somatic

2736
01:37:37,279 --> 01:37:40,719
tissue and

2737
01:37:39,039 --> 01:37:42,158
you know just like a person over time

2738
01:37:40,719 --> 01:37:44,239
those mutations

2739
01:37:42,158 --> 01:37:47,519
it's possible that could lead to you

2740
01:37:44,238 --> 01:37:49,919
know decreased vigor um i think it kind

2741
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:51,920
of depends on what you're seeing usually

2742
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:53,920
when i when i hear people talk about it

2743
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:55,760
it's like it was fine

2744
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:56,719
last year and now this year it looks

2745
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:59,360
like hell

2746
01:37:56,719 --> 01:38:01,679
and i'm like well that's not that time

2747
01:37:59,359 --> 01:38:03,599
frame doesn't fit you know slow

2748
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:05,359
mutations accumulating the plant that

2749
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:07,679
sounds like a pathogen

2750
01:38:05,359 --> 01:38:11,118
um but do i mean will a plant eventually

2751
01:38:07,679 --> 01:38:13,520
get old you know and go you know into

2752
01:38:11,118 --> 01:38:14,559
having issues it sounds reasonable to me

2753
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:16,560
but again

2754
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:18,320
i don't know any literature on that so

2755
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:19,119
right now

2756
01:38:18,319 --> 01:38:22,079
you know

2757
01:38:19,118 --> 01:38:24,079
my thoughts not not data no that's i

2758
01:38:22,079 --> 01:38:26,479
mean that's you know we're with this

2759
01:38:24,079 --> 01:38:28,559
this podcast is about thoughts you know

2760
01:38:26,479 --> 01:38:31,039
and we always try you know when we're

2761
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:32,880
talking about history um because most of

2762
01:38:31,039 --> 01:38:34,800
cannabis history is oral

2763
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:35,920
we always try to be like this is what we

2764
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:38,320
know

2765
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:40,158
these are our educated guesses

2766
01:38:38,319 --> 01:38:43,039
this is what we're pretty sure of but

2767
01:38:40,158 --> 01:38:45,118
there's disagreement amongst people and

2768
01:38:43,039 --> 01:38:46,719
it's hard to say what's specific so this

2769
01:38:45,118 --> 01:38:48,079
is like right in our wheelhouse of what

2770
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:49,679
we deal with

2771
01:38:48,079 --> 01:38:52,238
it really is

2772
01:38:49,679 --> 01:38:54,399
you know it it it is because

2773
01:38:52,238 --> 01:38:56,079
huh the the general

2774
01:38:54,399 --> 01:38:58,079
consensus when it comes to cannabis

2775
01:38:56,079 --> 01:39:01,118
whether we're talking about like i said

2776
01:38:58,079 --> 01:39:03,118
reversals and and and sexual identity

2777
01:39:01,118 --> 01:39:06,319
with cannabis or what have you the

2778
01:39:03,118 --> 01:39:07,920
answer is just it varies so heavily it

2779
01:39:06,319 --> 01:39:09,519
varies so heavily and there just isn't

2780
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:11,359
enough research yet and i think that's

2781
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:13,199
one thing that

2782
01:39:11,359 --> 01:39:14,960
anybody who who delves into the data

2783
01:39:13,198 --> 01:39:15,919
just runs into constantly time and time

2784
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:18,399
again

2785
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:20,880
yes there's definitely a lot of unknowns

2786
01:39:18,399 --> 01:39:22,079
and very few knowns out there right um

2787
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:23,760
so you know

2788
01:39:22,079 --> 01:39:25,840
we've been talking for a long time i

2789
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:27,760
think mostly we got our questions

2790
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:29,520
answered do you feel that way too matt

2791
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:32,719
yeah yeah yeah i do

2792
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:34,639
it's amazing maybe maybe you could plug

2793
01:39:32,719 --> 01:39:36,880
you know i noticed a number of times you

2794
01:39:34,639 --> 01:39:38,800
mentioned you have some sops or you have

2795
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:41,279
some best practices available on your

2796
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:43,279
website that people could go reference

2797
01:39:41,279 --> 01:39:45,599
um maybe you could talk a little bit

2798
01:39:43,279 --> 01:39:48,238
just for a second about what you guys do

2799
01:39:45,600 --> 01:39:50,719
uh what you have available for people uh

2800
01:39:48,238 --> 01:39:51,839
resource wise testing wise that type of

2801
01:39:50,719 --> 01:39:54,000
thing so

2802
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:56,319
feel free for a minute to just sort of

2803
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:59,600
lay into all that if you will

2804
01:39:56,319 --> 01:40:01,840
yes absolutely um yeah so you know we we

2805
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:03,840
definitely do testing um hop weight and

2806
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:07,600
viroid obviously that's the thing that's

2807
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:09,440
tested the most often we also offer

2808
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:12,719
a panel of

2809
01:40:09,439 --> 01:40:16,319
testing for pythium as well as fusarium

2810
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:19,359
we have a panel of viruses and even a

2811
01:40:16,319 --> 01:40:22,880
viroid hop stunt viroid which

2812
01:40:19,359 --> 01:40:26,559
hasn't been shown to be in cannabis yet

2813
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:29,039
but it has a really high uh large host

2814
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:31,119
range and it has some pretty damaging

2815
01:40:29,039 --> 01:40:33,279
effects and hops and so

2816
01:40:31,118 --> 01:40:34,799
um you know we're kind of screening

2817
01:40:33,279 --> 01:40:37,439
things all the time to make sure that

2818
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:38,480
we're kind of staying on top of stuff

2819
01:40:37,439 --> 01:40:40,960
um

2820
01:40:38,479 --> 01:40:43,359
among the stuff that i am the most

2821
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:45,118
excited about that was it's hoping

2822
01:40:43,359 --> 01:40:46,319
hoping to come out the beginning of next

2823
01:40:45,118 --> 01:40:48,719
year is

2824
01:40:46,319 --> 01:40:51,279
our on-site testing platform

2825
01:40:48,719 --> 01:40:53,198
um so this is one of the ways that we're

2826
01:40:51,279 --> 01:40:56,000
trying to help the industry bring the

2827
01:40:53,198 --> 01:40:58,079
cost of doing a lot of routine testing

2828
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,198
down into a range where people can

2829
01:40:58,079 --> 01:41:01,679
afford it

2830
01:40:59,198 --> 01:41:04,000
um and so you know we've been working

2831
01:41:01,679 --> 01:41:06,639
really hard at

2832
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:09,520
evolving a platform that we created to

2833
01:41:06,639 --> 01:41:11,359
test for covid in human saliva

2834
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:13,360
and evolving that into the cannabis

2835
01:41:11,359 --> 01:41:15,599
industry starting with testing for

2836
01:41:13,359 --> 01:41:17,039
hotplate and thyroid

2837
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:19,520
and the thing that i'm most excited

2838
01:41:17,039 --> 01:41:22,479
about it is that we we sat down with the

2839
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:25,600
chemistry that currently existed

2840
01:41:22,479 --> 01:41:27,599
isothermal amplification or lamp i think

2841
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:29,600
a lot of people have heard of that

2842
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:30,880
when we started addressing some of the

2843
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:33,119
um

2844
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:35,600
weaknesses of that technology the false

2845
01:41:33,118 --> 01:41:37,839
positive rate the low sensitivity the

2846
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:40,960
you know the lack of internal control

2847
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:43,920
and um we were able to improve that

2848
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:46,158
technology quite a lot so we were able

2849
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:47,679
to bring the sensitivity

2850
01:41:46,158 --> 01:41:50,399
to the point where you should be able to

2851
01:41:47,679 --> 01:41:54,239
detect about 95 of the reactions that

2852
01:41:50,399 --> 01:41:55,920
are found by a qpcr in the lab um and

2853
01:41:54,238 --> 01:41:57,919
the test can be judged you know it's a

2854
01:41:55,920 --> 01:42:00,000
color change test but there is an

2855
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:02,158
internal control so you can tell if

2856
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:04,479
you've done the test incorrectly or if

2857
01:42:02,158 --> 01:42:06,638
your plant is negative

2858
01:42:04,479 --> 01:42:09,678
and it also comes with

2859
01:42:06,639 --> 01:42:11,440
an analysis software so

2860
01:42:09,679 --> 01:42:14,239
if you want to do it high throughput if

2861
01:42:11,439 --> 01:42:16,559
you'd like to do you know 96 plants at a

2862
01:42:14,238 --> 01:42:18,559
time that's totally possible and it'll

2863
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:21,360
give you a digital readout

2864
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:23,840
um and so you know we're really excited

2865
01:42:21,359 --> 01:42:26,158
about bringing this out because

2866
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:28,319
we've worked really hard at making this

2867
01:42:26,158 --> 01:42:30,319
a really good test and a really good

2868
01:42:28,319 --> 01:42:32,719
tool and i think

2869
01:42:30,319 --> 01:42:34,238
this is going to help people do the type

2870
01:42:32,719 --> 01:42:35,920
of testing that they're going to need to

2871
01:42:34,238 --> 01:42:39,279
do to really

2872
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:40,880
start yeah knock it thing down

2873
01:42:39,279 --> 01:42:43,599
okay

2874
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:46,400
and then your is your website just uh is

2875
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:48,079
it toomeygenetics.com is it genomics

2876
01:42:46,399 --> 01:42:50,399
genomics yes yes

2877
01:42:48,079 --> 01:42:53,039
to me genomics.com yeah and hooked on

2878
01:42:50,399 --> 01:42:55,759
phonics never came to my house

2879
01:42:53,039 --> 01:42:56,800
i mangled at times

2880
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:58,719
you know

2881
01:42:56,800 --> 01:43:00,079
i have a little twang but but so that

2882
01:42:58,719 --> 01:43:02,000
that's where people could go to read

2883
01:43:00,079 --> 01:43:04,559
about the sops that you mentioned and

2884
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:06,399
some of the some of the data and stuff

2885
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:08,320
some of what we know

2886
01:43:06,399 --> 01:43:10,799
there's an easy to reference area on

2887
01:43:08,319 --> 01:43:12,719
that where you can learn yes and we are

2888
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:14,719
constantly putting up new content and we

2889
01:43:12,719 --> 01:43:16,880
try to let people know in instagram when

2890
01:43:14,719 --> 01:43:19,520
we're putting new stuff up um

2891
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:21,679
and there's a lot of i'm so

2892
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:24,719
i've just been busy making content and

2893
01:43:21,679 --> 01:43:26,800
doing research to help people out so um

2894
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:28,158
you know what we're going to have

2895
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:30,400
some stuff about all the different

2896
01:43:28,158 --> 01:43:33,279
viruses and viroids that are known in

2897
01:43:30,399 --> 01:43:35,198
cannabis the ones that aren't known what

2898
01:43:33,279 --> 01:43:37,759
you know what's the evidence they exist

2899
01:43:35,198 --> 01:43:40,479
which should you worry about which not

2900
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:41,440
a lot of a lot of content like that so

2901
01:43:40,479 --> 01:43:42,718
um

2902
01:43:41,439 --> 01:43:45,279
it's and it's all going up on the

2903
01:43:42,719 --> 01:43:47,359
website uh um just to help people figure

2904
01:43:45,279 --> 01:43:48,880
out like to navigate all of this because

2905
01:43:47,359 --> 01:43:51,279
there's so much contradictory

2906
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:53,760
information that it's it's really

2907
01:43:51,279 --> 01:43:55,198
difficult for someone to figure out what

2908
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:57,119
they're supposed to do and what they

2909
01:43:55,198 --> 01:43:59,039
should be worried about and what's

2910
01:43:57,118 --> 01:44:00,399
actually proven and what what is

2911
01:43:59,039 --> 01:44:01,760
somebody just saying something really

2912
01:44:00,399 --> 01:44:03,279
confidently even though they don't

2913
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:05,039
actually know

2914
01:44:03,279 --> 01:44:08,158
we hear that a lot

2915
01:44:05,039 --> 01:44:11,039
yeah like i said for this episode the

2916
01:44:08,158 --> 01:44:13,599
amount of people that told me exactly

2917
01:44:11,039 --> 01:44:14,399
precisely how transmissible

2918
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:18,239
this

2919
01:44:14,399 --> 01:44:20,399
hplv is in cannabis seeds was astounding

2920
01:44:18,238 --> 01:44:23,118
how many people were sure you know what

2921
01:44:20,399 --> 01:44:24,638
i mean like yeah and so this this whole

2922
01:44:23,118 --> 01:44:26,799
thing is very helpful and we hope

2923
01:44:24,639 --> 01:44:29,440
anything else that you guys work on

2924
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:31,039
whether it's it's it's these new um

2925
01:44:29,439 --> 01:44:32,559
different videos that you put out or

2926
01:44:31,039 --> 01:44:34,880
whatnot you'll bring it back to us and

2927
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:37,440
we can have you on again to talk about

2928
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:39,118
more and any new findings with hplv or

2929
01:44:37,439 --> 01:44:40,879
anything anything you think the campus

2930
01:44:39,118 --> 01:44:42,479
community should know about or be aware

2931
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:43,679
of like this because this is so

2932
01:44:42,479 --> 01:44:45,919
important

2933
01:44:43,679 --> 01:44:47,679
yes absolutely yeah and we are like i

2934
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:49,679
said instigating research studies in

2935
01:44:47,679 --> 01:44:50,800
collaboration with texas a m and i'm

2936
01:44:49,679 --> 01:44:53,600
hoping that that's really going to

2937
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:55,920
accelerate you know good science and

2938
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:58,079
real data and and as soon as we find it

2939
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:59,359
i'd love to share with the community

2940
01:44:58,079 --> 01:45:02,399
because i think that's what's really

2941
01:44:59,359 --> 01:45:05,839
needed here is quality research and a

2942
01:45:02,399 --> 01:45:07,359
lot of education so people understand

2943
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:08,880
maybe i could throw this out there just

2944
01:45:07,359 --> 01:45:10,880
real quick and this and then we could

2945
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:13,118
end it on that but you just mentioned

2946
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:17,760
texas a m right uh

2947
01:45:13,118 --> 01:45:19,679
texas is not cannabis friendly yet um so

2948
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:21,840
you know what do you like you know what

2949
01:45:19,679 --> 01:45:23,760
do you think about like obviously like

2950
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:25,520
bringing to bear some of these colleges

2951
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:26,880
and some of these these departments and

2952
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:28,719
stuff like that that have been working

2953
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:30,400
in agriculture and other areas for a

2954
01:45:28,719 --> 01:45:32,399
long time is going to be part of the

2955
01:45:30,399 --> 01:45:33,279
fabric of our new world

2956
01:45:32,399 --> 01:45:36,238
um

2957
01:45:33,279 --> 01:45:38,000
how do they work on that in texas

2958
01:45:36,238 --> 01:45:39,678
uh do they have to get special like

2959
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:42,399
federal permission or something like

2960
01:45:39,679 --> 01:45:43,760
that like texas law doesn't allow any i

2961
01:45:42,399 --> 01:45:45,039
mean it's not california it's not

2962
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:47,600
anywhere where they have any kind of

2963
01:45:45,039 --> 01:45:50,000
medical or recreational program either

2964
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:52,159
um it's one of the states that's

2965
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:54,880
anti-still

2966
01:45:52,158 --> 01:45:56,799
so um in texas a m they work on hemp

2967
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:58,800
varieties um

2968
01:45:56,800 --> 01:46:00,880
the you know the the

2969
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:03,760
the difference between a hemp variety

2970
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:06,480
and you know a thc containing variety is

2971
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:07,920
the amount of thc the plant has right

2972
01:46:06,479 --> 01:46:09,359
so because it's in the farm bill they

2973
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:10,960
can work on it

2974
01:46:09,359 --> 01:46:12,479
they can work they can test all that

2975
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:14,719
stuff via the hemp

2976
01:46:12,479 --> 01:46:17,359
and just get around the drug cultiva

2977
01:46:14,719 --> 01:46:19,439
drug cultivar aspect or whatever

2978
01:46:17,359 --> 01:46:21,039
yes yeah and you know um there are

2979
01:46:19,439 --> 01:46:23,919
universities like colorado state

2980
01:46:21,039 --> 01:46:26,399
university here in colorado is doing

2981
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:28,158
research um and they actually uh put out

2982
01:46:26,399 --> 01:46:30,719
a paper where they did next generation

2983
01:46:28,158 --> 01:46:32,719
sequencing on cannabis looking

2984
01:46:30,719 --> 01:46:35,359
specifically for what pathogens are

2985
01:46:32,719 --> 01:46:37,198
actually there yeah and so there are

2986
01:46:35,359 --> 01:46:38,799
universities that are starting to jump

2987
01:46:37,198 --> 01:46:41,919
in the ring too

2988
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:44,800
and do research and i i really think

2989
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:47,199
that that's where the answer is is

2990
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:50,480
you know collaborations between you know

2991
01:46:47,198 --> 01:46:52,559
academia and industry and open sharing

2992
01:46:50,479 --> 01:46:54,718
of information

2993
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:56,960
so that everybody can benefit from

2994
01:46:54,719 --> 01:46:59,600
what's being learned um both industry

2995
01:46:56,960 --> 01:47:02,239
research and academia research the one

2996
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:03,760
biggest bar between academia that i

2997
01:47:02,238 --> 01:47:05,759
found and

2998
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:08,320
and maybe maybe it's a bar between

2999
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:10,079
academia the people who have the money

3000
01:47:08,319 --> 01:47:12,960
and the actual cannabis people who've

3001
01:47:10,079 --> 01:47:15,118
been doing it you know for decades

3002
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:16,880
is that not often to the people with the

3003
01:47:15,118 --> 01:47:19,279
money or the people with the

3004
01:47:16,880 --> 01:47:21,279
academia ever encounter the people

3005
01:47:19,279 --> 01:47:22,238
behind the scenes that are doing that

3006
01:47:21,279 --> 01:47:23,439
are the people that have these

3007
01:47:22,238 --> 01:47:25,839
collections that have been doing the

3008
01:47:23,439 --> 01:47:27,039
real research and taking real data

3009
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:28,960
trying to keep it as straight as they

3010
01:47:27,039 --> 01:47:31,118
can not often do any of these people

3011
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:33,600
ever meet in the same realm so i'm

3012
01:47:31,118 --> 01:47:36,399
really hoping that somehow that's that a

3013
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:38,960
bridge is is reached between academia

3014
01:47:36,399 --> 01:47:42,000
and the what they would probably term

3015
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:43,198
black market botanists the observational

3016
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,880
community

3017
01:47:43,198 --> 01:47:46,960
right yes

3018
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:49,199
the observational community yeah that's

3019
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:50,639
a better word for it yes and that you

3020
01:47:49,198 --> 01:47:53,519
know what that's one of the major

3021
01:47:50,639 --> 01:47:55,359
missions of our company is um i was an

3022
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:56,880
academic scientist my husband was an

3023
01:47:55,359 --> 01:47:58,238
academic scientist

3024
01:47:56,880 --> 01:48:00,719
half the scientists on our team are

3025
01:47:58,238 --> 01:48:03,359
academic scientists and what we really

3026
01:48:00,719 --> 01:48:06,158
want to do is bridge that gap and bring

3027
01:48:03,359 --> 01:48:07,839
academia and what's going on

3028
01:48:06,158 --> 01:48:10,079
you know all the knowledge in the canvas

3029
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:12,800
industry and bring that all together and

3030
01:48:10,079 --> 01:48:15,359
really get some some solid data from i

3031
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:17,520
like the testing that you guys are doing

3032
01:48:15,359 --> 01:48:19,759
yeah i have issues i have issues with

3033
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:21,760
like the terpene and thc testing because

3034
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:24,159
i think it's so inaccurate and i think

3035
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:25,760
it's led people to assume a bunch of

3036
01:48:24,158 --> 01:48:27,759
stuff that's not true

3037
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:30,079
um you know and i don't think we know

3038
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:32,639
yet like why plants why those why

3039
01:48:30,079 --> 01:48:34,800
cannabis plants make us high

3040
01:48:32,639 --> 01:48:36,960
right like and or why the different

3041
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:38,639
highs happen like you can't look at a

3042
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:41,520
test and be like oh this is going to

3043
01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:43,760
give me a racy crawl out of my skin i'm

3044
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:45,760
nervous feeling versus like i want

3045
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:47,840
potato chips and i'm giggly and i'm warm

3046
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:50,320
and happy and comfortable feeling

3047
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:52,800
right right and then you know i do we do

3048
01:48:50,319 --> 01:48:54,719
testing all the time and it's like i uh

3049
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:56,560
you know they say that there's like 150

3050
01:48:54,719 --> 01:48:58,480
different terpenes and cannabinoids that

3051
01:48:56,560 --> 01:49:00,400
they've discovered and they test for

3052
01:48:58,479 --> 01:49:02,399
like 30.

3053
01:49:00,399 --> 01:49:04,079
yes

3054
01:49:02,399 --> 01:49:06,559
there's i think there's a really big

3055
01:49:04,079 --> 01:49:08,158
fixation right now on the level of thc

3056
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:09,280
and everybody wants the highest level

3057
01:49:08,158 --> 01:49:11,599
possible

3058
01:49:09,279 --> 01:49:13,279
but i don't you know

3059
01:49:11,600 --> 01:49:15,119
based on personal experience now we're

3060
01:49:13,279 --> 01:49:17,039
not talking about data at all yeah yeah

3061
01:49:15,118 --> 01:49:18,799
um just because it has a really high

3062
01:49:17,039 --> 01:49:20,238
level of thc does not mean that it's

3063
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:22,079
going to give you you know give the

3064
01:49:20,238 --> 01:49:24,158
consumer the feeling that they were

3065
01:49:22,079 --> 01:49:26,000
going for you know and they're

3066
01:49:24,158 --> 01:49:28,559
much more complicated

3067
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:30,800
than that and i think we just don't know

3068
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:32,480
right now how all that stuff interacts

3069
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:34,880
with the human body and with it with

3070
01:49:32,479 --> 01:49:36,638
each chemical with each other you know

3071
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:38,560
maybe you know this from academia but i

3072
01:49:36,639 --> 01:49:41,199
bet a lot of people don't know this

3073
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:43,119
where because cannabis was is a schedule

3074
01:49:41,198 --> 01:49:46,559
one substance right

3075
01:49:43,118 --> 01:49:48,719
you needed the dea's permission um to

3076
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:50,719
test for it right and so during the war

3077
01:49:48,719 --> 01:49:52,880
on drugs for a long time

3078
01:49:50,719 --> 01:49:54,639
um if i if i was a scientist then i went

3079
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:56,480
to the dea and i was like i want to see

3080
01:49:54,639 --> 01:49:58,319
if cannabis lowers my blood pressure and

3081
01:49:56,479 --> 01:49:59,919
makes me a happier person

3082
01:49:58,319 --> 01:50:02,158
they would deny me

3083
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:03,920
and if you went and said hey i want to

3084
01:50:02,158 --> 01:50:06,559
test and see if cannabis makes me more

3085
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:08,719
violent more prone to illegal acts and

3086
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:11,840
and raises my blood pressure they would

3087
01:50:08,719 --> 01:50:14,158
allow it so what's happened is we have

3088
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:16,000
like 40 or 50 years of cannabis testing

3089
01:50:14,158 --> 01:50:17,279
looking for negative correlations and

3090
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:20,158
effects

3091
01:50:17,279 --> 01:50:24,000
and barely any looking at the actual

3092
01:50:20,158 --> 01:50:26,559
effects or if there could be positives

3093
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:29,279
yeah yeah there's there's very limited

3094
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:30,880
research and um you know i think one of

3095
01:50:29,279 --> 01:50:33,039
the most frustrating things and i was

3096
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:35,118
actually discussing this

3097
01:50:33,039 --> 01:50:36,719
with a lawyer at a cannabis conference

3098
01:50:35,118 --> 01:50:38,319
is that to get something off the

3099
01:50:36,719 --> 01:50:40,319
schedule one list you have to do

3100
01:50:38,319 --> 01:50:42,319
research to prove that it's not

3101
01:50:40,319 --> 01:50:44,719
dangerous but you're not allowed to do

3102
01:50:42,319 --> 01:50:46,559
research on things on the schedule one

3103
01:50:44,719 --> 01:50:49,840
list so you're you're caught in the

3104
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:52,000
catch-22 yeah exactly the dea was able

3105
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:53,679
to prevent anything from messing with

3106
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,479
their narrative

3107
01:50:53,679 --> 01:50:56,560
by

3108
01:50:54,479 --> 01:50:58,559
them having a bottleneck and you had to

3109
01:50:56,560 --> 01:51:00,960
get their permission to actually have

3110
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:02,080
cannabis to test with

3111
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:04,560
yeah

3112
01:51:02,079 --> 01:51:05,359
yeah no i i mean and i am really hoping

3113
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:07,119
that

3114
01:51:05,359 --> 01:51:09,839
this is going to change because there

3115
01:51:07,118 --> 01:51:12,079
there needs to be so much research and

3116
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:13,920
you know from a virology pathogen

3117
01:51:12,079 --> 01:51:17,519
biology perspective

3118
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:19,279
having a reservoir of pathogens in a

3119
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:21,360
plant where we're not doing any research

3120
01:51:19,279 --> 01:51:23,679
we're not monitoring it that's dangerous

3121
01:51:21,359 --> 01:51:25,679
for all of agriculture sure

3122
01:51:23,679 --> 01:51:27,199
perspective of of what you think about

3123
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:28,800
the legality

3124
01:51:27,198 --> 01:51:31,279
if we're not doing research on it then

3125
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:33,039
everything is is threatened by it

3126
01:51:31,279 --> 01:51:34,639
especially with legality they want to

3127
01:51:33,039 --> 01:51:36,639
take all the cannabis out of the hills

3128
01:51:34,639 --> 01:51:38,000
and mountains where it thrived

3129
01:51:36,639 --> 01:51:39,840
and they want to bring it down to the

3130
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:41,439
valleys and the ag land

3131
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:42,639
and next to a lot of other kinds of

3132
01:51:41,439 --> 01:51:45,039
crops

3133
01:51:42,639 --> 01:51:46,719
correct yeah so i mean we need research

3134
01:51:45,039 --> 01:51:48,960
we need to understand what pathogens are

3135
01:51:46,719 --> 01:51:51,279
there which ones are coming you know and

3136
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:53,118
how to keep you know all of agriculture

3137
01:51:51,279 --> 01:51:54,719
safe like how they do with all the other

3138
01:51:53,118 --> 01:51:57,198
crops yeah

3139
01:51:54,719 --> 01:51:58,960
yeah well we're about two hours here

3140
01:51:57,198 --> 01:52:01,279
which is normally when we cut it i don't

3141
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:02,880
know we i want to thank you so much for

3142
01:52:01,279 --> 01:52:05,439
coming on and chatting it was really

3143
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:07,199
engaging uh and it cleared up a lot of

3144
01:52:05,439 --> 01:52:09,519
stuff i wrote down a lot of questions

3145
01:52:07,198 --> 01:52:10,638
and uh it's good to hear the state of

3146
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:12,639
where we are

3147
01:52:10,639 --> 01:52:14,639
you know uh where where we know we are

3148
01:52:12,639 --> 01:52:17,359
and where we were worried about and all

3149
01:52:14,639 --> 01:52:19,440
that and so maybe matt if you want to do

3150
01:52:17,359 --> 01:52:21,118
your end of the end of the evening plug

3151

and then we can all have a good night

3152
01:52:21,118 --> 01:52:24,319

3157
01:52:31,840 --> 01:52:35,039
in this new weird feature that is

3158
01:52:33,439 --> 01:52:37,519
cannabis for a lot of us that would that

3159
01:52:35,039 --> 01:52:40,079
have been very resistant to it like i i

3160
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:42,080
didn't do a lot of testing myself um

3161
01:52:40,079 --> 01:52:44,158
over the years like early on because it

3162
01:52:42,079 --> 01:52:45,519
was so expensive and just didn't make a

3163
01:52:44,158 --> 01:52:48,319
lot of sense but i think we're at that

3164
01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:49,760
point where testing has to be a mainstay

3165
01:52:48,319 --> 01:52:51,039
so we appreciate you bringing your

3166
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:53,599
