43
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,079
yeahh so you start how we normally do

44
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:46,239
start um by me asking you know how did

45
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:49,279
you become involved with the plant you

46
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:51,399
know in your life yeah so like I think I

47
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,280
started smoking weed when I was like

48
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:56,359
13 um I had a buddy that had some like

49
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,718
older siblings and they would just rip

50
00:01:56,359 --> 00:02:00,599
us off for small sacks like constantly

51
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,559
for just really shitty we weed like

52
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:03,798
nothing had names back then this is like

53
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,920
the mid

54
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:11,640
2000s um cuz I'm thir 32 now so or going

55
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,159
to be 32 in a few months so um that was

56
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:15,079
like my high school era was like mid

57
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:18,359
2000s to

58
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,920
2009 and um got ripped off on weed for

59
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,239
just like I don't know four or five

60
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:25,439
years um and then I I met a buddy who uh

61
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:28,400
he's he grew some weed um he would go up

62
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:30,280
during the Summers to Medford and uh he

63
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,439
him and his like older brother I think

64
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,919
like grew some really great blue cheese

65
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:35,120
that's why Matt like I I think that was

66
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:36,919
the first thing I ever bought from you

67
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,080
was the blue cheese and that's right

68
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:41,399
trying to refin that plant has been a

69
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,640
[ __ ] pain in the ass dude I bet cuz

70
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,480
cheese is like so dominant in the class

71
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:48,279
so variant too yeah yeah and like so

72
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,079
unpredictable like I remember I was

73
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,439
telling you that whole run like [ __ ]

74
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:56,879
revegged under 1212 right at the end of

75
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:59,158
flower ruined the whole thing yep um so

76
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:00,840
[ __ ] a on that front so that was like

77
00:02:59,158 --> 00:03:03,199
the first like good weed that I ever

78
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,319
really got that I knew like where it was

79
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:06,759
from and like what the name was and he

80
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:07,958
kind of started like showing me all

81
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:09,840
kinds of [ __ ] about weed and like

82
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:11,519
started selling me ounces that I could

83
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,239
so how old were you again at this point

84
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,759
I was like 17 or

85
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,840
18 because I dropped out of high school

86
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:21,679
in my junior year um and then just like

87
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,319
went on to try and do my own thing and

88
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,840
like figure [ __ ] out you local both

89
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:28,958
started really young yeah yeah because I

90
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,878
started smoking at 13 so it's like now

91
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,479
God I've been smoking for like 20 years

92
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:35,919
every day yeah um and so like I've seen

93
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:37,598
a lot of weed just because of that

94
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:40,039
duration even though like I've only been

95
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:43,158
a grower for like this is my 10th season

96
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:44,919
yeah you know so um but that was the

97
00:03:43,158 --> 00:03:46,878
first time I got good weed was from the

98
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:48,798
the homie Tim wherever you're at

99
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:51,039
nowadays somewhere up in Washington last

100
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,239
I heard [ __ ] a man you guys had some

101
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:56,199
good weed shout out Tim yeah right and

102
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,400
uh he showed me like the the first

103
00:03:56,199 --> 00:04:00,598
vaporizer you know the box that NATO is

104
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,438
always talking about oh yeah they one of

105
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:04,000
those is that what they call it I can't

106
00:04:02,438 --> 00:04:05,680
even remember but yeah it's the wooden

107
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,360
box with the heating element and the

108
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,560
[ __ ] tube that you just got to like

109
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,120
rip out of and they had the same thing

110
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,039
they figured out oh you pack like

111
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,079
individual little you know one hitters

112
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:17,319
in there and [ __ ] and that way it

113
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:19,600
doesn't taste like popcorn all the time

114
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:21,238
yeah it took me all the way till the

115
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,919
last party to learn that I would pack it

116
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:25,599
full like a normal bowl and just wa

117
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,959
waste it tastes like ass all the way

118
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,120
through it yeah [ __ ] terrible it gets

119
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:32,799
you something [ __ ] high though it's a

120
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,918
different high it's a stronger High it

121
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,759
comes on slow too so you just kind of

122
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:40,519
like realize how [ __ ] lit you are

123
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,439
yeah I always find VAP high so much

124
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:43,879
stronger bro like and like you're saying

125
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:46,360
like for a lot of people if they just do

126
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:48,079
it once they may not understand the high

127
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,560
because it's not familiar to them yet so

128
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,800
it may not feel the same and they may

129
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,600
not understand that they're higher but

130
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,520
once you get used to it and you could do

131
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,320
like some comparisons on on actual like

132
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:00,680
flower of the same flower through

133
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,519
different devices there's like night and

134
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,519
day how how much different the high is

135
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:07,038
and how much more impactful it is on me

136
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:08,599
yeah and then later on I figured out the

137
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:10,319
same thing with the volcano because I

138
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,840
had a a buddy who was a little wealthier

139
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,240
so he could afford that like [ __ ]

140
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:17,079
thousand volcano or whatever it was back

141
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,319
then and um did the bags for a while and

142
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:20,000
then we figured out the same thing

143
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,840
straight line that thing with the tube

144
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,279
from the other Vape you know what I mean

145
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:26,439
and just straight line it right from the

146
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:28,559
volcano get so [ __ ] lit yeah dude but

147
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:30,759
the guy that had the volcano this dude

148
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,038
um he was the first person that ever

149
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:34,520
showed me you could like grow weed and

150
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:36,439
like the one that I'd ever seen really

151
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:38,279
do it you know what I mean from start to

152
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:40,478
finish cuz like he had this place out in

153
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:43,079
the country and he had two or three

154
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:44,918
plants of whatever you know and it was

155
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:47,079
[ __ ] fire and I just helped him water

156
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:49,719
it because he traveled a lot

157
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:53,519
and no idea what I was doing I think I

158
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:56,600
had some like uh Fox Farm like Bloom the

159
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:58,639
tiger bloom and then like the risos

160
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,800
whatever their uh root thing is I think

161
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,840
Bush doctor

162
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,680
and I had no idea what any of that [ __ ]

163
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:06,598
did and I was just like I'm just gonna

164
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,519
add more and just start pouring

165
00:06:06,598 --> 00:06:11,598
more I want to press on this bit like

166
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:13,439
where were you getting your information

167
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:15,240
there was I didn't I like it was all

168
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,240
available and I was just dumb like I

169
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,079
wasn't like I was raised with computers

170
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,038
for playing [ __ ] Command and Conquer

171
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:23,439
and Starcraft like I didn't know that

172
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:24,959
you could like seek out information on

173
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:26,800
the internet because like I was in that

174
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:28,560
generation that was right on the cusp

175
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,079
right and so like there was a lot of

176
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,680
elements of how people older than me

177
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:35,399
like grew up and went to school like

178
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,598
looking up [ __ ] in the library and like

179
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:38,519
cuz like they wouldn't let you use

180
00:06:36,598 --> 00:06:40,120
sources from online yet you know what I

181
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:42,359
mean and so you had to go and look up

182
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,680
books and check them out and like write

183
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,520
the bibliography by hand and [ __ ] and

184
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,519
like uh we had computer class on just

185
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:51,198
like computer literacy you know but then

186
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,918
by the time I graduated high school they

187
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,639
were on like iPhone

188
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:57,560
2 and Facebook was out and you know and

189
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:59,800
so like I was in that weird generation

190
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,160
that kind of had like the full 90s

191
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:05,918
experience and then also like the full

192
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:10,120
like uh 20 and being an adult for all

193
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:11,478
that yeah you pretty close in age yeah

194
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:14,800
yeah but you grew up [ __ ] just

195
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:17,560
raising sheep and [ __ ] so you know like

196
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,000
I I remember I remember the the the

197
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,560
first dude in high school that had a

198
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,399
cell phone at my high school like there

199
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,839
was one guy that had a cell phone and it

200
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:26,399
was like this big you had to pay him 10

201
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:28,478
bucks to use it if you wanted to use it

202
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:30,159
from school but like that guy was like a

203
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:32,279
gangster you know

204
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,759

209
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,400

211
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,918

212
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:51,520
200 pixel

213
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:54,120

216
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:03,720
to steal those phones dog like I need

217
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:07,359
[ __ ] I need to so like I was a

218
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,960
poor kid at like a pretty affluent like

219
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,879
City you know what I mean in high school

220
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,158
it was a nice school for sure that's

221
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,360
what you don't want to be no for real I

222
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:17,079
was a total [ __ ] loser like yeah

223
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,879
anyone that knew me I was just like such

224
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:20,519
a [ __ ] loner kid like I had friends

225
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,479
and stuff but it was all the other kids

226
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:24,120
that didn't fit into a certain group you

227
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:27,758
know what I mean and so we became the

228
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:30,959
stoner kids you know what I mean and uh

229
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,839
um but yeah so actually I had a homie

230
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:35,240
whose dad grew some weed when we were in

231
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:37,240
high school too um he had like a little

232
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,639
indoor with like two or three lights in

233
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,120
it and I saw it like one time I was

234
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:43,399
gonna say you actually let you see it as

235
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,000
a kid I would be yeah they were some

236
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:46,879
[ __ ] dead head types you know what I

237
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,159
mean so they also were like my first

238
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:50,879
view into like the actual culture behind

239
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:53,278
the scene too because like they were

240
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:55,000
from that whole touring dead head like

241
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:56,879
they had both been on tour for I think

242
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,120
like a couple years at a time like him

243
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:02,159
and his wife yeah and um

244
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,720
um they were also like addicts of other

245
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:05,039
or ex addicts of other types you know

246
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,800
what I mean so they were they were a

247
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:08,360
little looser with the liquor cabinet

248
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:09,759
and like you know [ __ ] letting us

249
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,159
smoke weed there and [ __ ] like that

250
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:13,679
everybody's favorite parents kind of

251
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:15,799
like not even my homie's favorite

252
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,439
parents he had it so good but acted like

253
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:18,799
it was so bad you know what I mean yeah

254
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,320
I had a friend like that whose parents

255
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:21,719
would let us do whatever the [ __ ] we

256
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,680
wanted but he acted he was so spoiled

257
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,959
he's was like whatever yeah yeah I had

258
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:27,679
another friend like that where we

259
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:30,679
actually partied the most and like his

260
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:32,199
parents were like really nice people but

261
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:34,159
like they I was like why the [ __ ] are

262
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,160
you buying liquor for like 16-year-old

263
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:39,240
kids super overly permissive yeah you're

264
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:41,078
like a broken person in your own right

265
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,480
for for doing that like you know what I

266
00:09:41,078 --> 00:09:44,439
mean I'm a chill dad but I'm not going

267
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,039
to be buying [ __ ] liquor for 16 year

268
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:50,480
olds right like there is that divide of

269
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:52,278
like when you're when you're like 16

270
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,240
those kind of dads are super cool but

271
00:09:52,278 --> 00:09:56,720
like as you get older you realize man

272
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,879
what a [ __ ] delinquent bro it was his

273
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,079
mom too bro oh man that's

274
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:05,399

277
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:11,559
she was like a really really nice lady

278
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:13,600
she was in kind of like a shitty

279
00:10:11,559 --> 00:10:16,199
marriage and like you know what I mean

280
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,159
sounds like it yeah yeah there's like a

281
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,040
whole backstory behind that [ __ ] that

282
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,600
I've like only kind of like recognized

283
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:25,240
more as an adult and I was like oh that

284
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,879
was [ __ ] up yeah you know yeah I mean

285
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,240
while you're looking back at this point

286
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:29,759
like you know you mentioned to us that

287
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,000
school was maybe not the easiest

288
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:34,240
environment for you um and but you know

289
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,078
you encountered like your friend's

290
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,480
parents and they had they kind of like

291
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:39,759
you know you got introduced to this

292
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:42,680
culture when you're looking back at it

293
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:44,439
now do you are you surprised that you

294
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:47,519
came down this

295
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,399
path it makes sense to a certain degree

296
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,440
but there's also like so many fork in

297
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:53,839
the roads that like or Forks in the road

298
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,680
that I like uh like have recognize

299
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,360
looking back where I'm just like oh man

300
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:59,679
my life would be so different if I had

301
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,560
just like gone that way instead

302
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,519
you know like my first like real

303
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:06,039
industry job for like a place that was

304
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:09,039
quote unquote going legal you know like

305
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:12,159
I also had a uh a lab manager position

306
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:14,278
at a UC campus in a tissue culture lab

307
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:15,838
like on the table ready to go they were

308
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:17,320
like it's your job if you want it you

309
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,000
know and I was like oh but I could make

310
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:22,000
the same amount of money which was not

311
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,320
enough um like being a nursery manager

312
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,759
for these other guys in LA and so like I

313
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,440
it was just more glamorous you know and

314
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:30,639
I was Dumb and [ __ ] you know everyone

315
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,959
in weed that main character syndrome

316
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:34,320
where they like think they're the center

317
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:36,638
of the [ __ ] world and like with the

318
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,959
circles that I ran in for a long time

319
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,039
like it it was just bound to happen you

320
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,399
know that's kind of like one of the

321
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:43,719
things that I talk about with the guys

322
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:45,759
on the server is that it's just like you

323
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,000
can become like a real piece of [ __ ] if

324
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:49,439
you follow that rabbit hole far enough

325
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,919
you know because there's more of them

326
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,079
than there is good people in this

327
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:55,120
industry yeah there's there's always

328
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:56,838
plenty of people to shine your balls

329
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,120
there really are if you're willing to

330
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:01,760
give people stuff free or they're they

331
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,078
have this impression that that you being

332
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:06,439
your friend will take them far there

333
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:07,559
will always be people in line to tell

334
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:11,040
you you're

335
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:12,879
amazing 100% second you or or someone

336
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:16,078
comes along that they feel is more

337
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:17,720
advantageous or anything like that you

338
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:19,120
will get dropped like that I think

339
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,800
that's an experience I wish everyone

340
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,600
would experience because it's super

341
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:26,359
humbling and it is some of the best

342
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,639
perspective to be to really really have

343
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,639
your ego dropped hard I think it's a

344
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,320
good thing

345
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:32,959
yeah that was me man like I was one of

346
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,879
those idiots that went out to Oklahoma

347
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:37,039
and tried to like make it big because we

348
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,480
thought we were so smart and like we got

349
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:39,958
we got out there earlier than other

350
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,440
people you know what I mean those first

351
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:44,319
year and a half that was [ __ ] really

352
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,920
good money and then like we ate it hard

353
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,760
after that you know what I mean and it

354
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:49,159
was really humbling because it's like

355
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:51,000
when you when you're at the top of your

356
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:52,480
game and you're making bank and pulling

357
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
those [ __ ] multi- thousand pound

358
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,720
grows off and [ __ ] like yeah you're

359
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,679
everyone wants to be your [ __ ] buddy

360
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,160
everyone's yeah sucking your dick and

361
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:03,359
just like oh you're so [ __ ] cool man

362
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:06,360
and then like when you fall like you

363
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:09,199
realize you have no [ __ ] friends

364
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,039
yeah before we get to this like juicy

365
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:13,319
bit tell us a bit more about your like

366
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,240
earlier grows just to get us warmed up

367
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,600
maybe yeah yeah oh there's so much more

368
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:21,919
man yeah so like I I did the grow with

369
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:25,800
my buddy um in uh my hometown out in the

370
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:28,479
country and uh then afterwards the next

371
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:30,159
season um that was like the 215 era so

372
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,759
you could just go into [ __ ]

373
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:34,439
Sacramento buy tray of clones go right

374
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:36,439
back out to your growing and plant them

375
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:39,320
all kinds of stuff who knows if it was

376
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,560
real or not but like um I bought like 30

377
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,120
or something like that and we were like

378
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,799
well we can do three let's do 30 and we

379
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,159
plant them all out and I like rote it

380
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:49,159
till this patch and I weigh over aend it

381
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:51,120
with dry and I literally take these

382
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:52,879
clones from the tray and I just stick

383
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,039
them right into the dirt in this open

384
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:57,600
field in farm country and like I leave

385
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:59,240
for the weekend and he's supposed to be

386
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,959
taking care of him and I get back and

387
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,440
he's like oh they all died and I'm just

388
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:05,119
like what do you mean you know but I

389
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:09,320
didn't know anything you know I was like

390
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,959
[ __ ] 20 years old [ __ ] yeah and um I

391
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,959
literally just took a clone and put it

392
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:14,838
in the soil outside and didn't think it

393
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:17,719
would [ __ ]

394
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:20,880
die I I you know I had that same kind of

395
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,800
logic green a green thumb to me was hard

396
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:25,240
earned you know what I mean like nothing

397
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:27,559
came natural to me I suck at this and

398
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,240
yeah I've had to work so I get that and

399
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:31,159
it's what's funny is that I like try and

400
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,720
do like you know be a mentor to some of

401
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:35,078
the younger guys I see coming up in the

402
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,480
industry and stuff and um people that

403
00:14:35,078 --> 00:14:39,919
want to make this their life for some

404
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:42,680
stupid [ __ ] reason and

405
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:46,159
uh it was at least glamorous when I

406
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:47,758
[ __ ] got into it there you go I don't

407
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:52,319
see what these young people see in it

408
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:54,199
now like don't either yeah but I at

409
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,879
least do you want to tell us about how

410
00:14:54,198 --> 00:14:59,439
you got from that like early stage you

411
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:00,958
know towards like where you are now oh

412
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,440
just give me give me some time brother I

413
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:05,399
got plenty of stories to tell you there

414
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,600
you go yeah so then like um I I did my

415
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:09,000
Community College thing as like you know

416
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,519
High School Dropout I got all my

417
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,879
transfer credits and [ __ ] took way too

418
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:17,120
[ __ ] long and I think by

419
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:20,320
22 or 23 I moved up to

420
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:23,240
Humble um and then I stayed up there I

421
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,560
transferred to Humble State and um I did

422
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,600
some stupid shady [ __ ] with just like

423
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:29,359
change in Majors last minute once I got

424
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,159
there and I'm like I'm in the program I

425
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,720
know I don't have any prere but like I'm

426
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:35,240
going to study

427
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,560
botney and uh went into that because I

428
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,399
didn't know what I wanted to do at that

429
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:40,518
point I wasn't like that into plants

430
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,958
like I knew I was into agriculture but

431
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:44,919
like I didn't want to do all the work to

432
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:46,159
get into like UC Davis or like Cal

433
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:47,958
because it's like you basically have to

434
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:50,439
do like all your

435
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:52,159
college like at the community college

436
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,600
and then you just do your last year at

437
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,078
there and I'm like well what am I really

438
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,079
going to get out of that if I'm just

439
00:15:55,078 --> 00:15:59,000
spending like one year on campus

440
00:15:57,078 --> 00:16:01,638
actually learning from these people

441
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,159
supposed to be networking and that's it

442
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:04,799
yeah right yeah and I wanted the

443
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:06,639
information I still don't give a [ __ ]

444
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,639
about networking man like I just wanted

445
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,198
the info and like I didn't I wasn't

446
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,799
Savvy enough to just like go out and

447
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:14,559
teach it to myself you know um I had

448
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,679
just gardened like a little bit I grew

449
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:19,599
those few plants but like I was not like

450
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:21,359
horticulturally inclined at all um so I

451
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,920
move up to humbold I start the botney

452
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,079
program and I got a job at the hydro

453
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:27,318
shop up there in McKinleyville because

454
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:29,758
that's where I was

455
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:33,078
living and anyone that's lived up there

456
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:35,959
knows North Coast H Hydroponics any NHS

457
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:38,758
I think that's right um and uh Steve

458
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:40,439
Geer and all those guys um and that was

459
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:42,278
kind of like my first intro into like

460
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,880
the real industry because like I'd lived

461
00:16:42,278 --> 00:16:45,439
in Humble for like six months and I was

462
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:46,720
like there's no [ __ ] weed here I

463
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,480
don't know what everybody's talking

464
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,839
about because like I wasn't in any

465
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,800
circles you know what I mean I was an

466
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:55,160
outsider in the college town and So like

467
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:56,758
um I wasn't keyed into anything yet and

468
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:58,919
so like getting into the hydro shop

469
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:00,639
really just like I learned what it's

470
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:02,360
like really about you know what I mean

471
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,120
and started meeting some like actual

472
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,199
Growers and like people that did this

473
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:09,159
for a living and it was like so [ __ ]

474
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:10,839
scary back then as like an outsider

475
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,480
you're just like whoa like that dude

476
00:17:10,838 --> 00:17:17,240
just bought like [ __ ] $20,000 worth

477
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,880
of soil and he paid for it in tens yeah

478
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,400
right and you have to have run a money

479
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,559
counter like there on the [ __ ]

480
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,038
register and just like blow through

481
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:26,399
these [ __ ] bricks of tens to [ __ ]

482
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:28,640
that this guy gave you to pay for

483
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,080

484
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,440

489
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:42,359
question like to someone that just gave

490
00:17:39,798 --> 00:17:44,079
you $20,000 that's a dumbass question to

491
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:47,519
be like why is it in

492
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:50,000
tens yeah I mean like for Growers yeah

493
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:53,079
yeah yeah I didn't know I was just so

494
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,759
inexperienced yeah and so like I I grew

495
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:57,879
I started slowly piecing together like a

496
00:17:55,759 --> 00:18:00,319
little mini hom grow setup you know and

497
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:02,000
I like really tiptoed my way into it and

498
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,720
like I bought a little light and I

499
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,279
started growing house plants on it it

500
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,720
was like a four bold

501
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:10,678
T5 um and then um I got some stupid

502
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,000
all-in-one where like the ballast is

503
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:15,159
like in this [ __ ] metal housing with

504
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,839
like a 400 watt light and so it's just

505
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:19,640
hot as [ __ ] and I remember I took all my

506
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:21,678
student loan money like I would get this

507
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:25,919
big chunk and I lived with the girl

508
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:27,679
that's now my wife up there and um um I

509
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,919
would give I would get my student loan

510
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,720
money would [ __ ] pay the rent for

511
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,799
like six months just right off the bat

512
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,798
be like this is rent money set aside and

513
00:18:33,798 --> 00:18:37,400
I had like 15500 bucks left it's just

514
00:18:35,798 --> 00:18:39,639
supposed to be like all my living money

515
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,640
for a few months for the semester you

516
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:44,280
know and I took it and I blew it all on

517
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,280
[ __ ] growing

518
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:49,439
equipment of course I mean I I think

519
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,119
like for those of you who started on

520
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,558
this so early I mean when you're so

521
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:55,839
young like going back to what you were

522
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:58,678
saying earlier the the feeling of power

523
00:18:55,839 --> 00:19:00,798
must be really intoxicating um 100% %

524
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:02,759
especially as like a poor [ __ ] nobody

525
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:05,679
that was like never popular and like

526
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:07,440
never cool for any good reason like when

527
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,840
you like start pumping out like some

528
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,640
decent weed even back then like yeah you

529
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:14,279
made a lot of friends once again like

530
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,679
shallow ass friends but you know you you

531
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:18,519
feel cool for once you know and so it is

532
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:19,960
intoxicating and it ropes you in and

533
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:21,639
then you start seeing other things that

534
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,880
are like a bigger version of what you're

535
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,520
doing and you're like well I'm going to

536
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,720
do that you know and so like I I I

537
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:30,839
[ __ ] around I grew some like organic

538
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,200
quote unquote organic running some like

539
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:34,798
Roots organic stuff that's a whole side

540
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,440
story because I ended up meeting that

541
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:38,158
guy when I lived in Eugene the guy that

542
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,080
like founded that company and [ __ ] and

543
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:42,840
like shopped at his Hydro shop and like

544
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:44,558
talked to him pretty regularly um

545
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:46,839
another classic [ __ ] guy in the

546
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:48,519
industry you know what I mean he just

547
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:52,279
made a [ __ ] ton of money I think he sold

548
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:54,119
to some some big agrochemical company or

549
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:56,678
to Sunlight Supply or something like

550
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:59,558
that yeah that makes sense yeah so he

551
00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:01,280
just cashed out um but I grew actually

552
00:19:59,558 --> 00:20:04,158
some really good weed at that point I

553
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:05,759
was just getting clones from hprc which

554
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,520
is like the I think it's one of the

555
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:10,519
oldest collectives in California that's

556
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:12,119
still running it's an arcade is um and

557
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:13,720
it's like right around the corner from

558
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:15,319
this barber shop that my wife used to

559
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:18,159
run that's where a lot of people got the

560
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:20,399
train wreck cut from HP yeah yeah I

561
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,480
actually got quite a few clones from

562
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,200
there that like looking back and like

563
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,798
seeing the same thing later on I was

564
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,400
like oh that was the real thing like I

565
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:29,000
didn't question provenance because like

566
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,559
in Humble to that Point Cuts were pretty

567
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:36,159
free flowing yeah even in like the

568
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:37,558
mid-20s like you could just ask for it I

569
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,960
grew a lot of blue dream that was like

570
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:41,960
when I first fell in love with blue

571
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,798
dream and that's way after its era ended

572
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:47,120
like it had already like mided itself

573
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:49,639
out of Oblivion uh yeah by by 2010 it

574
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:53,038
was already like a wrap yeah yeah and so

575
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:54,840
this is like 2015 14 15 and so like I

576
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:56,440
started growing it and I was bringing it

577
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:58,639
back down to the Sacramento area and

578
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,759
like we were selling like 2503 $300

579
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,520
ounces of it cuz like people were

580
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:04,759
already a little nostalgic about it and

581
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:07,599
it was like just like really good small

582
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:09,038
batch blue dream and it's easy to grow

583
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,240
like I didn't know that at the time I

584
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:12,679
thought we were just the best Growers

585
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,640
you know we had it all figured out you

586
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:16,519
just add a little bit more boota Buddha

587
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,038
Bloom and and it's all

588
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:22,839
Gucci yeah right like you know yeah yeah

589
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:24,720
you're right dude it's totally so

590
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:27,439
[ __ ] dumb and so I'm working at this

591
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,759
Hydro shop I'm growing my little [ __ ]

592
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,600
uh one you know what I mean 600 watt

593
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:34,440
tent and um I'm [ __ ] the whole thing

594
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:36,199
up like every time I go away from Blue

595
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,080
Dream I [ __ ] it up like I grew Bubba

596
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:41,000
once and I harvested it at like [ __ ]

597
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:42,879
50 days and it was just like lar I'm

598
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,839
like um I mean it wasn't that bad there

599
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,559
was worse ones you know what I mean like

600
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:49,558
even blue dream I was taking way too

601
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:50,960
early I was taking it at like 56 and

602
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:53,879
little did I know I could have gotten

603
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,240
you know like 30% more yield getting it

604
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,679
letting it go those last few weeks just

605
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,038
no [ __ ] clue really BL dream though

606
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:02,400
like if you can get it really early and

607
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:04,558
you're growing it real well it can come

608
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,000
out super Berry and it's so nice when it

609
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:08,278
gets the berry notes and I even like the

610
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,960
high from early Blue Dream whereas yeah

611
00:22:08,278 --> 00:22:13,119
I also like the high a lot from like a

612
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:15,360
10we blue dream but yeah like the the

613
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:16,839
berry flavors are all there at seven so

614
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:18,519
yeah yeah exactly and that's kind of

615
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:20,720
what I noticed too I was like well it

616
00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:22,759
looks full and it smells amazing and

617
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,600
it's coated in resin like I'm just going

618
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:28,440
to take it like how much more is it

619
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:30,399
going to get by day 56 you know 63 you

620
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:33,480
know like you have no [ __ ] idea how

621
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,600
this actually works yeah and so I'm

622
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:39,159
getting like three4 pound of light and

623
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:42,278
I'm like [ __ ] yeah right crushing

624
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:44,039
it just a few more days but I ended up

625
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:45,839
meeting this dude that became my like

626
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:48,000
business partner or I mean I worked for

627
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:50,240
him for a long time and by the end I was

628
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,798
like one of his business partners and uh

629
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,558
he brought me into work on his uh like

630
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:56,440
working out of a clone house and so it

631
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:58,639
was just like a condo in one of the

632
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,120
towns up there and it was like like two

633
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,038
sides and one a dude lived in one and

634
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:04,639
had a bedroom but there was like a mom

635
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:07,319
room in there and then the whole other

636
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,240
side was just like Mom rooms and [ __ ]

637
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:12,839
uh uh clone racks and [ __ ] and like I

638
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,919
think I was making like $15 an hour you

639
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:17,439
know what I mean like cutting clones in

640
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:19,038
this illegal clone house um but they

641
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,919
pumped them out man and like they were

642
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:24,679
just feeding guys on the hill and so

643
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:26,200
like I think we had OG Sour Diesel um we

644
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:27,720
had this cut that the the mon called

645
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,080
Platinum Kush I've talked to you about

646
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:33,038
that Matt it's just some unknown baby

647
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:35,798
[ __ ] smelling resin coated super easy to

648
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:39,640
grow plant that I'm never going to see

649
00:23:35,798 --> 00:23:41,278
again um and a and Girl Scout because

650
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,159
that had like just started trickling

651
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:45,000
through more and it was like I was for

652
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:47,159
sure the forarm cut looking back on it

653
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,880
now but it was so it was so nice you

654
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,919
know it was actually a really nice Cut

655
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,278
easy to grow again I mean that's why we

656
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:55,960
have so many seed makers using cookie

657
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:57,200
stuff because anybody can make crosses

658
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,720
of stuff and it looks like cookies and

659
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,600
it's all super easy to grow and

660
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,240
everybody looks like a pro you know well

661
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:03,719
everyone says it's low yielding and I'm

662
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,359
like oh well that tells me you [ __ ] it

663
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,519
up because you gave it full strength

664
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:09,558
light full strength NES and it still

665
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:12,519
looks beautiful and it still smokes good

666
00:24:09,558 --> 00:24:14,918
but the yield is like half yep you know

667
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:17,079
and so it's it was still nice though and

668
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:19,159
so that would be like that's why I never

669
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:20,759
knew about like the hype era of cuts

670
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:23,039
while I was up there is that like

671
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:25,720
everyone I worked with and new was just

672
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:27,398
like wholesalers and like like wholesale

673
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:30,360
farmers and like they were selling [ __ ]

674
00:24:27,398 --> 00:24:31,678
that had to go back east and so like

675
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:32,959
they would have their Gardens like when

676
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,600
they would sell their clone when we

677
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,399
would sell clones to them it would be

678
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:39,918
like half OG half sour and then maybe

679
00:24:37,398 --> 00:24:42,558
like they would save like 10 or 15% for

680
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,919
the cookies just to like feed that local

681
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:46,879
like California Bay Area market and [ __ ]

682
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:48,960
that's interesting um but like it wasn't

683
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,840
a big thing and so like it was just

684
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,519
another offering that people would put

685
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:55,038
like at most like 30% of their Garden

686
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:56,480
you know and so I never really thought

687
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:57,839
that much of it it was just like another

688
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,798
cut I didn't know that there was this

689
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:02,199
like wave of [ __ ] happening down in the

690
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:05,079
bay that would like dictate the industry

691
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,640
till today you know yeah that's weird

692
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:07,759
yeah I didn't know about other ogs I

693
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,600
didn't know that there was like other

694
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:12,759
versions of cuts you know there was just

695
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:14,678
one OG Kush in the crew that I ran with

696
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:16,359
and it was a good one I've never seen it

697
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:18,519
again since like they called it a

698
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:20,719
Florida like when I pressed at some

699
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:22,879
point I I heard it was a Florida OG and

700
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,960
that's all I ever learned about it and

701
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,840
so maybe fla I've never actually seen

702
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,519
that like verified and in flower in

703
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:33,599
front of me or

704
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:36,119
flowering um but yeah great sour cut a

705
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:38,119
good headband which was probably the

706
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:39,798
Loompas when I think back on it because

707
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:41,359
when I had them all side by side I

708
00:25:39,798 --> 00:25:43,278
remember thinking that it looked like a

709
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:45,839
perfect halfway point between the sour

710
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:48,440
and the OG we had yeah it's to me it's

711
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:50,240
like a cam oji or saour oi definitely

712
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:53,600
it's just right down the middle it's a

713
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:56,240
big yielding big colas um it does the

714
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:57,798
leaf cannibalism thing that k91 does too

715
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,960
yeah it always kind of looked like [ __ ]

716
00:25:57,798 --> 00:26:01,879
on like not good Farmers too and even on

717
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,120
the best runs it didn't it didn't really

718
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:07,240
look amazing it was just something that

719
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:09,918
threw down like colas it got you weight

720
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,919
potent too yeah yeah and it and it sold

721
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:12,399
you know what I mean it was just one of

722
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:14,200
those things that it was just like oh if

723
00:26:12,398 --> 00:26:16,359
I grow a couple hundred pounds of this

724
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:19,840
like I I have a guy that'll buy that

725
00:26:16,359 --> 00:26:22,918
yeah for sure and so plants did you take

726
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:26,158
to yourself personally in that

727
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:28,720
period um I really liked the blue dream

728
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:32,320
I grew a lot of the cookies too

729
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:34,120
um we had a chocolate hashberry cut that

730
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:36,599
we grew I think that's from that that

731
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:39,239
dude purple Caper or whatever down in

732
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:41,319
the bay um it was actually pretty nice I

733
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,798
remember it fondly it was like a

734
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:46,839
chocolaty strawberry type nose really

735
00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:49,639
easy to grow like purple Frosty wheed it

736
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:51,639
made great hash um but it just smelled

737
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,038
like chocolate like as it aged in the

738
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,720
bag like it was just like what does that

739
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:56,839
smell like and anyone you put it up to

740
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,079
it be like oh that's chocolatey you know

741
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:01,639
interesting so milk chocolate yeah yeah

742
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:04,000
like milk chocy yeah it was really nice

743
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:06,399
but like like a like a milk chocolate

744
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,119
strawberry like Blended smoothie or like

745
00:27:06,398 --> 00:27:11,479
a milkshake kind of thing that's like

746
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:13,199
what I got from it um it's awesome and

747
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:16,240
then I actually really liked three kings

748
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,360
when it was going around OG sour

749
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,480
headband I don't know how it was mashed

750
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:22,199
together in what way I don't think

751
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:24,240
anyone does no um but it was [ __ ]

752
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,720
fire and it was way easier to grow than

753
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,480
any of its three components yeah and you

754
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,440
could pass it as like a few you know you

755
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,880
could pass it as a headband or a sour

756
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,919
type kind of thing you know what I mean

757
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:38,080
and it was way easier to grow and so I

758
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,679
actually really miss that cut it's one

759
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:41,439
of the things that I've like wanted to

760
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,360
pitch to certain people in the crew to

761
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,759
be like hey you want to remake this for

762
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:49,278
me you know I just don't think like if

763
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:50,759
it was remade what I what it reminds me

764
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:52,440
of some of the stuff Elite genetics

765
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:55,200
released not Elite cannabis but Elite

766
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:58,278
genetics back in the day

767
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,120
and a lot of that stuff was

768
00:27:58,278 --> 00:28:01,880
not quite what he said but some of it

769
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:04,639
was so [ __ ] dank that nobody really

770
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:06,360
cared you know just it was good mashes

771
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,960
yeah um that cut does still go around

772
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:10,079
I'll keep an eye out for it I mean it

773
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:12,480
was a good cut it was a really good cut

774
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:15,639
um one year I brought it to the dun cup

775
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:18,599
for um an OG entry because it was it was

776
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:20,880
good yeah yeah no and I really liked

777
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:22,519
that one I couldn't like uh I couldn't

778
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,039
get anyone else to [ __ ] grow it

779
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:25,399
around me so like I was trying to sell

780
00:28:24,038 --> 00:28:27,720
clones of it and I was just like not

781
00:28:25,398 --> 00:28:29,439
going to [ __ ] happen but like while I

782
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,399
was working for the Clone guys like we

783
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,960
did this whole thing where like we had

784
00:28:31,398 --> 00:28:35,759
more orders than we could fill and so we

785
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,919
started crapping up we called them

786
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:40,119
franchises and like we would just like

787
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,120
set up in another person's house and

788
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:44,959
their grow set up and as long as you

789
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:46,678
sold them to the guy I worked for you

790
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,399
know he would cut you in you know like

791
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:50,200
five out of the Eight dollar a cut and

792
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:51,839
then he would take the other three and

793
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,558
so it was a great way to just like move

794
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:55,199
bulk Cuts if you didn't have your own

795
00:28:53,558 --> 00:28:58,200
Market but you could set up a clone room

796
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,278
for like 800 bucks you know

797
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,558
yeah that sounds amazing yeah and so I

798
00:29:00,278 --> 00:29:04,759
remember one year or one one month in

799
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:06,398
particular I [ __ ] blew out like 10

800
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:08,319
G's worth of clones out of my [ __ ]

801
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:10,479
back bedroom while I was in college like

802
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:12,759
full-time student working at the Clone

803
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,240
house doing all the things like taking

804
00:29:12,759 --> 00:29:16,240
whatever work I could pick up because

805
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,720
like it's [ __ ] broke and supporting

806
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,880
myself and I ended up pulling together

807
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:22,159
like 10 grand in a single month just

808
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:25,360
from selling trays like it was [ __ ]

809
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:27,000
epic and I was a nursery huh yeah bro I

810
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:28,479
was hooked like instantly I was just

811
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,240
like this is the type of money you can

812
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,278
make and even like selling clones it's

813
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,079
like if I had a buyer for clones um and

814
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:36,679
brought them to like the guys I worked

815
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:38,359
with they were like oh yeah I'll fill

816
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:40,679
that 300 clone order and I'll give you

817
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:42,158
two bucks a cut you know to just like do

818
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:44,278
the sale and everything and so like you

819
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,240
could literally take an hour go load up

820
00:29:44,278 --> 00:29:49,079
some clones and drive them across town

821
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,599
and make like a thousand dollars easy

822
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:52,798
yeah and so it was just easy money for

823
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:54,798
me back then and like I got into that

824
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:56,319
whole lifestyle just like Easy Come Easy

825
00:29:54,798 --> 00:29:58,158
Go and so you just start blowing money

826
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:00,158
it's what everyone around you does and

827
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,880
you like bought a bunch of cool guns and

828
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,278
like bought a bunch of [ __ ] uh bought

829
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,679
a nice truck eventually and like you

830
00:30:04,278 --> 00:30:09,038
know what I mean like all the stupid

831
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:10,440
[ __ ] that you waste money on um oh trust

832
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:13,558
me I know High un Lonesome calls him my

833
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:16,038
boner toys yeah toy are get what are you

834
00:30:13,558 --> 00:30:18,480
doing with your boner toys one side

835
00:30:16,038 --> 00:30:22,398
question why is that reversal bottle so

836
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:24,319
[ __ ] black on on your desk there so

837
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:25,798
so because because these are super

838
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:29,240
concentrated it's not like ready to

839
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:31,480
spray yeah learned is over time the

840
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:34,000
plastic Bond or the the silver bonds to

841
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,599
the plastic to some degree so I always

842
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,919
like account for it but yeah what's

843
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:37,918
weird is they can be sitting next to

844
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:39,278
each other you could have two bottles

845
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,360
sitting next to each other the same

846
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:44,679
temperature for a month yeah one will do

847
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:46,000
it one won't it's so bizarre to me yeah

848
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:49,159
yeah yeah

849
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,640
yeah oxides yeah this is a highly con

850
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:53,120
this is like a THX bottle oh okay that

851
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,480
that explains it so I I've been looking

852
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:57,798
at it while we've been talking and I'm

853
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:00,159
just like what the [ __ ] is that yeah no

854
00:30:57,798 --> 00:31:02,759
but but but a lot of my sprays are so

855
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,919
highly concentrate like with silver that

856
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:06,440
this isn't uncommon to see it super dark

857
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:10,880
like this even in the normal ones but

858
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:12,240
this is a THX yeah yeah yeah yeah but um

859
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,200
yeah so I got accustomed to that

860
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,359
lifestyle accustom just having cash in

861
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:19,278
my pocket and like [ __ ] being like

862
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:21,479
like even just being like middle class

863
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:23,919
as far as like like 60 Grand a year made

864
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:26,120
me feel [ __ ] rich and this is like

865
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,759
what your early 20s yeah I'm still in

866
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:30,239
like my mid 20s

867
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:32,319
yeah like I think I'm like 24 25 by this

868
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,880
point you know yeah and so like we did

869
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:35,519
that for a few years while I was in

870
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:37,278
school you know and like I would help

871
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:40,038
out on outdoor Farms like just being

872
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:45,919
extra labors [ __ ] digging holes being

873
00:31:40,038 --> 00:31:47,638
a water boy as Caleb calls it um and uh

874
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:49,759
yeah man like just [ __ ] putting in my

875
00:31:47,638 --> 00:31:51,839
dues just trying to make money and meet

876
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:55,599
people and like get further and all this

877
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:58,720
[ __ ] and um I did like uh I had a friend

878
00:31:55,599 --> 00:32:00,519
who was like building a legal grow

879
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,639
because Humble County legalized before

880
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:04,000
the state did like the year before

881
00:32:02,638 --> 00:32:05,798
because they kind of saw the writing on

882
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,398
the wall that like the state's going to

883
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:08,839
legalize soon and they're like well

884
00:32:07,398 --> 00:32:10,479
we're going to get the county licensed

885
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:12,119
ahead of time so we're ahead of this and

886
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,919
it like puts all everyone at like an

887
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:15,319
advantage over the rest of the state

888
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,960
that like we already have County

889
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:18,599
authorization so now all you have to do

890
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,519
is do your state paperwork get your

891
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:23,839
licensing and you're good to go it

892
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:25,880
didn't [ __ ] work out that way okay it

893
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:27,678
basically made everyone dry snitch on

894
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,600
themselves and just like just not even

895
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,919
dry [ __ ] fullon just snitch yourself

896
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:34,158
out to the county because if you didn't

897
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,000
register your illegal grow at the county

898
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,440
by a certain date they would never give

899
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:43,200
you a license on that property

900
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:45,720
ever and so basically most people that

901
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,759
like wanted to go legal went and outed

902
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:50,480
themselves to the county and then you're

903
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:52,638
just like a map a DOT on a map that they

904
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,798
like know to fly over no to [ __ ]

905
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:57,119
check in on you know what I mean like it

906
00:32:54,798 --> 00:33:00,200
kind of put all those people it like it

907
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:02,879
expedited the the slow like Exodus of

908
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:04,679
farmers from that whole area you know oh

909
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,799
man there's like a deep irony to that

910
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:08,278
isn't there um yeah yeah that well

911
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:09,798
that's honestly like the industry in a

912
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:13,319
nutshell is all the people that like

913
00:33:09,798 --> 00:33:15,158
went above and beyond um like kind of

914
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:16,879
got [ __ ] early on especially the

915
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:18,360
smaller mom and pop grows that were like

916
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,159
we want to do this right and we want to

917
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:22,599
come out of the Shadows like they kind

918
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,080
of all got made an example of by like

919
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:28,879
people like fishing game in the

920
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:30,119
waterboard and like um a lot of

921
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,360
you know they didn't want people in the

922
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:33,558
mountains they're like you got to move

923
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:35,599
your farm to the [ __ ] bottomlands and

924
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:38,038
it's like bro you know how expensive

925
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:40,119
that is like some small farmers living

926
00:33:38,038 --> 00:33:41,679
in a cabin off grid and humble they're

927
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:44,278
not going to be able to [ __ ] do that

928
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:46,000
you know yeah because I was gonna say

929
00:33:44,278 --> 00:33:48,839
like if this were a movie I imagine that

930
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,679
would be a point of like serious

931
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:53,599
foreshadowing yeah yeah no for sure it'd

932
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,519
be like the ominous moment of everybody

933
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:57,519
like reluctantly coming up and putting

934
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,839
their name on the [ __ ] Ledger

935
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:01,919
you know that it's just like you're on

936
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:04,720
the [ __ ] list now and so it was just

937
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:07,399
like bad times up there and so like my

938
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:10,079
buddy that was building this legal grow

939
00:34:07,398 --> 00:34:11,638
for these rich dudes out of LA and that

940
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:13,240
whole thing ended up falling apart after

941
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:16,519
like a few months but like I worked

942
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:19,158

943
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:21,000
um and just like did my whole thing that

944
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:25,878
I was already doing just like Nursery

945
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:28,800
work um but I wrote I ended up writing a

946
00:34:25,878 --> 00:34:30,440
like a man agement contract for them and

947
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,039

948
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:35,000
do this I just like went online and like

949
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:36,519

00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:28,559
group um down in La I don't know they

973
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:32,400
want to be named or not but they're

974
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:35,199
they're a current legal brand now um not

975
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:38,079
like a huge one but you know like known

976
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:41,159
and um they had just [ __ ] indoors all

977
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:43,039
over La bro and they had a few

978
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:45,000
dispensaries like they were these like

979
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:46,960
kind of older dudes that I think they

980
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,440
had set up one of the first dispensaries

981
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,639
in um the San Fernando Valley and so

982
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,639
like they had they had money you know

983
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:56,400
and they had these big ass indoors all

984
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:57,920
over LA and like I think the smallest

985
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,358
one I think I think was like over 100

986
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:03,440
lights you know and then the larger ones

987
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:05,239
were like two to 400 lights and um

988
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:09,280
something like that maybe two to 300

989
00:36:05,239 --> 00:36:12,759
lights um and uh that was like my first

990
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:15,240
time like operating at scale and like a

991
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:17,040
more management type position where it's

992
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:18,239
just like I got all their genetics in

993
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:21,000
check because they were having a lot of

994
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:22,879
bug and infestation issues and so I just

995
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
went in there with a little TCT Tech

996
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,800
started washing plants and bleach before

997
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,358
I cloned them out to kill all the mites

998
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,960
kill all the aphids and all that

999
00:36:28,358 --> 00:36:32,960
[ __ ] like get a system together to

1000
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,480
like clean up the clones and the moms so

1001
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,400
then like we can cycle out all the rooms

1002
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:39,000
and start filling them with clean clones

1003
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:42,039
instead of all these rude aphids and

1004
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,960
[ __ ] and so just like help them out you

1005
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:45,759
were like a serious Pro by this point it

1006
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:48,119
sounds like and how old were you again I

1007
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,520
was I was like fake it till you make it

1008
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:52,800
pro you know what I mean like I was

1009
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:55,079
dropped way in over my head and they

1010
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,680
were like we need help and like if you

1011
00:36:55,079 --> 00:37:00,000
can do it for it you know that's the

1012
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:02,279
whole industry like realistically when

1013
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,159
when commercial came about think about

1014
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:06,760
how many of us like really knew how to

1015
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:09,039
run more than 20 likes yeah really there

1016
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:11,400
were some but not there some but not

1017
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:13,759
enough to fill up all the grows through

1018
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,639
Oklahoma Michigan like all the so

1019
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,040
realistically there were a lot of people

1020
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:18,639
that had to stick up their hands and

1021
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:20,440
just have the faith in themselves to get

1022
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:22,960
this done and most of them couldn't you

1023
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:24,480
know yeah yeah I was just following in

1024
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,838
the footsteps of the guys I saw in

1025
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,800
Humble and I like stole their recipe

1026
00:37:26,838 --> 00:37:30,119
these and or not stole you know I

1027
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,960
already had them they had given them to

1028
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:33,880
me but just like use their recipe try

1029
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:36,079
and modify it they were trying to do a

1030
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:38,720
bunch of LED grows with like the first

1031
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:41,318
gen fluent spiders and those were like

1032
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:43,199
pretty challenging because like I didn't

1033
00:37:41,318 --> 00:37:45,599
really understand like what cannabis

1034
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:48,199
wanted for like you know ppfd or like

1035
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:49,760
how many micro moles of light you know

1036
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:52,000
coming down on the canopy that it

1037
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:54,079
actually wanted because like the the old

1038
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,119
gavita 6 750s they're you're only

1039
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:58,760
getting like 400 at canopy height y less

1040
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,280
by the time you hit the bottom of the

1041
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,200
plant but like there was a lot of older

1042
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:04,760
cuts that still like that you know like

1043
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:06,838
Bubba and OG they they like that range

1044
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:09,000
still you know from everything that I've

1045
00:38:06,838 --> 00:38:11,639
seen with our

1046
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,119
experimentation um but like those just

1047
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:17,000
like make an a noob grower comment here

1048
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:19,280
which is that you constantly hear people

1049
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:21,280
say that like there is a target there's

1050
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,599
just like a ppfd that's like a magic

1051
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,000
number like a thousand for all plants

1052
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:28,920
yeah for all PLS for all time or all

1053
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,480
strings nice it's really nice and and my

1054
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,440
experience has really strained against

1055
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,880
that whenever I've tried to do that some

1056
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,240
of my plants have just suffered really

1057
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,800
intensely so it's just really nice to

1058
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:38,479
hear someone just you know be explicit

1059
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,560
and just say like obviously some plants

1060
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:43,400
are not going to enjoy that you know no

1061
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:45,159
man I've seen it at scale in a million

1062
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:48,119
different ways now that like certain

1063
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:49,799
plants do not want like a modern amount

1064
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:52,119
of light as far as like how Grow rooms

1065
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:54,640
are set up and just grided out with Lux

1066
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:56,960
thousand Watts some plants don't respond

1067
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:59,118
well to that they don't want the three E

1068
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:02,199
from Athena it actually makes them

1069
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:03,920
larier and like shittier overall than it

1070
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:06,559
ever even does like dense like I saw

1071
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:09,519
Bubba recently grown like that and it

1072
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:11,679
was ly and then I had it at a different

1073
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:13,880
facility in a different whole different

1074
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:16,199
setup and Circumstance and like it was

1075
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:18,039
shaded out by this canopy and I was

1076
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:20,159
doing this breeding project and it came

1077
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:22,199
through so [ __ ] nicely you know what

1078
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:23,598
I mean like it was so [ __ ] perfect

1079
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:27,078
and I was like dude it doesn't want any

1080
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:29,838
light at all yeah you know what I mean

1081
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:32,079
have you guys heard of um Bruce Bruce

1082
00:39:29,838 --> 00:39:35,119
bugby I think that's his name sounds

1083
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:37,318
familiar he's I he's like this kind of

1084
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:39,960
academic I believe who who kind of got

1085
00:39:37,318 --> 00:39:42,000
big on YouTube yeah and one of the main

1086
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,358
things he's known for is kind of like

1087
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,358
trying to tell people that there is this

1088
00:39:44,358 --> 00:39:50,679
one DLI this one ppfd number that you

1089
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:53,039
should always hit [ __ ] never

1090
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:55,960
like

1091
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:57,719
yeah like with anything in growing uh

1092
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:00,079
people just like yeah that's the answer

1093
00:39:57,719 --> 00:40:03,399
now cool well so I've got actually some

1094
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:05,119
good anecdotal like or just a good

1095
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:08,280
anecdote about this is that like I've

1096
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:09,960
met quite a few like PhD students and

1097
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,319
stuff that are like doing research in

1098
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,440
Canada and I've talked with some of

1099
00:40:11,318 --> 00:40:15,159
these people and they have all these

1100
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,599
claims and they'll make claims like oh

1101
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:19,358
freeze drying doesn't affect the quality

1102
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:22,838
of the weed and I'm just like well did

1103
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:25,039
you smoke it yeah right no we didn't but

1104
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:26,838
in all measurable ways it's identical

1105
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:28,639
and I'm just like yeah but you didn't

1106
00:40:26,838 --> 00:40:31,039
[ __ ] smoke it dude that's literally

1107
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:32,679
the only point of all of this and you

1108
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:35,239
like negated that whole thing because

1109
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:38,000
it's not proper or measurable in a way

1110
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:40,000
that you can like uh make have like make

1111
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,119
and show is statistically relevant but

1112
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,079
that's like literally the whole goal is

1113
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:46,280
to have it be enjoyable smoke and have

1114
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:47,440
the consumer want to buy it again so

1115
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,280
what the [ __ ] are you telling me that

1116
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,480
you did the research and you didn't do

1117
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,680
the one thing that everyone's going to

1118
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,480
do with the product that you're

1119
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:57,118
presenting me you know like go go [ __ ]

1120
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:58,760
yourself missing

1121
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,960
where it's like I guess you know in

1122
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:03,160
science like you construct the model and

1123
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,358
then you make hypotheses based on that

1124
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:06,799
model but then later on you actually

1125
00:41:04,358 --> 00:41:09,318
need to check the fit of the model to

1126
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:12,000
reality

1127
00:41:09,318 --> 00:41:14,519
yeah yeah dude even SE junkie he just

1128
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,440
posted on this the other day on IG about

1129
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:18,480
like what's like trying to like set up a

1130
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:20,079
debate about pros and cons of freeze

1131
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,679
drying and I'm like bro you trying to

1132
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:25,119
Outsource your think into the [ __ ]

1133
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:27,000
public yep y someone's been getting

1134
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:29,200
shopped someone's been shopping for

1135
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,119
[ __ ] freeze dryers recently doesn't

1136
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:34,919
know what call to make you

1137
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:37,680
know um but uh yeah man there is no

1138
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:40,079
magic quantity of fertilizer in any

1139
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:42,759
quantity or like or like ratio there's

1140
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:44,599
no magic DLI that all plants are all

1141
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:46,400
strains want you know what I mean like

1142
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:47,920
they're all if you think like that

1143
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,800
you've only been growing since the

1144
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,639
modern kickoff of everything being

1145
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:54,440
[ __ ] the same because like gelato

1146
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:56,838
hybrids don't mind those high dlis and

1147
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:58,559
[ __ ] high EC feeds at all

1148
00:41:56,838 --> 00:42:00,960
like they love it they will give you

1149
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:02,799
more weight and like a nicer expression

1150
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,920
and all that and so it's easy when you

1151
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,160
have a plant that like you give more gas

1152
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:09,200
and it gets bigger but like some plants

1153
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:10,960
don't [ __ ] respond that way yeah a

1154
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:13,078
lot the way it is acclimated to

1155
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,639
commercial growing and that's yeah or

1156
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:17,200
was selected under those pressures and

1157
00:42:15,639 --> 00:42:19,118
that's what I always tell people is that

1158
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:22,598
like bro OG doesn't want this it was

1159
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:25,000
selected in the [ __ ] 90s under a 600

1160
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:27,039
watt aesta Wing in like an 85 degree

1161
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,880
[ __ ] room you know what I mean and

1162
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:31,880
someone babed it yeah someone babied the

1163
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,880
[ __ ] out of it to get the expression

1164
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:35,880
that that they wanted from it you know

1165
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,358
and that's how it was selected and so

1166
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,400
like that's obviously what it [ __ ]

1167
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:40,960
prefers and so whenever people tell me

1168
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,400
they're not getting the OG expression

1169
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,720
they want I'm like I don't know throw it

1170
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,358
in some [ __ ] black gold potting soil

1171
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:48,838
feed it some din gr or some Cutting Edge

1172
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:50,598
and just leave it the [ __ ] alone and

1173
00:42:48,838 --> 00:42:52,480
don't touch it and don't try and add any

1174
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:54,920
like magic sauce to it just like leave

1175
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,880
it alone like give it the bare minimum

1176
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:58,480
and it'll come through for you

1177
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:01,200
and nobody believes

1178
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,679
me yeah you know it just takes time with

1179
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:05,078
a lot of people it's the same thing like

1180
00:43:02,679 --> 00:43:07,799
when people ask me uh when you select a

1181
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:09,519
male like uh what are you looking for

1182
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,800
well you know like how do you answer

1183
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:12,838
that like if you really know how it's

1184
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,559
done like depends on the project but

1185
00:43:12,838 --> 00:43:16,119
people want solid answers and if you

1186
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:17,519
give them something more open-ended

1187
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:20,200
they'll go to someone else to get a

1188
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:23,400
solid answer that's what I found yeah

1189
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:25,159
yeah for sure um before we get too off

1190
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:27,760
topic I got more stories to tell man I

1191
00:43:25,159 --> 00:43:29,279
got a long ass bring it back to theel

1192
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:34,160
let's bring it back to the timeline so

1193
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:36,559
it's 2018 I'm like 27 when I'm in La I

1194
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:38,000
think I turned 27 out there because I uh

1195
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:40,599
I moved in

1196
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,519
January um and so I'm working with these

1197
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:44,838
guys at this just like epic scale we're

1198
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:46,960
having a good time I'm making good money

1199
00:43:44,838 --> 00:43:49,400
not for La though like I was paying like

1200
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,000
[ __ ] three grand a month in rent you

1201
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,720
know real quick I just want to ask you

1202
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,760
what your mindset was at this point as

1203
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:57,879
like a young man like in oh I'm going to

1204
00:43:54,760 --> 00:44:01,000
get rich and famous growing up yeah yeah

1205
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:03,039
yeah yeah every like like I I had so

1206
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,159
many job offers by that point just

1207
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:08,119
because I was working in a place and was

1208
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:10,279
like publicly advertising that I like

1209
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:12,880
did cannabis at scale I was getting job

1210
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:14,480
offers [ __ ] constantly I had people

1211
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,000
wanting me to like move to [ __ ]

1212
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,599
Colombia at that point because things

1213
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,599
were just kicking off down there which

1214
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:23,800
is like a total [ __ ] scam I had canab

1215
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:25,519
Bros from [ __ ] Canada coming down

1216
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,760
with their [ __ ] funny money offering

1217
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:30,519
me a billion dollars in stock and like

1218
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:32,880
60 Grand a year to come [ __ ] move to

1219
00:44:30,519 --> 00:44:35,519
Panama and like manage their grows

1220
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,720
worldwide and [ __ ] like company didn't

1221
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:39,599
exist like eight months later you know

1222
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:42,159
what I mean like so many [ __ ] pump

1223
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:46,039
and dump schemes going on at that

1224
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:49,480
point um but um I was just like honing

1225
00:44:46,039 --> 00:44:52,199
the blades but I had a big old [ __ ]

1226
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:54,000
ego just that like oh I've made it I'm

1227
00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:55,719
going to be [ __ ] Rich I'm going to be

1228
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,159
this famous [ __ ] weed grower like all

1229
00:44:55,719 --> 00:45:00,838
these Bros I see on IG because like I

1230
00:44:58,159 --> 00:45:02,598
had just discovered like the jungle boys

1231
00:45:00,838 --> 00:45:04,400
and like at that point like symbiotic

1232
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:06,240
genetics was really big and so like

1233
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:09,440
purple punch was making the rounds and

1234
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:11,598
banana punch and all those um I actually

1235
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,440
popped those seeds when I first moved

1236
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:14,599
there to La so I was like I bought these

1237
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,639
seeds you guys want to grow them and

1238
00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:19,920
they're like yeah I guess and um I found

1239
00:45:17,639 --> 00:45:22,879
like such in one pack I found such a

1240
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,318
nice cut of mimosa um I still have picks

1241
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,920
of that one I can post it up on the

1242
00:45:24,318 --> 00:45:29,400
server but um just just like gorgeous

1243
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:32,000
purple weed coated in resin smelled like

1244
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:33,639
grape candy and Tangi and just like it

1245
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,559
was like a perfect middle of the road

1246
00:45:33,639 --> 00:45:38,199
between purple punch and Tangi or

1247
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:42,680
whatever he used in that

1248
00:45:38,199 --> 00:45:44,879
cross um but um yeah I was just kind of

1249
00:45:42,679 --> 00:45:47,679
like fumbling my way through like modern

1250
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,358
genetics like I met so many people down

1251
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:51,838
there at that point that were just

1252
00:45:49,358 --> 00:45:54,078
trying to like hand me [ __ ] clones of

1253
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:56,119
so much [ __ ] and I had no idea what I

1254
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:57,599
had on the table you know what I mean

1255
00:45:56,119 --> 00:46:00,400
like all the [ __ ] that all the modern

1256
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:02,599
Bros are would just like [ __ ] die for

1257
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:05,039
and um it was just all around and I

1258
00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:07,480
didn't know any better like they had so

1259
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:11,358
many old different cuts of OG from

1260
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:12,960
NorCal and like um uh I don't know a

1261
00:46:11,358 --> 00:46:15,318
bunch of stuff that I'm still not that

1262
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,920
Keen on like um what's that [ __ ] cut

1267
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:28,239
had like a ton of [ __ ] I've tried to

1268
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:29,920
connect with this one dude um cuz he was

1269
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:31,439
a he was like the first genetics nerd

1270
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,039
that I ever really met you know it's

1271

Cuts he was totally up to date on all

1275

the seed junky [ __ ] and was like growing

1276
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,519
gelato packs that like SE junkie had

1277
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:50,559

1296
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,559
though it's just like literally here to

1297
00:47:28,318 --> 00:47:32,759
promote a brand promote a guy build the

1298

hype sell the I me that's what High

1299
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:36,240
Times was and it was successful for

1300
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,880
years you know it's paid advertisement

1301
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:40,358
in the form of a magazine that people

1302
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:41,880
think isn't paid yeah yeah well and I

1303
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:43,838
think that's why like some people think

1304
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:45,720
that this podcast is this giant like

1305
00:47:43,838 --> 00:47:47,838
Revenue Creator and I'm like sorry to

1306
00:47:45,719 --> 00:47:49,118
bring it to you guys yeah this is this

1307
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:52,960
is a passion

1308
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:55,440
project yeah far far from it

1309
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:57,280
yeah I've learned in this industry like

1310
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:01,159
real information does not pay the

1311
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:02,960
[ __ ] bills like hype [ __ ] lies and

1312
00:48:01,159 --> 00:48:05,480
just like renames that pays the [ __ ]

1313
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:08,440
bills like yeah I mean being where

1314
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:10,480
you're at and um I mean you UND you've

1315
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:12,280
had the Journey of the smoke and mirrors

1316
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,880
and maybe you could talk about like

1317
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:15,920
through your stories do you have a story

1318
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:17,720
about like one of those experiences

1319
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,039
early on when you first started seeing

1320
00:48:17,719 --> 00:48:21,959
some of the Smoke

1321
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:24,159
Clear [ __ ] dude I was too dumb I was way

1322
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:26,679
too dumb like the smoke didn't clear for

1323
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:28,838
me until I crashed and burned and and

1324
00:48:26,679 --> 00:48:30,159
like it literally like the fire stopped

1325
00:48:28,838 --> 00:48:31,679
that's when the smoke cleared and I was

1326
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:34,118
like oh I've been a [ __ ] idiot for

1327
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:35,879

1363
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:52,039

Eugene like on a [ __ ] whim you know

1368
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:04,280
what I mean I met these dudes one time I

1369
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:06,679
flew up there to they flew me up to like

1370

[ __ ] outdoor grow and we're quote

1372
00:50:08,519 --> 00:50:13,759
unquote growing hemp this is the 2018

1373
00:50:10,838 --> 00:50:16,440
era oh yeah Oregon legalized hemp so I

1374
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:19,559
basically hit every [ __ ] like douchy

1375
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:23,000
bro State and move I've done every

1376
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:24,359
single [ __ ] one of them like I know

1377
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,679
so many people that did though like

1378
00:50:24,358 --> 00:50:28,400
that's not uncommon for sure no I

1379
00:50:26,679 --> 00:50:29,919
everyone I knew was doing the same thing

1380
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,200
and so it was just like it seemed like

1381
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,920
the move to make money and like oh you

1382
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:35,679
can't grow weed in the woods of Humbolt

1383
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,280
anymore because they they [ __ ]

1384
00:50:35,679 --> 00:50:39,798
they're just flying like crazy they're

1385
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,559
using GIS to like just automatically

1386
00:50:39,798 --> 00:50:44,159
find the [ __ ] weed Farms with a

1387
00:50:41,559 --> 00:50:45,880
computer and automatically send notices

1388
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:49,239
to your [ __ ] gate that's like you're

1389
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:52,440
in $10,000 a day fine for you not being

1390
00:50:49,239 --> 00:50:54,078
in compliance and so like yeah um the

1391
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:55,838
writing was on the wall for me you know

1392
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:57,559
there were still a few years that people

1393
00:50:55,838 --> 00:51:00,558
managed to make it work but like I kind

1394
00:50:57,559 --> 00:51:03,040
of moved on and um we did the whole

1395
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:05,559
thing out there that was just Eugene was

1396
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:07,519
[ __ ] scandalous times that was like

1397
00:51:05,559 --> 00:51:08,920
the beginning of the end ultimately but

1398
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:11,519
I didn't know it because it was still a

1399
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:13,920
few years out yeah but like working for

1400
00:51:11,519 --> 00:51:17,000
those guys it was just like [ __ ]

1401
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:19,920
BigTime work fully illegal fully black

1402
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:23,358
market like you know Interstate [ __ ]

1403
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:25,480
just like it was it was big time and uh

1404
00:51:23,358 --> 00:51:27,719
I'll not I'll spare the details on this

1405
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:31,920
[ __ ] because I don't think that uh that

1406
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:31,919
uh statute of limitations is up but

1407
00:51:32,119 --> 00:51:37,039
um um but like we got flown so [ __ ]

1408
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:39,960
hard bro like I cut down an acre of

1409
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:41,679
Hoops in like [ __ ] one one afternoon

1410
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:43,960
and transported it all to the separate

1411
00:51:41,679 --> 00:51:46,039
facility to [ __ ] dry it all and like

1412
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:48,440
we pulled off this [ __ ] like I don't

1413
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:50,039
know it was like a meager like 1200

1414
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:52,760
pound [ __ ] season but it should have

1415
00:51:50,039 --> 00:51:55,400
been like [ __ ] like 4,000 PBS if we

1416
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:57,040
had actually Let It Go but um you know

1417
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:59,039
know when you've got a hel a blacked out

1418
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:01,000
helicopter with a giant [ __ ] camera

1419
00:51:59,039 --> 00:52:04,558
flying 50 feet over your greenh houses

1420
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:06,400
ripping skins off of them like you know

1421
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:08,040
that the it's it's just a matter of time

1422
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,519
before they come back you know what I

1423
00:52:08,039 --> 00:52:11,318
mean and so I'm like [ __ ] it I'll

1424
00:52:09,519 --> 00:52:13,039
Harvest 10 or 14 days early I don't give

1425
00:52:11,318 --> 00:52:16,239
a [ __ ] getting something's better than

1426
00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:18,599
nothing and so uh uh we did all right

1427
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:19,919
that year the quality was like not great

1428
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:22,798
that was kind of like the beginning of

1429
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:24,920
my decline in growing good weed and like

1430
00:52:22,798 --> 00:52:26,759
kind of just being like a mids guy that

1431
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:29,680
just like grew at massive

1432

1447
00:53:01,639 --> 00:53:05,598
when it comes to weed movement bro well

1448
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:07,558
especially when like you're with like

1449
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:09,400
people and like I wasn't in this side of

1450
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:11,000
it I was just like a guy that grew

1451
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:13,400
flower you know they had this whole

1452
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,599
other oil side of it but like bro they

1453
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:18,318
were pumping out [ __ ] weight like

1454
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:19,559
flooding cities yeah it sounds like it

1455
00:53:18,318 --> 00:53:22,920
yeah they were they were doing some

1456
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:24,798
serious [ __ ] work and so um um we

1457
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:27,079
took a bunch of money and I knew some

1458
00:53:24,798 --> 00:53:29,119
guys in Oklahoma that I had met in La

1459
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:32,359
previously because like through some

1460
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:34,760
[ __ ] weird thing um one of the guys

1461
00:53:32,358 --> 00:53:36,279
that was a grower in La his they they

1462
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:38,559
those were all Mexican dudes right down

1463
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:40,119
in La it was this whole Mexican family a

1464
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:41,640
bunch of dudes in the family worked for

1465
00:53:40,119 --> 00:53:44,358
him growing and doing different things

1466
00:53:41,639 --> 00:53:46,838
for him and um one of them when they

1467
00:53:44,358 --> 00:53:50,480
first came over um from Mexico they

1468
00:53:46,838 --> 00:53:53,358
landed in Oklahoma and so um he knew

1469
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:55,760
some dudes from school that were um this

1470
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:57,639
one dude Drew and this one dude Pedro

1471
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,839
and they all knew each other from school

1472
00:53:57,639 --> 00:54:01,639
and so

1473
00:53:58,838 --> 00:54:03,558
um uh they were coming out to LA to see

1474
00:54:01,639 --> 00:54:05,039
how weeds grown at like scale so they

1475
00:54:03,559 --> 00:54:06,680
could set up their own legal grow

1476
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:08,838
because like Oklahoma was about to like

1477
00:54:06,679 --> 00:54:10,078
vote in medical yeah and so they were

1478
00:54:08,838 --> 00:54:11,679
getting all their ducks in a row because

1479
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:14,680
they were like smartass [ __ ]

1480
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:16,759
20-year-old kids man like 21y old guys

1483
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:22,880

like on that first year man weed was

1538
00:56:18,119 --> 00:56:23,318
worth so much [ __ ] money in Oklahoma

1539
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:24,920
that first summer cuz nobody everybody

1540
00:56:23,318 --> 00:56:26,838
had set up some like pretty small

1541
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:29,798
indoors and was kind of like slowly

1542
00:56:26,838 --> 00:56:31,480
growing like I set up a 12 lighter next

1543
00:56:29,798 --> 00:56:34,159
grow I'm going to double it all back in

1544
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:35,559
set up 24 that's what Drew and Pedro did

1545
00:56:34,159 --> 00:56:36,920
and they [ __ ] made it they filled

1546
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:39,640
that warehouse and now I think they have

1547
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:43,000
like 150 200 lights and they're this

1548
00:56:39,639 --> 00:56:44,598
nice self-sustaining unit um but like we

1549
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:47,318
just went out there and blew it out

1550
00:56:44,599 --> 00:56:49,440
immediately like from the first 10 weeks

1551
00:56:47,318 --> 00:56:51,960
I started building like I started with a

1552
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:54,358
raw piece of dirt and within 10 weeks I

1553
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:57,119
had a greenhouse lit up with [ __ ]

1554
00:56:54,358 --> 00:57:00,440
gavita filled with plants like [ __ ]

1555
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:02,079
ready to roll flowering you know and so

1556
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:04,079
uh we made really good money that first

1557
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:06,280
year man I was selling some light depth

1558

1559
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:10,680
18800

1560
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,880
each and like people lining up to buy

1561
00:57:10,679 --> 00:57:14,838
them you know yeah that's a good deal

1562
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:17,039
the weed sold itself that year like I

1563
00:57:14,838 --> 00:57:18,920

00:58:14,318 --> 00:58:20,519
donated mine for context to the people

1590
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:21,798
listening um and uh he told me it about

1591
00:58:20,519 --> 00:58:23,079
six months and that's what the doctors

1592
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:25,759
say too is like you're going to just

1593
00:58:23,079 --> 00:58:27,760
feel weird and off and like not a lot of

1594
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:29,520
energy and like you'll start feeling

1595
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:30,920
more normal around six months in because

1596
00:58:29,519 --> 00:58:33,280
like your kidney your other kidney

1597
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:36,119
literally has to like swell up and grow

1598
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:37,760
bigger to accommodate the workload wow

1599
00:58:36,119 --> 00:58:40,280
that can't feel good either that cannot

1600
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:41,920
be a fun feeling no and it's like a lot

1601
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:43,319
of expenditure for your body because

1602
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:45,519
it's like a kidney is like you like a

1603
00:58:43,318 --> 00:58:47,279
filtering vessel you know what I mean

1604
00:58:45,519 --> 00:58:49,119
and so it's just like packed full of

1605
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,119
like really thin capillaries and

1606
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:53,358
vasculature and like it literally has to

1607
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:55,358
enlarge itself AB like where it normally

1608
00:58:53,358 --> 00:58:58,358
never would you know

1609
00:58:55,358 --> 00:59:00,639
and so like supposedly like I'll go from

1610
00:58:58,358 --> 00:59:02,719
like you know 50% kidney function

1611
00:59:00,639 --> 00:59:05,118
immediately after surgery or less and I

1612
00:59:02,719 --> 00:59:07,519
should go up to about like 80% by the

1613
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:09,559
time I'm Healed maximum though is 80

1614
00:59:07,519 --> 00:59:11,318
yeah yeah 80 yeah that's kind of the

1615
00:59:09,559 --> 00:59:16,480
high end of what what the what they

1616
00:59:11,318 --> 00:59:19,960
expect your single after donations yeah

1617
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:21,639

slapped together for you and booze I was

1678
01:01:25,679 --> 01:01:28,960
like I wish I hadn't missed the moment

1679
01:01:27,519 --> 01:01:30,719
because this would [ __ ] land if

1680
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:34,559
you're like your comment was still like

1681
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:37,399
in view the context Dan is making fun of

1682
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:39,680
me and booze and our accents and a

1683
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:41,960
affiliation with sheep and

1684
01:01:39,679 --> 01:01:43,639
stuff well just the way that you said it

1685
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:46,199
you were like we were we were so much

1686
01:01:43,639 --> 01:01:49,798
cooler and nicer and smarter than those

1687
01:01:46,199 --> 01:01:53,439
Australian settlers were I'm just like

1688
01:01:49,798 --> 01:01:57,119
says the man that wasn't colonized yeah

1689
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:59,079
right that's beautiful yeah oh I love

1690
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:01,318
when white dudes start comparing like

1691
01:01:59,079 --> 01:02:03,039
colonizer debt to like where they live

1692
01:02:01,318 --> 01:02:05,000
I'm just like we're all [ __ ] man we're

1693
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:07,440
all from the British like and we're all

1694
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:09,079
[ __ ] weird because of it like once I

1695
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:11,639
started learning about like weird

1696
01:02:09,079 --> 01:02:13,760
British nuances of like religion and

1697
01:02:11,639 --> 01:02:15,920
culture and stuff I'm like oh the whole

1698
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:18,119
white world makes sense to me now you

1699
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:20,400
know oh my God we were the weirdest

1700
01:02:18,119 --> 01:02:22,358
people we were the like you guys may be

1701
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:24,559
like prison colonies and all that [ __ ]

1702
01:02:22,358 --> 01:02:26,639
but like we were the weirdest religious

1703
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:27,920
people out of Britain out of all of them

1704
01:02:26,639 --> 01:02:29,679
and we're like we're gonna go make our

1705
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:32,039
own [ __ ] country and so that like

1706
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:33,639
sums up America in a nutshell you know

1707
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:35,720
like why we have all this Evangelical

1708
01:02:33,639 --> 01:02:38,038
Christian nonsense and just like a

1709
01:02:35,719 --> 01:02:40,439
million different types of Christianity

1710
01:02:38,039 --> 01:02:43,079
that are all like so different you know

1711
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:45,079
what I mean oh my God guys let's not go

1712
01:02:43,079 --> 01:02:47,000
here for this no I know I'm sorry I'm

1713
01:02:45,079 --> 01:02:49,680
sorry we're getting contr to say on this

1714
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:52,358
topic but I I mean I agree that all

1715
01:02:49,679 --> 01:02:55,399
these all these colonies are just like

1716
01:02:52,358 --> 01:03:00,558
weird uh quarantine mutations of British

1717
01:02:55,400 --> 01:03:02,798
culture 100% yeah yeah 100% but um I had

1718
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:04,640
to like genuinely look up famous people

1719
01:03:02,798 --> 01:03:06,239
from New Zealand because I was just like

1720
01:03:04,639 --> 01:03:07,159
oh I know like lordy but that's not

1721
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:11,358
gonna

1722
01:03:07,159 --> 01:03:13,759
land yeah and so I found out that I was

1723
01:03:11,358 --> 01:03:15,358
like oh like [ __ ] Russell Crow I was

1724
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:20,839
like I found out he's a [ __ ] kiwi

1725
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:24,519
Romper pper bro yeah oh man

1726
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:27,639
a a controversy people be angry you

1727
01:03:24,519 --> 01:03:30,880
mentioned him because really he was like

1728
01:03:27,639 --> 01:03:32,159
born in New Zealand but he's living not

1729
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:34,960
oh see and that's what I thought I

1730
01:03:32,159 --> 01:03:36,960
thought he was an Aussie yeah um but for

1731
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:38,720
booze I threw up a [ __ ] image of like

1732
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:41,400
Steve Irwin when he was young like

1733
01:03:38,719 --> 01:03:41,399
bottle feeding

1734
01:03:42,719 --> 01:03:48,159
kangaroos like obviously that's how they

1735
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:50,278
all live right obviously back Jack all

1736
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:51,759
right last side tangent on this note I

1737
01:03:50,278 --> 01:03:53,719
was watching this [ __ ] weird ass

1738
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:55,000
video on YouTube about like permaculture

1739
01:03:53,719 --> 01:03:56,919
in Australia

1740
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,960
and there's just this dude in like super

1741
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:01,480
short cut off jean shorts and he's just

1742
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:03,119
like this Outback Rancher dude and in

1743
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:04,679
every single scene of where they're

1744
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:07,240
interviewing him he's rolling a

1745
01:04:04,679 --> 01:04:09,000

friends with he's a mentor of me and

1776
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:26,838
like he's the one that [ __ ] him over

1777
01:05:25,519 --> 01:05:28,759
and like IID already sorted this out

1778
01:05:26,838 --> 01:05:30,199
with my boy like we're cool because he

1779
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:31,720
will pay you like that was the thing

1780
01:05:30,199 --> 01:05:33,960
that everyone said about this dude is he

1781
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:36,278
pays his debts he may be late he may be

1782
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:38,039
a dick but he pays his [ __ ] debts and

1783
01:05:36,278 --> 01:05:39,639
so like just wait bro it'll be a year

1784
01:05:38,039 --> 01:05:41,520
late but like you'll get paid the money

1785
01:05:39,639 --> 01:05:43,199
he owes you and like he [ __ ] came

1786
01:05:41,519 --> 01:05:44,798
through and he did it man and so like

1787
01:05:43,199 --> 01:05:47,278
the whole reason that we split up and

1788
01:05:44,798 --> 01:05:49,159
all that drama and all that [ __ ]

1789
01:05:47,278 --> 01:05:51,079
like it never even needed to happen

1790
01:05:49,159 --> 01:05:53,318
because what he was paranoid about was

1791
01:05:51,079 --> 01:05:54,880
that like I was going to [ __ ] him to get

1792
01:05:53,318 --> 01:05:57,079
back at him for my boy and I'm just like

1793
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:59,240
I'm not that petty bro yeah you know

1794
01:05:57,079 --> 01:06:00,240
what I mean like but that's that's to me

1795
01:05:59,239 --> 01:06:03,519
that's

1796
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:05,399
more him projecting and showing his

1797
01:06:03,519 --> 01:06:07,960
inner soul if that's where his mind is

1798
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:09,720
at that that would scare me to be real

1799
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:11,119
yeah yeah well I mean and it just like

1800
01:06:09,719 --> 01:06:13,118
that was the beginning of the end for

1801
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:15,599
him too was all that paranoia because

1802
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:17,640
like he started making bad moves and

1803
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:20,000
doing [ __ ] with even shadier people than

1804
01:06:17,639 --> 01:06:23,358
us and like you know uh he ended up

1805
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:25,119
getting [ __ ] murdered and uh that's a

1806
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:27,199
hard lesson

1807
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:28,960
yeah bro no it was like a dude that I

1808
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:31,318
like worked with and talked to like

1809
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:34,079
every day for years you know what I mean

1810
01:06:31,318 --> 01:06:35,759
and so um I didn't like him at the end

1811
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:38,079
but I still don't think that he deserved

1812
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:39,599
what he got you know like he was still a

1813
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:41,720
family man you know like I've eaten

1814
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:43,880
dinner with his [ __ ] wife and

1815
01:06:41,719 --> 01:06:45,358
kids and now his kids have to grow up

1816
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:47,798
without a dad just because of some

1817
01:06:45,358 --> 01:06:50,239
stupid [ __ ] funny money [ __ ] well I

1818
01:06:47,798 --> 01:06:53,000
mean that's going to happen a lot too

1819
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:55,719
more as we see cannabis like the

1820
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:57,838
downfall see a lot of people whose

1821
01:06:55,719 --> 01:07:00,639
characters we thought were very sound

1822
01:06:57,838 --> 01:07:03,440
kind of make decisions that are out of

1823
01:07:00,639 --> 01:07:05,400
character yeah and it man that's hard to

1824
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:07,079
watch it's hard watch there was enough

1825
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:09,440
money flowing around that like we always

1826
01:07:07,079 --> 01:07:11,798
made jokes of like of like oh this will

1827
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:13,240
be a fun part in the movie you know I

1828
01:07:11,798 --> 01:07:14,719
mean that's like goes back to that main

1829
01:07:13,239 --> 01:07:16,239
character syndrome [ __ ] that

1830
01:07:14,719 --> 01:07:17,399
everyone gets caught in it's just like

1831
01:07:16,239 --> 01:07:19,919
we thought we were the center of the

1832
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:21,720
[ __ ] world bro yeah and because like

1833
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:23,358
I didn't know anyone as big as us and if

1834
01:07:21,719 --> 01:07:26,838
they did they kept their mouth shut you

1835
01:07:23,358 --> 01:07:28,598
know what I mean yeah and so like um

1836
01:07:26,838 --> 01:07:30,639
yeah man it was just a weird time and it

1837
01:07:28,599 --> 01:07:32,720
just like led to me doing like a lot of

1838
01:07:30,639 --> 01:07:34,719
like being a lot more introspective and

1839
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:37,038
just like having to like [ __ ] eat

1840
01:07:34,719 --> 01:07:39,159
crow hard you know what I mean just like

1843
01:07:41,079 --> 01:07:44,720
and I was just like the one with my name

1844

1880
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:05,759
talked to local about it and he's like

1881
01:09:02,039 --> 01:09:08,759
oh it's 13 by my estimates yeah

1882
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:10,880
yeah and uh funny enough on the GMO

1883

topic those same dudes at highrise when

1884
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:15,199
they first started they got this cut of

1885
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:17,920
GMO and it was supposedly through some

1886
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:19,879
roundabout Source directly from skunk

1887
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:22,440
Tech and like his selected skunk Master

yeah yeah and uh

1890
01:09:25,238 --> 01:09:32,158
um it was a much shorter flowering way

1891
01:09:28,798 --> 01:09:34,119
nastier cut like it was like [ __ ] cat

1892
01:09:32,158 --> 01:09:36,358
piss and baby [ __ ] in his warehouse for

1893
01:09:34,119 --> 01:09:38,238
like two weeks even after he trimmed it

1894
01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:40,440
moved it out and sold it I walked into

1895
01:09:38,238 --> 01:09:42,798
his warehouse and I was like dude I can

1896
01:09:40,439 --> 01:09:46,000
still [ __ ] smell it but it was a nine

1897
01:09:42,798 --> 01:09:48,479
weer too and it was much much prettier

1898
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:50,960
like [ __ ] dense Cookie bud how was

1899
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:53,000
the high it was [ __ ] great like KD

1900
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:55,000
style but yeah that's interesting just

1901
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,399
[ __ ] great we and I've never seen it

1902
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,319
again they dropped it because there was

1903
01:09:56,399 --> 01:10:00,559
not that much demand for it you know

1904
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:02,279
like they're much more like modern hype

1905
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:04,000
boys and know how to play in that market

1906
01:10:02,279 --> 01:10:06,719
and not like trip over their dick and

1907
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,719
[ __ ] up yeah like I tried I'm more much

1908
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:10,439
I came from a Staples era of like

1909
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:12,119
wholesaling you know what I mean and

1910
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:14,039
that's the people I came up with and so

1911
01:10:12,119 --> 01:10:16,319
like I like growing whole Hoops of one

1912
01:10:14,039 --> 01:10:17,600
[ __ ] cut you know what I mean yeah

1913
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:20,599
like that's how it should be really

1914
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:22,280
experience it and see it and all of it's

1915
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:24,400
you can't dial it in if you're growing

1916
01:10:22,279 --> 01:10:26,279
[ __ ] six Cuts in every room or every

1917
01:10:24,399 --> 01:10:27,960
Greenhouse every time and they're

1918
01:10:26,279 --> 01:10:29,639
cycling through for the flavor of the

1919
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:31,079
month and flavor of the year you know

1920
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:33,679
like you just never actually get that

1921
01:10:31,079 --> 01:10:35,238
true genetic there's no way to like I I

1922
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:36,840
don't want to say master because I don't

1923
01:10:35,238 --> 01:10:38,599
think anybody's truly ever I mean maybe

1924
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:41,079
some people do I never have mastered

1925
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:42,280
anything that I feel M it but like

1926
01:10:41,079 --> 01:10:43,840
there's no way you're going to get to

1927
01:10:42,279 --> 01:10:46,439
truly have that relationship with the

1928
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:48,400
cup where you get to grow it to its best

1929
01:10:46,439 --> 01:10:50,279
expression unless you're constantly

1930
01:10:48,399 --> 01:10:51,759
growing to each round and learning it

1931
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:55,599
together and it's acclimating and you're

1932
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:57,280
acclimating to it yeah yeah and so like

1933
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:59,560
I came back to California after I

1934
01:10:57,279 --> 01:11:01,840
cleaned up that whole [ __ ] mess like

1935
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:04,199
lost every dime I had drove back with

1936
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:05,920
like my [ __ ] dog and my truck and my

1937
01:11:04,198 --> 01:11:08,158
[ __ ] dog died out there too like

1938
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:10,760
right before my son was born like this

1939
01:11:08,158 --> 01:11:13,079
dog I've had whole adult yeah so like my

1940
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:17,000

1941
01:11:13,079 --> 01:11:19,479
my dog got leukemia and died like my

1942
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:22,600
song bro yeah bro for real like my uh I

1943
01:11:19,479 --> 01:11:25,198

1944
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:26,679
my relationship

1945
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:28,719
this is only two two and a half years

1946
01:11:26,679 --> 01:11:31,719

1947
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:33,000
recovering from that dude oh 100% bro I

1948
01:11:31,719 --> 01:11:35,198

1949
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:38,399
realize how [ __ ] up I am and you know

1950
01:11:35,198 --> 01:11:40,359
like like oh that's not normal six years

1951
01:11:38,399 --> 01:11:42,079
yeah I understand yeah it's worth it man

1952
01:11:40,359 --> 01:11:44,000
like I just I couldn't find someone that

1953
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:45,760
was right but like I found someone my

1954
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:48,039
age and like apparently I like talking

1955
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:49,400
to women more than [ __ ] Bros that's

1956
01:11:48,039 --> 01:11:52,079
pretty

1957
01:11:49,399 --> 01:11:53,920
typical room normal found this great

1958
01:11:52,079 --> 01:11:56,519
chick who I [ __ ] talked to like every

1959
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:58,079
two weeks to a month and like um it's

1960
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:59,440
just nice to not have to listen to

1961
01:11:58,079 --> 01:12:01,119
someone else talk to you about their

1962
01:11:59,439 --> 01:12:03,000
[ __ ] afterwards you're just like right

1963
01:12:01,119 --> 01:12:06,158
just help me with my [ __ ] and then the

1964
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:08,000
call ends and then I'm bouncing yeah

1965
01:12:06,158 --> 01:12:09,319
it's it's it's super selfish and I feel

1966
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,679
bad about it but it's like I'm paying

1967
01:12:09,319 --> 01:12:14,198
for this [ __ ] service yeah I'm not gonna

1968
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:15,639
feel that bad yeah never well you know

1969
01:12:14,198 --> 01:12:17,319
Matt and I have been starting to talk a

1970
01:12:15,639 --> 01:12:19,279
little bit about like mental health

1971
01:12:17,319 --> 01:12:21,399
stuff and like taking care of yourself

1972
01:12:19,279 --> 01:12:23,519
you know especially in uh in this world

1973
01:12:21,399 --> 01:12:24,759
where we're like mostly dudes who don't

1974
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:27,199
seem to know how to take care of

1975
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:29,000
ourselves so yeah worth shouting out

1976
01:12:27,198 --> 01:12:30,960
especially in like Western culture it's

1977
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:33,520
like you're supposed to be this like

1978
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:35,560
[ __ ] stoic roll with the punches

1979
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:37,520
nothing bothers me we can overcome

1980
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:40,280
everything and it's like it's a tiring

1981
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:42,280
face to put on every day man sometimes

1982
01:12:40,279 --> 01:12:44,920
you just want to be like it's hard to be

1983
01:12:42,279 --> 01:12:47,599
vulnerable as like an American man [ __ ]

1984
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:49,600
no yeah sure because why you end up

1985
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:52,719
becoming is like a brittle like

1986
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:54,400
repressed mess right yeah yeah like oh

1987
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:55,920
like he's got issues and it's like

1988
01:12:54,399 --> 01:12:57,839
anyone that tells you that you have

1989
01:12:55,920 --> 01:13:01,279
daddy issues like you they probably do

1990
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:02,800
too man yeah yeah dude cuz it's like I

1991
01:13:01,279 --> 01:13:04,599
had someone try and tell me that and I'm

1992
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:06,639
just like you know like I don't have the

1993
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:08,440
best relationship with my dad like but I

1994
01:13:06,639 --> 01:13:10,639
know he loves me and I care about him

1995
01:13:08,439 --> 01:13:12,319
too even though we're not like always on

1996
01:13:10,639 --> 01:13:13,600
the same page or tight you know what I

1997
01:13:12,319 --> 01:13:15,319
mean so it's like I don't think that's

1998
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:16,760
it for me for me it's more just that

1999
01:13:15,319 --> 01:13:18,799
like I've never felt like I like

2000
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:21,679
belonged anywhere and that's why I was

2001
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:24,079
like so ready to like hop on board with

2002
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:25,920
these people that like didn't retrospect

2003
01:13:24,079 --> 01:13:28,359
ever really treat me well they paid me

2004
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:30,239
well they let me feel slightly part of

2005
01:13:28,359 --> 01:13:32,439
the crew and [ __ ] and it's like it's

2006
01:13:30,238 --> 01:13:34,599
that Get Like Me game that every Hustler

2007
01:13:32,439 --> 01:13:36,559
from every industry has is that it's

2008
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:39,039
just like oh well if you do what I'm

2009
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:40,639
doing and become my [ __ ] then like yeah

2010
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:42,639
we can [ __ ] you can get like me and

2011
01:13:40,639 --> 01:13:45,079
[ __ ] be rich too you can have all

2012
01:13:42,639 --> 01:13:46,760
this glamorous lifestyle and like it's a

2013
01:13:45,079 --> 01:13:49,559
classic hustle that I like see

2014
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:50,960
everywhere now you know I think yeah I

2015
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:53,639
just want to point out as well like what

2016
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:55,880
you were saying earlier like most people

2017
01:13:53,639 --> 01:13:58,560
I believe all they want is to be

2018
01:13:55,880 --> 01:14:00,000
accepted and to fit in somewhere but I

2019
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:01,679
think a lot of the time people get

2020
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,719
confused and they confuse that for like

2021
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:06,158
getting more power or like getting

2022
01:14:03,719 --> 01:14:08,000
higher up in a hierarchy but really A

2023
01:14:06,158 --> 01:14:10,319
lot of these people just want to like

2024
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:13,279
feel like they belong you know yeah and

2025
01:14:10,319 --> 01:14:15,759
so like I spent so long trying to become

2026
01:14:13,279 --> 01:14:17,679
this guy that made money and like was

2027
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:19,719
more like the people that I saw because

2028
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:21,279
like they would full on tell you like oh

2029
01:14:19,719 --> 01:14:22,719
you're just weak you haven't figured it

2030
01:14:21,279 --> 01:14:24,519
out yet like you know what I mean like

2031
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:26,800
you haven't [ __ ] sold your soul out

2032
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:28,159
enough to like be like me and so you

2033
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:30,239
just got to do this that and the other

2034
01:14:28,158 --> 01:14:32,198
don't be so emotional bro don't like

2035
01:14:30,238 --> 01:14:33,839
tell the truth you know don't yeah and

2036
01:14:32,198 --> 01:14:35,359
so like I went down this whole Rabbit

2037
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:37,319

2054
01:15:09,639 --> 01:15:13,000

2055
01:15:11,439 --> 01:15:15,559

pounds of [ __ ] but you know like I've

2057
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:19,960
realized that I suck at growing weed now

2058
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:21,639
as far as like my home setup like God I

2059
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:23,800
[ __ ] up the last like three runs in a

2060
01:15:21,639 --> 01:15:27,279
row you know cuz like I'm not used to

2061
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:28,679
not having my toys and my setup and like

2062
01:15:27,279 --> 01:15:30,679
you know like home growing is a

2063
01:15:28,679 --> 01:15:33,079
completely different skill set than

2064
01:15:30,679 --> 01:15:35,279
commercial growing and it's uh actually

2065
01:15:33,079 --> 01:15:37,158
I think much more challenging because

2066
01:15:35,279 --> 01:15:38,960
you have such unideal conditions in

2067
01:15:37,158 --> 01:15:41,000
certain ways depending on how you built

2068
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:42,800
it where you're at you know what I mean

2069
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,479
like where I'm at it's just the heat

2070
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:46,960
during the year and then like once the

2071
01:15:44,479 --> 01:15:48,839
heat's off it's [ __ ] cold man and so

2072
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:50,760
it's like you're going from running AC

2073
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:54,400
to [ __ ] running heaters inside your

2074
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:56,119
tent kind of thing you know and um like

2075
01:15:54,399 --> 01:15:58,719
I've just had a [ __ ] of a Time

2076
01:15:56,119 --> 01:16:03,238
controlling my environment you know yeah

2077
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:06,439
and so uh I've [ __ ] up a bunch of runs

2078
01:16:03,238 --> 01:16:07,959
now learned from a bunch of runs I have

2079
01:16:06,439 --> 01:16:09,359
man yeah no that's the whole thing is

2080
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:11,119
that it's just like I'm realizing more

2081
01:16:09,359 --> 01:16:12,920
and more that I got lucky when I was

2082
01:16:11,119 --> 01:16:15,039
younger homeg growing and I had some

2083
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:17,239
easy to grow cuts that I wish I still

2084
01:16:15,039 --> 01:16:19,479
had but like the other day you know like

2085
01:16:17,238 --> 01:16:21,439
I'm growing some testers right now and

2086
01:16:19,479 --> 01:16:23,559
like I sprayed some Dr zes at the

2087
01:16:21,439 --> 01:16:25,158
[ __ ] 4 ounce a gallon most of my

2088
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:28,159
plants are all fine those little

2089
01:16:25,158 --> 01:16:31,399
seedlings got [ __ ] fried

2090
01:16:28,158 --> 01:16:32,799
man God damn it dude like yeah why is

2091
01:16:31,399 --> 01:16:34,039
this these small and they're still

2092
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:36,079
they're teens you know they're all like

2093
01:16:34,039 --> 01:16:38,000
eight inches tall they're top they're

2094
01:16:36,079 --> 01:16:40,079
starting to grow out but for whatever

2095
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:43,479
reason those genetics just got like

2096
01:16:40,079 --> 01:16:45,880
fried by the Dr zes and um I don't

2097
01:16:43,479 --> 01:16:47,238
really like Dr zes like I remember when

2098
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:49,719
it came out when I was working at the

2099
01:16:47,238 --> 01:16:52,079
hydro shop I've never really liked it

2100
01:16:49,719 --> 01:16:54,520
Nukem is a better product if we're

2101
01:16:52,079 --> 01:16:56,920
plugging specific [ __ ] I like Nukem a

2102
01:16:54,520 --> 01:17:00,520
lot more don't make my mistakes and buy

2103
01:16:56,920 --> 01:17:04,079
Dr zes buy Nukem there you

2104
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:07,440

2105
01:17:04,079 --> 01:17:09,119
the server as well yeah this is quite a

2106
01:17:07,439 --> 01:17:12,158
random interjection I think I was saying

2107
01:17:09,119 --> 01:17:14,198
this to mat like yesterday maybe but

2108

2109
01:17:14,198 --> 01:17:18,839

2178
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:41,360
a seed guy of all kinds like I love

2179
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:44,000
seeds of flowers vegetables like I have

2180
01:19:41,359 --> 01:19:45,839
a massive collection in my refrigerator

2181
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,319
that's um that I'm like constantly

2182
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:49,920
trying to reup

2183
01:19:47,319 --> 01:19:51,238
on that's super cool I mean I just

2184
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:53,239
wonder right like especially after

2185
01:19:51,238 --> 01:19:55,238
you've been telling the story of like

2186
01:19:53,238 --> 01:19:56,759
some of your major realizations as you

2187
01:19:55,238 --> 01:19:59,198
got older and especially encountering

2188
01:19:56,760 --> 01:20:01,280
some of these like big failures yeah

2189
01:19:59,198 --> 01:20:03,879
like I wonder if that impacted the way

2190
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:05,880
you presented yourself to us on the oh

2191
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:08,279
for sure I was definitely did not come

2192
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:11,039
in here like big dick swinging at all

2193
01:20:08,279 --> 01:20:12,719
exactly I was like I'm a [ __ ] failure

2194
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:14,719
I because I was in like I was like

2195
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:16,520
[ __ ] depressed as [ __ ] when I first

2196
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:19,600
got on the server because I listened for

2197
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:21,000
probably the first year or so like I

2198
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:23,679
don't remember how long has this even

2199
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:26,800
been going now like three years now

2200
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:28,239
I mean yeah for for the actual show uh

2201
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:29,960
yeah I think two or three years two and

2202
01:20:28,238 --> 01:20:31,678
a half three years yeah something like

2203
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:33,880
that so I listened for the first year

2204
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:36,279
and a half or two years and then like I

2205
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:38,440
got on the server in like probably only

2206
01:20:36,279 --> 01:20:39,800
like October of last year that's right

2207
01:20:38,439 --> 01:20:41,079
you know what I mean some somewhere

2208
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:43,679
around there because it was like right

2209
01:20:41,079 --> 01:20:46,119
before I like took this job and like uh

2210
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:49,800
moved to like work for this

2211
01:20:46,119 --> 01:20:51,840
MSO um and so uh but anyway I go I'm

2212

2279
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:21,360
you look like I've never seen that

2280
01:23:19,039 --> 01:23:24,079
picture yeah I've got to scroll I got to

2281
01:23:21,359 --> 01:23:26,960
[ __ ] I think I a photo when I was in

2282
01:23:24,079 --> 01:23:29,519
like um that's right I did when I was in

2283
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:31,158
uh in the surgery prep or whatever I was

2284
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:32,760
I was dming with you because I was just

2285
01:23:31,158 --> 01:23:34,719
like I had to chill at the hospital so

2286
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:38,440
like when you do a kidney donation

2287
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:40,198
normally the donor goes in first and

2288
01:23:38,439 --> 01:23:41,719
they take it out and then they prep the

2289
01:23:40,198 --> 01:23:43,119
other they're prepping the other guy and

2290
01:23:41,719 --> 01:23:45,239
then they open him up and immediately

2291
01:23:43,119 --> 01:23:47,119
put it in yeah like my Dad's health was

2292
01:23:45,238 --> 01:23:50,519
like really bad he had had to have like

2293
01:23:47,119 --> 01:23:52,639
a double bypass for his heart um in the

2294
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:54,360
December before the surgery so like six

2295
01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:55,880
or seven months before and just like

2296
01:23:54,359 --> 01:23:58,079
really poor General Health just from

2297
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:59,679
being in kidney failure you know and so

2298
01:23:58,079 --> 01:24:00,960
they actually had to open him up first

2299
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:03,480
to even make sure that they could

2300
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:05,880
actually do the surgery you know because

2301
01:24:03,479 --> 01:24:07,678
they have to basically like find uh

2302
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:09,920
vasculature and like find veins and

2303
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:11,719
arteries to match up to that'll actually

2304
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:13,359
Supply adequate blood flow and they were

2305
01:24:11,719 --> 01:24:16,158
really worried that they wouldn't have

2306
01:24:13,359 --> 01:24:17,319
that that' all be like AC adapter yeah

2307
01:24:16,158 --> 01:24:19,079
right they were just worried it'd be

2308
01:24:17,319 --> 01:24:21,279
like really atrophied and so like I had

2309
01:24:19,079 --> 01:24:24,359
to like sit there and wait not knowing

2310
01:24:21,279 --> 01:24:26,599
if I was having surgery or not like 5 to

2311
01:24:24,359 --> 01:24:29,479
like 900 a.m. and so I was just like

2312
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:31,199
scrolling through the [ __ ] uh um the

2313
01:24:29,479 --> 01:24:33,198
server and [ __ ] you know what I mean

2314
01:24:31,198 --> 01:24:34,879
just bullshitting on General chat and

2315
01:24:33,198 --> 01:24:37,839
like [ __ ] trying to keep my mind off

2316
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:39,880
it and um started doing like a little

2317
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:42,719
bit of writing that I've like continued

2318
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:44,600
doing um because that's like I have a

2319
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:46,520
lot to say Obviously you know like I

2320
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:48,239
have the [ __ ] gift of the gab I can

2321
01:24:46,520 --> 01:24:51,600
talk for [ __ ] ever especially about

2322
01:24:48,238 --> 01:24:53,919
weed you know and so I was like oh if

2323
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:55,679
you're so [ __ ] opinionated and nobody

2324
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:57,440
wants to like listen to you say it in

2325
01:24:55,679 --> 01:24:59,679
person like that's kind of like Prime

2326
01:24:57,439 --> 01:25:01,238
material for being a writer it is you

2327
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:03,840
know what I mean and I've been

2328
01:25:01,238 --> 01:25:06,079
encouraging Matt WR not nobody wants to

2329
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:07,760
hear my [ __ ] you well so and that's like

2330
01:25:06,079 --> 01:25:10,079
what I thought too and so when I started

2331
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:12,560
talking to normal people like like

2332
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:15,000
talking to nurses and like [ __ ] nurse

2333
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:16,159
practitioners when like I was doing all

2334
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:18,639
this and they're just like oh what are

2335
01:25:16,158 --> 01:25:21,039
you do and I just [ __ ] roll my eyes

2336
01:25:18,639 --> 01:25:22,639
and I'm just like I'm a weed guy you

2337
01:25:21,039 --> 01:25:24,960
know what I mean because it's you know

2338
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:27,639
it's going to spark like [ __ ] hundred

2339
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:29,920
run on questions afterwards you know and

2340
01:25:27,639 --> 01:25:31,520
it's just cuz they have no [ __ ] clue

2341
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:33,679
and so like then you have to like try

2342
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:35,360
and summarize your entire experience in

2343
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:37,319
the weed industry and what it's like and

2344
01:25:35,359 --> 01:25:38,639
like a few sentences and a casual

2345
01:25:37,319 --> 01:25:40,519
conversation like it just doesn't

2346
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:42,480
[ __ ] work yeah and so it's like I

2347
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:44,920
don't think that I had any like unique

2348
01:25:42,479 --> 01:25:47,399
or like amazing or like scaled once in

2349
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:50,039
a-lifetime experience like in the in

2350
01:25:47,399 --> 01:25:52,638
this industry but like it was definitely

2351
01:25:50,039 --> 01:25:55,560
just like an uncommon experience for

2352
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:58,039
normal people you know what I

2353
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:59,920
mean like I don't know how to do it like

2354
01:25:58,039 --> 01:26:02,118
I have no skill in writing you know like

2355
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:04,359
I can write decently I went to college

2356
01:26:02,118 --> 01:26:05,920
like but I'm much more on like the

2357
01:26:04,359 --> 01:26:08,000
scientific side you know what I mean

2358
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:09,920
like we can talk writing another time

2359
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:12,560
Eric because that is something that I'm

2360
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:14,359
also sort of interested in um at this

2361
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:16,400
stage I think we did want to ask you

2362
01:26:14,359 --> 01:26:17,920
about some of the tech that you got to

2363
01:26:16,399 --> 01:26:20,599
play with and some of the projects that

2364
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:22,760
you got to do um Matt mentioned

2365
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:25,719
something about you scoping pollen

2366
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:28,199
brains oh yeah yeah so that's been a big

2367
01:26:25,719 --> 01:26:29,920
thing with like the reversal research is

2368
01:26:28,198 --> 01:26:31,879
just like why are why are why are

2369
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:34,960
certain times it's a failure even though

2370
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:37,079
you have like a good pollen drop and so

2371
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:38,880
um I started just like doing the base

2372
01:26:37,079 --> 01:26:41,279
science behind pollen seeing what other

2373
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:43,159
people do for like pollen viability and

2374
01:26:41,279 --> 01:26:45,039
like number one you just scope it see if

2375
01:26:43,158 --> 01:26:47,719
it looks normal or not and then you can

2376
01:26:45,039 --> 01:26:49,880
start doing things like starch um

2377
01:26:47,719 --> 01:26:52,279
staining and so like you just put iodine

2378
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:53,960
on it because like a live pollen it's

2379
01:26:52,279 --> 01:26:56,118
basically a miniature plant like people

2380
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:58,639
have this misconception that pollen is

2381
01:26:56,118 --> 01:27:00,639
sperm cells from a plant and it's not

2382
01:26:58,639 --> 01:27:02,118
it's like a little microorganism and

2383
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:04,480
this thing they call the alteration of

2384
01:27:02,118 --> 01:27:06,399
generations in plants and so I

2385
01:27:04,479 --> 01:27:08,359
definitely did not know that yeah and so

2386
01:27:06,399 --> 01:27:10,599
like pollen is not a sperm cell it's a

2387
01:27:08,359 --> 01:27:13,920
miniature plant that's a small clump of

2388
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:15,719
cells like maybe 15 or so and it has the

2389
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:18,000
ability that once it germinates it

2390
01:27:15,719 --> 01:27:19,960
creates sperm cells in a pollen tube

2391
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:22,238
that then fertilize the egg exact the

2392
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:24,480
ovule itself is actually a separate

2393
01:27:22,238 --> 01:27:26,919
plant and type of plant like that's the

2394
01:27:24,479 --> 01:27:28,479
gapy is what they call it in botney so

2395
01:27:26,920 --> 01:27:30,760
like the plant you see and that you're

2396
01:27:28,479 --> 01:27:33,359
growing is the sporify and it's

2397
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:35,560
basically supposed to multiply itself

2398
01:27:33,359 --> 01:27:37,039
but the gapy which is like the big thing

2399
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:38,880
in flowering plants that like make

2400
01:27:37,039 --> 01:27:41,118
flowering plants what they are in like a

2401
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:44,319
separate lineage is the retention of

2402
01:27:41,118 --> 01:27:46,198
that ovule onto the sporify and so in

2403
01:27:44,319 --> 01:27:48,639
primitive plants it used to drop the

2404
01:27:46,198 --> 01:27:50,879
ovule like in seaweed for example it

2405
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:52,760
drops the ovule into the water current

2406
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:55,239
and the other sporify that's or the

2407
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:56,800
other gapy that's the male drops the

2408
01:27:55,238 --> 01:27:58,879
sperm into the water current and they

2409
01:27:56,800 --> 01:28:00,840
all just meet somewhere yeah you know

2410
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:03,118
what I mean so pollen's not sperm sorry

2411
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:05,560
to bust anyone's [ __ ]

2412
01:28:03,118 --> 01:28:07,599
bubble like it's funny because we use

2413
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:09,520
that that like illusion for people who

2414
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:10,960
don't understand like how males and

2415
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:14,040
females reproduce but you're you're

2416
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:16,639
exactly right like it's not the same

2417
01:28:14,039 --> 01:28:18,439
method of action yeah I guess I guess I

2418
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:20,319
never mentioned at all that like when I

2419
01:28:18,439 --> 01:28:22,519
was at humble or I guess I I did say I

2420
01:28:20,319 --> 01:28:25,238
was studying botney but like I studied a

2421
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:26,639
lot of like seaweed andology too and

2422
01:28:25,238 --> 01:28:28,479
like that's where you really get into

2423
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:30,039
the nitty-gritty of like how plants

2424
01:28:28,479 --> 01:28:31,759
evolved because it all happened in the

2425
01:28:30,039 --> 01:28:34,359
water to begin with oh that's

2426
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:37,360
interesting yeah like all modern plants

2427
01:28:34,359 --> 01:28:39,319
come from like you know in the in water

2428
01:28:37,359 --> 01:28:41,238
first and then they come to land and

2429
01:28:39,319 --> 01:28:42,920
that's where you get into like micro isy

2430
01:28:41,238 --> 01:28:44,439
and their co-evolution with plants

2431
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:46,359
because plants didn't have Roots as we

2432
01:28:44,439 --> 01:28:47,719
know them when they first evolved and

2433
01:28:46,359 --> 01:28:50,759
made it on the land so they actually

2434
01:28:47,719 --> 01:28:52,560
needed that relationship to absorb

2435
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:53,840
nutrients and minerals

2436
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:55,719
other things they need from the

2437
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:57,639
environment you know and so that's why

2438
01:28:55,719 --> 01:29:00,639
we have that like symbiosis you know

2439
01:28:57,639 --> 01:29:02,560
it's not just like MOS powder that we

2440
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:06,199
figured out works with weed plants you

2441
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:07,719
know yeah for sure there was like a time

2442
01:29:06,198 --> 01:29:09,599
in that I didn't know that all this [ __ ]

2443
01:29:07,719 --> 01:29:11,359
was applicable either that it's like for

2444
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:13,320
all plants you know what I mean like oh

2445
01:29:11,359 --> 01:29:15,559
micro rizy that's just like something we

2446
01:29:13,319 --> 01:29:18,118
have from like forestry and like

2447
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:19,920
knowledge of trees and micology that

2448
01:29:18,118 --> 01:29:21,279
like we've applied to agriculture it's

2449
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:24,039
not that we like discovered it in

2450
01:29:21,279 --> 01:29:25,759
agriculture first you know yeah and so

2451
01:29:24,039 --> 01:29:27,158
like you can get this like closed view

2452
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:28,560
that it's like oh this is just a weed

2453
01:29:27,158 --> 01:29:31,319
thing and it's like no man it's just a

2454
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:32,800
thing for plants you know absolutely

2455
01:29:31,319 --> 01:29:34,198
when you get really deep in your Canon

2456
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:36,600
knowledge you'd be surprised how much of

2457
01:29:34,198 --> 01:29:38,919
it like crosses over you know it's just

2458
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:40,760
general knowledge about plants I also

2459
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:42,719
think that it's a bit narrow-minded for

2460
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:44,840
people who grow these plants to just

2461
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:46,880
look at resources about growing these

2462
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:48,319
plants like even doing the research for

2463
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:50,400
some of the breeding episodes that we

2464
01:29:48,319 --> 01:29:52,439
did it was so cool to go and look at

2465
01:29:50,399 --> 01:29:54,719
like apple tree

2466
01:29:52,439 --> 01:29:56,919
or like citrus you know and look at what

2467
01:29:54,719 --> 01:29:59,158
they had done and like the history of

2468
01:29:56,920 --> 01:30:02,118
the breeding development for those kinds

2469
01:29:59,158 --> 01:30:04,399
of crops um there's so much out there

2470
01:30:02,118 --> 01:30:07,039
that like yeah you know people shouldn't

2471
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:08,839
be scared to go and dig through well and

2472
01:30:07,039 --> 01:30:10,920
one thing I've noticed too is that like

2473
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:12,560
getting an education in plant breeding

2474
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:14,239
that's not really going to help you in

2475
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:16,840
cannabis because all the tools you get

2476
01:30:14,238 --> 01:30:18,559
used to using they just don't [ __ ]

2477
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:20,440
exist yet there's no standards there's

2478
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:23,159
no protocols maybe there are for private

2479
01:30:20,439 --> 01:30:25,000
Industries with [ __ ] like is doing you

2480
01:30:23,158 --> 01:30:27,559
know what I mean but like beyond that

2481
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:29,479
man like [ __ ] nobody has this [ __ ] as

2482
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:32,800
like public information to learn from

2483
01:30:29,479 --> 01:30:34,718
and do and so like a lot of advanced

2484
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:38,000
genomics are predicated on like oh well

2485
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:40,158
I know every freaking Al of every Gene

2486
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:42,198
in this entire genome and like we don't

2487
01:30:40,158 --> 01:30:44,118
that's what we had to man that's what we

2488
01:30:42,198 --> 01:30:46,799
had to try and like drive home when we

2489
01:30:44,118 --> 01:30:48,679
were doing our uh seed making and

2490
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:52,360
breeding episodes to kind of like draw

2491
01:30:48,679 --> 01:30:55,079
the line between where the science

2492
01:30:52,359 --> 01:30:57,439
can really apply for people at home or

2493
01:30:55,079 --> 01:30:59,000
like you know at smaller scales and

2494
01:30:57,439 --> 01:31:00,759
being like look there's a lot of this

2495
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:04,238
that's idealized that just doesn't work

2496
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:07,320
for us yeah well people get scared about

2497
01:31:04,238 --> 01:31:10,319
like um you know crisper technology and

2498
01:31:07,319 --> 01:31:12,319
stuff like that I'm just like it's it's

2499
01:31:10,319 --> 01:31:14,118
just not quite there yet you know what I

2500
01:31:12,319 --> 01:31:17,599
mean we're still going through the

2501
01:31:14,118 --> 01:31:20,799
basics of like really old school 70s and

2502
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:22,520
80s Tech of like uh making polyploids

2503
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:24,119
and things like that you

2504
01:31:22,520 --> 01:31:27,199
like there's still not a general

2505
01:31:24,118 --> 01:31:29,960
consensus of like whether that's like

2506
01:31:27,198 --> 01:31:32,000
even valuable to do or not you know like

2507
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:34,158
there isn't a certain aspect of like oh

2508
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:37,359
a triploid plant can't be pollinated by

2509
01:31:34,158 --> 01:31:39,198
like a diploid or a tetrol that's cool

2510
01:31:37,359 --> 01:31:41,759
you know what I mean like but it's it's

2511
01:31:39,198 --> 01:31:43,638
for like midy field grown weed that

2512
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:45,239
doesn't need to be perfect anyway who

2513
01:31:43,639 --> 01:31:46,639
gives a [ __ ] if your field grown weed

2514
01:31:45,238 --> 01:31:49,198
has some [ __ ] seeds in it we're going

2515
01:31:46,639 --> 01:31:50,760
to blast it anyway right you know you're

2516
01:31:49,198 --> 01:31:52,719
G to sit it in the dirt anyways while

2517
01:31:50,760 --> 01:31:54,639
you're waiting to stack it yeah oh bro

2518
01:31:52,719 --> 01:31:57,439
when I was in Oklahoma I saw some weed

2519
01:31:54,639 --> 01:32:01,279
that was like field grown it was just

2520
01:31:57,439 --> 01:32:04,799
covered in clay and just like

2521
01:32:01,279 --> 01:32:08,319
disgusting absolutely combin harvested

2522
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:11,400
[ __ ] horrific weed and like they were

2523
01:32:08,319 --> 01:32:12,840
packaging it for sale like I was just

2524
01:32:11,399 --> 01:32:14,519
like you think you can sell this as

2525
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:15,600
flour and they're like we know we can

2526
01:32:14,520 --> 01:32:18,239
and I'm just

2527
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:19,760
like and they probably did man yeah yeah

2528
01:32:18,238 --> 01:32:22,759
I don't think they're probably doing too

2529
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:24,440
well anymore though I doubt it Oklahoma

2530
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:26,480
what's funny is that everyone talks [ __ ]

2531
01:32:24,439 --> 01:32:29,000
on it like it's this midy ass place for

2532
01:32:26,479 --> 01:32:31,559
weed Oklahoma has more fire weed on the

2533
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Shelf than California does because of a

2534
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:36,199
couple small groups that operate with

2535
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:38,760
high integrity and have been allowed to

2536
01:32:36,198 --> 01:32:40,960
like carve out their local Niche and

2537
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:42,679
they actually support small local

2538
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:44,960
companies out there they're like into

2539
01:32:42,679 --> 01:32:46,560
that and like California says they are

2540
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:48,279
but the second they got the chance to

2541
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:52,000
[ __ ] go dick ride some dude and get a

2542
01:32:48,279 --> 01:32:54,439
cookie hoodie [ __ ] they're lining up out

2543
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:56,960
the door but you know Lally yeah yeah

2544
01:32:54,439 --> 01:32:59,279
literally and so like it's the I've seen

2545
01:32:56,960 --> 01:33:02,198
things in Oklahoma like [ __ ] small

2546
01:32:59,279 --> 01:33:04,079
local boys who started off with nothing

2547
01:33:02,198 --> 01:33:06,039
Ascend to like the top of the industry

2548
01:33:04,079 --> 01:33:08,238
there to where like their [ __ ] sells out

2549
01:33:06,039 --> 01:33:09,920
every time they drop it you know like

2550
01:33:08,238 --> 01:33:11,799
they're making good [ __ ] money for

2551
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:13,679
themselves and like surviving this whole

2552
01:33:11,800 --> 01:33:15,920
[ __ ] bottom out of the industry

2553
01:33:13,679 --> 01:33:17,760
because they have a good solid business

2554
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:20,199
and a good solid base of customers that

2555
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:22,320
support them and uh you don't really see

2556
01:33:20,198 --> 01:33:24,000
that in California unless it's a giant

2557
01:33:22,319 --> 01:33:27,079
corporate company and that's I think

2558
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:29,760
just consistency overall you know oh I

2559
01:33:27,079 --> 01:33:32,600
go and I get [ __ ] permanent marker

2560
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:36,239
from DOA and it's the same every single

2561
01:33:32,600 --> 01:33:38,239
time it's like okay I can respect that

2562
01:33:36,238 --> 01:33:39,638
you know that's how product should be

2563
01:33:38,238 --> 01:33:41,279
yeah it should be consistent especially

2564
01:33:39,639 --> 01:33:43,840
if it's gonna be labeled as medic I look

2565
01:33:41,279 --> 01:33:45,079
at sunr as kind of like a vintage though

2566
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:48,560
you know what I mean I'm like this is

2567
01:33:45,079 --> 01:33:50,319
the 2018 or the 2023 crop you know what

2568
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:52,480
I mean it's going to have its own unique

2569
01:33:50,319 --> 01:33:54,799
Nuance to it even if it's the exact same

2570
01:33:52,479 --> 01:33:57,718
seeds or cuts that I grew the year

2571
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:59,199
before and so like I don't think that

2572
01:33:57,719 --> 01:34:01,520
there's like a lot of these large

2573
01:33:59,198 --> 01:34:03,799
companies want to like extrapolate to

2574
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:06,679
the Nationwide and worldwide and all

2575
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:09,119
that and I'm like dude I I I don't think

2576
01:34:06,679 --> 01:34:11,399
you really can because even an indoor

2577
01:34:09,118 --> 01:34:13,279
that's set up the same in the same city

2578
01:34:11,399 --> 01:34:14,879
and you can barely tell which [ __ ]

2579
01:34:13,279 --> 01:34:17,279
facility you're in because the rooms are

2580
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:19,039
so identical they put out a different

2581
01:34:17,279 --> 01:34:21,719
[ __ ] product than the one down the

2582
01:34:19,039 --> 01:34:24,198
road a few miles absolutely and it's no

2583
01:34:21,719 --> 01:34:25,760
L different in quality control to where

2584
01:34:24,198 --> 01:34:27,678
like they can spot it and tell you where

2585
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:29,400
it came from kind of thing you're like

2586
01:34:27,679 --> 01:34:31,760
oh it did this that's kind of like what

2587
01:34:29,399 --> 01:34:34,198
I see from this facility you know and

2588
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:35,560
it's like okay and like consumers know

2589
01:34:34,198 --> 01:34:37,719
too where they're like I'm looking for

2590
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:39,320
jars that say this and it's like I've

2591
01:34:37,719 --> 01:34:41,319
heard that echoed even on the first

2592
01:34:39,319 --> 01:34:43,359
smoke of the day from seed junkie and

2593
01:34:41,319 --> 01:34:45,238
those guys they were like people know

2594
01:34:43,359 --> 01:34:48,319
and the consumers like start recognizing

2595
01:34:45,238 --> 01:34:52,000
what facilities they want weed from and

2596
01:34:48,319 --> 01:34:53,599
so yeah um Dan I wanted to bring it back

2597
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:55,158
to some of the other projects that you

2598
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:57,880
may have done and I don't know how much

2599
01:34:55,158 --> 01:34:59,319
detail obviously you can speak to these

2600
01:34:57,880 --> 01:35:01,679
yeah for sure but I know you mentioned

2601
01:34:59,319 --> 01:35:03,319
like tissue tissue culture and it's

2602
01:35:01,679 --> 01:35:04,440
interesting to me because obviously most

2603
01:35:03,319 --> 01:35:06,039
of the time when someone brings up

2604
01:35:04,439 --> 01:35:08,039
tissue culture I kind of roll my eyes

2605
01:35:06,039 --> 01:35:09,719
because yeah you know it's like some

2606
01:35:08,039 --> 01:35:12,238
kind of they got scammed and they bought

2607
01:35:09,719 --> 01:35:14,560
some stupid home kit right but you are

2608
01:35:12,238 --> 01:35:16,559
someone who's probably actually seen on

2609
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:18,679
the ground like you know in a commercial

2610
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:20,800
industrial context what it actually is

2611
01:35:18,679 --> 01:35:22,719
or where it is yeah like what what are

2612
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:25,159
your thoughts on it at the moment I

2613
01:35:22,719 --> 01:35:27,520
think it is still so fledgling you know

2614
01:35:25,158 --> 01:35:29,439
what I mean like I think that the the

2615
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:33,719
the Bros with a science background like

2616
01:35:29,439 --> 01:35:36,000
me have figured out a lot of Basics um I

2617
01:35:33,719 --> 01:35:38,319
don't believe based on success rates

2618
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:41,800
I've seen that people are accurately

2619
01:35:38,319 --> 01:35:43,599
doing meristem cultures no I don't I

2620
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:46,000
just don't [ __ ] believe it I know

2621
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:48,920
it's a numbers game it's a numbers game

2622
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:51,840
so like you can do 12 perfectly executed

2623
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:54,000
marem cultures but only one comes up

2624
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:55,600
actually clean and virus absolutely and

2625
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:57,359
so there is a numbers game associated

2626
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:59,239
with it's not the technique that's wrong

2627
01:35:57,359 --> 01:36:02,238
it's just that I think that there's more

2628
01:35:59,238 --> 01:36:03,718
people kind of scamming other people by

2629
01:36:02,238 --> 01:36:05,879
teaching them techniques that are

2630
01:36:03,719 --> 01:36:07,520
technically proper but they don't have

2631
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:09,639
the success rates that they claim they

2632
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:11,960
do yeah people make it out like that if

2633
01:36:09,639 --> 01:36:14,118
I Marist stem something and then throw

2634
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:16,399
it in a thermocycler and like keep that

2635
01:36:14,118 --> 01:36:18,519
heat amped up that it'll like force the

2636
01:36:16,399 --> 01:36:21,079
virus to express and like oh it's free

2637
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:23,040
and I test it and it's free yeah and

2638
01:36:21,079 --> 01:36:25,559
like if that was the case then why is

2639
01:36:23,039 --> 01:36:27,880
hlvd still such a [ __ ] industry

2640
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:30,560
ruining crop for not just us but for

2641
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:33,279
hops too there's massive losses reported

2642
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:35,159
worldwide over hlvd and hops has way

2643
01:36:33,279 --> 01:36:37,759
much more way more money and traditional

2644
01:36:35,158 --> 01:36:40,158
a behind it than we do and they still

2645
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:41,360
haven't figured it out for them I have

2646
01:36:40,158 --> 01:36:43,039
kind of like two different questions

2647
01:36:41,359 --> 01:36:44,559
because I know people are interested in

2648
01:36:43,039 --> 01:36:46,560
tissue culture for a couple of different

2649
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:48,639
reasons one is just for preservation

2650
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:49,960
right I think that's its key feature

2651
01:36:48,639 --> 01:36:51,560
that's it only feature and then the

2652
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:53,279
other one and then the other one being

2653
01:36:51,560 --> 01:36:56,880
like cleaning it up right cleaning up

2654
01:36:53,279 --> 01:36:58,960
Cuts there's a third so in terms of the

2655
01:36:56,880 --> 01:37:01,560
okay yeah what's the third one third is

2656
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:03,840
actually commercial propagation yeah

2657
01:37:01,560 --> 01:37:06,159
it's unnecessary though it's but but

2658
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:09,400
like with that like what they found out

2659
01:37:06,158 --> 01:37:12,000
was they cannot insert these these

2660
01:37:09,399 --> 01:37:13,759
tissue culture clones immediately and

2661
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:15,238
then grow them because they had so many

2662
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:17,400
hormones that they were all just firing

2663
01:37:15,238 --> 01:37:19,000
off nuts and [ __ ] balls everywhere

2664
01:37:17,399 --> 01:37:21,519
well not only that it's like there's a

2665
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:24,399
long turnaround time from turning a

2666
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:26,080
plantlet into like a fullsize teen yeah

2667
01:37:24,399 --> 01:37:29,359
you know what I mean like that veg time

2668
01:37:26,079 --> 01:37:31,639
is [ __ ] consistently or like like

2669
01:37:29,359 --> 01:37:33,479
genuinely a lot longer than if I just

2670
01:37:31,639 --> 01:37:35,840
cut a clone and grow it abolutely and so

2671
01:37:33,479 --> 01:37:38,479
the main application that I see is like

2672
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:40,400
tissue cultured and Marist stemmed moms

2673
01:37:38,479 --> 01:37:41,759
and those getting cycled out quarterly

2674
01:37:40,399 --> 01:37:43,479
and then just doing like standard

2675
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:45,280
cloning protocols because like then

2676
01:37:43,479 --> 01:37:47,479
you're cutting off of a clean Mom that's

2677
01:37:45,279 --> 01:37:50,118
routinely getting cycled through it's

2678
01:37:47,479 --> 01:37:52,479
getting tested and verified quarterly

2679
01:37:50,118 --> 01:37:54,439
and like then you you're you're starting

2680
01:37:52,479 --> 01:37:56,839
from a clean base but you also have the

2681
01:37:54,439 --> 01:37:59,319
efficiency of doing traditional

2682
01:37:56,840 --> 01:38:01,639
propagation say efficient yeah there's

2683
01:37:59,319 --> 01:38:03,279
no Market except for maybe hemp but hemp

2684
01:38:01,639 --> 01:38:06,000
can is all for extraction and you can

2685
01:38:03,279 --> 01:38:07,840
just use seed you know and so like there

2686
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:10,039
I just per like I don't there's so many

2687
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:12,639
techniques like synthetic seeds what's

2688
01:38:10,039 --> 01:38:14,840
the [ __ ] point it's super cool I've

2689
01:38:12,639 --> 01:38:17,159
I've tried to do it I had it almost

2690
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:18,800
right but it just like I I knew another

2691
01:38:17,158 --> 01:38:20,759
guy in La that did it and he's like well

2692
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:22,840
I can cryostor it for six months like

2693
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:24,840
this and still germinates and I'm like

2694
01:38:22,840 --> 01:38:26,599
so like but we could just do that with a

2695
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:28,079
tissue culture sample you know it we

2696
01:38:26,599 --> 01:38:30,679
could just do that with a normal culture

2697
01:38:28,079 --> 01:38:35,118
that's small do you remember when Dutch

2698
01:38:30,679 --> 01:38:39,639
Passion took that to Market they they

2699
01:38:35,118 --> 01:38:41,479
tried to do it it was in um 2009 I think

2700
01:38:39,639 --> 01:38:44,520
I might be off by fears but they

2701
01:38:41,479 --> 01:38:47,000
actually tried to take it to Market and

2702
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:49,239
what they were finding was that it it

2703
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:51,560
was so hard for people to germinate a

2704
01:38:49,238 --> 01:38:54,198
regular seed yeah you know that there

2705
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:56,159
was no way no way it was ever going to

2706
01:38:54,198 --> 01:38:57,439
last or be be financially viable or

2707
01:38:56,158 --> 01:39:00,279
commercially viable because people can't

2708
01:38:57,439 --> 01:39:03,198
even germinate a normal seed let alone

2709
01:39:00,279 --> 01:39:05,238
yeah a micro plantlet in this

2710
01:39:03,198 --> 01:39:07,079
encapsulated in a gel of [ __ ]

2711
01:39:05,238 --> 01:39:08,598
hormones yeah good [ __ ] luck with

2712
01:39:07,079 --> 01:39:10,800
that because it doesn't have it doesn't

2713
01:39:08,599 --> 01:39:15,599
have Roots you know what I mean how's it

2714
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:17,880
ever like without a lab it's hard yeah

2715
01:39:15,599 --> 01:39:19,520
so in terms of like the three kind of

2716
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:21,279
like main outcomes that people are

2717
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:24,119
looking for you know we said president

2718
01:39:21,279 --> 01:39:26,279
ation propagation cleaning up yeah are

2719
01:39:24,118 --> 01:39:29,679
we saying that like out of all three

2720
01:39:26,279 --> 01:39:32,158
like not in on on any of those fronts

2721
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:34,000
has not gone that far or it's not far

2722
01:39:32,158 --> 01:39:35,879
preservation is kind of like the main

2723
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:37,560
course as far as I'm concerned all the

2724
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:39,880
other things are kind of like yeah it

2725
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:42,639
can work people have shown that it does

2726
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:45,079
work in certain circumstances and not in

2727
01:39:42,639 --> 01:39:46,960
others um I think that we'll get to a

2728
01:39:45,079 --> 01:39:50,319
point where with like the right

2729
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:52,118
antivirals and uh proper marem culturing

2730
01:39:50,319 --> 01:39:53,479
and just proper technique overall of

2731
01:39:52,118 --> 01:39:55,920
knowing that it's like just because I

2732
01:39:53,479 --> 01:39:57,399
did the process doesn't mean it's clean

2733
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:59,960
then like we'll get to a point where we

2734
01:39:57,399 --> 01:40:02,079
can clean up plants to a certain degree

2735
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:03,679
um and maybe get them virus free because

2736
01:40:02,079 --> 01:40:05,319
like I trust that certain people are

2737
01:40:03,679 --> 01:40:07,440
smart enough to do it they're smarter

2738
01:40:05,319 --> 01:40:09,319
than me for sure you know what I mean

2739
01:40:07,439 --> 01:40:10,879
and I don't think it's an impossibility

2740
01:40:09,319 --> 01:40:12,960
I just think that like the people

2741
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:15,639
executing are just not our top tier

2742
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:18,000
individuals so like if Chimera told me

2743
01:40:15,639 --> 01:40:19,679
and some giant Canadian MSO told me that

2744
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,679
like no no we've nailed it and we

2745
01:40:19,679 --> 01:40:23,840
invested a few million in research and

2746
01:40:21,679 --> 01:40:26,118
we made it happen and like we're not

2747
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:27,599
sharing I'd believe it especially if

2748
01:40:26,118 --> 01:40:29,679
they weren't sharing if they were making

2749
01:40:27,599 --> 01:40:32,119
it public I'd be like no [ __ ]

2750
01:40:29,679 --> 01:40:33,960
way right right yeah nobody wants to

2751
01:40:32,118 --> 01:40:35,759
Share info and I I just think that's

2752
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:37,639
hilarious whenever you can't patent

2753
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:39,560
something they're like [ __ ] lip

2754
01:40:37,639 --> 01:40:41,079
sealed they're just like if we can't

2755
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:42,719
profit off it then we are not going to

2756
01:40:41,079 --> 01:40:43,960
allow anyone else to have it and so

2757
01:40:42,719 --> 01:40:46,198
that's just like another sign of the

2758
01:40:43,960 --> 01:40:48,639
breakdown of the culture going towards

2759
01:40:46,198 --> 01:40:51,238
more of a COR corporate culture is that

2760
01:40:48,639 --> 01:40:53,719
it's just like even if it's industrywide

2761
01:40:51,238 --> 01:40:56,439
like needed for the the community and

2762
01:40:53,719 --> 01:40:57,840
the industry to go on if one company has

2763
01:40:56,439 --> 01:41:00,319
it and no one else does they're not

2764
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:02,159
going to [ __ ] share it oh yeah no way

2765
01:41:00,319 --> 01:41:04,439
yeah there's too much money on the table

2766
01:41:02,158 --> 01:41:06,598
like um the people investing in these

2767
01:41:04,439 --> 01:41:08,559
companies are like billionaire hedge

2768
01:41:06,599 --> 01:41:10,319
funds and [ __ ] yeah they AR even a part

2769
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:12,840
of the culture like [ __ ] black rock

2770
01:41:10,319 --> 01:41:17,799
owns weed companies you

2771
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:20,560
know yeah and so like um the everything

2772
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:23,520
is is profit motivated obviously but

2773
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:25,960
like um it's like I'd like to make a a

2774
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:28,320
living doing this obviously too but it's

2775
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:29,960
just like at the cost of other people in

2776
01:41:28,319 --> 01:41:32,479
the community and not for the betterment

2777
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:35,158
of it but actually to like detract from

2778
01:41:32,479 --> 01:41:39,158
it it's it seems it's it's [ __ ] in my

2779
01:41:35,158 --> 01:41:42,000
opinion I agree so yeah I I kind of do

2780
01:41:39,158 --> 01:41:43,960
want to ask you about like what you see

2781
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:45,800
in the future for the industry but

2782
01:41:43,960 --> 01:41:48,599
before we get to that just noting we

2783
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:50,400
have about 20 30 minutes probably yeah I

2784
01:41:48,599 --> 01:41:53,000
hope I'm not being too greedy here but

2785
01:41:50,399 --> 01:41:54,559
like in terms of like your experience

2786
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:58,198
out outside of like say like the tissue

2787
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:59,480
culture stuff and like the uh reversal

2788
01:41:58,198 --> 01:42:00,960
stuff that you've talk to us about are

2789
01:41:59,479 --> 01:42:03,718
there any other kinds of projects or

2790
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:05,118
Teck that you wanted to highlight or

2791
01:42:03,719 --> 01:42:06,639
that you found interesting that you

2792
01:42:05,118 --> 01:42:10,158
could touch

2793
01:42:06,639 --> 01:42:12,599
on um I mean like a lot of the stuff's

2794
01:42:10,158 --> 01:42:15,359
pretty standard that I do honestly it's

2795
01:42:12,599 --> 01:42:18,719
just more like the rate that I do it at

2796
01:42:15,359 --> 01:42:21,118
that's like crazy cuz like I make

2797
01:42:18,719 --> 01:42:23,560
hybrids constantly like we have like a

2798
01:42:21,118 --> 01:42:27,359
fully fleshed out scheduled breeding

2799
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:29,320
program that's like [ __ ] to the date

2800
01:42:27,359 --> 01:42:31,439
these pollinations need to happen these

2801
01:42:29,319 --> 01:42:33,319
Cuts need to be taken these are the

2802
01:42:31,439 --> 01:42:35,919
selections these need to go on to the

2803
01:42:33,319 --> 01:42:37,719
next part of the process you know but

2804
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:39,719
like most of it's really standard it's

2805
01:42:37,719 --> 01:42:41,399
just the rate that we [ __ ] do it at

2806
01:42:39,719 --> 01:42:42,920
and the structure beyond that that I

2807
01:42:41,399 --> 01:42:44,439
think is really cool that I hadn't

2808
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:46,039
really experienced you know because like

2809
01:42:44,439 --> 01:42:48,799
whenever I did feno hunts it was like

2810
01:42:46,039 --> 01:42:50,800
one or two things at a time you know

2811
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:53,480
like I'm constantly feno hunting like

2812
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:56,159
[ __ ] 20 different things you know

2813
01:42:53,479 --> 01:42:57,598
taking notes [ __ ] like Crossing them

2814
01:42:56,158 --> 01:42:59,719
together doing all kinds of [ __ ] just

2815
01:42:57,599 --> 01:43:01,440
seeing what happens you know when we

2816
01:42:59,719 --> 01:43:02,679
were first met you you seemed a little

2817
01:43:01,439 --> 01:43:05,439
bit

2818
01:43:02,679 --> 01:43:06,880
like um hesitant to tell me like where

2819
01:43:05,439 --> 01:43:09,319
you worked for and stuff and I think

2820
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:11,079
like maybe maybe because people do judge

2821
01:43:09,319 --> 01:43:12,359
immediately like oh you're one of them

2822
01:43:11,079 --> 01:43:14,158
you know what I mean yeah and that's

2823
01:43:12,359 --> 01:43:16,479
what I was trying to hedge against yeah

2824
01:43:14,158 --> 01:43:18,359
get to know me first yeah but like

2825
01:43:16,479 --> 01:43:20,158
realistically from my point of view like

2826
01:43:18,359 --> 01:43:21,880
all I would think all I was thinking was

2827
01:43:20,158 --> 01:43:24,638
wow would an opportunity to go through a

2828
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:26,039
whole bunch of like any lines just to

2829
01:43:24,639 --> 01:43:28,800
like a

2830
01:43:26,039 --> 01:43:30,359
great totally advantageous and like I

2831
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:32,279
would have taken that job even with what

2832
01:43:30,359 --> 01:43:34,238
I do for I would have taken that job I

2833
01:43:32,279 --> 01:43:36,519
really yeah because of what you get to

2834
01:43:34,238 --> 01:43:38,559
see the scale at which you get to see it

2835
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:40,679
there's so much to learn for anyone

2836
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:42,800
anyone at any skill so I I applaud it

2837
01:43:40,679 --> 01:43:44,480
I'm glad you took it I think it's rad no

2838
01:43:42,800 --> 01:43:46,119
I have to remind myself of that pretty

2839
01:43:44,479 --> 01:43:47,959
constantly because there's parts of it

2840
01:43:46,118 --> 01:43:49,759
that I don't like you know what I mean

2841
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:52,639
like I see plants that I think should go

2842
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:54,679
forward that get smashed and tossed to

2843
01:43:52,639 --> 01:43:56,679
the side and thrown away because they're

2844
01:43:54,679 --> 01:43:58,960
not a perfect commercial offering on the

2845
01:43:56,679 --> 01:44:00,480
first hybrid you know but I'm like oh

2846
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:02,319
but that would be such a cool parental

2847
01:44:00,479 --> 01:44:03,879
for this reason or like this would be

2848
01:44:02,319 --> 01:44:06,439
like you know what I mean and it's just

2849
01:44:03,880 --> 01:44:08,118
like not there and so like that's the

2850
01:44:06,439 --> 01:44:10,799
part that I'm still like pushing for a

2851
01:44:08,118 --> 01:44:12,679
lot is just like not more control but

2852
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:15,480
just like more variety of like the

2853
01:44:12,679 --> 01:44:18,599
things that we're doing because um a lot

2854
01:44:15,479 --> 01:44:21,519
of people um including our competitors

2855
01:44:18,599 --> 01:44:23,599
and stuff they want like quick match UPS

2856
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:25,159
to like yeah be able to Market you know

2857
01:44:23,599 --> 01:44:27,199
what I mean because the market demands

2858
01:44:25,158 --> 01:44:29,719
it constantly now it's like you got to

2859
01:44:27,198 --> 01:44:31,559
have new [ __ ] at least twice a year if

2860
01:44:29,719 --> 01:44:33,920
you don't have two releases a year like

2861
01:44:31,560 --> 01:44:35,960
you're old news you know what I mean and

2862
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:37,800
like realistically like quarterly you

2863
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:40,118
better have one for every brand that you

2864
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:43,000
have like new Cuts coming down the

2865
01:44:40,118 --> 01:44:44,799
pipeline and so um I don't think people

2866
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:47,279
understand that like nowadays it's not

2867
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:49,279
so much of like what cuts do I have

2868
01:44:47,279 --> 01:44:52,079
access to it's like what hasn't been

2869
01:44:49,279 --> 01:44:54,238
done before what's actually new and

2870
01:44:52,079 --> 01:44:55,800
exciting that's like genuinely [ __ ]

2871
01:44:54,238 --> 01:44:58,359
hard to place your thumb on because it's

2872
01:44:55,800 --> 01:45:00,480
like I can cross ogs and Skittles and

2873
01:44:58,359 --> 01:45:02,519
[ __ ] sherb and all that [ __ ] but

2874
01:45:00,479 --> 01:45:04,000
guess what a ton of other people already

2875
01:45:02,520 --> 01:45:07,000
have it's already been released it's

2876
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:09,000
cycled through the market and So like um

2877
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:10,719
like where to go next is honestly I

2878
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:12,880
think the big question for everyone like

2879
01:45:10,719 --> 01:45:14,760
we're still riding cookies hype to this

2880
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:17,319
day it may have changed its name

2881
01:45:14,760 --> 01:45:20,119
slightly to seed junkie or to [ __ ]

2882
01:45:17,319 --> 01:45:21,559
Doo or whatever yeah [ __ ] Tony meno

2883
01:45:20,118 --> 01:45:24,000
and all those dudes and their Skittles

2884
01:45:21,560 --> 01:45:26,080
run but like it's really even all of

2885
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:28,560
that is still predicated on cookies it

2886
01:45:26,079 --> 01:45:30,279
is all predicated on cookies it's the

2887
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:32,760
perfect moment for me to ask you then

2888
01:45:30,279 --> 01:45:35,679
like what has been historically some of

2889
01:45:32,760 --> 01:45:39,280
your favorite stuff to grow and smoke

2890
01:45:35,679 --> 01:45:40,719
grow and consume but also like what

2891
01:45:39,279 --> 01:45:43,319
areas of the gene pool do you think

2892
01:45:40,719 --> 01:45:47,480
still hold potential for the

2893
01:45:43,319 --> 01:45:49,679
future um I mean one is like the past

2894
01:45:47,479 --> 01:45:51,718
and one part is the future I've always

2895
01:45:49,679 --> 01:45:53,480
gravitated towards like blue dream

2896
01:45:51,719 --> 01:45:55,560
obviously I love when we do hybrids of

2897
01:45:53,479 --> 01:45:57,198
that but it's predictable man like you

2898
01:45:55,560 --> 01:45:58,800
know exactly what it's going to do it's

2899
01:45:57,198 --> 01:46:01,439
going to be pretty dominant that's why I

2900
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:03,719
love it yeah yeah it's gonna be dominant

2901
01:46:01,439 --> 01:46:06,238
it's gonna smell like blue dream sort of

2902
01:46:03,719 --> 01:46:08,079
it's gonna have a big chunky structure

2903
01:46:06,238 --> 01:46:10,198
you know like I can tell when stuff's

2904
01:46:08,079 --> 01:46:12,559
like 50% Blue Dream because it's like

2905
01:46:10,198 --> 01:46:14,439
pretty [ __ ] obvious um that's what

2906
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:15,960
was so cool about pack is that he took

2907
01:46:14,439 --> 01:46:17,678
both the bullies you know what I mean

2908
01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:19,599
train wreck and blue dream they're both

2909
01:46:17,679 --> 01:46:21,319
bullies in the breeding room and you got

2910
01:46:19,599 --> 01:46:23,599
to see who's going to [ __ ] overcome

2911
01:46:21,319 --> 01:46:24,920
the other and it's like really great

2912
01:46:23,599 --> 01:46:26,880
that like they actually kind of met in

2913
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:29,359
the middle maybe T was they danc

2914
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:31,039
together yeah maybe T was a little more

2915
01:46:29,359 --> 01:46:32,479
dominant with that terpinolene because

2916
01:46:31,039 --> 01:46:35,560
that lined up with like that super

2917
01:46:32,479 --> 01:46:37,359
silver haze background yeah um but like

2918
01:46:35,560 --> 01:46:39,639
there's still noticeable Blue Dream

2919
01:46:37,359 --> 01:46:42,079
traits in there that that mellow out

2920
01:46:39,639 --> 01:46:43,800
that that the harshness of the tea dub

2921
01:46:42,079 --> 01:46:45,399
and um I'm sure someone else has already

2922
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:46,880
said all this I listen to local talk

2923
01:46:45,399 --> 01:46:50,479
about these all the time because he's in

2924
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:52,199
love um yeah right yeah yeah he's like I

2925
01:46:50,479 --> 01:46:54,638
like what did he pop like a pack of 10

2926
01:46:52,198 --> 01:46:56,439
and he's like I got seven Keepers yeah

2927
01:46:54,639 --> 01:46:58,880
right he it's that good though bro

2928
01:46:56,439 --> 01:47:00,919
that's an exaggeration I'm sure know

2929
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:02,599
yeah people like to joke that he's like

2930
01:47:00,920 --> 01:47:05,158
our young Bachelor I'm like he's not a

2931
01:47:02,599 --> 01:47:07,800
bachelor he's married is he married is

2932
01:47:05,158 --> 01:47:10,238
he I didn't know that guys to the plant

2933
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:13,039
guys oh I was gonna say what's his name

2934
01:47:10,238 --> 01:47:13,039
bro I

2935
01:47:13,238 --> 01:47:17,678
know like what do I like about the past

2936
01:47:15,719 --> 01:47:19,760
and like where's the future going yeah

2937
01:47:17,679 --> 01:47:22,399
and so like I always lean towards like

2938
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:23,920
OG and chem hybrids it's just like where

2939
01:47:22,399 --> 01:47:25,799
I want to smoke at the end of the day

2940
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:27,639
and I'm not much of a daytime smoker

2941
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:29,880
anymore now that I have like a quote

2942
01:47:27,639 --> 01:47:31,520
unquote Big Boy job and I have like

2943
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:33,039
responsibilities and like when I come

2944
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:34,719
home I'm a dad you know what I mean I

2945
01:47:33,039 --> 01:47:36,079
gotta do [ __ ] I gota do chores I gotta

2946
01:47:34,719 --> 01:47:39,039
like help make dinner and do all the

2947
01:47:36,079 --> 01:47:41,639
things and so like I have some like Dad

2948
01:47:39,039 --> 01:47:43,960
weed is what I call it um or like I like

2949
01:47:41,639 --> 01:47:46,760
to smoke papaya right now it's like 18

2950
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:49,239
and a half% THC but it's [ __ ] tasty

2951
01:47:46,760 --> 01:47:51,119
as all get out it's got that sour mango

2952
01:47:49,238 --> 01:47:54,000
candy type flavor with some cheese

2953
01:47:51,118 --> 01:47:56,198
behind it and um it's [ __ ] great for

2954
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:58,599
daytime smoke man I can do my job all

2955
01:47:56,198 --> 01:48:00,638
day on that [ __ ] um even though most

2956
01:47:58,599 --> 01:48:02,840
days I choose not to but it's it's good

2957
01:48:00,639 --> 01:48:04,520
for me when I like oh I gotta go take my

2958
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:06,599
kid to the park and be the responsible

2959
01:48:04,520 --> 01:48:09,000
one you know he's like which one is this

2960
01:48:06,599 --> 01:48:10,840
uh papaya oh papaya that's right yeah

2961
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:13,399
it's it's some sort of a green crack or

2962
01:48:10,840 --> 01:48:15,039
a Betsy hybrid is like guaranteed what I

2963
01:48:13,399 --> 01:48:16,638
think it is it's one of the two it has

2964
01:48:15,039 --> 01:48:18,719
to probably probably green crack cuz

2965
01:48:16,639 --> 01:48:20,319
Betsy didn't make prob much yeah yeah

2966
01:48:18,719 --> 01:48:22,599
yeah but she's got some qualities of

2967
01:48:20,319 --> 01:48:25,399
Betsy that I think like line up pretty

2968
01:48:22,599 --> 01:48:26,760
decently you know what I mean um but

2969
01:48:25,399 --> 01:48:28,638
like it could go either way you know

2970
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:30,639
what I mean yeah a lot of the stuff in

2971
01:48:28,639 --> 01:48:32,400
Betsy I think is skunk one so it does

2972
01:48:30,639 --> 01:48:33,920
make sense yeah it yeah exactly it's

2973
01:48:32,399 --> 01:48:35,920
like literally just like oh well they're

2974
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:37,560
two things from the same place anyway

2975
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:41,399
yeah right

2976
01:48:37,560 --> 01:48:43,480
yeah similar Expressions yeah um but

2977
01:48:41,399 --> 01:48:45,039
yeah I need Dad weed nowadays man like

2978
01:48:43,479 --> 01:48:46,559
if I'm going to the park and I'm walking

2979
01:48:45,039 --> 01:48:48,279
with my 2-year-old trying to make sure

2980
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:49,800
he doesn't run into the street and die

2981
01:48:48,279 --> 01:48:52,399
like I don't want to be zoned out on

2982
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:55,239
some [ __ ] [ __ ] like ghost OG or some

2983
01:48:52,399 --> 01:48:58,960
[ __ ] [ __ ] high off my ass just like

2984
01:48:55,238 --> 01:49:00,799
huh and so um like Dad Dad weed has been

2985
01:48:58,960 --> 01:49:03,000
[ __ ] key to my life being like

2986
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:04,840
productive lately but then like once the

2987
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:07,000
kid goes to bed man like I'm [ __ ]

2988
01:49:04,840 --> 01:49:09,719
racking bong loads of the [ __ ] OG and

2989
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:12,399
chem every night oh and of course that

2990
01:49:09,719 --> 01:49:14,560
permanent marker is my heart it's the

2991
01:49:12,399 --> 01:49:16,079
best weed that's ever existed it is

2992
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:19,000
pretty much the best weed that's ever

2993
01:49:16,079 --> 01:49:20,719
existed yeah only second to to zope

2994
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:23,079
though obviously for

2995
01:49:20,719 --> 01:49:28,800
Len out there it's going to be replacing

2996
01:49:23,079 --> 01:49:30,319
Blue Bonnet next R dying yeah the best

2997
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:33,119
there's ever

2998
01:49:30,319 --> 01:49:34,799
been people can hate on it like I went

2999
01:49:33,118 --> 01:49:37,519
through a jar of it and it's pretty good

3000
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:39,480
it just doesn't hold the high through

3001
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:41,280
long-term smoking you know like when you

3002
01:49:39,479 --> 01:49:43,799
first rip a couple bowls of it for a day

3003
01:49:41,279 --> 01:49:45,238
or two you are getting surprised bro I

3004
01:49:43,800 --> 01:49:46,800
was surprised it's the first cookies

3005
01:49:45,238 --> 01:49:49,319
that like actually had a decent high

3006
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:51,239
like cookies for me it's been a minute

3007
01:49:49,319 --> 01:49:53,039
man like and it's a great sherb

3008
01:49:51,238 --> 01:49:55,359
expression I think he says it's like a

3009
01:49:53,039 --> 01:49:57,118
biscotti BX sherb or some [ __ ] like that

3010
01:49:55,359 --> 01:49:59,039
I don't know if I believe that because

3011
01:49:57,118 --> 01:50:01,519
biscotti is very particular and how it

3012
01:49:59,039 --> 01:50:04,198
breeds and like how it like never grown

3013
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:06,760
it profile I've got a bag I've got a few

3014
01:50:04,198 --> 01:50:08,879
bags of you to do um reviews with like I

3015
01:50:06,760 --> 01:50:11,000
got some Lemon Cherry and some biscotti

3016
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:12,760
and um I'm trying to get that zope for

3017
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:15,719
you so you can try the real deal it's

3018
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:17,679
not bad but it's shout out do yeah yeah

3019
01:50:15,719 --> 01:50:19,840
it's it's good man like it's just like

3020
01:50:17,679 --> 01:50:22,359
not like the perfumey stuff has never

3021
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:24,599
been like my thing that's not my forte

3022
01:50:22,359 --> 01:50:26,399
either but it is interesting because you

3023
01:50:24,599 --> 01:50:28,079
don't see it as often you know what I

3024
01:50:26,399 --> 01:50:30,118
mean it's for sure coming out of that

3025
01:50:28,079 --> 01:50:33,760
Bubba I would assume like something

3026
01:50:30,118 --> 01:50:35,439
called zap would smell soapy and I it

3027
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:37,800
does to a certain degree it's like a

3028
01:50:35,439 --> 01:50:39,759
perfumey soap that like that like what

3029
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:42,000
Bubba does cuz that's what it is right

3030
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:44,440
it's it's soap which is like Bubba Kush

3031
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:46,639
Kush mins and then I think cross to Z I

3032
01:50:44,439 --> 01:50:48,000
don't know if that's like the actual

3033
01:50:46,639 --> 01:50:50,000
lineage or not but it's what I would

3034
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:51,439
assume based on the name cuz it smells

3035
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:53,560
smells kind of like Skittle it looks

3036
01:50:51,439 --> 01:50:56,118
like Sher it smells like Skittles and

3037
01:50:53,560 --> 01:50:57,560
some perfume notes behind it and like so

3038
01:50:56,118 --> 01:50:59,118
it was interesting I thought it was

3039
01:50:57,560 --> 01:51:01,360
enjoyable but it's just not something

3040
01:50:59,118 --> 01:51:03,960
that I would like gravitate towards like

3041
01:51:01,359 --> 01:51:07,719
every day you know like I like Sher but

3042
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:09,800
it's just not a daily driver for me yeah

3043
01:51:07,719 --> 01:51:11,639
um but the future [ __ ] if I know what's

3044
01:51:09,800 --> 01:51:14,840
coming up man like everyone's just

3045
01:51:11,639 --> 01:51:16,880
trying come up yeah what about you what

3046
01:51:14,840 --> 01:51:18,880
do you want to see or what what interest

3047
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:21,078
you well and that's like the thing like

3048
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:22,880
like why I've kind of just stopped doing

3049
01:51:21,078 --> 01:51:25,399
personal breeding at all is like I'm in

3050
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:27,199
like an exploration phase right now you

3051
01:51:25,399 --> 01:51:28,839
know and so like I've got some of these

3052
01:51:27,198 --> 01:51:31,439
testers from pack that I'm really

3053
01:51:28,840 --> 01:51:33,319
excited about I've got those um Blue

3054
01:51:31,439 --> 01:51:35,559
Bonnet f2s that you just sent me those

3055
01:51:33,319 --> 01:51:39,599
are definitely high up on the list to

3056
01:51:35,560 --> 01:51:42,000
get popped um what else like I've got

3057
01:51:39,599 --> 01:51:44,039
Punchy Punchy yeah punchy's going in but

3058
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:45,639
that might be a commercial run I I'm

3059
01:51:44,039 --> 01:51:47,198
stoked to see that too yeah I'm gonna

3060
01:51:45,639 --> 01:51:49,599
I'll get that one worked in for sure I

3061
01:51:47,198 --> 01:51:51,000
know how to I know who to leverage yeah

3062
01:51:49,599 --> 01:51:54,000
um

3063
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:55,880
but um it's honestly like a really big

3064
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:58,359
huge question in the industry is like

3065
01:51:55,880 --> 01:52:00,400
well what's next because everything has

3066
01:51:58,359 --> 01:52:03,279
just been a continuation of those

3067
01:52:00,399 --> 01:52:04,879
original cookies cuts and like nothing

3068
01:52:03,279 --> 01:52:06,399
has been very original like I always

3069
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:08,639
trying to explain it to him it's just

3070
01:52:06,399 --> 01:52:11,118
like well if I take gelato which is just

3071
01:52:08,639 --> 01:52:14,599
supposedly Girl Scout and sherbet which

3072
01:52:11,118 --> 01:52:17,399
is really just like Cherry Pie and OG

3073
01:52:14,599 --> 01:52:20,400
and like F1 durb and URL all [ __ ]

3074
01:52:17,399 --> 01:52:22,158
together in one big pile you know like

3075
01:52:20,399 --> 01:52:23,799
what are you really ever going to find

3076
01:52:22,158 --> 01:52:26,359
by taking something out of the later

3077
01:52:23,800 --> 01:52:28,880
generations and doubling it back to URL

3078
01:52:26,359 --> 01:52:31,039
doubling it back to OG doubling it back

3079
01:52:28,880 --> 01:52:33,039
to even F1 derb or whatever if that's

3080
01:52:31,039 --> 01:52:34,960
really in there like I don't really know

3081
01:52:33,039 --> 01:52:37,039
what you're going to find besides a

3082
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:39,679
slightly reinvigorated version of the

3083
01:52:37,039 --> 01:52:41,399
same exact thing you know and so I view

3084
01:52:39,679 --> 01:52:44,359
those as just like dead ends I don't

3085
01:52:41,399 --> 01:52:46,359
think there's really much that's like

3086
01:52:44,359 --> 01:52:48,439
currently available that's going to make

3087
01:52:46,359 --> 01:52:51,198
any waves anytime soon Beyond like what

3088
01:52:48,439 --> 01:52:55,399
we already see with Perman marker and z

3089
01:52:51,198 --> 01:52:57,559
and gassy candy type strains you know um

3090
01:52:55,399 --> 01:53:00,638
we were talking about something earlier

3091
01:52:57,560 --> 01:53:02,800
the big rush for OG now which is a lot

3092
01:53:00,639 --> 01:53:04,840
of us dude everyone's searching again

3093
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:07,560
right now like I've done a bunch of work

3094
01:53:04,840 --> 01:53:09,800
like making incrosses and like crossing

3095
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:11,880
different ogs together which was its own

3096
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:13,679
whole fun adventure in reversals cuz

3097
01:53:11,880 --> 01:53:16,560
like it's not the hardest reversal out

3098
01:53:13,679 --> 01:53:19,118
there but it's not it's not easy either

3099
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:21,079
and like I got them to [ __ ] dump bro

3100
01:53:19,118 --> 01:53:22,920
after on the thir attemp you know cuz

3101
01:53:21,078 --> 01:53:24,880
like we were working together just like

3102
01:53:22,920 --> 01:53:28,239
slowly honing in the recipe of like all

3103
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:31,118
right well here's a normal STS recipe oh

3104
01:53:28,238 --> 01:53:33,759
that's too strong let's dilute that down

3105
01:53:31,118 --> 01:53:35,158
let's play with some additives and um y

3106
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:37,440
so like most of the additives I'm

3107
01:53:35,158 --> 01:53:40,078
playing with are like um different

3108
01:53:37,439 --> 01:53:42,559
metals because um silver is a plus two

3109
01:53:40,078 --> 01:53:44,359
ion and so if you go down that line on

3110
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:46,280
the the periodic table there's a few

3111
01:53:44,359 --> 01:53:48,639
others too there's Cobalt I think zinc

3112
01:53:46,279 --> 01:53:51,359
is one um there's a bunch of these

3113
01:53:48,639 --> 01:53:55,039
heavier metals that all kind of fit and

3114
01:53:51,359 --> 01:53:56,598
replace that same um effect not quite as

3115
01:53:55,039 --> 01:53:58,359
well as silver but that's why I'm using

3116
01:53:56,599 --> 01:54:00,119
them as like a lowd dose additive is

3117
01:53:58,359 --> 01:54:02,920
like well do they push certain things

3118
01:54:00,118 --> 01:54:05,158
over the edge and like with OG's like

3119
01:54:02,920 --> 01:54:08,078
the the STS with Cobalt seem to [ __ ]

3120
01:54:05,158 --> 01:54:11,279
do the trick that's

3121
01:54:08,078 --> 01:54:13,039
funny yeah it was uh I I'll keep my

3122
01:54:11,279 --> 01:54:14,479
dilutions to myself you guys can [ __ ]

3123
01:54:13,039 --> 01:54:16,719
around and find out if you want to do it

3124
01:54:14,479 --> 01:54:19,319
too but [ __ ] man it took me some

3125
01:54:16,719 --> 01:54:21,639
[ __ ] work to get there you know I

3126
01:54:19,319 --> 01:54:23,279
look that's what reverse triangle too if

3127
01:54:21,639 --> 01:54:26,078
I remember correctly that's the one that

3128
01:54:23,279 --> 01:54:28,439
uh kind of pushed it over the Cobalt STS

3129
01:54:26,078 --> 01:54:30,519
yeah but like we both know what type of

3130
01:54:28,439 --> 01:54:32,238
[ __ ] Cobalt that was and like I don't

3131
01:54:30,520 --> 01:54:34,520
even understand how it's possible that

3132
01:54:32,238 --> 01:54:37,198
it works yeah I know that's true that's

3133
01:54:34,520 --> 01:54:39,400
very true yeah and so like like most

3134
01:54:37,198 --> 01:54:42,399
people's recipes are really just a fat

3135
01:54:39,399 --> 01:54:44,519
dose of silver nitrate yes um yeah you

3136
01:54:42,399 --> 01:54:46,638
know and then like you know you throw

3137
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:50,920
some [ __ ] tho sulfate in there you

3138
01:54:46,639 --> 01:54:52,560
get silver tho sulfate for some of it w

3139
01:54:50,920 --> 01:54:54,199
yeah it works for most things but

3140
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:56,480
there's definitely a lot of genetics

3141
01:54:54,198 --> 01:54:59,359
that like like z z does not like that

3142
01:54:56,479 --> 01:55:01,158
normal ass [ __ ] recipe no it doesn't

3143
01:54:59,359 --> 01:55:03,359
and like I've actually had some better

3144
01:55:01,158 --> 01:55:05,279
Success With It using colloidal recently

3145
01:55:03,359 --> 01:55:09,198
which I know is like the joke in

3146
01:55:05,279 --> 01:55:13,158
reversal Tech but like um with our

3147
01:55:09,198 --> 01:55:15,519
buddies stupid overpriced mix with a a

3148
01:55:13,158 --> 01:55:17,399
routine spray of colloidal seem to do

3149
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:21,679
the trick for the Z family have you ever

3150
01:55:17,399 --> 01:55:24,519
seen a oneandone spray yeah that

3151
01:55:21,679 --> 01:55:26,560
sucks no it works for a lot of [ __ ] but

3152
01:55:24,520 --> 01:55:30,040
it's just like it one and

3153
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:32,719
done debatable because because every 14

3154
01:55:30,039 --> 01:55:34,719
days the sex tries to push back so it

3155
01:55:32,719 --> 01:55:36,679
does yeah so that's what I've noticed

3156
01:55:34,719 --> 01:55:39,319
with with these one and done what I've

3157
01:55:36,679 --> 01:55:41,078
noticed is that the top 30% of the plant

3158
01:55:39,319 --> 01:55:43,719
always goes back to female before it

3159
01:55:41,078 --> 01:55:46,158
actually drops pollen or it drops it and

3160
01:55:43,719 --> 01:55:48,239
then all those stigma just like absorb

3161
01:55:46,158 --> 01:55:50,279
all that pollen before it can like you

3162
01:55:48,238 --> 01:55:54,158
can collect it you know what I mean

3163
01:55:50,279 --> 01:55:55,719
and so uh I don't like the idea people

3164
01:55:54,158 --> 01:55:58,158
seem to think that there's this like

3165
01:55:55,719 --> 01:56:00,279
oneandone spray that works on all plants

3166
01:55:58,158 --> 01:56:02,039
magically and like I just haven't seen

3167
01:56:00,279 --> 01:56:03,719
it work out that way it doesn't make

3168
01:56:02,039 --> 01:56:06,078
sense to me sexually because if they

3169
01:56:03,719 --> 01:56:09,520
start reversing in two weeks at least

3170
01:56:06,078 --> 01:56:11,319
two sprays yeah but two doses of a

3171
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:13,920
[ __ ] gram of silver nitrate per

3172
01:56:11,319 --> 01:56:16,158
gallon will [ __ ] fry your plants at

3173
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:18,639
the same yeah exactly and so that's what

3174
01:56:16,158 --> 01:56:20,799
you see with those sprays too and like I

3175
01:56:18,639 --> 01:56:23,400
was talking to to one of these guys that

3176
01:56:20,800 --> 01:56:26,480
won't be named um about his reversal

3177
01:56:23,399 --> 01:56:28,279
Tech and um he was basically telling me

3178
01:56:26,479 --> 01:56:30,238
that like he thinks that the stress

3179
01:56:28,279 --> 01:56:32,279
response from the spray itself is one of

3180
01:56:30,238 --> 01:56:34,359
the number one inhibiting factors in

3181
01:56:32,279 --> 01:56:35,920
reversals and I was like that actually

3182
01:56:34,359 --> 01:56:37,839
makes a lot of sense to me like if you

3183
01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:40,920
spray silver nitrate and it has the

3184
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:43,520
effect of blocking ethylene but it also

3185
01:56:40,920 --> 01:56:45,520
activates all of these stress responses

3186
01:56:43,520 --> 01:56:48,079
from yeah that that's going to [ __ ] up

3187
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:49,440
what you're trying to do and like like

3188
01:56:48,078 --> 01:56:51,158
because we do find that plants at the

3189
01:56:49,439 --> 01:56:52,759
Ultimate Health or the best reverse yeah

3190
01:56:51,158 --> 01:56:54,118
say what you will about that guy he was

3191
01:56:52,760 --> 01:56:55,639
[ __ ] pretty bright you know what I

3192
01:56:54,118 --> 01:56:58,598
mean oh oh yeah I know what you're

3193
01:56:55,639 --> 01:57:00,319
talking about yeah yeah and so like um

3194
01:56:58,599 --> 01:57:02,119
that was one of the key takeaways like

3195
01:57:00,319 --> 01:57:04,238
we had like a two-hour long conversation

3196
01:57:02,118 --> 01:57:06,198
about different reversal techs and stuff

3197
01:57:04,238 --> 01:57:08,678
did you talk about injecting jellic acid

3198
01:57:06,198 --> 01:57:13,279
straight into the stem no we didn't get

3199
01:57:08,679 --> 01:57:15,039
that far okay but I I I got some uh I

3200
01:57:13,279 --> 01:57:16,880
got some good tips though that I

3201
01:57:15,039 --> 01:57:18,800
actually am curious because they were

3202
01:57:16,880 --> 01:57:21,199
the the idea was founded from like you

3203
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:22,560
know p research where I was like that is

3204
01:57:21,198 --> 01:57:25,439
really cool like I'm actually going to

3205
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:26,760
pursue that um and see if like you know

3206
01:57:25,439 --> 01:57:29,078
this was all [ __ ] and just

3207
01:57:26,760 --> 01:57:30,840
conceptual or not you know what I mean

3208
01:57:29,078 --> 01:57:32,439
yeah some of it was that I got from that

3209
01:57:30,840 --> 01:57:35,440
dude that sounded really intelligent was

3210
01:57:32,439 --> 01:57:37,319
conceptual [ __ ] but that's cool man

3211
01:57:35,439 --> 01:57:39,118
in application though was was kind of

3212
01:57:37,319 --> 01:57:41,238
interesting U one of the one of the

3213
01:57:39,118 --> 01:57:43,719
techniques was and it only worked a few

3214
01:57:41,238 --> 01:57:46,759
times but it did work was applying ga3

3215
01:57:43,719 --> 01:57:50,840
late to stretch the anthers yeah exactly

3216
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:53,400
or like um like one other one was like

3217
01:57:50,840 --> 01:57:55,520
um ABA OB cisic acid is like really

3218
01:57:53,399 --> 01:57:58,078
important in seed set inessence in

3219
01:57:55,520 --> 01:58:00,400
plants and like a spray of that followed

3220
01:57:58,078 --> 01:58:02,238
up by an oxin to negate the effects

3221
01:58:00,399 --> 01:58:04,279
Beyond so you're not sessing the plant

3222
01:58:02,238 --> 01:58:06,039
but you're assisting seed set I was like

3223
01:58:04,279 --> 01:58:07,479
that's an interesting concept like I'm

3224
01:58:06,039 --> 01:58:09,719
gonna play with that you know what I

3225
01:58:07,479 --> 01:58:12,078
mean because oxin is an ethylene

3226
01:58:09,719 --> 01:58:14,520
promoter in itself and so like it

3227
01:58:12,078 --> 01:58:16,198
doesn't always make sense why you would

3228
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:18,679
want to do that when you're combining it

3229
01:58:16,198 --> 01:58:20,519
with an ethylene blocker you know but

3230
01:58:18,679 --> 01:58:23,760
there there is some there is some action

3231
01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:26,320
combining certain like IBA IAA with

3232
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:28,039
exactly like the oxen source is the key

3233
01:58:26,319 --> 01:58:29,479
differentiator because they don't all

3234
01:58:28,039 --> 01:58:32,719
have the same response even though

3235
01:58:29,479 --> 01:58:35,078
they're all oxin and so like the Avenues

3236
01:58:32,719 --> 01:58:37,359
that I want to look down are like 2ip

3237
01:58:35,078 --> 01:58:40,519
benzo Amino purine you know like there's

3238
01:58:37,359 --> 01:58:41,880
a lot of different oins um to go and

3239
01:58:40,520 --> 01:58:43,599
experiment with that I don't think

3240
01:58:41,880 --> 01:58:45,880
anyone really

3241
01:58:43,599 --> 01:58:48,599
has yeah you know what I mean like it's

3242
01:58:45,880 --> 01:58:50,159
not necessary to get like everything to

3243
01:58:48,599 --> 01:58:51,960
reverse but there are certain plants

3244
01:58:50,158 --> 01:58:54,078
that like like I'm kind of thinking of

3245
01:58:51,960 --> 01:58:56,319
it as like groupings of families like I

3246
01:58:54,078 --> 01:58:58,000
have my OG spray now and it works really

3247
01:58:56,319 --> 01:59:00,238
well for that I know how many times I

3248
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:02,158
need to spray it what rotation at what

3249
01:59:00,238 --> 01:59:03,879
concentration and it seems to work

3250
01:59:02,158 --> 01:59:06,679
really well across the board for OG

3251
01:59:03,880 --> 01:59:08,359
types I'm slowly getting towards my Z

3252
01:59:06,679 --> 01:59:10,118
recipe you know what I mean I have to

3253
01:59:08,359 --> 01:59:12,359
like verify that right now I just have

3254
01:59:10,118 --> 01:59:13,839
kind of like oneoff anecdotal evidence

3255
01:59:12,359 --> 01:59:16,158
but it [ __ ] dumped twice as much

3256
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:18,840
pollen as it normally does that's a plus

3257
01:59:16,158 --> 01:59:21,238
dude I mean CSI csi's still fighting

3258
01:59:18,840 --> 01:59:22,800
with it instead go trying to get s1's to

3259
01:59:21,238 --> 01:59:24,359
reverse those to try to get you know

3260
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:25,920
what I mean like I've thought about that

3261
01:59:24,359 --> 01:59:27,559
too cuz I have a handful that I'm

3262
01:59:25,920 --> 01:59:29,920
working with right now that are much

3263
01:59:27,560 --> 01:59:32,960
easier to work with than Skittles itself

3264
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:35,078
they're not dead ringers as far as the

3265
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:37,599
the nose department they never quite are

3266
01:59:35,078 --> 01:59:39,078
you know that that that Skittles nose is

3267
01:59:37,599 --> 01:59:41,840
a [ __ ] one-off

3268
01:59:39,078 --> 01:59:43,960
man we ran through a lot of s1s and we

3269
01:59:41,840 --> 01:59:46,400
didn't find a Dead Ringer we found a lot

3270
01:59:43,960 --> 01:59:49,599
of things close oh we're here we're here

3271
01:59:46,399 --> 01:59:52,879
okay I want to just tease that no we'll

3272
01:59:49,599 --> 01:59:56,679
keep that as a teaser yeah yeah yeah I

3273
01:59:52,880 --> 02:00:00,639
mean we may be doing a z sure key line

3274
01:59:56,679 --> 02:00:02,279
pie episode uh with local maybe um me

3275
02:00:00,639 --> 02:00:04,078
and him have been having excellent

3276
02:00:02,279 --> 02:00:06,238
private conversations about it I'm gonna

3277
02:00:04,078 --> 02:00:09,519
I'm gonna do my best to also either

3278
02:00:06,238 --> 02:00:11,519
bring CSI in on that or get you guys to

3279
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:13,199
write me down a bunch of questions and

3280
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:15,480
things you want me to or things you want

3281
02:00:13,198 --> 02:00:17,960
his opinion on and I'll get that into

3282
02:00:15,479 --> 02:00:20,559
the show I almost want like opinions of

3283
02:00:17,960 --> 02:00:22,118
my findings too whether he like thinks

3284
02:00:20,560 --> 02:00:25,520
that that makes sense based on what he's

3285
02:00:22,118 --> 02:00:28,118
seeing I'm sure CU I didn't run his s1's

3286
02:00:25,520 --> 02:00:30,719
I we made our own and so like either way

3287
02:00:28,118 --> 02:00:32,679
it's the same cut yeah exactly yeah like

3288
02:00:30,719 --> 02:00:36,118
Skittles is pretty identifiable once you

3289
02:00:32,679 --> 02:00:38,440
know it and you got it from the same

3290
02:00:36,118 --> 02:00:40,198
yeah there's like a constructive side to

3291
02:00:38,439 --> 02:00:41,638
this too for me which is I think locco

3292
02:00:40,198 --> 02:00:44,359
is actually interested in like a little

3293
02:00:41,639 --> 02:00:46,239
project himself to kind of them out and

3294
02:00:44,359 --> 02:00:48,759
see how to like you know do what with it

3295
02:00:46,238 --> 02:00:52,759
so I think it could both be quite a cool

3296
02:00:48,760 --> 02:00:54,280
like history slash like info speculation

3297
02:00:52,760 --> 02:00:57,719
but also maybe like a hypothetical

3298
02:00:54,279 --> 02:01:02,319
breeding project kind of um episode as

3299
02:00:57,719 --> 02:01:05,480
well so yeah I will say this um in

3300
02:01:02,319 --> 02:01:07,519
meeting Dan and over time becoming like

3301
02:01:05,479 --> 02:01:08,839
knowing who he is and in cannabis and

3302
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:11,000
stuff and even though he worked for that

3303
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:13,119
was cool but when we really really

3304
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:14,960
really connected was when I realized

3305
02:01:13,118 --> 02:01:16,839
that there's not a lot of people besides

3306
02:01:14,960 --> 02:01:18,399
me and CSI and maybe the other person we

3307
02:01:16,840 --> 02:01:21,840
were talking about that's done a lot of

3308
02:01:18,399 --> 02:01:23,960
research in into reversals but when I

3309
02:01:21,840 --> 02:01:26,560
realized he had done more he had taken

3310
02:01:23,960 --> 02:01:28,198
the research further than I had taken it

3311
02:01:26,560 --> 02:01:30,840
that's when I got interested and it kind

3312
02:01:28,198 --> 02:01:32,078
of it really did put me back in the mode

3313
02:01:30,840 --> 02:01:33,800
because for a long time I was just kind

3314
02:01:32,078 --> 02:01:36,279
of done with my spray as far as okay

3315
02:01:33,800 --> 02:01:37,840
it's there I've finished it I'm happy

3316
02:01:36,279 --> 02:01:39,679
with it it does what I needed to do for

3317
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:41,319
the most part right but it's kind of

3318
02:01:39,679 --> 02:01:43,199
inspired me to get back into it a little

3319
02:01:41,319 --> 02:01:46,840
bit and get back into the science and

3320
02:01:43,198 --> 02:01:48,439
the the R&amp;D and and get back into it so

3321
02:01:46,840 --> 02:01:50,760
I thanks for that inspiration too

3322
02:01:48,439 --> 02:01:53,198
because like it felt very dead for a

3323
02:01:50,760 --> 02:01:55,560
long time in that yeah yeah oh it's it's

3324
02:01:53,198 --> 02:01:57,118
just colloidal silver as they always say

3325
02:01:55,560 --> 02:01:59,639
yeah my spring is just colloidal anyway

3326
02:01:57,118 --> 02:01:59,639
so it doesn't

3327
02:02:00,319 --> 02:02:05,559
matter dude every time we bring it up in

3328
02:02:03,359 --> 02:02:07,519
the [ __ ] on the like when we're doing

3329
02:02:05,560 --> 02:02:10,159
the YouTube live and [ __ ] there's always

3330
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:12,920
some [ __ ] that says colloidal

3331
02:02:10,158 --> 02:02:15,479
exclamation colloidal yeah every [ __ ]

3332
02:02:12,920 --> 02:02:17,520
time and no matter what I see it and I

3333
02:02:15,479 --> 02:02:20,559
think of you I'm just like I know he saw

3334
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:22,960
that too that [ __ ] douchebag he just

3335
02:02:20,560 --> 02:02:25,360
cringed in his heart yeah yeah yeah I'll

3336
02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:27,279
just say that I am selfishly stoked

3337
02:02:25,359 --> 02:02:29,880
because like now that we have access to

3338
02:02:27,279 --> 02:02:34,759
farm a Dan like we're just gonna oh man

3339
02:02:29,880 --> 02:02:36,880
we're gonna milk it milk content yeah

3340
02:02:34,760 --> 02:02:38,920
I've got I've got a lot of things to say

3341
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:41,159
it may get redundant at a certain point

3342
02:02:38,920 --> 02:02:42,760
but it's just like I never have answers

3343
02:02:41,158 --> 02:02:44,479
I just have data points you know what I

3344
02:02:42,760 --> 02:02:45,920
mean it's like I've seen a lot of plants

3345
02:02:44,479 --> 02:02:47,879
I've grown a lot of plants I've done a

3346
02:02:45,920 --> 02:02:49,719
lot of breeding and like I don't ever

3347
02:02:47,880 --> 02:02:51,760
claim to have the answers for anything

3348
02:02:49,719 --> 02:02:53,520
but I can tell you what I've seen you

3349
02:02:51,760 --> 02:02:55,159
know that's all that matters like we

3350
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:56,520
always talk about and like the the whole

3351
02:02:55,158 --> 02:02:58,279
Skittles thing it's just like whether

3352
02:02:56,520 --> 02:03:00,520
key line pie and green sherb are the

3353
02:02:58,279 --> 02:03:02,599
same cut I'm not convinced but certain

3354
02:03:00,520 --> 02:03:05,360
people are you know what I mean like

3355
02:03:02,599 --> 02:03:07,760
it's a the problem is we've never had

3356
02:03:05,359 --> 02:03:10,880
all them together sourced from the key

3357
02:03:07,760 --> 02:03:12,920
lime pie source and green sherb in the

3358
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:15,920
room at the same time and now we can't

3359
02:03:12,920 --> 02:03:18,000
Source the supposedly burning bush

3360
02:03:15,920 --> 02:03:19,719
nurseries down in SF is still up and

3361
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:21,880
running and still sells it and I'm just

3362
02:03:19,719 --> 02:03:24,158
like for real yeah yeah you can still

3363
02:03:21,880 --> 02:03:26,599
get order it off his [ __ ] website you

3364
02:03:24,158 --> 02:03:28,319
know what I mean I've never yeah I've

3365
02:03:26,599 --> 02:03:31,078
never tried it because I was just like

3366
02:03:28,319 --> 02:03:34,399
oh what are the chances I mean yeah by

3367
02:03:31,078 --> 02:03:37,238
clone man and he was apparently one of

3368
02:03:34,399 --> 02:03:40,679
the closer original sources from what

3369
02:03:37,238 --> 02:03:42,598
I've been able to tell and So like um

3370
02:03:40,679 --> 02:03:44,639
that whole mystery is still just like

3371
02:03:42,599 --> 02:03:47,840
unfolding for me you know like I keep

3372
02:03:44,639 --> 02:03:49,118
growing and it never answers it I'll

3373
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:50,880
find that I'll find the picture the

3374
02:03:49,118 --> 02:03:54,078
keyme pi s ones that I have you're going

3375
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:55,480
to be like oh [ __ ] green Sher yeah yeah

3376
02:03:54,078 --> 02:03:57,799
and it could be that too like

3377
02:03:55,479 --> 02:04:00,519
realistically like so when I grew green

3378
02:03:57,800 --> 02:04:02,320
sh when I grew green sherb as well it

3379
02:04:00,520 --> 02:04:04,719
was when I was working in La I think we

3380
02:04:02,319 --> 02:04:07,558
did one run of it alongside the sunset

3381
02:04:04,719 --> 02:04:09,840
cuz we got it at the same time yeah and

3382
02:04:07,559 --> 02:04:12,159
it was very different than what I

3383
02:04:09,840 --> 02:04:15,840
remember from keyme pie it was much more

3384
02:04:12,158 --> 02:04:18,558
gelato structured it was bigger it was

3385
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:21,559
not key like key lime to me reeks like

3386
02:04:18,559 --> 02:04:23,119
key lime like it is that exact profile

3387
02:04:21,559 --> 02:04:24,639
you know and I've done a lot of breeding

3388
02:04:23,118 --> 02:04:27,000
with it and I still have a lime right

3389
02:04:24,639 --> 02:04:29,319
now that I have seeds of in the fridge

3390
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:31,520
that when I pop it people tell me

3391
02:04:29,319 --> 02:04:33,319
they're like yeah it's [ __ ] limey and

3392
02:04:31,520 --> 02:04:35,320
I'm just like dude it was [ __ ] lime

3393
02:04:33,319 --> 02:04:36,719
it was always lime and so like when

3394
02:04:35,319 --> 02:04:39,399
people tell me other things about key

3395
02:04:36,719 --> 02:04:42,520
lime like oh kind of just like this

3396
02:04:39,399 --> 02:04:43,759
candish like maybe melon and mango or

3397
02:04:42,520 --> 02:04:47,040
whatever that's kind of like the one

3398
02:04:43,760 --> 02:04:48,800
that I got you know interesting also um

3399
02:04:47,039 --> 02:04:52,078
another little point I think it was like

3400
02:04:48,800 --> 02:04:54,199
like um [ __ ] NorCal I mag one time I

3401
02:04:52,078 --> 02:04:56,238
deep dive his Instagram because I was

3402
02:04:54,198 --> 02:04:59,558
just like oh I know you [ __ ] worked

3403
02:04:56,238 --> 02:05:01,198
green Sher for a while and um I scrolled

3404
02:04:59,559 --> 02:05:04,159
all the way down to like [ __ ] like I

3405
02:05:01,198 --> 02:05:06,519
don't know 2013 or some [ __ ] and to the

3406
02:05:04,158 --> 02:05:08,679
first picture and mention of green sherb

3407
02:05:06,520 --> 02:05:11,079
and it had seated itself in that run of

3408
02:05:08,679 --> 02:05:12,920
his oh you know what I mean and so like

3409
02:05:11,078 --> 02:05:14,960
it obviously had the potential to do

3410
02:05:12,920 --> 02:05:17,359
that you know what I mean it didn't look

3411
02:05:14,960 --> 02:05:19,319
amazing but it had the potential to I'd

3412
02:05:17,359 --> 02:05:21,359
never had any sexual stability with

3413
02:05:19,319 --> 02:05:22,479
keyme P like whatsoever that's

3414
02:05:21,359 --> 02:05:26,078
interesting

3415
02:05:22,479 --> 02:05:28,359
yeah gassy see mine wasn't gassy it was

3416
02:05:26,078 --> 02:05:30,078
just straight line then I also wonder we

3417
02:05:28,359 --> 02:05:31,679
gonna have to save this okay I know I

3418
02:05:30,078 --> 02:05:34,558
know I know we can go deeper on that

3419
02:05:31,679 --> 02:05:36,880
I've got so much more on that good point

3420
02:05:34,559 --> 02:05:38,920
this is the Cliffhanger I'm the producer

3421
02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:41,559
of the show right now there it goes

3422
02:05:38,920 --> 02:05:44,000
there it goes it's

3423
02:05:41,559 --> 02:05:46,559
done it's it done this has been really

3424
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:48,719
awesome and like I'm pretty sure we only

3425
02:05:46,559 --> 02:05:51,679
like had a fraction of what Dan had to

3426
02:05:48,719 --> 02:05:54,118
to say oh oh yeah bro yeah like I said

3427

getting much bigger each time for the

3434
02:06:06,399 --> 02:06:10,439
podcast we're finding some amazing

3435
02:06:08,078 --> 02:06:13,359
people that uh are really good

3436
02:06:10,439 --> 02:06:14,799

3445
02:06:31,639 --> 02:06:35,760
communicating and sometimes it just

3446
02:06:33,880 --> 02:06:38,480
doesn't work and like I I really enjoyed
