00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:06,299
welcome to breeder Syndicate 2.0 where

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,820
we explore the history of a clandestine

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:11,039
scene researching everything from

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,839
cannabis strain history old smuggling

5
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,058
Tales from the first person perspective

6
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:16,440
to breeding science and news on current

7
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:18,300
subculture

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,920
I'm your host Matthew and I'll

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,080
occasionally be joined by my homie not

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,118
so dog breeder and grower from Mendocino

11
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:26,639
to speak on these subjects and sometimes

12
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:28,320
interview other participants our goal is

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,060
to document this history before it's

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,320
written by corporations and others who

15
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:34,140
just weren't there

16
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,219
let's start writing some wrongs welcome

17
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,219
to the underground

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,379
hey what's up everyone welcome to reader

19
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,480
Syndicate I'm Matthew here with my

20
00:00:43,378 --> 00:00:47,899
co-host thousand fold and today we are

21
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,898
going to talk

22
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,920
handoff

23
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,119
so today we are continuing a series of

24
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,559
reading

25
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:57,299
um and

26
00:00:55,558 --> 00:00:58,679
would like to thank quasioux for

27
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:01,198
suggesting this one

28
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:03,299
we are going to be going over some of

29
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:06,118
the quote-unquote building blocks on

30
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:07,739
cannabis some of the plots and lines

31
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:10,319
that

32
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:12,359
you know still feature in in much of of

33
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:13,978
modern work today

34
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:17,280
um we're going to go over each of these

35
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:21,239
and talk about how they will breed and

36
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,680
how they work in breeding projects

37
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:25,319
um okay yeah that's all I have to say

38
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,000
there all right yeah this is a an easy

39
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:29,099
one we've covered it briefly in another

40
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,219
episode but I wanted to go more in depth

41
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:33,599
and more in detail on a few of them

42
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:36,000
um because I think it it definitely

43
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,798
needs to be done so yeah without further

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,560
ado

45
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,500
yeah okay so I guess we'll first launch

46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,000
into some of the the all the golden

47
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,759
Generation

48
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,859
Um so hey skunk one Northern Lights yes

49
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,259
sir poison Afghani number one blueberry

50
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:54,478
so we can start with Haze map

51
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,759
so so for Hayes

52
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:59,519
um being one of the main bass lines a

53
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,459
lot of Dutch still to this day

54
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:05,039
um use Hayes as one of their their main

55
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:06,839
bass lines that's in most everything

56
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,420
um a lot of it was Haze crossed the

57
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,739
skunk one but you know like as the Dutch

58
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:12,839
and Neville and all them were over there

59
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:14,459
developing these lines uh Sam the skunk

60
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,739
man in America

61
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:18,360
um according to history or as it's told

62
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:20,459
I should say

63
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,680
um and Rob Clark obviously was a part of

64
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:24,900
that as we learned later on

65
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,719
um the development of things like Haze

66
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,459
and skunk one took place in California

67
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:31,859
originally they weren't Dutch specific

68
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:34,140
but when the sand the skunk man went

69
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,660
over to Amsterdam he took a few of these

70
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:41,098
lines with him and they were worked so

71
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:43,439
well and things like skunk one had a

72
00:02:41,098 --> 00:02:44,939
very specific structure that bred well

73
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,300
into other lines whereas things like

74
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:49,979
Haze I mean supposedly I trying to find

75
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,260
these versions of haze I haven't quite

76
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:54,238
experienced yet but supposedly they had

77
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:56,159
the ultimate High according to Neville

78
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,780
and

79
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,060
um a lot of the work done over in

80
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:05,280
Amsterdam was to try to like capture

81
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:07,739
that Haze high in a faster

82
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,959
faster better structured more resinous

83
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:13,200
form essentially an easier easier

84
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,819
growing form for indoor the haze is one

85
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,158
of the baselines there's there is debate

86
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:19,679
about what is in Haze

87
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:22,378
um it sounds like some of what Sam gave

88
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,879
to Neville and whoever else ended up

89
00:03:22,378 --> 00:03:26,699
with it because there's some quotes from

90
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:28,318
others saying they got haze from Sam too

91
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:30,359
um but it sounds like some of these

92
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:32,639
different batches or different versions

93
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,379
worked by this whatever group was in

94
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:37,619
Santa Cruz making the haze

95
00:03:34,378 --> 00:03:40,620
and some had you know Indian in it later

96
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,539
on some had Thai but it sounds like what

97
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:46,019
we're seeing is mostly a combination of

98
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:48,359
Colombian gold things like Acapulco Gold

99
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:51,060
um and maybe tie in there from the

100
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,140
original stuff being combined and those

101
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,180
took it a lot of different directions

102
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:55,919
and obviously were very long flowering

103
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,620
since there was no addition of Afghani

104
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:00,658
at that point you know in any of this

105
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,939
um so it itself was a worked line from

106
00:04:00,658 --> 00:04:04,199
the history says Santa Cruz so I'm going

107
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:07,680
to go with that

108
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:10,079
and um yeah it is constructed of what I

109
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,939
would also consider older bass lines but

110
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,799
they're not bass lines that I can fully

111
00:04:11,938 --> 00:04:16,560
speak on since I wasn't really alive

112
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,720
when um Colombian gold Panama Red

113
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,819
Acapulco Gold

114
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,380
um you know any of those zacatec is

115
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:23,719
purple any of those were around being

116
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:25,860
you know

117
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,600
smoked I just wasn't there so I can't

118
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,979
really comment on those fully but we do

119
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,860
know that the basis for things like

120
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:33,740
skunk one as well were um Acapulco Gold

121
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,900
and Colombian gold with some FBA

122
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:38,280
according to Sam the skunk band

123
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:40,079
so yeah

124
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:41,519
while the bass lines we were talking

125
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:45,240
about bass lines I did want to have a

126
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:47,459
quick nod to the the bass lines that

127
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,079
existed before the lines that we

128
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:51,719
commonly use because technically people

129
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:53,879
could take it back to the Acapulco Gold

130
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,160
the Colombian gold and things like that

131
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:59,459
but realistically what we're working

132
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,699
with today are modern versions of things

133
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:06,180
like the haze the skunk one the Northern

134
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:09,600
Lights uh one two five you know

135
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:11,699
I mean this is also the kind of limit of

136
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,800
you know roughly the limits of what we

137
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:16,520
know as well exactly go back further we

138
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:19,379
just don't have that information

139
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:21,000
with information going back further I

140
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:23,819
mean like I've been trying to allude to

141
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,639
to store calling them stories or you

142
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:28,740
know whatever because we have really one

143
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,199
man's perspective

144
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,639
um of skunk one how it was created who

145
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,319
created it and when

146
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,240
and

147
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,699
you know that's just one man's take on

148
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,139
it one man's story and not to call any

149
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:42,180
of that into question but that's what we

150
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:44,819
have and that's what I'm repeating but

151
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:47,160
it doesn't necessarily make it

152
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:48,418
fact you know what I mean like it's

153
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,400
because I'm sure there were other people

154
00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:52,379
involved with different perspectives and

155
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,299
I definitely don't want to ignore that

156
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:55,680
because things change over time what if

157
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:59,160
one of these guys comes out and speaks

158
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,560
and it's very legit and uh yeah so I

159
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:04,800
don't want to I don't want to nail this

160
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,538
into stone necessarily on who brought

161
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,000
what where at what time but we do know

162
00:06:06,538 --> 00:06:10,860
that Sam did bring you know the haze and

163
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,779
the and the skunk one over we do know

164
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:14,340
that for a fact but who is involved with

165
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:16,978
making these and what their makeup was

166
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:19,679
we are taking that from a story

167
00:06:16,978 --> 00:06:22,019
yeah and I think Hayes in particular out

168
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:26,160
of this whole list is probably like our

169
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:29,038
broadest term in the sense of like

170
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:32,100
um it's hard to point at

171
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:33,899
you know particular lines or particular

172
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:37,620
clones and say like they that definitely

173
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:39,478
represents all of Hayes absolutely

174
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:42,600
um quite quite a lot of uh fragmentation

175
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:44,818
there like trying to refer to Haze as a

176
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,680
single line to me is really incorrect if

177
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:48,300
you go back and look at the history it

178
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,639
seems like it was several lines that

179
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:53,939
were made by a specific group or worked

180
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:56,340
by A specific group and in that case you

181
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:58,740
know like one is a hybrid of the other

182
00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:00,060
would you call up the same name would

183
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,160
that be the same line technically

184
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,720
probably not like it could be very

185
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,060
different from the last one you know

186
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,680
what I mean but yeah during that time

187
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,660
there wasn't all the name game there

188
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,939
wasn't all the marketing involved though

189
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,800
the Hayes brothers and the haze crew

190
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:15,418
were some of the first to do any type of

191
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,800
marketing and putting their names out

192
00:07:15,418 --> 00:07:17,639
there and when they did they called it

193
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,000
like

194
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:24,240
um let's see it was the magenta

195
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,399
silver blue and another one um

196
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,259
and they they did denote that there were

197
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:30,179
different versions of this Haze out

198
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:33,060
there but they were just called by color

199
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:35,098
names and that was it at the time

200
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,139
okay so we might have to Broad stroke

201
00:07:35,098 --> 00:07:40,620
this one a little bit yeah I did want to

202
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:42,840
ask here so in general broadly speaking

203
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,660
what and I think you already mentioned

204
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:47,579
this but what traits do you want to see

205
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,620
past from

206
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:52,139
a haze type plant

207
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:55,139
so I'm only going to speak on what

208
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:56,699
Neville would talk about because he was

209
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:58,620
the one most vocal and had the most

210
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:00,180
experience with breeding original Haze

211
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,459
if I were to try to speak out of myself

212
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,560
I mean my populations were small and I

213
00:08:02,459 --> 00:08:07,439
tried different seed lines of original

214
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,000
Haze and I just don't know how similar

215
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:11,038
those were to what was being seen in

216
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,899
Amsterdam at the time so I'll talk about

217
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:14,699
from Neville's experience what what he

218
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:18,179
was looking for he wanted to find the

219
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:19,860
high of haze and the flavors and the

220
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,660
sweetness of Mexican and all the other

221
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:24,479
things like that and in a shorter

222
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:27,419
flowering time he wanted to use indicas

223
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,918
and afghanis as he put it to shorten the

224
00:08:27,418 --> 00:08:31,918
flowering time but he did not want the

225
00:08:28,918 --> 00:08:34,439
high from any of those to overtake the

226
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:37,139
haze high that was his ultimate goal and

227
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,940
in the end he he is like the one thing I

228
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:41,098
remember most of him talking about Hayes

229
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,260
was that he decided that the haze

230
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:45,120
females really weren't

231
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:47,399
worth breeding with and he found that

232
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,019
the males carried much more of what he

233
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:51,720
wanted genetically

234
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:53,459
and passed on more genetically than the

235
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,100
females and and obviously he wasn't

236
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:57,719
doing like marker assisted breeding you

237
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,879
know but um

238
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,920
from experience I found like you know

239
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:04,200
that really does play into a point and

240
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:05,759
Neville really did know his plans I can

241
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,320
I can attest to that

242
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:11,039
so yeah

243
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,778
um what what was seen in Amsterdam is is

244
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:15,599
typically agreed to be like the

245
00:09:12,778 --> 00:09:17,519
Colombian dominant Haze

246
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,740
um what Neville got seems to have been

247
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,500
very Colombian gold dominant according

248
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:25,500
to Neville and others uh his old partner

249
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:27,419
and there are other versions of Hayes

250
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,039
out there that are more quote unquote

251
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:31,259
Thai dominant or Southeast Asian

252
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:33,179
whatever a different slightly different

253
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:34,500
direction so there are different groups

254
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:36,179
of people that have different theories

255
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,519
about which directions they should take

256
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:40,859
this original Haze Line original hey

257
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:43,200
seed line some fill but you know the

258
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,839
real high of haze is in the Southeast

259
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,540
Asian Direction Vietnamese Thai whatever

260
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:51,240
was really used and some people are very

261
00:09:48,539 --> 00:09:53,819
adamant that Colombian is the the way to

262
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,799
find uh the traits that people want the

263
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:58,440
Colombian Direction I don't know enough

264
00:09:55,799 --> 00:10:00,659
about pure Colombian or pure Southeast

265
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,640
Asian from that era to even comment on

266
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:05,120
it but that's essentially what I've

267
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:09,659
taken from the conversation

268
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:11,639
yep and so you mentioned

269
00:10:09,659 --> 00:10:14,100
the High

270
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:16,080
um and you mentioned

271
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,180
uh braiding it with

272
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:20,820
indicas to shortened flowering time I

273
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:22,919
imagine improved structure as well yes

274
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:25,620
um yields in production of things all of

275
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:29,299
it okay okay

276
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,299
um do you have a sense of

277
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:35,480
what trades tend to pass like in

278
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:37,379
actuality so in actuality

279
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,420
passed down

280
00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:40,620
it doesn't sound like the high was it

281
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:42,899
sounds like the thing that one thing

282
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:45,240
everybody chases almost like um looking

283
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:47,700
for that skunks in it you know like the

284
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,919
high of hazes this mystical

285
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,360
thing that a lot of people really

286
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:53,819
I mean their people have really good

287
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,220
Haze examples like uh Haze hybrid

288
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,860
examples that with really great highs

289
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:01,259
that are just blow your head off

290
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:03,959
um as far as in pure Haze it seems like

291
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:06,240
it's been a long chase a very long Chase

292
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:08,699
and not a lot of um Colonial examples

293
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,459
kept in past if that makes sense

294
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:14,759
um a lot of the hybrid's been great

295
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:16,139
yeah what are good examples of hybrids

296
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:17,338
um first and foremost like the first

297
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:19,559
thing comes to my mind is super silver

298
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:21,420
haze which is a combination of the skunk

299
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:23,518
one and all five Northern Lights five

300
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:25,740
which we we will discuss a little bit

301
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,419
but we've gone into deep like so much

302
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:29,039
detail in Northern Lights I I don't

303
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:31,500
really know what what much more we could

304
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:33,838
cover on other than to say you know it

305
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:37,620
was the other than

306
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:39,540
whatever Afghani was used in super skunk

307
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:42,778
it was probably one of the more common

308
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:43,679
afghanis used like the nl1 by by Neville

309
00:11:42,778 --> 00:11:45,120
and them

310
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:46,979
um and all five as well was used pretty

311
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,959
heavily but nl1 was usually used as the

312
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,700
male and lines they do it outcross to

313
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,739
things like Hayes

314
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,660
um what else do we have

315
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,740
uh Super Silver Haze though is the first

316
00:11:54,659 --> 00:11:57,539
thing that comes to mind a combination

317
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:59,579
of Northern Lights five skunk one and

318
00:11:57,539 --> 00:12:01,439
Haze and different you know combinations

319
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:03,778
I remember I think skunk ones on both

320
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,060
sides it's been a while

321
00:12:03,778 --> 00:12:08,220
um yeah things like mango Haze Neville's

322
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:09,838
Haze all great examples but super silver

323
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:12,839
haze seems to be the one that has been

324
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,860
the often most repeated and renamed in

325
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:15,779
my opinion

326
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:17,220
um what's the relation to Amnesia Haze I

327
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:18,778
know they're close right

328
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,100
it's you know I've tried to get the

329
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:23,578
answer out of people but it sounds like

330
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:26,339
Amnesia is just a a individual from I

331
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:27,719
like that word an individual from

332
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:30,120
um

333
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,820
from Super Silver Haze

334
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,679
yeah okay I mean they're very similar

335
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,300
like very very similar but for some

336
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:40,259
reason Amnesia whether it was the name

337
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:42,419
or just a slightly faster better version

338
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:44,220
of of a lot of the super silver haze

339
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:45,838
examples it's stuck around pretty

340
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:49,160
heavily in Amsterdam and still passed

341
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,160
around in Clone form pretty wide

342
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,920
yeah still big in Europe for sure

343
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:55,559
massive

344
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:57,299
okay well for me the last question on

345
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:59,518
Hayes

346
00:12:57,299 --> 00:13:01,740
um are there weird possibility I mean

347
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,019
this is probably more true of this one

348
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:06,539
than than a lot of the others

349
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:08,399
um I'm are there weird possibilities or

350
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:11,099
paths that you can see with Hayes that

351
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,659
people haven't really taken yet

352
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,500
it's probably a hard question for this

353
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:15,719
one

354
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:18,120
you know I I think

355
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,680
um with the original hazeline as Sam

356
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,600
used to sell it and like I've seen

357
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:23,879
examples from different people of the

358
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,980
current original Haze line from Sam and

359
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:27,659
it's like got dense bud and resonance

360
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,000
that's nothing like I've seen in

361
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:31,679
original Haze in the past or history or

362
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,440
any of that like it's pretty well

363
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:36,239
documented to not look like that

364
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,639
um with that said I've seen some pretty

365
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,500
amazing stuff that only like one

366
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,659
person's done where like Crossing deep

367
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:45,059
chunks to Haze makes something very

368
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:46,559
modern beautiful resonance it takes all

369
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:48,359
the boxes

370
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,159
um I think Hayes has a lot of potential

371
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,620
being crossed to some of these base

372
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:54,120
afghanis that kind of float around like

373
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,278
you know like we're seeing a lot more

374
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,159
afghanis be imported and different

375
00:13:56,278 --> 00:14:02,100
afghanis accessible

376
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:04,199
um all those make potential potential

377
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,480
great Partners to Haze and you can see a

378
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:09,778
lot of unique directions just coming

379
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,879
from using different modern afghanis you

380
00:14:09,778 --> 00:14:14,700
know I think that you're thinking in

381
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:16,500
2023 it's still worth trying oh yeah

382
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:19,620
people have access to these things yeah

383
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:21,600
Mendo pertains like an old purple

384
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,620
Afghani like that across the haze I

385
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,899
think would be

386
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:26,278
pretty amazing but you but like you have

387
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:27,659
to consider like the reason a lot of

388
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:29,879
these people wanted to use Haze in the

389
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:32,039
first place was the high and Crossing to

390
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:35,458
afghanis and hoping to keep that high

391
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:38,819
seems to be the hardest part

392
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:40,319
nice so it the partner will matter for

393
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:42,959
sure but there's all kinds of directions

394
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:45,600
you could go with it to bring it into

395
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:48,239
the modern times modern era where you

396
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,560
know like little dab kids could enjoy it

397
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,778
when they see it on Instagram you're

398
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:54,179
like oh that's dank bro I can't smell it

399
00:14:51,778 --> 00:14:55,559
but it looks dank whatever that means

400
00:14:54,179 --> 00:14:57,299
yeah

401
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:58,739
thank you

402
00:14:57,299 --> 00:15:01,219
anything else you'd like to say about

403
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,220
Haze

404
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:06,060
um just that it's still a it's still

405
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:07,379
somewhat of a mystery on its past it's

406
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:09,419
something that I've been chasing down a

407
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:11,399
long time be it trying to figure out who

408
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:13,679
the Hayes brothers were if they're still

409
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:16,078
around were they always the original

410
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,979
creators of Hayes

411
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:19,138
um

412
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:21,600
yeah I mean it's it's one of those

413
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:24,419
mysteries in cannabis that I'd like to

414
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,399
solve before I'm done you know I don't

415
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:27,240
know that I will

416
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,159
um

417
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,180
yeah I don't know I think it's one of

418
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:31,500
the most interesting mysteries in

419
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,939
cannabis and I wish more people would

420
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,139
jump in on it like serious serious

421
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,120
researchers

422
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:38,519
and see how far they can get

423
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,919
did someone like um because those are

424
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:43,500
great conversations but uh did someone

425
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:46,019
like Mad Jack encounter his

426
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,919
and he was not that I'm aware

427
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:48,659
um

428
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:51,419
I I don't know if you imagine mentioning

429
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:53,399
skunk one and that like that story about

430
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:54,240
Rob Clark and the briefcase and all that

431
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:57,659
but

432
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,120
he was growing a lot of other stuff like

433
00:15:57,659 --> 00:16:01,740
long flowering like Mexicans and

434
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,679
Colombians and stuff but those were not

435
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:06,600
those were like his own accessions

436
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:09,359
that he had caught 30 years from bagseed

437
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:12,199
but I don't I don't think um Rob brought

438
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:16,860
Hayes he did bring Afghani one though

439
00:16:12,198 --> 00:16:20,099
and uh skunk one for sure and I think in

440
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:22,680
the um looking at the maps and the

441
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,399
different stuff that I have for magad

442
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:27,299
um

443
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:30,240
there was also Pollyanna in there which

444
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:32,159
to me I mean like it's one of them

445
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,899
I can't call it a bass line because how

446
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:36,000
much did early Pearl and silver Pearl

447
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:38,159
really pass into modern lines but at the

448
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,720
same time like it's a baseline that I'm

449
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:42,000
interested in because I'm so fascinated

450
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,220
by the Pearl group but overall I don't

451
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,519
think it's as important to cannabis

452
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:49,860
history as it is important to me to you

453
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,379
know to research and discuss

454
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:56,720
yeah fair enough

455
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:56,720
okay well we can move on to skunk one

456
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:01,800
all right let's do skunk one

457
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:04,199
what should we start on so

458
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:07,198
I guess the first thing is again this is

459
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:10,380
a this is a it's a line it's not a it's

460
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:12,900
not an individual plant clone

461
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:15,360
um so how how wide or narrow

462
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:17,579
would you consider this line at this

463
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:20,759
point in 2023

464
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:22,318
in 2023 I mean skunk one I've seen so

465
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:24,058
many different examples of skunk one

466
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:26,279
nowadays that are supposedly from Pure

467
00:17:24,058 --> 00:17:30,599
lines you have some skunk one that's

468
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:33,298
super dense and and smells Bland and

469
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:36,178
and earthy you have skunk one that's

470
00:17:33,298 --> 00:17:39,179
resinous looks more narrow leafed smells

471
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:42,000
cheesy foot funky all the way to Berry

472
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:42,840
and fruit like in the same clone

473
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,179
um

474
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:46,980
yeah skunk one seems to be all over the

475
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:48,660
place to me like you can find there's

476
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:53,700
still lots of different examples grape

477
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:55,500
still variable yeah okay so uh as always

478
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:58,558
this is quite a subjective question but

479
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:02,339
for you Matt what would you what traits

480
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:04,558
do you like to see being passed

481
00:18:02,339 --> 00:18:07,678
one of my favorite examples of skunk one

482
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:09,119
is the probably the Green Crack like we

483
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,980
don't know what's in Green Crack

484
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:13,199
necessarily but all the traits kind of

485
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,819
Mount up to be skunk one dominant like

486
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,900
it looks like a great example of skunk

487
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:18,839
one

488
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:20,700
um it's very heavy mango smelling

489
00:18:18,839 --> 00:18:22,259
um it's Offspring it's very purple and I

490
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,819
like that because I like purple for

491
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:25,798
aesthetic Beauty

492
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:28,439
um it's it's dense it's a great

493
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:30,839
commercial producer it's resinous enough

494
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,519
I mean today in today's modern Market

495
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:34,199
Green Crack might not do as well because

496
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:37,200
people like to see Leaf resin a lot

497
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,640
which most people just cut off

498
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,298
you know

499
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,038
um

500
00:18:39,298 --> 00:18:42,298
yeah I don't know I think that's one of

501
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:44,160
my favorite examples a lot of people's

502
00:18:42,298 --> 00:18:45,538
favorite examples are cheese and I've

503
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,160
talked about that clone a bunch being

504
00:18:45,538 --> 00:18:50,879
one of the Clones that I've learned most

505
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:53,519
about the the plasticity of cannabis and

506
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,100
I meant to give a definition because

507
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:58,500
I've I've mentioned it a few times

508
00:18:56,099 --> 00:19:00,240
um and I you know like I didn't know if

509
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,339
I was kind of making [ __ ] up like we're

510
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,900
calling it plastic because like most

511
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:05,399
people would you know rubber would be

512
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:08,038
probably better it's the correct term I

513
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,960
think but uh plant plasticity refers to

514
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:12,779
a plant's ability and this is from plant

515
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,038
plasticity.ku.edk

516
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:15,839
um first you have plants ability to

517
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:17,519
adapt and to cope with changes in its

518
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,079
environment and contrast animals which

519
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:20,460
are able to actively move away to avoid

520
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:22,199
challenges such as Predators or change

521
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,400
of climate plants have acquired the

522
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,720
ability to biosynthesize an

523
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,059
unprecedented array of structurally

524
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,319
complex by active natural compounds the

525
00:19:27,058 --> 00:19:30,119
specialized roles in order to cope with

526
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,220
environmental challenges so that's what

527
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:33,959
plasticity overall is in a plant when I

528
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,839
refer to it in Skunk one

529
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:39,120
when you have a single clone that when

530
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:40,980
you change the medium or how you feed it

531
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:43,319
and it can go from something as Extreme

532
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,940
as uh like

533
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:48,779
what's a good example like gouda cheese

534
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:51,000
smelling or like no Funk cheese all the

535
00:19:48,779 --> 00:19:54,538
way to a Sweet Berry in the same clone

536
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,538
that is super not common to see

537
00:19:54,538 --> 00:19:59,339
something that plastic and and versatile

538
00:19:57,538 --> 00:20:00,779
in a single clone so you can imagine

539
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:02,220
breeding with something like this you're

540
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:03,418
going to see a lot of different examples

541
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:06,360
come out of it because it'll have that

542
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:08,100
whole range in it so yeah

543
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:09,659
yeah okay

544
00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:13,019
I don't know if I answered the question

545
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:15,240
but no you did you did okay um what

546
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:18,000
traits I guess the the converse is what

547
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:20,099
traits would you not like to see being

548
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,798
passed from skunk one

549
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:25,740
that blando man like

550
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:28,139
I saw all of this like without naming

551
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:31,500
any names a few people really skunk one

552
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:35,720
in the past you know five years

553
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:39,298
and a lot of that was all bland blando

554
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:40,980
earthy and that's

555
00:20:39,298 --> 00:20:42,418
there's so much of that in all of

556
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,819
today's modern lines that come from

557
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:47,660
skunk oh my god dude blando clarissian

558
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:51,000
has to be my next um

559
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:53,279
that's a good one I mean yeah it's

560
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,500
everywhere it's in it's in every line um

561
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:57,058
even in cookies and wedding cake all

562
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,579
that stuff you can run into that blando

563
00:20:57,058 --> 00:21:02,279
skunk one banana OG has it very heavy

564
00:20:59,579 --> 00:21:04,439
you know and it's outcrosses it's what I

565
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:06,178
try to avoid most from skunk one myself

566
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:08,400
I mean maybe some people like it maybe

567
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:10,280
they like the high from blando I do not

568
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:14,580
like the high from Land though

569
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:16,200
okay any anything else that that can be

570
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:19,500
passed down from skunk one that's that

571
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:21,179
you can think of that's not desirable

572
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,460
was that the main the main thing that

573
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:25,440
comes to mind I mean other than like

574
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:28,019
depending on what your project is if you

575
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,538
want to breed something very uniform and

576
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:32,220
less plastic like that would be an

577
00:21:30,538 --> 00:21:34,619
undesirable trait if you're going for

578
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,700
uniformity right so that's another thing

579
00:21:34,619 --> 00:21:37,979
I would say

580
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,720
yeah so as always you know what you'd

581
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:42,720
like to see past should be relative to

582
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:45,600
your goals Counterpoint though

583
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,860
um s1s of Green Crack were like I mean

584
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:49,500
other than the fact that most of them

585
00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:53,038
were purple looking like they all look

586
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:55,500
like like green crack exactly so

587
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:58,019
there is ways to to find skunk one

588
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:01,500
examples that are more true reading than

589
00:21:58,019 --> 00:22:04,079
others but like how pure skunk one it is

590
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:06,900
I don't know you know what I mean so

591
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:09,960
okay it may be skunk one S3 you know

592
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:11,519
what I mean like maybe yeah uniform yeah

593
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,880
exactly

594
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:16,139
okay and to round skunk one out

595
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,600
um

596
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:20,400
other still

597
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:22,619
weird possibilities that people haven't

598
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,600
explored in your opinion or have we seen

599
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:27,839
enough of it that like was more or less

600
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:29,759
saying the range do you think man

601
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:32,279
um that is a tough one

602
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:33,900
that is a tough one

603
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:35,579
um

604
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,798
or maybe another way of framing it is

605
00:22:35,579 --> 00:22:40,558
like what's have you seen anything

606
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:43,019
really strange to come out of skunk one

607
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:45,859
apart from say trees as you mentioned

608
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:45,859
already an outlier

609
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:51,298
I haven't seen anything that I would

610
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:53,158
consider amazing wondrous unique

611
00:22:51,298 --> 00:22:55,139
examples out of skunk one that I haven't

612
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:56,400
seen prior but like I said like there's

613
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,080
some stuff I think that is worth

614
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,700
bringing with like the green crack that

615
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:01,859
you can take different directions and do

616
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:04,919
new novel things with um

617
00:23:01,859 --> 00:23:06,719
but I mean I think it would be more like

618
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:08,640
trying to find those already excellent

619
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,558
examples that exist as opposed to trying

620
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,080
to do seat hunts of what's left of skunk

621
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:15,119
one or is being presented as skunk one

622
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:16,678
because it really feels like it's all

623
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:21,058
been worked in a very specific Direction

624
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:23,220
and a far cry from what it once was

625
00:23:21,058 --> 00:23:26,099
yeah yeah and we have told that story a

626
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:28,079
few times so we won't get into that

627
00:23:26,099 --> 00:23:29,519
um okay so we can move on to something

628
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:32,579
you already mentioned Northern Lights

629
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:34,440
okay Northern Lights yeah yeah it's a

630
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:36,240
family I don't know which which one

631
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,679
we're gonna you know talk about or how

632
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,679
we broad stroke this one but

633
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:44,220
um yeah I don't even know where to start

634
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:48,298
uh most of the NL that anybody's ever

635
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:50,038
seen is nl1 and L2 or nl5 that's a quick

636
00:23:48,298 --> 00:23:52,259
way to Broad brush stroke it a lot of

637
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:54,779
what was used in hybrids were the nl5

638
00:23:52,259 --> 00:23:56,940
however Neville also used the nl1 a lot

639
00:23:54,779 --> 00:23:58,200
and L2 got used briefly

640
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:01,259
um and all two is supposed to be the

641
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:04,319
more cushy Hindu Kush one and all one

642
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:07,379
supposedly like Bubba you know like as

643
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:10,798
best people can kind of break apart and

644
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:13,080
in all five was a hybrid supposedly of a

645
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:15,960
Hawaiian and

646
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:18,720
um Afghani so it was supposed to be more

647
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:21,360
hybrid like narrow Leaf mixed in with

648
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,360
the the broad leaf and Neville tended to

649
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:27,240
like his his um selections with the nl5

650
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:30,599
across the haze over like say the nl1

651
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:33,240
haze or any of the other ones

652
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:35,759
okay so come back to this whole question

653
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,140
would you consider it to be wide quote

654
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:39,058
unquote or narrow in terms of

655
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:42,000
variability still

656
00:24:39,058 --> 00:24:44,158
so going through the nl5 that we got

657
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,980
from from what's his name I'm not going

658
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,840
to say his name because he's but um the

659
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:51,240
person who supposedly originated the

660
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:52,980
line it was quite variable quite

661
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,200
variable but there was a lot of like the

662
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:56,460
earthy chocolate in it you know that I

663
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,700
would expect from The Steve Murphy

664
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:01,319
Afghani based on like the nl1 and L2

665
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,120
um there's a lot of that in there but

666
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:04,859
there's a it's it's pretty wide and

667
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:07,079
variant I mean but it was it was open

668
00:25:04,859 --> 00:25:09,119
pollinated and I think the one before

669
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:12,119
that was open pollinated as well

670
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:14,819
so that also could be why

671
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:18,119
um it's really hard to say to to to

672
00:25:14,819 --> 00:25:20,639
really speak on knowing that I've seen a

673
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:22,918
perfect excellent example of nl5 while

674
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,259
I'm confident that's what we got I

675
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:26,759
cannot factually state that obviously

676
00:25:25,259 --> 00:25:28,558
like that would be too hard to do okay

677
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:29,819
there's always some faith in it you know

678
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:30,899
you're always taking someone's word at

679
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:33,418
some point

680
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:37,080
yep okay and as far as you can

681
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:39,600
generalize this uh again what traits

682
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:41,339
tend to be favorable

683
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:44,819
um in it and that people like to see

684
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:47,158
past okay so just in general what I'll

685
00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:49,740
say is nl1

686
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:52,860
um I mean it looks like Bubba it looks

687
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:55,019
like that's just what Bubba might be and

688
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:56,579
um if that's the case Bubba has so many

689
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:58,619
amazing traits and it's why it's still

690
00:25:56,579 --> 00:26:01,079
used as one of the modern lines

691
00:25:58,619 --> 00:26:03,119
constantly by people who who love it and

692
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:05,759
have kept it for years

693
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:07,079
um so I mean like that soapy earthy

694
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:09,658
chocolate

695
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:11,220
just really dense perfect for growing

696
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:14,400
indoor

697
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:16,200
um is like nl1 nl2 is very similar maybe

698
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,298
a little more stretchy

699
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,500
um

700
00:26:17,298 --> 00:26:21,480
uh trying to think of good examples

701
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:24,538
Neville thought that OG Kush was an nl2

702
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:26,099
base uh Kush 4 and L2 was Neville's

703
00:26:24,538 --> 00:26:27,960
prediction if I remember correctly and

704
00:26:26,099 --> 00:26:29,759
he was positive at least on the nl2

705
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,679
that's all I remember him talking about

706
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:34,140
when we would discussing OG Kush you'd

707
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:37,140
say that's my nl2 that's my nl2 I'm sure

708
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:40,200
of it so I by looking at it he thought

709
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:42,538
OG Kush was a great example of nl2 which

710
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:45,298
like as far as traits go

711
00:26:42,538 --> 00:26:47,339
people have consistently bred towards OG

712
00:26:45,298 --> 00:26:49,319
Kush type plants over the past 20 years

713
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:51,538
and that's why we ended up in this

714
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:54,899
Cookie's Direction in my opinion you

715
00:26:51,538 --> 00:26:56,640
know like so it is a desirable trait to

716
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:59,700
have things like OG Kush

717
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,980
but like you know desirable traits get

718
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:05,659
compounded over time then it gets a lot

719
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:07,980
less desirable in my opinion yeah

720
00:27:05,659 --> 00:27:09,480
oh undesirable

721
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,400
I don't know enough about them for

722
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,860
undesirables I only know a few examples

723
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:16,380
to compare them to of the no one and two

724
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:17,759
uh nl5 there I could talk about all

725
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,380
kinds of undesirables and that and

726
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:21,538
there's some booth in there

727
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:23,400
um it's it's another one where back in

728
00:27:21,538 --> 00:27:25,558
the day when we talk about a high

729
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:28,140
ceiling low floor it's a great example

730
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:30,839
of it it's a great example of an 80s

731
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:33,360
hybrid where you can find some really

732
00:27:30,839 --> 00:27:34,740
really nice stuff in it that um like

733
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:36,839
some of the chocolatey stuff in there is

734
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:39,058
just phenomenal and chocolate's not yeah

735
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:40,918
chocolate's not a common thing to see

736
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:43,918
I did cut you off as you're about to

737
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:46,740
talk about nl5 desirables so yeah yeah

738
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,720
okay yeah so yeah um the chocolate is

739
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:52,620
very desirable but there's a lot of

740
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:56,339
a lot of like again earthy low

741
00:27:52,619 --> 00:27:58,678
flavor low potency not very resinous

742
00:27:56,339 --> 00:28:00,538
kind of loose butted stuff in nl5 it's

743
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:02,220
all in there yeah um everything from

744
00:28:00,538 --> 00:28:05,640
both sides

745
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:08,120
how variable was uh was in terms of

746
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:08,120
structure

747
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:12,360
um it you know I mean it had a pretty

748
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:14,220
wide-ranging structure it's a hybrid so

749
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:15,719
you know it definitely did have a

750
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:18,000
wide-ranging structure but there was a

751
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:19,380
lot of um it wasn't so wide that you

752
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,179
would think oh [ __ ] does that have Haze

753
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:23,100
in it you know like it was it was a

754
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:24,538
manageable indoor structure uh

755
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:25,678
everything we saw

756
00:28:24,538 --> 00:28:28,259
okay

757
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:31,440
were there things that you saw

758
00:28:28,259 --> 00:28:33,240
reliably passed or like tended to pass

759
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,640
more frequently than other things hard

760
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,440
question again but yeah not enough data

761
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,580
yet not enough data yet to answer that

762
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,120
correctly

763
00:28:38,579 --> 00:28:43,500
all right and then last one as always uh

764
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:46,259
are there weird things that people

765
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:48,659
haven't seen tried considered yet

766
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:51,599
again not enough data yet I mean

767
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:54,600
considering in all five was most people

768
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:56,399
known new nl5 is a clone you know that

769
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:58,439
Neville had selected and we were given

770
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,940
an nl5 seed line that supposedly

771
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,919
predated

772
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:04,019
um anything Neville touched with because

773
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:06,900
Neville modified Northern Lights each

774
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:09,658
one in Amsterdam himself and none of

775
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:11,640
that was just pure from Greg even though

776
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:12,659
he gets upset when I say that

777
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,759
um

778
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:17,940
it's true it's just he modified

779
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:20,038
everything and nl5 was no different so

780
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:21,538
the nl5 that people are used to and

781
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:24,298
accustomed to that came from Amsterdam

782
00:29:21,538 --> 00:29:26,220
over here will be different than the nl5

783
00:29:24,298 --> 00:29:28,679
that stayed in the states

784
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:31,860
so yeah there's also that and and we

785
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:33,778
have a lot more data on nl5 and hybrids

786
00:29:31,859 --> 00:29:35,939
um and I'll find proper being the Clone

787
00:29:33,778 --> 00:29:37,919
that Neville used however the nl5c line

788
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,360
is still pretty fresh to everyone uh you

789
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,278
know only been around a few years being

790
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:43,439
passed around

791
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:45,240
okay well since we we have talked about

792
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,179
Haze and we have talked about Northern

793
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,500
Lights is it worth going into

794
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:51,659
um

795
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:55,259
nl5 Haze

796
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:56,940
I mean considering it's it's a hybrid of

797
00:29:55,259 --> 00:29:58,919
two of the bass lines I don't really

798
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:01,440
think so other than just say

799
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:04,380
um you know it's a fine example of an F1

800
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:07,259
you know roughly

801
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:09,240
um and it tends to be what spit out a

802
00:30:07,259 --> 00:30:11,099
lot of the keepers during the 90s as the

803
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,440
nl5 haze a lot of people kept a lot of

804
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:14,879
stuff from that so again

805
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,558
um uh when I refer to the high ceiling

806
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,360
low floor that's another one where you

807
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:19,678
could get you know five packs and find

808
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:21,778
nothing that you like and then someone

809
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,159
can grab one and find just this killer

810
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:25,140
example

811
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:26,640
um very very much luck of the dice on

812
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:30,600
that one

813
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:33,299
yeah yeah and I I imagine the nl5 haze

814
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:35,819
Keepers that we still have uh kind of

815
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:38,038
varied enough that it's hard to

816
00:30:35,819 --> 00:30:41,278
draw a line through them or generalize

817
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:44,278
about them yeah okay I agree

818
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:47,099
okay so we can move on to the Durban so

819
00:30:44,278 --> 00:30:50,038
just to clarify here what is this Durban

820
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:51,480
Poison that people talk about I mean you

821
00:30:50,038 --> 00:30:53,879
know I I don't know what it was

822
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,500
originally called I think that that the

823
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:59,039
name attributed to it I gotta look at

824
00:30:55,500 --> 00:31:01,079
the old um catalog from Sam but I want

825
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:03,599
to say Durban Poison when we refer to

826
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:05,819
Turbo poison proper is

827
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:08,158
what South Africa was producing as their

828
00:31:05,819 --> 00:31:10,379
commercial but at the time that was

829
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,940
being grown down there and it was

830
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:14,520
brought over by a few different people

831
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:17,100
Mel Frank had some and introduced it to

832
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:17,879
the population as trying to think who

833
00:31:17,099 --> 00:31:18,918
else

834
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:21,000
um

835
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:23,759
sssc claimed that they had a different

836
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,960
accession completely different and I

837
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:27,599
would believe that there's tended to be

838
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,538
more terpenolene leaning whereas uh Mel

839
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:33,719
Franks was notoriously more like aniseed

840
00:31:30,538 --> 00:31:36,058
like black licorice you know

841
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:39,899
um but yeah it was just a commercial

842
00:31:36,058 --> 00:31:41,879
African strain that made its way over

843
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:45,479
here and you know I mean it's still

844
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:47,159
around still being used so because of

845
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,538
that I I definitely consider it a

846
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:50,159
baseline because it's just never gone

847
00:31:48,538 --> 00:31:52,500
away even though it's not necessarily

848
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,960
known to be in a ton of stuff

849
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:57,720
um it's still capped still passed you

850
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,759
know in Clone forms and Seed lines I

851
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:02,220
mean people still you know bring sea

852
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:03,839
lines over from South Africa granted I

853
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,700
doubt they're very similar to what they

854
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:07,379
were in the past as far as like being a

855
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:09,120
pure Durban Poison

856
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:11,340
um Dutch passions got very famous and

857
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:13,199
that was like a German poison skunk one

858
00:32:11,339 --> 00:32:14,879
and that went around disturbing poison

859
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,140
as well which would be a German poison

860
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,039
hybrid

861
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,480
um

862
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:19,980
so a lot of people have different ideas

863
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,960
of driven poison

864
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:26,240
So speaking to the version that you know

865
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:28,679
what traits are favorable

866
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:31,319
the version that I'm most familiar with

867
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:32,820
is the terpenolene one

868
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:35,278
um it's very potent

869
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:37,918
it to me it adds a lot of flavor to

870
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:40,380
stuff but the flavor also comes with

871
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:42,720
that smell of witch hazel is the best

872
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:43,980
way to put it like if you can go grab a

873
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,079
bottle of witch hazel and smell it

874
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:47,460
that's typically what you'll smell with

875
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:49,019
the Durban that I'm used to working with

876
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:50,460
and I'm not even sure that's pure Durban

877
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:52,798
but it's the one the Clone that runs

878
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:55,558
around California

879
00:32:52,798 --> 00:32:57,119
um okay it's very resonance very potent

880
00:32:55,558 --> 00:33:01,200
um adds flavor those are the positive

881
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:03,658
traits uh yields very well good density

882
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,819
um finishes fast enough to be run up

883
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:08,039
north

884
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:09,658
as far as breeding like it's very

885
00:33:08,038 --> 00:33:10,859
unpredictable on what you will cross it

886
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:13,500
with because sometimes it'll just

887
00:33:10,859 --> 00:33:15,898
completely Dominate and it'll be seed

888
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:18,298
versions of itself mostly you know at

889
00:33:15,898 --> 00:33:19,139
least the smell and taste

890
00:33:18,298 --> 00:33:21,960
um

891
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:23,580
so it takes the right partner it's all I

892
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,538
can say on that like

893
00:33:23,579 --> 00:33:26,699
um I like what I like the

894
00:33:24,538 --> 00:33:28,379
interpinoleenic berry combinations a lot

895
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,819
because I feel like it accentuates the

896
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:32,278
berry I like your kind of lean and

897
00:33:29,819 --> 00:33:33,898
bubble gum flavors because I I bubblegum

898
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:35,519
smells because I I believe that it like

899
00:33:33,898 --> 00:33:38,099
brings out the flavor of the bubble gum

900
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:40,079
a lot so those those would be good

901
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:42,480
examples of things to breed with oh that

902
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:45,000
sounds really nice yeah I have a bunch

903
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,038
of the um the Durban bubble gums and

904
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,200
bubble gum durbins from CSI but he did

905
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:53,759
it both ways that we're gonna run

906
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:56,399
oh okay I'm excited to see that yeah

907
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:57,379
um what what's not good from it that can

908
00:33:56,398 --> 00:33:59,759
come out

909
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:03,179
because like I said it just dominates

910
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:04,859
the gift curse yeah and like when

911
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:06,659
Neville used to talk about terpenoline

912
00:34:04,859 --> 00:34:08,279
he would refer to it as cat piss because

913
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:10,858
some people smell like that witch hazel

914
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,780
smell it smells cat pissy or ammonia to

915
00:34:10,858 --> 00:34:15,299
them and to me it doesn't it smells just

916
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:16,679
like witch hazel I don't smell piss

917
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,960
um but he referred to it as the cat

918
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:20,338
pissy thing in Haze that that is like

919
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,858
literally the gift that keeps on giving

920
00:34:20,338 --> 00:34:25,199
that you can't chase away very hard to

921
00:34:22,858 --> 00:34:27,179
breed away from it in Haze but it's not

922
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,618
just Haze I mean it's in a lot of

923
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:30,659
different lines I've seen it pop up in

924
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:32,820
Afghani lines in Pakistani pure lines

925
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:34,260
all kinds of different lines have um

926
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,780
that's your pendling trait but it's most

927
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:39,540
most often associated with Jack Herer

928
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:41,280
train wrecked Urban things like that

929
00:34:39,539 --> 00:34:42,599
yep

930
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,240
okay

931
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:46,619
and again to round this one out uh there

932
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:49,858
are weird possibilities with it that

933
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:51,838
people haven't tried seeing considered

934
00:34:49,858 --> 00:34:53,398
I mean you mentioned you mentioned um

935
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:55,619
the bubble gum classes that's an

936
00:34:53,398 --> 00:34:58,559
interesting take on it yeah I like I

937
00:34:55,619 --> 00:35:01,140
like that um I really wanted to do so I

938
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:03,900
had a what we called the 95 Scentsy star

939
00:35:01,139 --> 00:35:05,639
Bubblegum expression and it was uh

940
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,200
is it was supposed to be it was

941
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:09,179
Superstar from Delta 9 Labs but it's

942
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:10,799
very terminally and super pink bubble

943
00:35:09,179 --> 00:35:13,139
gum and that was the first time I'd seen

944
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,780
the combination of those two

945
00:35:13,139 --> 00:35:17,219
like scents and flavors together and it

946
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:19,260
was just full on you could taste pink

947
00:35:17,219 --> 00:35:20,519
bubble gum all through it and the main

948
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:22,500
complaint with the Indiana bubble gum

949
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:24,000
cut is it has great smell

950
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,920
that the flavor doesn't translate it's

951
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,739
just earthy like they're Hatchy you know

952
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,358
what I mean like just in Translation but

953
00:35:28,739 --> 00:35:32,279
I'm pretty confident because what I've

954
00:35:30,358 --> 00:35:35,279
seen with the with terpenolin and

955
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:37,740
bubblegum Terps in the past that um the

956
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,119
tickets right there in this in those

957
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:42,419
seed lines

958
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:44,220
that's wicked yeah is any other

959
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:46,800
um pairing you can imagine that could be

960
00:35:44,219 --> 00:35:50,098
cool that you you might speculate about

961
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,660
so with the um Durbin Bonnet one thing

962
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:54,300
I'll say is I expected a lot of stuff

963
00:35:51,659 --> 00:35:56,460
like blue dream I and that's why I made

964
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,599
it I wanted some more like you did that

965
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,820
I didn't even know you did that yeah

966
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:02,940
yeah it's called trademark Chad

967
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:04,260
and oh that's the one okay yeah yeah

968
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:05,880
it's had a few different names I had to

969
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:07,320
change it because someone got mad and

970
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,338
said that it was their name first so I

971
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,900
changed it to

972
00:36:08,338 --> 00:36:11,460
trademark Chad because he said he was

973
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:14,880
going to trade market or trademarked it

974
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:16,199
so he's a Chad so I named after him

975
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,720
um

976
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:21,899
but yeah no it's it's I what I expected

977
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:23,459
was Blue Dream type stuff what I got was

978
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:25,440
all over the place there's even some

979
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:27,179
skunky stuff in there but you I

980
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,159
definitely did not expect from combining

981
00:36:27,179 --> 00:36:31,139
sure paneling and hard like blueberry

982
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:33,118
juice you know

983
00:36:31,139 --> 00:36:35,279
um so there are unique things that can

984
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,019
be done with it that are unexpected that

985
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,180
I would not predict even in lines that I

986
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:40,079
feel like I know real well so there I

987
00:36:39,179 --> 00:36:42,059
think there are still things that could

988
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:45,539
be done with it it's just really hard to

989
00:36:42,059 --> 00:36:47,219
to like think about things that can be

990
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:48,539
done well with your paneling and not

991
00:36:47,219 --> 00:36:50,098
just automatically assume it's going to

992
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:52,500
be ultra paneling based on having used

993
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:53,820
that German device in the past so but

994
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,920
there there is things that can be done

995
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:57,359
you know like so it's not something to

996
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,460
give up on it's kind of like deep chunk

997
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:01,980
too A lot of people like don't see much

998
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:03,599
value in deep chunk the the line from

999
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:05,760
Tom Hill

1000
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:08,519
um it's very earthy

1001
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:11,820
it's kind of like earthy dirt

1002
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:14,460
derps like just not really great but

1003
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:17,220
very resinous it does have a decent High

1004
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:18,838
to it and but the the tourists people

1005
00:37:17,219 --> 00:37:19,919
just don't like the Terps on it and it's

1006
00:37:18,838 --> 00:37:22,500
so dense a lot of people don't like

1007
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,480
breeding with it but it's it's one of

1008
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:27,300
those lines where if you find the right

1009
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:30,059
partner for it the chirps kind of set

1010
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:32,099
aside themselves and let the the well I

1011
00:37:30,059 --> 00:37:33,500
shouldn't say terms but what would you

1012
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:36,059
call it um

1013
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:39,599
yeah odor scent cannabinoids everything

1014
00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:40,920
passed through uh you know and um yeah I

1015
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,680
it's

1016
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:45,900
you wouldn't expect it but it's cool

1017
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:47,759
when it happens you know and and that

1018
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:49,079
tells me that maybe there are more novel

1019
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,460
things can be done with deep chunk that

1020
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:52,019
people haven't really thought of you

1021
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:53,880
know so I think we'll be doing more

1022
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:55,559
stuff with that in the future too

1023
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:57,599
all right little shout out to deep chunk

1024
00:37:55,559 --> 00:38:00,139
there yeah

1025
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:03,599
okay so Tom Hill the purple purple

1026
00:38:00,139 --> 00:38:05,699
prince Tom Hill king of purples there

1027
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,920
you go

1028
00:38:05,699 --> 00:38:10,679
okay so we're moving on to Afghani

1029
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:13,200
number one yeah Afghani and everyone

1030
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:15,059
um who introduced that is that another

1031
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:17,098
Mel Frank one it might be I don't want

1032
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:20,338
to get that wrong

1033
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:21,480
um it's been a minute but Afghani one is

1034
00:38:20,338 --> 00:38:24,358
an old

1035
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:27,199
quote unquote pre-soviet Afghani

1036
00:38:24,358 --> 00:38:27,199
um supposed to be pure

1037
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:31,858
acrid ammonia and then I've heard people

1038
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:34,739
say green apple all the way to Green

1039
00:38:31,858 --> 00:38:37,559
Apple like I all the Afghani one I saw

1040
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:39,899
was all acrid ammonia

1041
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:42,119
um some was more loose butted and I

1042
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:44,280
didn't really expect that it's it's The

1043
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:46,980
Afghani one seedlines very

1044
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:49,980
um not uniform but it is what I expect

1045
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:53,579
now knowing older afghanis like it's not

1046
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:56,338
all like super dense Frosty

1047
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:57,900
dank you know what I mean like there's a

1048
00:38:56,338 --> 00:38:59,219
lot there's a very low selling in

1049
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:02,059
Afghani one but there was some really

1050
00:38:59,219 --> 00:39:02,059
cool [ __ ] in there too

1051
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:09,720
okay so in terms of like what you

1052
00:39:06,358 --> 00:39:10,980
wouldn't want to see coming out of it uh

1053
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:11,639
what I wouldn't want to see an Afghani

1054
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,740
one

1055
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:15,179
um the Smoke's very harsh

1056
00:39:13,739 --> 00:39:17,819
that's one thing I remember most about

1057
00:39:15,179 --> 00:39:19,799
like the cut that we ran was that it was

1058
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:21,599
very harsh a lot of people didn't like

1059
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,640
smoking it it wasn't a pleasant smoke it

1060
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,859
would make everyone cough

1061
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:27,719
um it hurt to smoke it it wasn't because

1062
00:39:25,858 --> 00:39:29,578
of bad grows it was just a very harsh I

1063
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:31,379
don't know if it's because the uh the

1064
00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:33,660
oils or whatever

1065
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:35,099
um yeah it was always super harsh very

1066
00:39:33,659 --> 00:39:36,779
hashy

1067
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:38,760
um a lot of what I crossed it to just

1068
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:41,160
looked like itself

1069
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:43,800
so

1070
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:46,500
unless you really loved that plant it

1071
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,940
wasn't super desirable I remember

1072
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:50,699
Neville's quotes about it was that it

1073
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:52,079
was like an uninspiring boring High

1074
00:39:50,699 --> 00:39:53,639
um he thought it was very Bland but he

1075
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,980
was like I said he was into the haze

1076
00:39:53,639 --> 00:39:58,440
type eyes the Speedy like

1077
00:39:55,980 --> 00:40:01,740
very very different type of high than

1078
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:03,119
like a narcotic numbing dumbing gown of

1079
00:40:01,739 --> 00:40:04,739
Afghani one

1080
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,000
um so in the over the years like you

1081
00:40:04,739 --> 00:40:07,259
look at old high times too it wasn't

1082
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,358
just Neville there's other people that

1083
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:11,940
talk about Afghani one and just weren't

1084
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:14,159
really interested in it they um some

1085
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:15,659
people like uh are The Connoisseur

1086
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:18,598
thought afghanis were going to be the

1087
00:40:15,659 --> 00:40:20,759
end of cannabis As We Know It with that

1088
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:23,760
being at the spearhead you know

1089
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:25,800
um so there are some undesirable traits

1090
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,500
desirable traits though like

1091
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:31,260
resin production

1092
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:33,480
um that dumbed down narcotic High could

1093
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:35,520
be used and modified to be something

1094
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:37,440
more complex you know combined with

1095
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:39,059
something hazy there's so many different

1096
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,619
directions you could take Afghani one

1097
00:40:39,059 --> 00:40:42,900
and I don't know that all of them have

1098
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:44,338
been done per se but I don't know that

1099
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,200
there's really any good seed lines that

1100
00:40:44,338 --> 00:40:49,199
represent Afghani Ones Still

1101
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:53,460
and that's also an issue

1102
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:55,980
what is your heirloom Afghani

1103
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:57,960
so that was from a guy named bite me off

1104
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:59,940
of the Mr Nice forums he was a dude that

1105
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:02,940
was a Smuggler back in Florida during

1106
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:04,320
the late 80s early 90s and he'd handed

1107
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:06,539
me a bunch of different bags of seed and

1108
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:09,359
only a few had actual labels on what

1109
00:41:06,539 --> 00:41:11,460
they were like it we had Afghani we had

1110
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:12,900
this one called God and it was it was a

1111
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:14,099
predated God bud so it had nothing to do

1112
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,960
with God but that was one of the first

1113
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:17,700
things I asked when I saw it we had a

1114
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,900
Korean Afghani

1115
00:41:17,699 --> 00:41:22,199
um might have been one more and then

1116
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:24,300
there was like numbers 1 through 14 and

1117
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:26,159
it was just big bags of old backseat and

1118
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,660
basically it was all this easy it kept

1119
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:29,819
as a Smuggler that he thought was good

1120
00:41:27,659 --> 00:41:30,659
weed you know and that's where it came

1121
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,559
from

1122
00:41:30,659 --> 00:41:34,199
um

1123
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:35,578
he didn't have a lot of info on it best

1124
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:37,259
I can gather is like some kind of Super

1125
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:39,900
Skunk hybrid because it lines up with

1126
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:42,359
that really well but it also has very

1127
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:44,338
narrow leaves and a lot of uh outcrosses

1128
00:41:42,358 --> 00:41:45,239
so I just don't know what that is

1129
00:41:44,338 --> 00:41:48,299
yeah

1130
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:51,118
interesting yeah it's a totally

1131
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:55,200
fascinating one to me but it's also very

1132
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:57,119
like sexually unstable you know

1133
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:59,399
um usually the skunkier stuff is more

1134
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:01,380
sexually unstable and I can see why

1135
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:03,960
people would have right away from that

1136
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:06,660
because it was so sexually unstable

1137
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:08,338
but yeah it's one of those lines that I

1138
00:42:06,659 --> 00:42:10,559
I felt was really really special and

1139
00:42:08,338 --> 00:42:12,599
kind of like a little time capsule

1140
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:14,338
yeah but I assume you wouldn't

1141
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:17,099
necessarily relate it to Afghani number

1142
00:42:14,338 --> 00:42:19,380
one right it's just boring or do you

1143
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:21,300
think you could still

1144
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:24,720
so there are some theories out there

1145
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:27,480
that the Afghan T used in Maple Leaf

1146
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:29,519
Indica was actually Afghani one that is

1147
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,300
a legitimate Theory

1148
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:32,820
um

1149
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:34,260
in in saying that it would also be

1150
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:35,940
saying that Neville may not have been so

1151
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:38,460
honest about what he used in Afghan tea

1152
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:39,059
but by the time or in

1153
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,980
um

1154
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:42,779
in Maple Leaf indica and super skunk as

1155
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:44,639
the Afghan T but during that time he

1156
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:46,560
wasn't even he didn't like Sam the skunk

1157
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:48,420
Band by that point and

1158
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:50,759
I don't see his ego letting him

1159
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,480
attribute anything to Sam if he did use

1160
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:55,500
it

1161
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:57,838
that accurate nature is definitely in

1162
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:59,639
the heirloom Afghani that's in Afghani

1163
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:01,078
one yeah there was a similarity there

1164
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:02,098
now it doesn't mean that it had Afghani

1165
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:04,740
one in it it could have been a similar

1166
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:07,680
type Afghani for sure yeah

1167
00:43:04,739 --> 00:43:08,879
um but it's in there so yeah it's hard

1168
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:10,199
to say okay

1169
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,480
okay

1170
00:43:10,199 --> 00:43:14,818
uh in terms of The Afghani number one

1171
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:17,880
again are there weird paths that people

1172
00:43:14,818 --> 00:43:19,318
haven't taken yet like I would say so

1173
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,940
but like I said I don't I don't know if

1174
00:43:19,318 --> 00:43:22,920
the seed lines out there to be gotten

1175
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:25,139
pure anymore um seedsman was selling it

1176
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,880
for a long time but it slowly drifted

1177
00:43:25,139 --> 00:43:28,440
away from what most people knew as

1178
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,780
Afghani one and nobody was really happy

1179
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:33,179
with what they were getting there

1180
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:35,640
um which it could just be taking it in a

1181
00:43:33,179 --> 00:43:36,838
bad Direction over the years and be the

1182
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:38,940
same line

1183
00:43:36,838 --> 00:43:40,858
but yeah I I it's one of those ones

1184
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:42,659
where I don't know I don't know if it's

1185
00:43:40,858 --> 00:43:44,578
still possible to even get a pure seed

1186
00:43:42,659 --> 00:43:45,838
line like that that represents what it

1187
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:50,220
was

1188
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:51,960
okay that's a good one to cover off yeah

1189
00:43:50,219 --> 00:43:54,299
all right uh anything else you wanted to

1190
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:57,300
say about that one

1191
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:59,818
no I think that's that's about it

1192
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:03,619
all right well we can move on to a

1193
00:43:59,818 --> 00:44:03,619
favorite old school blueberry

1194
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,880
we had a little debate on whether they

1195
00:44:06,659 --> 00:44:11,159
should go into old school or modern yeah

1196
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:13,559
and

1197
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:14,940
I really do you think it belongs just

1198
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:18,000
like at that

1199
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:19,740
mid 90s to late 90s period kind of

1200
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,420
pushes it back into that Dutch era of

1201
00:44:19,739 --> 00:44:22,139
being old school

1202
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:24,900
um

1203
00:44:22,139 --> 00:44:26,759
yeah I mean I could wax poetic without

1204
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:29,280
blueberry forever all right I'll just

1205
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,780
start with the the basic questions so uh

1206
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,280
how wide or narrow

1207
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:36,839
do you think it is

1208
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:39,839
okay blueberry proper more narrow than

1209
00:44:36,838 --> 00:44:40,739
most lines now

1210
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:44,460
yeah

1211
00:44:40,739 --> 00:44:47,098
um because of DJ's approach I think so

1212
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:50,579
the wacky breeding approach and I say

1213
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:52,140
that with a lot of love wacky Crossing

1214
00:44:50,579 --> 00:44:55,140
two different completely different

1215
00:44:52,139 --> 00:44:58,559
opposite types over several Generations

1216
00:44:55,139 --> 00:45:01,379
will make for some weird [ __ ]

1217
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:03,420
Yeah so basically he he kept widening

1218
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:06,358
and didn't do very much narrowing is

1219
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:10,200
there widening and inbreeding

1220
00:45:06,358 --> 00:45:12,239
okay yeah like the two like I don't even

1221
00:45:10,199 --> 00:45:14,219
know how

1222
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:16,019
that's like the like the opposite

1223
00:45:14,219 --> 00:45:17,519
intention like like from a breeding

1224
00:45:16,019 --> 00:45:19,739
perspective like thinking about that way

1225
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:21,358
I would like if I

1226
00:45:19,739 --> 00:45:22,799
tried to rationalize that I would be

1227
00:45:21,358 --> 00:45:24,119
like okay well that doesn't make any

1228
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,800
sense I'm

1229
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:27,960
doing the opposite of what I'm trying to

1230
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:29,460
achieve I think you know like am I

1231
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,500
trying to widen it or am I trying to

1232
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:34,318
make it totally inbred these are two

1233
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:36,960
different directions and by doing like

1234
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:39,420
Crossing using roughly two or three

1235
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:41,519
plants and Crossing sativa looking to

1236
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:44,639
Indica looking in the same line multiple

1237
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:47,159
Generations is literally doing

1238
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:49,500
opposite work yeah I see and I see what

1239
00:45:47,159 --> 00:45:51,420
you mean now yeah I see what you mean so

1240
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:53,639
he it's inbreeding in the sense that

1241
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:56,039
he's kept it within the family so to

1242
00:45:53,639 --> 00:45:57,980
speak yes but he wasn't using similar

1243
00:45:56,039 --> 00:46:00,920
individuals within the family

1244
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:03,539
yeah Divergent right kind of yeah

1245
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:06,780
interesting okay it's a very interesting

1246
00:46:03,539 --> 00:46:08,000
artistic approach to the breeding for

1247
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:11,640
sure

1248
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,900
okay well what traits do you like seeing

1249
00:46:11,639 --> 00:46:17,039
past

1250
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:19,559
so I like seeing actual Berry smells

1251
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:21,119
past because the high to that is what

1252
00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:23,639
like I always associate with

1253
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:24,780
anti-anxiety high for myself and that

1254
00:46:23,639 --> 00:46:26,460
doesn't necessarily ring true for

1255
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:28,319
everyone on Earth so please don't apply

1256
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:29,818
it to yourself if some people will smoke

1257
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:32,159
blueberry and [ __ ] hate it and like

1258
00:46:29,818 --> 00:46:33,480
make make some flip out so I definitely

1259
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:35,219
don't want to insinuate that it works

1260
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:37,019
that way for everyone but for me if I

1261
00:46:35,219 --> 00:46:38,639
have blueberry scents like blueberry jam

1262
00:46:37,019 --> 00:46:40,380
type scents or even blueberry muffin

1263
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:43,139
type sense I know that generally

1264
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:45,539
speaking it's going to be a mild happy

1265
00:46:43,139 --> 00:46:47,159
ride for me it's not going to do it's

1266
00:46:45,539 --> 00:46:48,960
not going to yank me to a place that

1267
00:46:47,159 --> 00:46:51,679
like all of a sudden I'm like in the

1268
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,679
corner going [ __ ]

1269
00:46:51,858 --> 00:46:55,799
you know like it doesn't do that and and

1270
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:56,939
that's what I appreciate about it and

1271
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,619
that's why I love it so much that's a

1272
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:01,380
trait that I love is that Berry scent

1273
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:02,519
because of how it um affects me as far

1274
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:04,380
as other traits there's beautiful

1275
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:06,179
purples in there

1276
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:08,818
um in my opinion DJ has some of the most

1277
00:47:06,179 --> 00:47:10,739
beautiful unique looking work that's

1278
00:47:08,818 --> 00:47:11,579
ever existed

1279
00:47:10,739 --> 00:47:14,098
um

1280
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:16,619
so yeah there's a lot of it does seem to

1281
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:18,900
have a fairly distinctive look yes it

1282
00:47:16,619 --> 00:47:20,160
does I I can spot it in anything like I

1283
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:21,838
really can I've worked with all of it

1284
00:47:20,159 --> 00:47:23,219
enough to where I can spot blueberry in

1285
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:25,078
anything

1286
00:47:23,219 --> 00:47:27,719
um it's very distinctive

1287
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:29,579
and yeah like I said it there's so many

1288
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:31,379
different families of blueberry but

1289
00:47:29,579 --> 00:47:33,180
they're all the same family like he DJ

1290
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:34,500
took it like there's a blue moonshine

1291
00:47:33,179 --> 00:47:36,059
Direction in the old time moonshine

1292
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:38,760
Direction there was

1293
00:47:36,059 --> 00:47:41,219
um there was flow which isn't even the

1294
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:42,960
berry selection but it's like two of the

1295
00:47:41,219 --> 00:47:44,338
three parents as opposed to all three

1296
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,380
parents

1297
00:47:44,338 --> 00:47:48,539
um it's a completely separate line but

1298
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:50,818
still related which you know still

1299
00:47:48,539 --> 00:47:51,420
causes some inbreeding issues

1300
00:47:50,818 --> 00:47:53,699
um

1301
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:55,260
what else is there Vanna Luna which is

1302
00:47:53,699 --> 00:47:57,539
like the blueberry sativa direction

1303
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:59,460
there's f-13 which is also another

1304
00:47:57,539 --> 00:48:00,838
attempt at the blueberry sativa

1305
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:02,760
Direction

1306
00:48:00,838 --> 00:48:06,119
um and his modern blueberry like to me

1307
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:08,280
is more like a little squat Afghani type

1308
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:10,440
um which you know a lot of people

1309
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:12,000
typically think of blueberry sativa and

1310
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:13,380
if you grow modern DJ blueberry you're

1311
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,519
not going to get stuff very close to

1312
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:17,700
what a lot of people expect from

1313
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:20,759
blueberry sativa back in the day

1314
00:48:17,699 --> 00:48:24,960
yeah nice good summary

1315
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:26,280
what would you not like to see past Okay

1316
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,960
so

1317
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:30,359
a lot of trouble I've had with blueberry

1318
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:32,818
has been when I breed with it inside

1319
00:48:30,358 --> 00:48:34,440
itself and don't outcross it all and

1320
00:48:32,818 --> 00:48:37,318
have no outcrosses anywhere in it

1321
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:39,780
there's a lot of mutations there's

1322
00:48:37,318 --> 00:48:41,579
albinism which is a horrible trait in my

1323
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:43,040
opinion where you know the leaves grow

1324
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:46,500
out white

1325
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:49,800
and yeah you can't there's no energy for

1326
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:50,760
the plant can't reflect light right so

1327
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,619
um

1328
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:55,020
yeah there's a lot of really negative

1329
00:48:52,619 --> 00:48:58,200
mutations and recessive traits in

1330
00:48:55,019 --> 00:49:00,960
blueberry that exist and what I've

1331
00:48:58,199 --> 00:49:03,299
noticed is with a single outcross if you

1332
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:06,059
use the Right male or female

1333
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:08,519
um from the blue line and outcross all

1334
00:49:06,059 --> 00:49:09,719
those those mutations almost immediately

1335
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:12,539
disappear

1336
00:49:09,719 --> 00:49:13,980
and you get you can get a lot of the

1337
00:49:12,539 --> 00:49:16,139
great traits that blueberry brings in

1338
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:17,579
hybrids which is why its popularity in

1339
00:49:16,139 --> 00:49:19,440
my opinion took off when people were

1340
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:21,839
making hybrids with it some of the most

1341
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,000
famous lines out there like the blue

1342
00:49:21,838 --> 00:49:25,619
dream or what else is a good blueberry

1343
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,780
you can't bubbleberry the original

1344
00:49:25,619 --> 00:49:29,579
bubbleberry things like that are so

1345
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:32,400
beloved

1346
00:49:29,579 --> 00:49:34,140
yeah yeah

1347
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,980
um obviously a question is very close to

1348
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:37,980
you

1349
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:40,679
um are there other directions or paths

1350
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:42,780
that you can see still remain to be

1351
00:49:40,679 --> 00:49:45,899
taken

1352
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:48,180
hmm I tried to cover all the bases

1353
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:49,619
um yeah but yeah like I one thing I

1354
00:49:48,179 --> 00:49:51,000
didn't expect when Crossing into like

1355
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:53,460
triangle was a bunch of Chinese food

1356
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:57,059
Terps like there are a lot of different

1357
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:59,940
Savory yes very Savory yeah extremely

1358
00:49:57,059 --> 00:50:01,380
Savory with no Berry like

1359
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:03,119
yeah there's a lot of different

1360
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:05,220
directions and unique directions you can

1361
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:06,420
take a good like a really good selection

1362
00:50:05,219 --> 00:50:08,759
of blueberry

1363
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:11,338
that don't even necessitate having Berry

1364
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:15,000
smells or any of it you know what I mean

1365
00:50:11,338 --> 00:50:17,279
so it's it's saying it's a good line for

1366
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:20,818
pretty much anything explicit line is

1367
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:23,940
yeah for exploration I don't want to I

1368
00:50:20,818 --> 00:50:27,239
mean like referring to DJ's lines proper

1369
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:28,800
I would say in hybrids is their best

1370
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:31,439
um

1371
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:33,060
it's hard to say low low ceiling High

1372
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:36,000
floor because there aren't a lot of

1373
00:50:33,059 --> 00:50:38,219
blueberry clones capped from that that

1374
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,780
are like specifically from DJ's lines

1375
00:50:38,219 --> 00:50:42,179
that people are like this is my DJ Short

1376
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:43,740
Blueberry cut it rocks it rocks the

1377
00:50:42,179 --> 00:50:44,940
house I'm passing it around and it's

1378
00:50:43,739 --> 00:50:48,419
made it around that didn't happen a lot

1379
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:51,358
we have DJ's 98 selection from his F4

1380
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:52,858
line that he selected that's passed

1381
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:54,299
around a lot

1382
00:50:52,858 --> 00:50:56,338
um there's different blueberry clones

1383
00:50:54,300 --> 00:51:00,240
out there with no real good provenance

1384
00:50:56,338 --> 00:51:02,159
like um but Dabney blue is one

1385
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:04,558
um what's another one

1386
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:06,779
even even my Riot Barry OG the original

1387
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:08,819
blueberry muffin cut was

1388
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:11,160
um The Proven answers we don't know that

1389
00:51:08,818 --> 00:51:12,420
it was directly from DJs there's a lot

1390
00:51:11,159 --> 00:51:14,098
of blueberry cuts out there that are

1391
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:15,240
like that

1392
00:51:14,099 --> 00:51:17,280
yeah

1393
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:19,078
okay

1394
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:21,720
it's kind of it's cool to know though

1395
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:24,000
that the presumably then that the

1396
00:51:21,719 --> 00:51:25,858
blueberry scent profile

1397
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,900
um isn't confined to that family

1398
00:51:25,858 --> 00:51:30,659
necessarily that like it's possible to

1399
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:33,780
see it crop up in other places man there

1400
00:51:30,659 --> 00:51:35,759
was a um a sour diesel crust to Irene

1401
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:37,500
and like I cannot prove that Irene

1402
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,000
doesn't have blueberry in it it might

1403
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:41,579
but

1404
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,318
if not that Sour Diesel Irene was some

1405
00:51:41,579 --> 00:51:45,359
of the most blueberry cereal blueberry

1406
00:51:43,318 --> 00:51:47,338
muffin type stuff that I've ever smoked

1407
00:51:45,358 --> 00:51:49,199
it's amazing absolutely phenomenal and

1408
00:51:47,338 --> 00:51:52,380
it pops up fairly regularly in that

1409
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:54,000
hybrid so when you think of diesel and

1410
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:55,680
Irene would you think that that was a

1411
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,960
possibility or is that a complete

1412
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:58,558
surprise it was a complete surprise I

1413
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,940
mean

1414
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:02,339
um OG Kush

1415
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:04,079
some some expressions of it you can get

1416
00:52:02,338 --> 00:52:06,480
are almost like sweet cereal

1417
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:08,220
so that part I can see

1418
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,838
um like almost like a trick cereal

1419
00:52:08,219 --> 00:52:11,939
having it

1420
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:13,858
a sour diesel and Irene like burnt

1421
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:15,539
rubber and Irene I would think would

1422
00:52:13,858 --> 00:52:18,598
pull it more towards like this burnt

1423
00:52:15,539 --> 00:52:20,400
rubber like harsh OG tones OG Kush type

1424
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:22,260
tones but it's not I mean they're there

1425
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,940
in some of those expressions but like

1426
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:26,520
that expression was full on blueberry

1427
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:28,500
it's it we called it the saurine 16.

1428
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:30,119
it's phenomenal phenomenal some of us

1429
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:33,239
keep it still

1430
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:35,579
amazing yeah sounds like a very cool

1431
00:52:33,239 --> 00:52:37,799
plant and I've heard of people getting

1432
00:52:35,579 --> 00:52:40,800
um blueberry from things like big bud

1433
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:41,818
so there's also that you know like it's

1434
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,818
out there there's different things

1435
00:52:41,818 --> 00:52:46,199
putting out Berry towns for sure

1436
00:52:44,818 --> 00:52:50,539
nice

1437
00:52:46,199 --> 00:52:50,539
okay anything else on the blueberry mat

1438
00:52:51,358 --> 00:52:54,480
um

1439
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:56,900
just that I own JD short Soul that's

1440
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,900
about it

1441
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:02,940
that's about it I think that rounds out

1442
00:53:01,139 --> 00:53:04,858
our

1443
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:06,659
coverage of like the older generation

1444
00:53:04,858 --> 00:53:09,480
yeah

1445
00:53:06,659 --> 00:53:10,980
and I think we can move on to what we

1446
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:12,900
would consider some of the more modern

1447
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:14,760
building blocks

1448
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:17,760
and you just mentioned it but we can

1449
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:21,359
start with the OG Kush I think OG Kush

1450
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:22,619
so um yeah I guess we know this traces

1451
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:26,639
back to

1452
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:28,019
um the triangle Kush as best we know and

1453
00:53:26,639 --> 00:53:30,000
as far as triangle Kush a lot of people

1454
00:53:28,019 --> 00:53:31,079
think it's related to chem 91 it could

1455
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,599
be

1456
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:36,599
might just be similar we just don't know

1457
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:38,700
yet there's no like facts there yet

1458
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:41,280
um but triangle Kush seems to be the

1459
00:53:38,699 --> 00:53:43,139
origin point for OG Kush

1460
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:45,480
um what's the best way to describe OG

1461
00:53:43,139 --> 00:53:48,358
Kush in a roundabout way it has a very

1462
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:51,000
specific budge structure

1463
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:53,400
um does very low

1464
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,900
calyx Leaf ratio I think that's the way

1465
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,818
it goes lower high I always forget that

1466
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:58,680
how that goes but there's been there's

1467
00:53:56,818 --> 00:54:00,000
not a lot of stuff to trim on an OG Kush

1468
00:53:58,679 --> 00:54:01,858
and that's why one of the reasons that

1469
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,199
people loved it so much it's a very

1470
00:54:01,858 --> 00:54:05,460
dense cushy some you know like it

1471
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:08,879
depends on the cut you have and how you

1472
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:12,300
grow it it could be really soapy Piney

1473
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:15,660
um it can be fuely gassy it can be

1474
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:16,500
earthy as [ __ ] if it's grown real midsy

1475
00:54:15,659 --> 00:54:18,118
um

1476
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:21,599
but yeah and then there's also sweets

1477
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:23,338
right it's very potent and I think for

1478
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:26,039
me the high like the best way to equate

1479
00:54:23,338 --> 00:54:29,460
it would be the most well-rounded high

1480
00:54:26,039 --> 00:54:31,739
of any of the Clones that I've run or

1481
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:34,740
plants or lines or any of it like it

1482
00:54:31,739 --> 00:54:36,899
seems to have the best of The Afghani

1483
00:54:34,739 --> 00:54:38,519
type highs that people most associate

1484
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:42,358
with afghanis being narcotic or whatever

1485
00:54:38,519 --> 00:54:43,739
but it's also very cerebral and it gets

1486
00:54:42,358 --> 00:54:45,659
people twisted like it'll make it so you

1487
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:48,719
can't drive if you smoke a good OG and

1488
00:54:45,659 --> 00:54:51,838
like get twisted on it so that's that's

1489
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:52,679
major components it breeds really well

1490
00:54:51,838 --> 00:54:55,318
um

1491
00:54:52,679 --> 00:54:56,699
a lot of the reasons I think OG took off

1492
00:54:55,318 --> 00:54:59,279
was because it was during the early days

1493
00:54:56,699 --> 00:55:01,139
of the collectives and it was a clone

1494
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:04,319
that you could hybridize and it

1495
00:55:01,139 --> 00:55:06,779
routinely give you over 25 THC

1496
00:55:04,318 --> 00:55:11,159
and because collectives were so driven

1497
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:13,380
at THC numbers I think it was almost

1498
00:55:11,159 --> 00:55:15,358
like a self-fulfilling prophecy that OG

1499
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:17,579
Kush got used so much

1500
00:55:15,358 --> 00:55:20,519
because it was the one thing reliably

1501
00:55:17,579 --> 00:55:25,380
passing those THC numbers

1502
00:55:20,519 --> 00:55:27,900
yep what were what were bad things bad

1503
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:31,260
um what were less favorable traits

1504
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:34,139
to come out of it the lank bro

1505
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:36,300
nobody likes the OG link nobody likes to

1506
00:55:34,139 --> 00:55:38,940
have to stock their plants and like or

1507
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:40,559
stake it and um and like net it and all

1508
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:42,358
that [ __ ] I don't like having to do that

1509
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:45,059
like I've almost lost my eye a thousand

1510
00:55:42,358 --> 00:55:46,858
times on Stakes because of OG Kush

1511
00:55:45,059 --> 00:55:48,240
um but yeah that's I'd say that is the

1512
00:55:46,858 --> 00:55:49,920
main bad trade for Moji Chris there's

1513
00:55:48,239 --> 00:55:52,139
not a lot of bad that comes from OG Kush

1514
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:55,440
to be honest it's a very so OG Kush may

1515
00:55:52,139 --> 00:55:57,000
cause blindness yeah right you may like

1516
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:59,818
I know I have so many friends that have

1517
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:02,338
had their eyes like permit scars like by

1518
00:55:59,818 --> 00:56:04,980
their eyes from getting hit with steaks

1519
00:56:02,338 --> 00:56:07,799
um yeah the Flop the link that's the

1520
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:09,780
most undesirable trait in OG Kush in my

1521
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:11,700
opinion I'm trying to think of any un

1522
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:13,500
any other undesirable trait and there

1523
00:56:11,699 --> 00:56:15,239
really isn't it's it's a remark it's

1524
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:16,920
super consistent right that structure

1525
00:56:15,239 --> 00:56:18,838
because even in hybrids that I've grown

1526
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:20,940
envious ones like you you definitely see

1527
00:56:18,838 --> 00:56:22,380
it all the time yeah

1528
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:23,760
um it's very consistent for the

1529
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:26,640
structure

1530
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:28,800
um the high the smell the potency

1531
00:56:26,639 --> 00:56:30,058
and I really think just because it made

1532
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:31,800
everyone look like a professional

1533
00:56:30,059 --> 00:56:34,079
breeder once you had it you know what I

1534
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:36,000
mean like if you if once you have OG

1535
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:38,400
Kush Every Single Seed line that you're

1536
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:41,699
kicking out crossed with it is upwards

1537
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:43,019
of 23 THC if grown okay you know what I

1538
00:56:41,699 --> 00:56:46,379
mean you've grown midsie it'll be about

1539
00:56:43,019 --> 00:56:47,880
23 plus so it made a lot of people

1540
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:51,119
really

1541
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:53,760
um look more effective and knowledgeable

1542
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:56,220
and

1543
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:58,559
just effective at breeding because they

1544
00:56:56,219 --> 00:57:00,000
were using OG

1545
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:01,559
but then we saw what happened with that

1546
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,500
everybody did the same thing and got the

1547
00:57:01,559 --> 00:57:07,440
same idea and realized the same thing

1548
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:09,358
yeah yeah and while we

1549
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:11,159
you know this in a sense you could call

1550
00:57:09,358 --> 00:57:12,539
it like quote unquote a family but

1551
00:57:11,159 --> 00:57:14,940
really it's like a collection of

1552
00:57:12,539 --> 00:57:18,000
different cuts that people have kept

1553
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:21,599
right over time it's like a a collection

1554
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,579
of different bag seeds of uh one cut you

1555
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:25,440
know what I mean or a backseat of a bag

1556
00:57:23,579 --> 00:57:27,119
seat of one cut that constantly kept

1557
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:29,579
that expression going down

1558
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:31,619
yeah yeah

1559
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:33,359
um I wanted to try this question for

1560
00:57:31,619 --> 00:57:35,519
this one because it does tend to be you

1561
00:57:33,358 --> 00:57:37,500
know cuts um yeah

1562
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:40,159
how would you go about making this into

1563
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:40,159
a regular line

1564
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:48,179
so I saw one person try to go make uh OG

1565
00:57:46,318 --> 00:57:49,440
Kush regular seed line using an Afghani

1566
00:57:48,179 --> 00:57:51,539
outcross

1567
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,780
they asked me any outcross that he used

1568
00:57:51,539 --> 00:57:56,818
was auto flowering and kind of

1569
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:58,680
hermaphroditic so

1570
00:57:56,818 --> 00:58:00,599
but I I think he had the right idea in

1571
00:57:58,679 --> 00:58:02,639
using an Afghani type because that'll

1572
00:58:00,599 --> 00:58:05,760
help help pull down some of that link

1573
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:08,578
you know um I think Urkel has made

1574
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:11,280
excellent outcrosses so like maybe an uh

1575
00:58:08,579 --> 00:58:13,800
Merkel regular seed line uh makes

1576
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:17,940
excellent outcrosses to OG

1577
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:20,160
um but for just keeping OG like OG

1578
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:22,079
I would recommend like a Bubba bat cross

1579
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:23,818
seed line

1580
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,680
yeah so you get some of the structure

1581
00:58:23,818 --> 00:58:28,318
back of Bubba Bubba Bubba Kush already

1582
00:58:25,679 --> 00:58:30,480
has OG Kush in it so you're reinforcing

1583
00:58:28,318 --> 00:58:33,058
a lot of the OG Kush traits while

1584
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:36,000
bringing in some of that structure and

1585
00:58:33,059 --> 00:58:38,359
you know I like I like Bubba so yeah

1586
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,358
yeah

1587
00:58:38,699 --> 00:58:43,259
Bubba veg is very differently still

1588
00:58:40,679 --> 00:58:44,639
right to the OG like it's yeah squat

1589
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:47,819
slow

1590
00:58:44,639 --> 00:58:49,798
you know sometimes like I there's all

1591
00:58:47,818 --> 00:58:52,079
you can grow Bubba lanky too almost like

1592
00:58:49,798 --> 00:58:53,639
OG but for the most part it has way

1593
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:55,500
better structure than Bubba if you're if

1594
00:58:53,639 --> 00:58:59,639
you're growing it well but I've seen it

1595
00:58:55,500 --> 00:59:02,880
grown better [ __ ] yeah yeah yeah I've

1596
00:58:59,639 --> 00:59:06,000
seen Bubba grow lanky and be quite lanky

1597
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:07,619
and in poor situations

1598
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,920
no but I think that's a good call though

1599
00:59:07,619 --> 00:59:12,358
on how that that's a good approach for

1600
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:15,119
attempting a regular line with the OG

1601
00:59:12,358 --> 00:59:16,440
yep there's plenty of Bubba BX seed

1602
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:18,720
lines out there that are regular seed

1603
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:21,240
lines using Bubba we have one with um

1604
00:59:18,719 --> 00:59:24,118
the outcross being the heirloom Afghani

1605
00:59:21,239 --> 00:59:26,759
right yeah and and for it just crossed

1606
00:59:24,119 --> 00:59:28,920
with bubble extremely well made for a a

1607
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:30,420
true reading Bubba of everything look

1608
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:32,579
like Bubba and smelled like Bubba from

1609
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:33,960
the line uh maybe a little bit skunkier

1610
00:59:32,579 --> 00:59:36,240
but

1611
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:37,440
you know like it was pretty Bubba and

1612
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,879
that would make for an excellent

1613
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,200
outcross any kind of mail from that

1614
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:42,900
would be an excellent outcross to make

1615
00:59:40,199 --> 00:59:46,078
an OG Chrissy loan

1616
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:49,380
okay so last question which I think for

1617
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:51,000
for this for this um group of plants

1618
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:52,740
like is a funny one are there

1619
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:56,539
possibilities that we haven't seen yet

1620
00:59:52,739 --> 00:59:58,618
with the OG [ __ ] no yeah

1621
00:59:56,539 --> 01:00:00,179
I've seen everything with that

1622
00:59:58,619 --> 01:00:01,500
[ __ ] yeah I don't I can't really

1623
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:05,239
think of anything offhand that could be

1624
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:07,798
done with OG better but um

1625
01:00:05,239 --> 01:00:08,939
yeah no I that's definitely one that I

1626
01:00:07,798 --> 01:00:11,358
can't really think of anything that

1627
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:13,380
needs to be done

1628
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:15,420
fair enough

1629
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:17,039
um I thought maybe we may as well cover

1630
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:18,659
off Bubba since you've already mentioned

1631
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:20,880
a bunch of times yeah

1632
01:00:18,659 --> 01:00:23,759
I mean yeah it's it is kind of a

1633
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:26,940
baseline it's not in everything

1634
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:28,740
um it's not as popular as it once was

1635
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:30,659
but like you have stuff like cushman's I

1636
01:00:28,739 --> 01:00:31,618
think that has Bubba in it right

1637
01:00:30,659 --> 01:00:33,539
um

1638
01:00:31,619 --> 01:00:34,920
yeah I mean it's just so the basic

1639
01:00:33,539 --> 01:00:37,079
things I guess like

1640
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:40,019
uh what would you like to see pass from

1641
01:00:37,079 --> 01:00:41,339
the Bubba and what would you not

1642
01:00:40,019 --> 01:00:43,139
um I'd like to see everything passed

1643
01:00:41,338 --> 01:00:45,960
from Bubba but I'm above a freak you

1644
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:48,118
know so I like Bubba as is like I some

1645
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:50,639
people don't like Bubba I like Bubba a

1646
01:00:48,119 --> 01:00:53,579
lot so I like seeing Bubba pure

1647
01:00:50,639 --> 01:00:57,719
um we had a really great clone

1648
01:00:53,579 --> 01:00:59,400
that we kept we called Bubba sativa

1649
01:00:57,719 --> 01:01:01,618
um it came out of Bubba s1s that were

1650
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:04,380
likely pollen contaminated

1651
01:01:01,619 --> 01:01:05,880
because this was such an outlier and I

1652
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:07,380
haven't seen it in Bubba s once again in

1653
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:11,099
either a CSI

1654
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:14,180
but it it had a big

1655
01:01:11,099 --> 01:01:14,180
what would be traditionally

1656
01:01:15,179 --> 01:01:18,779
more like something people would

1657
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:21,298
associate more is quote unquote sativa's

1658
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:23,280
structure big huge colas with a big you

1659
01:01:21,298 --> 01:01:24,000
know pyramid shape at the top

1660
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:28,140
um

1661
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:30,599
but it smelled like Bubba it had like

1662
01:01:28,139 --> 01:01:33,480
the high of OG Kush which Bubba doesn't

1663
01:01:30,599 --> 01:01:35,818
necessarily have on its own and it was

1664
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:38,940
just so [ __ ] good and smelled so good

1665
01:01:35,818 --> 01:01:40,619
like a amped up terp Bubba that it's

1666
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:42,420
I've been chasing it ever since I've

1667
01:01:40,619 --> 01:01:44,400
been looking for that ever since and I

1668
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:45,900
since I can't find an S once it just has

1669
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,119
to be a product of pollen contamination

1670
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:49,500
which means who knows what it was but I

1671
01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:50,880
would really like to find something very

1672
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:52,679
similar again

1673
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:53,579
so in terms of the high like he was

1674
01:01:52,679 --> 01:01:55,500
saying

1675
01:01:53,579 --> 01:01:57,420
um I imagine

1676
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:59,519
sorry imagine what you're trying to say

1677
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:02,338
is that the high was a bit rounded

1678
01:01:59,519 --> 01:02:04,019
height than than the normal yeah it

1679
01:02:02,338 --> 01:02:05,759
wasn't just narcotic I mean Bubba does

1680
01:02:04,019 --> 01:02:07,858
have a well-rounded high for the most

1681
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:09,359
part but this was

1682
01:02:07,858 --> 01:02:10,558
um what I would call the no ceiling High

1683
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:12,480
where you can keep smoking it and

1684
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:13,920
getting more and more high and higher

1685
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,900
but it just didn't have any of the

1686
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:17,818
anxiety effects that I get with stuff

1687
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:20,099
that usually is like that the no ceiling

1688
01:02:17,818 --> 01:02:21,659
high so it was cool it was really cool

1689
01:02:20,099 --> 01:02:23,519
and unique

1690
01:02:21,659 --> 01:02:26,219
okay so I guess we're we're kind of in

1691
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:28,679
this Zone already but are there many

1692
01:02:26,219 --> 01:02:31,318
paths that you paths that you see are

1693
01:02:28,679 --> 01:02:33,539
still on trodden when it comes to Bubba

1694
01:02:31,318 --> 01:02:35,940
yeah I mean that Bubba sativa itself was

1695
01:02:33,539 --> 01:02:37,679
so rare that like

1696
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:39,420
the fact that that could be created from

1697
01:02:37,679 --> 01:02:40,739
Bubba even from a pollen contamination

1698
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:43,680
tells me that there's other stuff out

1699
01:02:40,739 --> 01:02:46,439
there that definitely could be we did a

1700
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:47,759
a Bubba Rose flow which was a Old Dutch

1701
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:50,579
Passion flow release really early

1702
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:52,740
release of DJ shorts flow and we crossed

1703
01:02:50,579 --> 01:02:55,019
that and on its own that Rose slow was

1704
01:02:52,739 --> 01:02:58,939
not ideal

1705
01:02:55,019 --> 01:03:02,338
um it was very sparse not good density

1706
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:03,000
little to no resin production

1707
01:03:02,338 --> 01:03:04,920
um

1708
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,900
it was so inbred it was so [ __ ] bread

1709
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:09,358
was horrible like every plant looked

1710
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:12,000
pretty identical

1711
01:03:09,358 --> 01:03:14,338
the it had the leaf cannibalism thing

1712
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,858
they were all bright red and beautiful

1713
01:03:14,338 --> 01:03:19,380
that way in color but the rest of it was

1714
01:03:16,858 --> 01:03:21,779
just not right but we crossed it to

1715
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:24,480
Bubba and um

1716
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:26,760
it immediately took all the best like I

1717
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:29,460
haven't found a bad plant in that Bubba

1718
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:31,380
roast flow at all so taking something

1719
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:33,480
that was like that I wouldn't have

1720
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:34,858
normally used or kept I was really

1721
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:36,240
interested to see how it would go with

1722
01:03:34,858 --> 01:03:39,358
Bubba and a few other things just

1723
01:03:36,239 --> 01:03:41,519
because it was so wild and Bubba tamed

1724
01:03:39,358 --> 01:03:42,179
it Bubba tamed it really well

1725
01:03:41,519 --> 01:03:45,239
um

1726
01:03:42,179 --> 01:03:48,000
so yeah I mean it was a complete like uh

1727
01:03:45,239 --> 01:03:49,679
incensey like really like nag Champa

1728
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,599
incense Bubba like you don't see that a

1729
01:03:49,679 --> 01:03:52,558
lot so there's definitely unique novel

1730
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:55,980
directness

1731
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:58,200
I think is that called Red Menace yes

1732
01:03:55,980 --> 01:04:01,260
that's the name of that one okay yeah

1733
01:03:58,199 --> 01:04:02,639
yeah that's a Bubba Ross flow

1734
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:04,619
cool

1735
01:04:02,639 --> 01:04:07,019
okay anything else you'd like to say

1736
01:04:04,619 --> 01:04:09,180
about the Bubba before we move on just

1737
01:04:07,019 --> 01:04:11,759
the rocks and it like it sucks it not

1738
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:13,500
more people use it or is or aren't as

1739
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,480
familiar with it as they were in the 90s

1740
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:17,639
because for a while it held its own kind

1741
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:19,199
of like OG Kush like bubble was in you'd

1742
01:04:17,639 --> 01:04:20,639
see like all these bubble hybrids and

1743
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:22,558
collectives

1744
01:04:20,639 --> 01:04:24,298
um that you could buy and smoke I

1745
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:25,440
remember Bubba wreck was big back in the

1746
01:04:24,298 --> 01:04:28,679
day there was all kinds of bubble

1747
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:29,460
hybrids but nowadays it's it's kind of

1748
01:04:28,679 --> 01:04:31,500
um

1749
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:33,720
it's not used as much it's still there

1750
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:35,039
but like I I would like to see it

1751
01:04:33,719 --> 01:04:36,719
injected more into the culture because

1752
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:37,920
it's different than OG Kush it's

1753
01:04:36,719 --> 01:04:40,500
different than cookies

1754
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:43,079
you know I like it

1755
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:44,639
on a personal note when I was still

1756
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:46,559
flailing around in my first couple of

1757
01:04:44,639 --> 01:04:49,199
years of growing

1758
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:49,920
um I grew out some Bubba s1s and they

1759
01:04:49,199 --> 01:04:51,719
were

1760
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:53,838
the best things that I'd ever grown at

1761
01:04:51,719 --> 01:04:56,519
that point and maybe my first real

1762
01:04:53,838 --> 01:04:58,558
encounter with growing really good

1763
01:04:56,519 --> 01:05:01,500
weight myself

1764
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:04,559
um so I think it will always hold a spot

1765
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:06,599
for me yeah so there's also some stuff

1766
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:09,240
that me and CSI talk about or I'll say

1767
01:05:06,599 --> 01:05:11,220
CSI talks about with me I should say

1768
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:13,139
um in in going through his Bubba S1

1769
01:05:11,219 --> 01:05:14,879
populations there's one that he found

1770
01:05:13,139 --> 01:05:17,578
that he loves and it's he calls it like

1771
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:19,260
lemon head candy Bubba and I don't see a

1772
01:05:17,579 --> 01:05:21,059
lot of lemon in Bubba but this was an

1773
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:23,339
outlier that does pop up and there's

1774
01:05:21,059 --> 01:05:25,859
other things that are more um darker

1775
01:05:23,338 --> 01:05:27,779
colored and blue colored in Bubba like

1776
01:05:25,858 --> 01:05:29,759
the the he refers to as the blue indica

1777
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:31,859
and so there's a lot of stuff in those

1778
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:33,720
above s1s a lot of people think Bubba is

1779
01:05:31,858 --> 01:05:35,699
just Bubba but if you go through those

1780
01:05:33,719 --> 01:05:38,098
s1s and and go through enough of them

1781
01:05:35,699 --> 01:05:41,098
you'll see some wild variances that

1782
01:05:38,099 --> 01:05:42,720
stand out and are completely unique to

1783
01:05:41,099 --> 01:05:44,760
anything else that we have out there I

1784
01:05:42,719 --> 01:05:46,019
mean we have Lemonheads candy stuff but

1785
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:47,280
the high to it is supposed to be

1786
01:05:46,019 --> 01:05:49,380
phenomenal and then we have things like

1787
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:51,359
the bomb threat Bubba and other other

1788
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:54,358
different expressions of Bubba that are

1789
01:05:51,358 --> 01:05:55,558
like you know slightly lemony and really

1790
01:05:54,358 --> 01:05:57,298
potent

1791
01:05:55,559 --> 01:05:59,220
yeah

1792
01:05:57,298 --> 01:06:01,380
yeah that's nice

1793
01:05:59,219 --> 01:06:03,000
um get yourself a pack of s1s don't be

1794
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:04,260
stupid people

1795
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:07,858
there you go

1796
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:10,200
yeah and I think CSI is doing a round of

1797
01:06:07,858 --> 01:06:11,818
he's doing another round of Baba S1

1798
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:14,578
that's coming back

1799
01:06:11,818 --> 01:06:17,519
it's coming back yes sir

1800
01:06:14,579 --> 01:06:24,480
all righty okay so I think we can move

1801
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:24,480
on to another favorite the chem 91 yes

1802
01:06:24,858 --> 01:06:29,038
I already know the answer to some of

1803
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:31,318
these questions but let's just go over

1804
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:34,260
it how wide or narrow would you consider

1805
01:06:31,318 --> 01:06:35,639
the 91 narrow I would consider it very

1806
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:38,460
narrow

1807
01:06:35,639 --> 01:06:41,699
yeah and we've mentioned it many times

1808
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:43,920
but uh there is plenty of circulation

1809
01:06:41,699 --> 01:06:45,719
that it is itself in S1

1810
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:47,220
that is correct yeah there's there's a

1811
01:06:45,719 --> 01:06:49,259
lot of speculation on that but you know

1812
01:06:47,219 --> 01:06:50,279
who knows it's very hard to prove at

1813
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:52,200
this point

1814
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:53,700
all right what would you like what

1815
01:06:52,199 --> 01:06:55,199
traits would you like to see past and

1816
01:06:53,699 --> 01:06:57,838
what traits would you not like to see

1817
01:06:55,199 --> 01:06:59,939
past in the 90s so typically typically

1818
01:06:57,838 --> 01:07:02,279
with 91 the traits that people want to

1819
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:06,720
pass are the potency

1820
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:09,240
um I I've smelled 91 turned up to like a

1821
01:07:06,719 --> 01:07:12,838
30 volume as far as Terps go in a

1822
01:07:09,239 --> 01:07:14,459
regular seed line based on chem 91 so if

1823
01:07:12,838 --> 01:07:15,960
I could get those chirps passed out of

1824
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:17,940
chem91 that would be phenomenal but I

1825
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:19,740
don't often see that because like well

1826
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:21,420
you can see when you get to smell what

1827
01:07:19,739 --> 01:07:23,098
probably can 91 smelled like is a

1828
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:26,639
cologne like originally before it was

1829
01:07:23,099 --> 01:07:27,900
all beat up like it was phenomenal and I

1830
01:07:26,639 --> 01:07:29,639
could see why it was kept around because

1831
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:33,480
it was so unique

1832
01:07:29,639 --> 01:07:35,940
um yeah it's phenomenal because not many

1833
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:38,338
people I think have hazarded like

1834
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:43,200
hazarded like a an account of its smell

1835
01:07:38,338 --> 01:07:46,019
before I feel like oh I'll try I'll try

1836
01:07:43,199 --> 01:07:47,818
so immediately when I think of chem 91

1837
01:07:46,019 --> 01:07:50,519
and trying to list the smell

1838
01:07:47,818 --> 01:07:51,900
I go for the ammonia acrid similar to

1839
01:07:50,519 --> 01:07:54,659
Afghani one

1840
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:57,119
ammonia acrid is in there but there is

1841
01:07:54,659 --> 01:08:00,000
something else in there that I

1842
01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:01,818
Curry is not right

1843
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,380
but it's not this is

1844
01:08:01,818 --> 01:08:07,798
there or something some kind of savory

1845
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:09,480
there and in the um chem 91 chemd I-95

1846
01:08:07,798 --> 01:08:11,699
that I was referring to from Natalie

1847
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:13,858
that was like a like chem91 turned up to

1848
01:08:11,699 --> 01:08:16,380
a 30. um

1849
01:08:13,858 --> 01:08:18,059
it it that was almost more prevalent

1850
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:19,259
than the ammonia or any of that stuff

1851
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:22,080
and that's when I was like oh my God

1852
01:08:19,259 --> 01:08:24,198
this is so freaking unique and I smelled

1853
01:08:22,079 --> 01:08:27,000
that smell in chem 91 but never to that

1854
01:08:24,198 --> 01:08:29,219
volume you know

1855
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:31,198
um yeah it's hard to say like calling it

1856
01:08:29,219 --> 01:08:34,198
a curry isn't quite accurate but it's

1857
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:36,000
Savory in there there's ammonia there's

1858
01:08:34,198 --> 01:08:36,960
there's burnt tennis ball rubber I think

1859
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,079
that's the way most people would

1860
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:41,819
describe it first and in the Clone as it

1861
01:08:40,079 --> 01:08:44,219
is now that's the most apparent smell is

1862
01:08:41,819 --> 01:08:46,679
like that tennis ball burnt rubber but

1863
01:08:44,219 --> 01:08:49,319
there are other smells in cam91 that can

1864
01:08:46,679 --> 01:08:50,699
be coaxed out of it for sure and some of

1865
01:08:49,319 --> 01:08:52,440
those are some of my favorite smells

1866
01:08:50,698 --> 01:08:55,379
from her

1867
01:08:52,439 --> 01:08:57,539
yeah and again another personal anecdote

1868
01:08:55,380 --> 01:08:59,579
and and I'm No Authority on this I've

1869
01:08:57,539 --> 01:09:01,859
only grown a few s1s but one of the

1870
01:08:59,579 --> 01:09:03,899
things that I did smell in in my

1871
01:09:01,859 --> 01:09:06,779
favorite one was this kind of like

1872
01:09:03,899 --> 01:09:09,298
what I call like a quite a dark smell

1873
01:09:06,779 --> 01:09:11,219
like a charred meat

1874
01:09:09,298 --> 01:09:12,479
kind of thing to come out I wonder if

1875
01:09:11,219 --> 01:09:16,980
you're describing what I'm talking about

1876
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:19,379
it's very likely it's it's it is so hard

1877
01:09:16,979 --> 01:09:22,259
yeah yeah you know as always we're just

1878
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:24,719
talking in Impressions so yeah yeah and

1879
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:27,600
another thing that I I recently saw from

1880
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:29,939
the chem 91 that I'd never seen before

1881
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:32,759
was a very soapy expression that

1882
01:09:29,939 --> 01:09:34,798
reminded me of OG Kush it wasn't exactly

1883
01:09:32,759 --> 01:09:36,779
like OG Kush

1884
01:09:34,798 --> 01:09:38,460
um but I see why people are like oh that

1885
01:09:36,779 --> 01:09:40,739
smells like OG Kush you know what I mean

1886
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:42,600
like it they would it was a scent in

1887
01:09:40,738 --> 01:09:44,459
that direction of OG Kush but I don't

1888
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:46,259
think it was the same thing but I see

1889
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:48,298
why people are like oh I can smell why

1890
01:09:46,259 --> 01:09:50,939
that's related to OG if they come across

1891
01:09:48,298 --> 01:09:52,679
that expression in the 91 S1

1892
01:09:50,939 --> 01:09:55,439
yeah and again for my pot you know

1893
01:09:52,679 --> 01:09:58,380
homegrow is impression yeah I did run

1894
01:09:55,439 --> 01:10:00,960
TKS ones and 91s ones in the same run

1895
01:09:58,380 --> 01:10:02,819
and I did see some quite interesting or

1896
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:05,579
like smell or taste some interesting

1897
01:10:02,819 --> 01:10:10,500
overlaps so yeah I can also see it from

1898
01:10:05,579 --> 01:10:10,500
my very um fragmentary experience

1899
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:18,179
um what traits would you not like to see

1900
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:20,579
past so so 91 it has the the lovely

1901
01:10:18,179 --> 01:10:24,000
trait of forever throwing white hairs

1902
01:10:20,579 --> 01:10:25,439
long past its maturation date like long

1903
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,719
past vanished Harvesters you'll keep

1904
01:10:25,439 --> 01:10:28,919
kicking them I don't like that tray some

1905
01:10:27,719 --> 01:10:30,960
people just ignore it and don't even

1906
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:32,640
notice it which blows my mind that some

1907
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:34,980
people don't notice that chain but it's

1908
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:36,840
very apparent trait to it the other

1909
01:10:34,979 --> 01:10:38,519
trait is the leaf cannibalistic trait

1910
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:40,440
where instead of going through

1911
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:43,679
senescence and just you know fading out

1912
01:10:40,439 --> 01:10:46,500
slowly its leaves start just crumbling

1913
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:48,719
off and like it's a leaf necrosis that

1914
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:50,880
happens as it fades that's not a good

1915
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:52,980
look that's not that's not a good look

1916
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:56,480
at all it's really hard to get beautiful

1917
01:10:52,979 --> 01:10:59,279
pictures of chem 91 and flower like

1918
01:10:56,479 --> 01:11:00,359
Instagram exactly that's what I'm trying

1919
01:10:59,279 --> 01:11:02,039
to say like

1920
01:11:00,359 --> 01:11:05,359
for people who are used to seeing modern

1921
01:11:02,039 --> 01:11:08,039
cookie type weed and that's their like

1922
01:11:05,359 --> 01:11:11,579
Mark Benchmark for what weed should look

1923
01:11:08,039 --> 01:11:14,219
like chem 91 would look very ugly

1924
01:11:11,579 --> 01:11:16,679
right like it would look very ugly to

1925
01:11:14,219 --> 01:11:18,060
most people I think it's ugly to me it's

1926
01:11:16,679 --> 01:11:20,579
ugly as [ __ ] I think it's an ugly ass

1927
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:22,380
yeah personally like Puck ugly [ __ ]

1928
01:11:20,579 --> 01:11:24,300
camera you want ugly as [ __ ] has great

1929
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:27,119
traits has great breeding traits whereas

1930
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:30,300
the puck I think has nothing but um

1931
01:11:27,119 --> 01:11:33,359
chem91 for sure has some good breeding

1932
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:35,039
I think that's a generally

1933
01:11:33,359 --> 01:11:38,039
um that's a common issue

1934
01:11:35,039 --> 01:11:40,140
opinion I think anybody in our crew who

1935
01:11:38,039 --> 01:11:42,539
is going to [ __ ] all shares that [ __ ]

1936
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:45,119
opinion with me too

1937
01:11:42,539 --> 01:11:46,920
yeah yeah and I mean in terms of the

1938
01:11:45,119 --> 01:11:48,719
frequency of these things passing that

1939
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:51,000
is also really consistent right like it

1940
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:53,279
the potency is consistent that leaf

1941
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,359
necrosis is consistent as well

1942
01:11:53,279 --> 01:11:57,000
um yeah

1943
01:11:54,359 --> 01:11:58,859
and chem 91 dominance like I mean it

1944
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:01,260
tends to make stuff look like chem 91

1945
01:11:58,859 --> 01:12:02,460
for the most part yeah

1946
01:12:01,260 --> 01:12:05,400
yeah

1947
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:08,100
okay so because again this is a clone

1948
01:12:05,399 --> 01:12:09,299
I'm going to ask that question how would

1949
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:11,159
you

1950
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:13,020
think uh you would you would approach

1951
01:12:11,158 --> 01:12:15,658
making it into a regular line

1952
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:17,400
Afghani one like using the old Afghani

1953
01:12:15,658 --> 01:12:19,439
one seed line not not a modern one but

1954
01:12:17,399 --> 01:12:21,539
like all that the old one that the the

1955
01:12:19,439 --> 01:12:23,339
laafi Clone that we had came from I

1956
01:12:21,539 --> 01:12:26,219
would I would go with that find a

1957
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:28,500
regular mail in there and use it um

1958
01:12:26,219 --> 01:12:29,880
Canada you want to sell Afghani dominant

1959
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:31,920
that I think taking it any other

1960
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:35,400
direction would be pointless

1961
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:36,600
yeah if you're ammonia Afghani

1962
01:12:35,399 --> 01:12:39,779
if you don't have access to something

1963
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:43,400
like that I imagine a common one is like

1964
01:12:39,779 --> 01:12:43,399
an RG type

1965
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:47,219
yeah I just think that that would just

1966
01:12:45,539 --> 01:12:49,319
take it in one specific direction that

1967
01:12:47,219 --> 01:12:52,980
would muddle it up with OG

1968
01:12:49,319 --> 01:12:55,139
but to keep it chemi like uh you know

1969
01:12:52,979 --> 01:12:56,819
Matt Elite did great using the chemd

1970
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:59,100
I-95 which I wouldn't have thought to

1971
01:12:56,819 --> 01:13:01,198
use because it was such a poly hybrid

1972
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:02,640
I remember when he told me about it I

1973
01:13:01,198 --> 01:13:05,399
was kind of not interested as much

1974
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:09,480
because of the polyhybrid nature the

1975
01:13:05,399 --> 01:13:12,299
chemd and I-95 is uh is it Legend

1976
01:13:09,479 --> 01:13:14,939
triangle and it's star dog if I remember

1977
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:17,400
correctly is the I-95 so there's a lot

1978
01:13:14,939 --> 01:13:18,839
in there and I was thinking well if

1979
01:13:17,399 --> 01:13:20,879
you're trying to find chem 91 why are

1980
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:22,800
you using all this stuff that's like

1981
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:25,319
that is potentially all over the place

1982
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:27,840
but Matt knew his [ __ ] he nailed it man

1983
01:13:25,319 --> 01:13:30,658
so for a regular seed line I'd say and

1984
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:31,860
it probably is accessible for some

1985
01:13:30,658 --> 01:13:33,719
people

1986
01:13:31,859 --> 01:13:35,000
um what do you call it Resurrection it's

1987
01:13:33,719 --> 01:13:37,198
what he called it the seed line

1988
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,579
phenomenal nothing better I'd use that

1989
01:13:37,198 --> 01:13:40,738
all day

1990
01:13:38,579 --> 01:13:43,519
every day for cam 91 that should that

1991
01:13:40,738 --> 01:13:43,519
should have been my first thought

1992
01:13:43,619 --> 01:13:47,039
um going from scratch I'd use like an

1993
01:13:45,119 --> 01:13:48,179
awkward Afghani

1994
01:13:47,039 --> 01:13:49,800
yeah

1995
01:13:48,179 --> 01:13:52,140
yep

1996
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:54,860
okay anything else you want to say on

1997
01:13:52,140 --> 01:13:54,860
the 91.

1998
01:13:55,198 --> 01:13:58,738
um just that if not so we're here he

1999
01:13:57,300 --> 01:14:00,850
would be trying to argue how beautiful

2000
01:13:58,738 --> 01:14:02,158
it is and he can't right now

2001
01:14:00,850 --> 01:14:04,380
[Music]

2002
01:14:02,158 --> 01:14:07,259
I mean okay

2003
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:09,119
I think if you were if you're a bit more

2004
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:11,159
of a contrarian I can see it though you

2005
01:14:09,119 --> 01:14:13,500
know you you kind of get tired of seeing

2006
01:14:11,158 --> 01:14:15,359
the Instagram stuff and

2007
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:17,340
and the ugly stuff starts to look bitter

2008
01:14:15,359 --> 01:14:18,779
in a way you know I think it's just

2009
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:20,279
because it's been in his life for so

2010
01:14:18,779 --> 01:14:22,019
long like it's like talking about one of

2011
01:14:20,279 --> 01:14:22,819
his kids you call it ugly he's like wait

2012
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:26,159
a minute

2013
01:14:22,819 --> 01:14:28,019
you know you can't do that oh yeah I've

2014
01:14:26,158 --> 01:14:29,519
seen I've seen a couple of times when he

2015
01:14:28,020 --> 01:14:31,440
obviously got triggered by you saying

2016
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:33,540
that I think the last time we spoke

2017
01:14:31,439 --> 01:14:35,519
about it I said watch I'm Gonna Make You

2018
01:14:33,539 --> 01:14:37,859
Triggers on this and then I did it and

2019
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:41,400
made him get triggered I love it though

2020
01:14:37,859 --> 01:14:43,259
I love the predictability of it

2021
01:14:41,399 --> 01:14:45,719
well we can move on to an adjacent one

2022
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:47,640
which is another big big big favorite

2023
01:14:45,719 --> 01:14:50,100
Sarah diesel

2024
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:51,719
um yeah again as we know there are

2025
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:54,300
multiple cuts

2026
01:14:51,719 --> 01:14:57,658
um but we'll always happen

2027
01:14:54,300 --> 01:15:00,420
okay how narrow or wide

2028
01:14:57,658 --> 01:15:02,339
depending on which cut you're using

2029
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:04,739
um let's say when I'm referring to

2030
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:07,500
salver I'm going to refer to ecsd choco

2031
01:15:04,738 --> 01:15:08,879
the one that most of us hold I'm going

2032
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:12,238
to refer to that guy

2033
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:14,640
and that one itself I you know there is

2034
01:15:12,238 --> 01:15:17,218
some variance in Super Skunk

2035
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:20,219
um it was a skunk one Afghan tea

2036
01:15:17,219 --> 01:15:22,439
however like sour seems to breed pretty

2037
01:15:20,219 --> 01:15:23,698
true to sour like in my experience as

2038
01:15:22,439 --> 01:15:25,319
long as you're not Crossing into crazy

2039
01:15:23,698 --> 01:15:27,059
poly hybrids that are bringing in tons

2040
01:15:25,319 --> 01:15:28,559
of other stuff like if you're Crossing

2041
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:30,539
it like for example the blueberry or

2042
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:32,159
something very very troop reading for

2043
01:15:30,539 --> 01:15:35,539
for a few traits

2044
01:15:32,158 --> 01:15:38,939
um sour can be very very uniform

2045
01:15:35,539 --> 01:15:41,340
okay so with within that uniformity uh

2046
01:15:38,939 --> 01:15:44,399
what are the traits that people like to

2047
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:46,500
see whether you like in sour it's uh so

2048
01:15:44,399 --> 01:15:48,420
I've talked about this a lot

2049
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:51,300
um specifically the dog tongue trait is

2050
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:52,679
what we call it and that's oh God it's

2051
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:53,940
so hard to describe like I put up

2052
01:15:52,679 --> 01:15:56,460
pictures of it and circled the dog

2053
01:15:53,939 --> 01:15:58,738
tongues and people still miss it or they

2054
01:15:56,460 --> 01:16:01,020
they don't get that I'm referring to a

2055
01:15:58,738 --> 01:16:03,359
very rounded type Leaf not a pointed

2056
01:16:01,020 --> 01:16:06,179
Leaf not just any small Leaf in the bud

2057
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:08,219
and the way that the pattern of

2058
01:16:06,179 --> 01:16:10,500
arrangement of these dog tongue leaves

2059
01:16:08,219 --> 01:16:12,300
is one of the traits of sour and it's

2060
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:14,819
how to me how sour is easily

2061
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:15,960
identifiable these specific traits and

2062
01:16:14,819 --> 01:16:18,679
those traits are carried from Super

2063
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:18,679
Skunk as well

2064
01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:25,980
um centrate burnt rubber skunky all day

2065
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:28,199
to me uh more burnt rubber than skunky

2066
01:16:25,979 --> 01:16:29,939
definitely but um what if it's other

2067
01:16:28,198 --> 01:16:32,339
major traits is that it has this

2068
01:16:29,939 --> 01:16:34,619
wonderful like thing it leaves on your

2069
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:36,719
palette almost like thick oils on your

2070
01:16:34,619 --> 01:16:38,579
tongue that you can taste and go after

2071
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:40,500
you smoke and a lot of people really

2072
01:16:38,579 --> 01:16:41,698
enjoy that so that's another trait from

2073
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:45,060
sour and

2074
01:16:41,698 --> 01:16:46,799
um the high it is very potent and I

2075
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:48,780
would equate it to something like maybe

2076
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:51,539
closer to the OG Kush high but more of a

2077
01:16:48,779 --> 01:16:53,519
traditionally quote-unquote sativa type

2078
01:16:51,539 --> 01:16:54,300
experience more cerebral than just doji

2079
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:57,120
Kush

2080
01:16:54,300 --> 01:17:00,300
yeah okay for most people it's also good

2081
01:16:57,119 --> 01:17:01,679
that hate saying things in

2082
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:04,679
but

2083
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:07,380
alongside what you call the dog tongue

2084
01:17:04,679 --> 01:17:09,779
leaves it's also got those swollen brags

2085
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:11,039
right yeah the swollen bracks um again

2086
01:17:09,779 --> 01:17:12,539
that's another thing from Super Skunk

2087
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:14,219
you'll see it in diesel you'll see it in

2088
01:17:12,539 --> 01:17:16,920
all kinds of different Super Skunk

2089
01:17:14,219 --> 01:17:18,779
um plants but yeah the swollen pracs and

2090
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:21,020
the the the pattern of the dog tongue

2091
01:17:18,779 --> 01:17:23,759
leaves like for me that's the telltale

2092
01:17:21,020 --> 01:17:25,199
signs of sour

2093
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:28,800
mm-hmm

2094
01:17:25,198 --> 01:17:31,019
what uh less favorable traits that you

2095
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:32,640
stretch sometimes come through stretch

2096
01:17:31,020 --> 01:17:35,280
just like OG Kush people hate the

2097
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:38,520
stretch of sour lanky as [ __ ]

2098
01:17:35,279 --> 01:17:41,880
um it's okay so another thing with sour

2099
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:43,739
is you can grow it nail it perfect and

2100
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:46,319
then lose all of it in the drying cure

2101
01:17:43,738 --> 01:17:48,299
it's very easy to get to get busy sour

2102
01:17:46,319 --> 01:17:50,519
like put all that time and effort in and

2103
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:52,500
just lose it in the Cure really easy

2104
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:54,000
um yeah even to people who are really

2105
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:55,979
experienced and good with curing and

2106
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,539
drying it can happen so I think that's

2107
01:17:55,979 --> 01:17:59,519
one of the traits with sour like that

2108
01:17:57,539 --> 01:18:01,140
burnt rubber can fade pretty fast and

2109
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:04,860
turn into just like

2110
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:06,420
musty boofy smell over time it

2111
01:18:04,859 --> 01:18:08,759
dissipates pretty fast so that's not a

2112
01:18:06,420 --> 01:18:11,279
very desirable trait but when it's first

2113
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:13,860
harvested and cured right like that it's

2114
01:18:11,279 --> 01:18:15,420
phenomenal that smell

2115
01:18:13,859 --> 01:18:16,979
yep

2116
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:18,960
okay

2117
01:18:16,979 --> 01:18:21,539
um

2118
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:23,698
because it is a clone how would you go

2119
01:18:21,539 --> 01:18:28,158
about making it into a regular line

2120
01:18:23,698 --> 01:18:28,158
ooh sour into a regular line

2121
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:34,140
you know some of the best seed lines of

2122
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:36,900
sour have been combinations of different

2123
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:38,400
OG Kush hybrids and sour

2124
01:18:36,899 --> 01:18:40,198
yeah

2125
01:18:38,399 --> 01:18:42,000
um OG Kush combines really well with

2126
01:18:40,198 --> 01:18:45,000
sour for whatever reason like whether

2127
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:47,760
it's the high the way it smells when

2128
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:50,460
they combine but like it is different

2129
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:52,320
than just sour it's very OG based when

2130
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:54,359
that happens so if I'm gonna make a

2131
01:18:52,319 --> 01:18:57,420
regular seed line of sour I would

2132
01:18:54,359 --> 01:18:59,158
probably use one of the many regular

2133
01:18:57,420 --> 01:19:01,079
diesel seed lines

2134
01:18:59,158 --> 01:19:02,759
because that'll get you closer back to

2135
01:19:01,079 --> 01:19:04,260
Super Skunk and double up on the super

2136
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:06,539
scope trait which we think is a double

2137
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:09,659
recessive and

2138
01:19:06,539 --> 01:19:11,939
um reinforce that in all the progeny so

2139
01:19:09,658 --> 01:19:14,099
yeah I I would choose a diesel regular

2140
01:19:11,939 --> 01:19:15,178
seed line from anyone that that has that

2141
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:17,640
yeah

2142
01:19:15,179 --> 01:19:19,020
yeah I mean the other obviously we just

2143
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:21,600
mentioned it but

2144
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:24,000
um what is your take on diesel 91 like

2145
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:26,940
crosses

2146
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:29,100
I mean it it all like that's a hard one

2147
01:19:26,939 --> 01:19:31,139
because I think it's great because it

2148
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:33,840
double reinforces a lot of traits but

2149
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:36,780
that would also be presupposing that 91

2150
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:39,420
has super skunk in it but it does lock

2151
01:19:36,779 --> 01:19:42,658
in a lot of the same traits so it's

2152
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:44,819
really hard to argue it client wise

2153
01:19:42,658 --> 01:19:47,519
yeah or I guess the other the other

2154
01:19:44,819 --> 01:19:49,500
quite popular theory is that if there's

2155
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:51,179
no Super Skunk in 91 there might still

2156
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:53,219
be 91 in the sour

2157
01:19:51,179 --> 01:19:54,480
oh yeah for sure I think there's for

2158
01:19:53,219 --> 01:19:55,980
sure now you want to say all right I

2159
01:19:54,479 --> 01:19:57,479
don't think that's very debatable

2160
01:19:55,979 --> 01:19:59,099
yeah yeah

2161
01:19:57,479 --> 01:20:00,419
cool

2162
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:02,280
okay

2163
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:04,380
um are there weird possibilities with

2164
01:20:02,279 --> 01:20:05,639
the sour that people haven't you know

2165
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:07,500
considered

2166
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:09,360
I'm sure there is a lot of like I said

2167
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:12,899
most of what we've seen with sour tends

2168
01:20:09,359 --> 01:20:14,819
to be in like that Sour OG Direction

2169
01:20:12,899 --> 01:20:16,500
um people trying to remake headband as

2170
01:20:14,819 --> 01:20:19,799
they they have heard that it's made you

2171
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:22,679
know but I haven't seen a lot of novel

2172
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:24,300
sour stuff I mean CBF did his um

2173
01:20:22,679 --> 01:20:25,800
strawberry sour which is one of my

2174
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:27,179
favorite lines of all time the

2175
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:29,340
Strawberry Cough

2176
01:20:27,179 --> 01:20:30,960
um strawberry cream which is supposedly

2177
01:20:29,340 --> 01:20:32,279
a Strawberry Cough S1

2178
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:33,719
um the strawberry cream East Coast Sour

2179
01:20:32,279 --> 01:20:35,158
Diesel was one of my favorite lines of

2180
01:20:33,719 --> 01:20:36,359
all time and it was because it was so

2181
01:20:35,158 --> 01:20:38,099
unique

2182
01:20:36,359 --> 01:20:39,779
um but taking taking that strawberry

2183
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:42,000
rubber type stuff and throwing

2184
01:20:39,779 --> 01:20:44,460
strawberry jam type Terps on it it's

2185
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,600
insane it's wonderful

2186
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:47,819
um I think there's so many novel

2187
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:50,219
Direction sour can be taken even like my

2188
01:20:47,819 --> 01:20:52,139
beliefs hour I love that you didn't see

2189
01:20:50,219 --> 01:20:53,158
a lot of blueberry sour out there you

2190
01:20:52,140 --> 01:20:54,659
know there's a lot of different

2191
01:20:53,158 --> 01:20:57,658
directions people could take it that

2192
01:20:54,658 --> 01:21:00,960
that they just haven't yet

2193
01:20:57,658 --> 01:21:02,759
okay so actually more potential than I

2194
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:04,260
than I thought for something as popular

2195
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:08,460
and as

2196
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:09,659
long held as that okay that's cool

2197
01:21:08,460 --> 01:21:12,119
all right

2198
01:21:09,658 --> 01:21:13,920
um anything else on the sour mat that

2199
01:21:12,119 --> 01:21:15,779
you wanted to address

2200
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:17,640
um just to say that like sour was

2201
01:21:15,779 --> 01:21:19,559
probably a few different clones early on

2202
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:21,179
so trying to find the original sour is

2203
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:23,219
kind of a moot point

2204
01:21:21,179 --> 01:21:24,600
um what would be considered original if

2205
01:21:23,219 --> 01:21:26,219
they were all kind of popped at the same

2206
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:28,079
time you know

2207
01:21:26,219 --> 01:21:30,119
um yeah yeah that's the only note I

2208
01:21:28,079 --> 01:21:33,119
would make on that

2209
01:21:30,119 --> 01:21:35,939
yep Fair Point

2210
01:21:33,119 --> 01:21:39,359
okay well we move on to another favorite

2211
01:21:35,939 --> 01:21:42,299
In This Crowd which is the purple Urkel

2212
01:21:39,359 --> 01:21:44,099
yeah oh real quick um before we exit

2213
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:46,920
sour I just wanted to make a quick note

2214
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:47,940
for people in our patreon they are able

2215
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:48,600
to see

2216
01:21:47,939 --> 01:21:51,599
um

2217
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:54,480
a kind of a sour episode we did with

2218
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:56,280
klopp and it's available to be seen if

2219
01:21:54,479 --> 01:21:58,799
you're part of the patreon it wasn't

2220
01:21:56,279 --> 01:22:01,139
finished and it's not a

2221
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:03,179
like produced well produced or edited

2222
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:04,320
it's in its entirety but if you're a

2223
01:22:03,179 --> 01:22:05,819
part of the patreon you can see that as

2224
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:07,619
well

2225
01:22:05,819 --> 01:22:09,299
yeah definitely

2226
01:22:07,619 --> 01:22:13,559
um a very interesting piece of content

2227
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:16,199
still yeah for for the Nerds

2228
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:19,580
okay so the oracle

2229
01:22:16,198 --> 01:22:19,579
how wide or narrow

2230
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:24,960
um it's wide and narrow at the same time

2231
01:22:23,279 --> 01:22:28,800
I would say like

2232
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:31,980
relative to a lot of lines it's narrow

2233
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:34,920
but when you explore Urkel

2234
01:22:31,979 --> 01:22:36,718
like Urkel the Urkel type is about 20

2235
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:39,539
percent

2236
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:40,859
of what you'll see in self Urkle which

2237
01:22:39,539 --> 01:22:43,920
means that there's a lot of variability

2238
01:22:40,859 --> 01:22:46,198
in my opinion you know like if 20 look

2239
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:48,300
like Urkel from s1s then there's pretty

2240
01:22:46,198 --> 01:22:51,359
wide swap even though comparatively to

2241
01:22:48,300 --> 01:22:53,880
other lines it's probably more narrow

2242
01:22:51,359 --> 01:22:57,599
mm-hmm okay

2243
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:59,520
um favorable and unfavorable traits one

2244
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:01,800
of the best grapes ever one of the best

2245
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:03,960
grapes ever a lot of its out crosses

2246
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:05,579
have beautiful purple colors

2247
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:08,158
um it's not necessarily consistent for

2248
01:23:05,579 --> 01:23:10,198
outcrossing purple despite its name and

2249
01:23:08,158 --> 01:23:12,299
even grown there's been a lot of like

2250
01:23:10,198 --> 01:23:14,579
grain grows of Urkel that same clone

2251
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:16,380
where it just doesn't go purple

2252
01:23:14,579 --> 01:23:19,380
um

2253
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:22,739
grape grape extreme

2254
01:23:19,380 --> 01:23:23,880
yeah it's one of the best grapes period

2255
01:23:22,738 --> 01:23:26,399
um

2256
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:28,440
what else it does it like it's Leaf to

2257
01:23:26,399 --> 01:23:30,658
calc ratio kind of sucks it's squat I

2258
01:23:28,439 --> 01:23:33,000
don't really like its branching

2259
01:23:30,658 --> 01:23:34,439
um short node inters like inner node

2260
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:37,979
spacing

2261
01:23:34,439 --> 01:23:40,979
um not desirable at all and it does

2262
01:23:37,979 --> 01:23:43,019
breed pretty well for that trait

2263
01:23:40,979 --> 01:23:45,658
um yeah

2264
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:46,980
I think I think they're mostly grape

2265
01:23:45,658 --> 01:23:49,500
um

2266
01:23:46,979 --> 01:23:52,319
and it does well in our crosses

2267
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:54,119
yeah yeah you already mentioned the OG

2268
01:23:52,319 --> 01:23:55,619
pairing really well with it yeah I can

2269
01:23:54,119 --> 01:23:56,880
see it from the point of view already of

2270
01:23:55,619 --> 01:23:58,559
what you're saying about its structure

2271
01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:00,659
yep

2272
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:02,400
um what so you mentioned the grape

2273
01:24:00,658 --> 01:24:04,979
what's its potency like I imagine it's

2274
01:24:02,399 --> 01:24:07,019
not one of the more potent ones so this

2275
01:24:04,979 --> 01:24:10,678
is a weird one because

2276
01:24:07,020 --> 01:24:12,780
um testing wise 18 THC right okay some

2277
01:24:10,679 --> 01:24:14,699
people some people don't get any effect

2278
01:24:12,779 --> 01:24:17,698
from Merkel some people think it's just

2279
01:24:14,698 --> 01:24:20,460
completely mild worthless to smoke

2280
01:24:17,698 --> 01:24:22,198
me that [ __ ] gives me the fear every

2281
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:24,179
time and it's not necessarily a

2282
01:24:22,198 --> 01:24:25,859
important thing it's just a quality of

2283
01:24:24,179 --> 01:24:27,779
the high that just does not mix well

2284
01:24:25,859 --> 01:24:29,279
with me anything that's very Urkle

2285
01:24:27,779 --> 01:24:31,500
dominant I I just don't smoke anymore

2286
01:24:29,279 --> 01:24:34,259
because it puts me in bad places every

2287
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:35,698
time it's really reliable

2288
01:24:34,260 --> 01:24:39,539
um yeah

2289
01:24:35,698 --> 01:24:42,779
okay so potency is is debatable

2290
01:24:39,539 --> 01:24:45,000
um very very dep very much depends on

2291
01:24:42,779 --> 01:24:47,039
the the individual

2292
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:49,439
yeah yeah

2293
01:24:47,039 --> 01:24:51,600
no that's a good point

2294
01:24:49,439 --> 01:24:54,178
um you mentioned it's

2295
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:56,100
kind of less less ideal structure are

2296
01:24:54,179 --> 01:24:58,380
there other things that are less less

2297
01:24:56,100 --> 01:25:00,860
than ideal about about it or traits that

2298
01:24:58,380 --> 01:25:00,859
it may pass

2299
01:25:01,619 --> 01:25:07,079
um I mean with the 20 being Urkel types

2300
01:25:04,380 --> 01:25:09,000
you know there's probably a good 60 that

2301
01:25:07,079 --> 01:25:11,579
are just kind of Mitzi

2302
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:13,979
yeah in the S ones so yeah there's a lot

2303
01:25:11,579 --> 01:25:15,960
of undesirable in it um

2304
01:25:13,979 --> 01:25:19,019
like

2305
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:21,300
muted grape just not really great High

2306
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:23,820
not really resinous

2307
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:26,219
um you have the OG KB mutant type which

2308
01:25:23,819 --> 01:25:27,539
most people call like ogkb but it's just

2309
01:25:26,219 --> 01:25:28,619
basically

2310
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:30,719
um

2311
01:25:28,619 --> 01:25:32,460
how do I explain that this is not

2312
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:34,140
crinkle leaves and it's not webbed

2313
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:36,000
leaves like people refer to ogkv that's

2314
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:38,520
not a correct way to describe it but the

2315
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:40,198
leaves overlap on each other like that

2316
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:42,060
there's three leaves that overlap on top

2317
01:25:40,198 --> 01:25:44,099
and almost look like Duck's foot type

2318
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:46,739
but they're not webbed or like a true

2319
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:49,140
Ducks foot from Wally duck um but yeah

2320
01:25:46,738 --> 01:25:50,639
it has that weird Leaf overlaying trait

2321
01:25:49,140 --> 01:25:53,039
like that

2322
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:55,079
and um you'll see it a lot in Urkel

2323
01:25:53,039 --> 01:25:55,679
outcrosses and s1s

2324
01:25:55,079 --> 01:25:57,779
um

2325
01:25:55,679 --> 01:26:00,060
yeah and that's where like the OG KB

2326
01:25:57,779 --> 01:26:01,738
type comes from is from a pure Oracle

2327
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:06,300
mutation that can be considered

2328
01:26:01,738 --> 01:26:09,119
undesirable looking at it but ogkb is a

2329
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:11,340
amazing Stellar example you know like so

2330
01:26:09,119 --> 01:26:13,920
while it may look undesirable in the end

2331
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:15,600
that's a desirable plan

2332
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:18,119
yeah

2333
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:20,520
um apart from it pairing well with the

2334
01:26:18,119 --> 01:26:23,939
OG what are other pairings with the

2335
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:25,679
Oracle that you've seen as successful

2336
01:26:23,939 --> 01:26:27,178
let's see

2337
01:26:25,679 --> 01:26:29,819
chem 91

2338
01:26:27,179 --> 01:26:32,219
does well with Oracle

2339
01:26:29,819 --> 01:26:33,960
um sour did well with Urkel bubble gum

2340
01:26:32,219 --> 01:26:35,880
did well with Urkel the white did

2341
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:38,698
amazing with Oracle

2342
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:40,679
um this the things that let that like 20

2343
01:26:38,698 --> 01:26:42,299
expression of Urkel fly through real

2344
01:26:40,679 --> 01:26:44,699
well like the white or it just turns up

2345
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:47,520
the resin production that's Oracle shine

2346
01:26:44,698 --> 01:26:49,619
um or the the Urkle bubble gums like all

2347
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:51,360
that [ __ ] was fired it was good uh

2348
01:26:49,619 --> 01:26:52,920
that's a lot of like Rascal did a lot of

2349
01:26:51,359 --> 01:26:55,439
great [ __ ] with Oracle he's one of my

2350
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:56,940
like other than CSI who's done the most

2351
01:26:55,439 --> 01:26:58,678
work with Urkel

2352
01:26:56,939 --> 01:27:01,019
um yeah Rascals hybrids with Oracle

2353
01:26:58,679 --> 01:27:02,819
early on which is phenomenal I I that's

2354
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:05,159
what I constantly reference when I think

2355
01:27:02,819 --> 01:27:06,539
about like awesome Urkel hybrids this

2356
01:27:05,158 --> 01:27:08,698
Rascals work

2357
01:27:06,539 --> 01:27:11,698
does it still give you the fear in those

2358
01:27:08,698 --> 01:27:13,859
outcrosses absolutely absolutely it's

2359
01:27:11,698 --> 01:27:15,359
just so beautiful though like like the

2360
01:27:13,859 --> 01:27:17,039
white Urkel I love to grow just because

2361
01:27:15,359 --> 01:27:19,500
it was so [ __ ] beautiful just like

2362
01:27:17,039 --> 01:27:21,539
picture Urkel with like the resin of the

2363
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:24,300
white just cake

2364
01:27:21,539 --> 01:27:25,800
Leaf tip to Leaf it was beautiful

2365
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:28,199
um yeah I didn't like smoking it just

2366
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:30,360
because it affected me very negatively

2367
01:27:28,198 --> 01:27:32,759
well everybody around me likes smoking

2368
01:27:30,359 --> 01:27:33,719
it you know but yeah kind of ruined it

2369
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:35,159
for me yeah

2370
01:27:33,719 --> 01:27:36,600
yeah

2371
01:27:35,158 --> 01:27:37,439
okay

2372
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:39,719
um

2373
01:27:37,439 --> 01:27:41,039
again because it's a clone how would you

2374
01:27:39,719 --> 01:27:43,520
go about trying to make it into a

2375
01:27:41,039 --> 01:27:43,519
regular line

2376
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:51,179
what would be a good Urkel outcross to

2377
01:27:48,539 --> 01:27:53,819
maintain the grape skunk one

2378
01:27:51,179 --> 01:27:55,800
um in my opinion like

2379
01:27:53,819 --> 01:27:58,259
Urkel is a combination of something

2380
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:59,699
across to skunk one because in the Urkel

2381
01:27:58,260 --> 01:28:02,760
outcrosses you can see a lot of the

2382
01:27:59,698 --> 01:28:06,238
skunk one type Terps uh the oniony and

2383
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:08,579
cheesy and all that stuff's in there so

2384
01:28:06,238 --> 01:28:10,799
maybe a skunk one type out cross that is

2385
01:28:08,579 --> 01:28:12,658
leaning towards great

2386
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:14,159
um yeah there was a there was a good

2387
01:28:12,658 --> 01:28:16,500
regular seed line that I had that was

2388
01:28:14,158 --> 01:28:18,719
called Kush skunk that was super grapey

2389
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:20,340
and dense like Urkel that I think would

2390
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:21,539
make for an amazing regular seed out

2391
01:28:20,340 --> 01:28:24,380
cross and I think that's still around

2392
01:28:21,539 --> 01:28:24,380
Peak seeds

2393
01:28:25,619 --> 01:28:29,219
that's a good tip

2394
01:28:27,479 --> 01:28:32,039
yeah

2395
01:28:29,219 --> 01:28:34,139
okay they're under um hardcore real

2396
01:28:32,039 --> 01:28:35,039
quick hardcore underrated company Peak

2397
01:28:34,139 --> 01:28:37,020
seeds

2398
01:28:35,039 --> 01:28:38,519
um they don't get a lot of mentions

2399
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:39,540
except from the old school dudes that

2400
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:41,460
ran it

2401
01:28:39,539 --> 01:28:43,139
um they're still around their Northern

2402
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:44,880
Berry was great they did a lot of berry

2403
01:28:43,139 --> 01:28:46,440
work that was good they're Kush skunk

2404
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:49,380
where it doesn't have like a fancy name

2405
01:28:46,439 --> 01:28:52,259
that's like not like ooh Kush skunk it

2406
01:28:49,380 --> 01:28:53,819
was phenomenal it was phenomenal so yeah

2407
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:56,159
um shout out to them got to give them

2408
01:28:53,819 --> 01:28:57,299
their their dues you know because uh I

2409
01:28:56,158 --> 01:28:58,859
don't think they get they didn't do a

2410
01:28:57,300 --> 01:29:01,400
lot of advertising anywhere and they're

2411
01:28:58,859 --> 01:29:01,399
a great company

2412
01:29:02,219 --> 01:29:05,819
all right

2413
01:29:03,899 --> 01:29:08,579
um any

2414
01:29:05,819 --> 01:29:10,079
any weird alternative parts that people

2415
01:29:08,579 --> 01:29:11,698
haven't yet taken that you could see

2416
01:29:10,079 --> 01:29:15,359
them taking

2417
01:29:11,698 --> 01:29:18,719
you know one of my favorite was the

2418
01:29:15,359 --> 01:29:20,639
Urkel tray dog from Highland lonesome

2419
01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:23,279
it made something

2420
01:29:20,639 --> 01:29:24,600
um they called dogs vaults and there was

2421
01:29:23,279 --> 01:29:26,880
a cut from it called the poodle nuts

2422
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:28,920
that is still wholly unique to anything

2423
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:32,100
else in cannabis that I've seen the

2424
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:34,500
structure the scent all of it it's a

2425
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:35,940
phenomenal cut it did have a similar

2426
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:38,639
structure to Urkel a really tight

2427
01:29:35,939 --> 01:29:40,079
internode spacing but the high all of it

2428
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:41,940
made up for it it had a little bit of

2429
01:29:40,079 --> 01:29:44,880
harm trait but like when you have

2430
01:29:41,939 --> 01:29:46,859
something that's special and I could

2431
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:47,940
smoke it like it's only a few archives I

2432
01:29:46,859 --> 01:29:49,319
could smoke

2433
01:29:47,939 --> 01:29:52,319
um we have something like that then yeah

2434
01:29:49,319 --> 01:29:54,119
like and again all to say that that was

2435
01:29:52,319 --> 01:29:56,759
a completely holy unique expression for

2436
01:29:54,119 --> 01:29:58,079
Urkel that I hadn't seen yet in a cross

2437
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:59,880
um I think there's a lot more out there

2438
01:29:58,079 --> 01:30:01,439
that can be done like that if people

2439
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:03,119
think outside the box I kind of want

2440
01:30:01,439 --> 01:30:04,859
something back then

2441
01:30:03,119 --> 01:30:06,420
what kind of flavor were you getting

2442
01:30:04,859 --> 01:30:09,658
from there

2443
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:11,520
um you know grapey a lot except there

2444
01:30:09,658 --> 01:30:13,500
was some skunkiness to it but the one

2445
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:15,840
thing that I remember most about poodle

2446
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:18,779
nuts was when we took cuts of it in veg

2447
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:20,880
it would stink up [ __ ] uh you know a

2448
01:30:18,779 --> 01:30:23,099
3 000 square foot house just taking cuts

2449
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:24,840
off one single mom it smelled like skunk

2450
01:30:23,100 --> 01:30:27,480
nothing smelled skunkier than veg

2451
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:30,119
material of poodle nuts ever Nothing

2452
01:30:27,479 --> 01:30:31,619
Compares isn't that something y'all have

2453
01:30:30,119 --> 01:30:33,599
said about the Urkel as well in general

2454
01:30:31,619 --> 01:30:34,800
yeah you can get a lot of skunky smells

2455
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:37,440
out of it and [ __ ]

2456
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:39,600
yeah no even in flower like the first

2457
01:30:37,439 --> 01:30:41,460
four weeks of flour it's super skunky

2458
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:43,020
and then it just turns great all of a

2459
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:44,520
sudden at the end it's kind of

2460
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:47,880
disappointing in that sense but yeah

2461
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:49,920
that's that's how she goes

2462
01:30:47,880 --> 01:30:52,980
um really interesting I wonder if it's

2463
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:54,960
possible that um that could be drawn out

2464
01:30:52,979 --> 01:30:56,339
I think it could be coaxed out I think I

2465
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:58,139
definitely think it could I think even

2466
01:30:56,340 --> 01:30:59,400
in that tray dog if you ran enough of

2467
01:30:58,139 --> 01:31:00,600
the Oracle trade dog I think you could

2468
01:30:59,399 --> 01:31:03,059
have done it I think you could find that

2469
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:04,679
now and heinlunson made a bunch of it I

2470
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:06,780
still have some old seeds of it too of

2471
01:31:04,679 --> 01:31:10,380
dog's faults original

2472
01:31:06,779 --> 01:31:12,420
from him cool yeah okay

2473
01:31:10,380 --> 01:31:15,139
uh anything else you'd like to say about

2474
01:31:12,420 --> 01:31:15,139
the oracle

2475
01:31:15,359 --> 01:31:21,238
um yeah just shout out to CSI

2476
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:23,340
um hi and lonesome

2477
01:31:21,238 --> 01:31:24,959
um Bodhi all the other people who

2478
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:26,520
inspired me to even be using Urkel in

2479
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:28,380
the first place

2480
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:30,480
yeah

2481
01:31:28,380 --> 01:31:35,900
yeah okay

2482
01:31:30,479 --> 01:31:39,178
well we move on to move on to cookies

2483
01:31:35,899 --> 01:31:41,460
to round out the uh modern building

2484
01:31:39,179 --> 01:31:43,980
blocks the modern building blocks it

2485
01:31:41,460 --> 01:31:46,679
would be very hard to leave cookies out

2486
01:31:43,979 --> 01:31:50,039
despite it maybe being a hybrid

2487
01:31:46,679 --> 01:31:52,079
you know of Urkel types OG types and

2488
01:31:50,039 --> 01:31:55,760
whatever F1 derp is

2489
01:31:52,079 --> 01:31:59,039
um it itself has become a very modern

2490
01:31:55,760 --> 01:32:00,719
very Baseline because it's very hard to

2491
01:31:59,039 --> 01:32:02,880
find any modern lines that do not have

2492
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:05,039
cookies in them

2493
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:07,380
um it used to be that way with OG when

2494
01:32:05,039 --> 01:32:09,779
cookies made its introduction there was

2495
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:14,279
also a big boom of seed makers coming in

2496
01:32:09,779 --> 01:32:16,380
and like OG it was a plant where anybody

2497
01:32:14,279 --> 01:32:19,500
could make crosses with it and it would

2498
01:32:16,380 --> 01:32:21,300
look very decent on Instagram because it

2499
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:25,260
would all look like cookies and cookies

2500
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:28,020
is this very frosty dense purple black

2501
01:32:25,260 --> 01:32:30,420
beautiful plants and

2502
01:32:28,020 --> 01:32:31,679
um yeah it was very it was it was it

2503
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:33,260
just made a lot of people look very

2504
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:35,699
talented because it's very easy to make

2505
01:32:33,260 --> 01:32:37,079
photogenically pretty cookie stuff

2506
01:32:35,698 --> 01:32:38,638
however

2507
01:32:37,079 --> 01:32:40,859
there's not a lot of people who are like

2508
01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:43,380
[ __ ] I love smoking cookies you know 10

2509
01:32:40,859 --> 01:32:45,238
years later it's not like Ochi Kush

2510
01:32:43,380 --> 01:32:46,440
where people where that high is still

2511
01:32:45,238 --> 01:32:50,099
chased

2512
01:32:46,439 --> 01:32:52,500
yeah yeah so I think I can also already

2513
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:54,120
say that it in in the wide narrow

2514
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:55,500
question it's it's definitely on the

2515
01:32:54,119 --> 01:32:57,420
narrow side right

2516
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:58,979
now definitely I mean like when you get

2517
01:32:57,420 --> 01:33:01,800
down to the gelatos

2518
01:32:58,979 --> 01:33:05,039
there's not you know

2519
01:33:01,800 --> 01:33:06,480
yep I mean I mean I shouldn't say that

2520
01:33:05,039 --> 01:33:08,219
because some people love gelatos right

2521
01:33:06,479 --> 01:33:10,379
but once you've hit gelato and you try

2522
01:33:08,219 --> 01:33:11,939
to make like gelato crosses

2523
01:33:10,380 --> 01:33:13,079
you can usually end up with more gelatos

2524
01:33:11,939 --> 01:33:15,059
unless it's a

2525
01:33:13,079 --> 01:33:16,979
very severe outcross but most people are

2526
01:33:15,060 --> 01:33:20,280
breeding towards more cookie looking

2527
01:33:16,979 --> 01:33:22,079
stuff so you don't typically see like

2528
01:33:20,279 --> 01:33:24,059
like when we did

2529
01:33:22,079 --> 01:33:26,460
um the chocolate Thai Forum cut we were

2530
01:33:24,060 --> 01:33:28,679
trying to breed away from cookies into

2531
01:33:26,460 --> 01:33:30,300
the the chocolate tie line we had and

2532
01:33:28,679 --> 01:33:31,619
that's what made it unique but like when

2533
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:33,420
you breed it back to more cookies you're

2534
01:33:31,619 --> 01:33:36,198
just getting more cookies and that's

2535
01:33:33,420 --> 01:33:36,199
cookies

2536
01:33:36,238 --> 01:33:40,198
okay so what are the best traits of

2537
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:42,659
cookies

2538
01:33:40,198 --> 01:33:46,379
um localx to Leaf ratio consistent

2539
01:33:42,658 --> 01:33:47,460
potency high high high resin production

2540
01:33:46,380 --> 01:33:50,819
um

2541
01:33:47,460 --> 01:33:51,960
and and aesthetic Beauty

2542
01:33:50,819 --> 01:33:52,639
yeah

2543
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:57,060
yeah

2544
01:33:52,639 --> 01:34:01,199
uh the worst yield

2545
01:33:57,060 --> 01:34:03,600
um actual oils in the resin glands that

2546
01:34:01,198 --> 01:34:06,479
are so copious it's not it's not that

2547
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:07,560
great like you can have a lot of stocks

2548
01:34:06,479 --> 01:34:10,259
and stuff make something look very

2549
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:14,179
frosty but have very low oil content in

2550
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:14,179
the resin glands on the head so

2551
01:34:29,039 --> 01:34:33,119
over again right yeah yeah I mean you

2552
01:34:31,738 --> 01:34:35,218
just see more cookies and more cookies

2553
01:34:33,119 --> 01:34:35,939
more resinous stuff

2554
01:34:35,219 --> 01:34:38,579
um

2555
01:34:35,939 --> 01:34:41,460
yeah wedding cakey stuff

2556
01:34:38,579 --> 01:34:44,158
just all over the place

2557
01:34:41,460 --> 01:34:45,658
all over the place cookies

2558
01:34:44,158 --> 01:34:48,059
I don't even want to ask this question

2559
01:34:45,658 --> 01:34:49,500
for cookies but I may as well because if

2560
01:34:48,060 --> 01:34:52,080
we've been doing it for the others so

2561
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:54,060
because it's a cut how would you make it

2562
01:34:52,079 --> 01:34:56,158
into a regular line

2563
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:58,380
hmm

2564
01:34:56,158 --> 01:35:00,479
realistically you're making a regular

2565
01:34:58,380 --> 01:35:01,260
line of cookies is pretty easy

2566
01:35:00,479 --> 01:35:03,839
um

2567
01:35:01,260 --> 01:35:06,840
if you outcrossed anything that is like

2568
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:09,539
a short squat little low yielding

2569
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:12,420
Afghani type you've been pretty pretty

2570
01:35:09,539 --> 01:35:14,100
typically like pick up a easy breeding

2571
01:35:12,420 --> 01:35:16,139
cookies line in a few steps maybe you

2572
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:18,539
can take into F2 or

2573
01:35:16,139 --> 01:35:20,279
vx1 any of that stuff like that that's

2574
01:35:18,539 --> 01:35:21,899
it would be pretty easy to make a

2575
01:35:20,279 --> 01:35:23,880
cookies line just because it breeds so

2576
01:35:21,899 --> 01:35:25,439
true to itself

2577
01:35:23,880 --> 01:35:28,739
yeah

2578
01:35:25,439 --> 01:35:32,899
okay uh there are there paths to take

2579
01:35:28,738 --> 01:35:32,899
with cookies that we haven't seen yet oh

2580
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:36,840
I mean

2581
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:39,600
I mean probably right yeah I mean

2582
01:35:36,840 --> 01:35:42,060
probably like I don't think cookies is

2583
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:43,920
the end of cannabis but I think the like

2584
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:46,080
gelato is like I think that's the end

2585
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:47,639
result of cookies and I don't see much

2586
01:35:46,079 --> 01:35:51,000
you could do with gelato to try to save

2587
01:35:47,639 --> 01:35:52,859
it like Crossing gelato to some like

2588
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:54,420
I don't know like a Burmese like a 21

2589
01:35:52,859 --> 01:35:56,339
week for me these might be interesting

2590
01:35:54,420 --> 01:35:57,539
maybe but like that it would be really

2591
01:35:56,340 --> 01:35:59,520
hard to find something to do however

2592
01:35:57,539 --> 01:36:00,960
with cookies I still think you could

2593
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:03,659
cross into stuff like that and find

2594
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:05,939
really interesting stuff

2595
01:36:03,658 --> 01:36:07,920
yeah yeah

2596
01:36:05,939 --> 01:36:10,619
so if you actually want to

2597
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:12,239
take it someplace different which it

2598
01:36:10,619 --> 01:36:13,859
seems like maybe not that many people

2599
01:36:12,238 --> 01:36:16,198
have have wanted that for whatever

2600
01:36:13,859 --> 01:36:17,759
reason or tried almost everyone's it

2601
01:36:16,198 --> 01:36:19,259
seems like to me most of the cookie

2602
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:21,300
stuff is like OG across the cookies

2603
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:23,820
across the OG crusted cookies like

2604
01:36:21,300 --> 01:36:27,300
that's 99 of it like people

2605
01:36:23,819 --> 01:36:28,319
went One Direction for the most part

2606
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:30,480
yeah

2607
01:36:28,319 --> 01:36:32,759
yeah okay

2608
01:36:30,479 --> 01:36:35,059
and anything else you want to say about

2609
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:35,060
cookies

2610
01:36:35,340 --> 01:36:38,699
um yeah there's one thing or is it

2611
01:36:37,979 --> 01:36:42,000
um

2612
01:36:38,698 --> 01:36:43,559
I'm pretty sure if you if you do some

2613
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,840
research you'll find out that there's

2614
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:49,860
all kinds of times

2615
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:52,579
and cookies so where is that

2616
01:36:49,859 --> 01:36:52,579
always

2617
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:58,800
there you go a few times it has to

2618
01:36:57,300 --> 01:37:01,199
happen at least once an episode right

2619
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:03,600
you know it's just so classic and it's

2620
01:37:01,198 --> 01:37:06,960
definitely relevant to cookies

2621
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:09,900
yeah hashtag never forget yeah I never

2622
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:14,399
get phenotyped

2623
01:37:09,899 --> 01:37:17,039
well that does take us to the end of um

2624
01:37:14,399 --> 01:37:19,679
our list of modern building blocks met

2625
01:37:17,039 --> 01:37:20,460
boom and we're at 138 so what else we

2626
01:37:19,679 --> 01:37:21,840
got

2627
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:23,340
I don't know did you want to shout out

2628
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:25,619
any other

2629
01:37:23,340 --> 01:37:28,139
lines that didn't lines or plants didn't

2630
01:37:25,619 --> 01:37:30,779
quite make it in to either of these

2631
01:37:28,139 --> 01:37:33,359
sections just uh gesture towards them

2632
01:37:30,779 --> 01:37:34,979
anything on the top of your head

2633
01:37:33,359 --> 01:37:37,198
I mean like like I said there's stuff

2634
01:37:34,979 --> 01:37:38,519
like swazi really borrowed there's

2635
01:37:37,198 --> 01:37:40,678
there's

2636
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:42,060
um like Durban Thai high flyer there was

2637
01:37:40,679 --> 01:37:44,520
a tie that was used in that there's

2638
01:37:42,060 --> 01:37:46,739
there's been random lines that have been

2639
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:48,900
used or or

2640
01:37:46,738 --> 01:37:50,459
um accessions from different land races

2641
01:37:48,899 --> 01:37:53,099
that have been used and stayed for a

2642
01:37:50,460 --> 01:37:55,319
while in lines but when we when we were

2643
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:58,020
talking about doing this this list

2644
01:37:55,319 --> 01:37:59,399
it was really mainly trying to find the

2645
01:37:58,020 --> 01:38:02,159
lines that have carried on into modern

2646
01:37:59,399 --> 01:38:05,339
times and

2647
01:38:02,158 --> 01:38:07,379
and there's really only a few that

2648
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:09,480
really really made their Mark and kept

2649
01:38:07,380 --> 01:38:11,100
carrying on to modern modern times that

2650
01:38:09,479 --> 01:38:14,459
we can identify like oh that's a skunk

2651
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:16,620
one tree that's that's a haze trade

2652
01:38:14,460 --> 01:38:19,158
um we've seen a lot less Haze traits in

2653
01:38:16,619 --> 01:38:21,238
America and Haze type plants and and

2654
01:38:19,158 --> 01:38:22,979
sativa type plants that are people

2655
01:38:21,238 --> 01:38:25,799
plants that people would typically call

2656
01:38:22,979 --> 01:38:27,779
sativa in general yeah um we've seen a

2657
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:28,679
lot of The Afghani explosion and it's

2658
01:38:27,779 --> 01:38:30,899
kind of

2659
01:38:28,679 --> 01:38:32,760
because of Home growing situations and

2660
01:38:30,899 --> 01:38:34,979
the legalities I think that it's it's

2661
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:37,739
typically gone that direction in the U.S

2662
01:38:34,979 --> 01:38:40,379
so we don't have like the big Haze

2663
01:38:37,738 --> 01:38:42,299
culture that they do in Amsterdam where

2664
01:38:40,380 --> 01:38:43,980
where you know super silver haze Amnesia

2665
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:46,020
Haze everything over here it's cookies

2666
01:38:43,979 --> 01:38:48,000
everything and slowly we're seeing that

2667
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:49,139
invade over there so I don't know what

2668
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:52,260
we're going to see for the future with

2669
01:38:49,139 --> 01:38:54,179
hazes but hopefully people keep working

2670
01:38:52,260 --> 01:38:56,340
yeah yeah

2671
01:38:54,179 --> 01:38:57,840
um I also thought I'd mention that we

2672
01:38:56,340 --> 01:38:59,520
have talked about all these plants

2673
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:00,779
before or I should say met and not so

2674
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:01,920
have definitely talked about all of

2675
01:39:00,779 --> 01:39:04,019
these

2676
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:06,658
um plants and lines before so if you

2677
01:39:04,020 --> 01:39:08,520
want to go for a deeper dive you can

2678
01:39:06,658 --> 01:39:10,019
definitely find the episodes where they

2679
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:13,260
cover

2680
01:39:10,020 --> 01:39:15,719
um the respective plants or lines

2681
01:39:13,260 --> 01:39:16,320
um this was just meant to be

2682
01:39:15,719 --> 01:39:19,079
um

2683
01:39:16,319 --> 01:39:21,719
a summary an overview on each of these

2684
01:39:19,079 --> 01:39:24,600
but also with the particular lens of

2685
01:39:21,719 --> 01:39:26,880
breeding with them or working with them

2686
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:28,739
um whereas in in a lot of the previous

2687
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:31,739
episodes It's been a bit more about

2688
01:39:28,738 --> 01:39:34,619
their provenance or sorry

2689
01:39:31,738 --> 01:39:36,000
um much more driven um by by their

2690
01:39:34,619 --> 01:39:38,460
history

2691
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:41,100
um with some some aspects of this so

2692
01:39:38,460 --> 01:39:41,939
yeah

2693
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:45,179
um

2694
01:39:41,939 --> 01:39:47,399
was there anything else that

2695
01:39:45,179 --> 01:39:49,380
uh we wanted to add especially

2696
01:39:47,399 --> 01:39:51,719
considering this is still part of our

2697
01:39:49,380 --> 01:39:54,119
like breeding series with any follow-ups

2698
01:39:51,719 --> 01:39:56,399
to any of the previous episodes or

2699
01:39:54,119 --> 01:39:57,960
anything like that nothing comes to mind

2700
01:39:56,399 --> 01:40:00,719
directly were there any questions from

2701
01:39:57,960 --> 01:40:03,420
anybody that we needed to run through

2702
01:40:00,719 --> 01:40:04,679
no but I may just mention that like I

2703
01:40:03,420 --> 01:40:06,658
saw some really cool conversations

2704
01:40:04,679 --> 01:40:09,300
happening in the Discord in and around

2705
01:40:06,658 --> 01:40:11,939
those episodes like I know

2706
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:15,360
squirrel scientist and maybe crybaby

2707
01:40:11,939 --> 01:40:17,579
were having a discussion about the

2708
01:40:15,359 --> 01:40:18,658
actual findings in terms of

2709
01:40:17,579 --> 01:40:20,579
um

2710
01:40:18,658 --> 01:40:23,519
uh the occurrence of actual heterosis

2711
01:40:20,579 --> 01:40:25,559
yeah um in cannabis plants and that was

2712
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:28,500
really interesting

2713
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:31,620
um there's obviously so much

2714
01:40:28,500 --> 01:40:36,060
more beyond what we've outlined

2715
01:40:31,619 --> 01:40:38,158
um so you know definitely don't take

2716
01:40:36,060 --> 01:40:39,239
um our stopping point for the stopping

2717
01:40:38,158 --> 01:40:41,939
point

2718
01:40:39,238 --> 01:40:43,198
um there's a lot going on out there

2719
01:40:41,939 --> 01:40:46,859
um like I think Matt's already mentioned

2720
01:40:43,198 --> 01:40:49,738
before you know like whether uh

2721
01:40:46,859 --> 01:40:52,380
whether you can find them in like

2722
01:40:49,738 --> 01:40:54,718
um Journal articles or you know

2723
01:40:52,380 --> 01:40:56,100
agricultural breeding textbooks there's

2724
01:40:54,719 --> 01:40:59,219
so much

2725
01:40:56,100 --> 01:41:02,820
uh knowledge out there that we are still

2726
01:40:59,219 --> 01:41:06,600
you know very far from fully digesting

2727
01:41:02,819 --> 01:41:08,579
in the Cannabis world so yeah

2728
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:10,860
yeah like yeah he's right you know like

2729
01:41:08,579 --> 01:41:12,479
just remember everything is from certain

2730
01:41:10,859 --> 01:41:14,819
perspectives like when I was telling the

2731
01:41:12,479 --> 01:41:17,099
skunk one tale that was all done from

2732
01:41:14,819 --> 01:41:19,799
someone else's perspective and cannabis

2733
01:41:17,100 --> 01:41:21,239
is just a big conglomeration of

2734
01:41:19,800 --> 01:41:23,520
different perspectives and it's the best

2735
01:41:21,238 --> 01:41:24,599
we got so don't feel like he like he

2736
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:26,880
said don't feel like this is the end

2737
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:28,560
point this is the best we know currently

2738
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:30,659
but it doesn't mean someone can't dig up

2739
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:31,860
research that we haven't and find out

2740
01:41:30,658 --> 01:41:33,839
things we haven't that we don't even

2741
01:41:31,859 --> 01:41:35,579
know and I hope people are inspired to

2742
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:38,279
do that

2743
01:41:35,579 --> 01:41:39,359
yeah for sure and just to mention as

2744
01:41:38,279 --> 01:41:42,359
well we're still trying to get high in

2745
01:41:39,359 --> 01:41:45,118
Lonesome on we weren't able to uh get it

2746
01:41:42,359 --> 01:41:48,139
going this week but hopefully soon yeah

2747
01:41:45,118 --> 01:41:48,139
that'll be a great episode

2748
01:41:52,260 --> 01:41:57,119
I need more stuff on this board bro

2749
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:59,639
you do we still we still haven't had the

2750
01:41:57,118 --> 01:42:01,799
not so Clips yet so no we got you plant

2751
01:41:59,639 --> 01:42:04,199
seeds you number them seed one through

2752
01:42:01,800 --> 01:42:07,380
300 or one through two we have that one

2753
01:42:04,198 --> 01:42:09,000
and then uh yeah and phenotypes I think

2754
01:42:07,380 --> 01:42:11,219
that's all we got

2755
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:13,380
I reckon we can afford yeah I think we

2756
01:42:11,219 --> 01:42:15,198
can diversify the sound board but yeah

2757
01:42:13,380 --> 01:42:18,000
we'll work on it

2758
01:42:15,198 --> 01:42:19,259
all right well that I guess

2759
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:21,118
um other than that

2760
01:42:19,260 --> 01:42:23,280
um check out riotsseeds.com for all your

2761
01:42:21,118 --> 01:42:24,839
seed needs and feminized spray we have

2762
01:42:23,279 --> 01:42:26,039
our spray don't forget if you want to

2763
01:42:24,840 --> 01:42:27,659
make your own feminized seeds at home

2764
01:42:26,039 --> 01:42:29,039
it's an excellent way to do it we have

2765
01:42:27,658 --> 01:42:31,019
the instructions on the site three

2766
01:42:29,039 --> 01:42:32,698
different sizes available we have our

2767
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:34,500
patreon Discord where we hang out all

2768
01:42:32,698 --> 01:42:36,539
the time and exchange all kinds of ideas

2769
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:37,500
I think tonight I don't even know I

2770
01:42:36,539 --> 01:42:39,300
don't know if you have time tonight but

2771
