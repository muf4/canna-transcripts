00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:47,159
explanation from ganjir of what happened

56
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,780
and all I won't read the whole thing but

57
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:51,120
I'll scroll through it

58
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,979
um it said last weekend 12 certified

59
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,360
ganjiers were chosen to judge at the

60
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:59,098
2022 Cowboy Cup in Stillwater Oklahoma

61
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,360
the judges were selected by both gone to

62
00:02:59,098 --> 00:03:02,098
your team and organizers of the cowboy

63
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,140
cup based on experience filled of

64
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:06,299
expertise and ensure diverse viewpoints

65
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:08,219
were represented so basically they chose

66
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,379
a bunch of days

67
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:12,780
um they go into detail about how judges

68
00:03:10,378 --> 00:03:15,060
were chosen whatever and people were

69
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,280
allowed to submit samples and they were

70
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,378
they had to have coas with their samples

71
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,860
certificate of authenticities basically

72
00:03:19,378 --> 00:03:24,899
saying that there's no mold no residual

73
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,599
chemicals from growth whatever no no

74
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:30,300
junk in your [ __ ] right so they had to

75
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:33,119
submit paperwork with each sample well

76
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,040
at the cup I guess they had microscopes

77
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,700
like they show right here sitting there

78
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:41,939
to analyze each sample and here are the

79
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:43,979
results I I guess despite the COA they

80
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:45,840
wanted to review each sample there under

81
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:47,579
the microscope which I think is actually

82
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,098
good I think that's a great Safeguard

83
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:52,500
because you never know what kind of

84
00:03:50,098 --> 00:03:55,079
authenticity these these Labs really

85
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,818
bring to the table so I also see

86
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,799
trichome development and stuff too

87
00:03:56,818 --> 00:04:00,298
exactly you know I mean you get a real

88
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,040
good you get a much better view of the

89
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:04,620
bud obviously and people that that

90
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:07,019
understand buds can get an actual good

91
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:10,438
look at it what's going on there so the

92
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:12,480
samples it says uh unfortunately results

93
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:14,699
were not great

94
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,560
of the 12 samples in the sun-grown

95
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:18,298
category 10 were found to consistently

96
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,579
show both Visual and aromatic

97
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:24,779
indications of contamination so that

98
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:26,460
means 10 smelled like mold or

99
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:28,198
whatever

100
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:30,599
presence of something some kind of scent

101
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:33,478
of the eight samples in the light assist

102
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,340
category seven are found to consistently

103
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:37,319
show both Visual and aromatic

104
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:40,918
indications of contamination

105
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:43,139
not good of the 20 samples in the Indo

106
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:44,698
category two were found to consistently

107
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:46,800
show both Visual and aromatic

108
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:48,419
indications of contamination this means

109
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,060
that contamination was clearly visible

110
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:53,099
in 19 of the 40 samples submitted to us

111
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,379
for assessment and here's some pictures

112
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,879
so you guys can get an idea ladies and

113
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:59,459
gents I'm sorry I always say guys ladies

114
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,978
and gents can get an idea for um some of

115
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:04,079
the contamination in there it said

116
00:05:01,978 --> 00:05:05,879
because the levels of contamination both

117
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:07,319
were both clear and evident to the

118
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:09,418
certified gun years the samples were

119
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:11,519
disqualified from the competition each

120
00:05:09,418 --> 00:05:16,159
disqualified sample was photo documented

121
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:18,719
for proof of the contamination so yeah

122
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,900
not good not looking good for the

123
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:25,080
Oklahoma entrance

124
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:27,120
okay so I gotta remove this thing there

125
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:29,639
we go there we go so not looking good

126
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,560
for the the Oklahoma entrance

127
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:34,918
um there were a lot of people really

128
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:37,079
hyper super pissed off that thought that

129
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:38,579
uh there was some rigging going on that

130
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:42,300
maybe these people were trying to sell

131
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:44,099
them I guess during a speech or some

132
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:47,579
kind of post that one of the people from

133
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:49,680
ganjir made it offered them some

134
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:51,478
training in being able to spot

135
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,579
contamination and mold and maybe how to

136
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:55,079
grow different and this upset a lot of

137
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:58,019
people because they're like we're

138
00:05:55,079 --> 00:06:00,899
Growers we know our stuff we had coas

139
00:05:58,019 --> 00:06:02,579
you had a little scope with the you know

140
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:05,159
you know stuff like that so that's kind

141
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:07,379
of how it was taken and uh it's it's

142
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:10,139
really interesting to watch how it

143
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:12,899
um turns out in the community

144
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:15,000
yeah I mean I I will say I do think it's

145
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:16,799
a little just to start I think it's a

146
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,600
little silly that

147
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,280
um in California in the west coast at

148
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,080
least I would say that when people are

149
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:24,899
going for awards and things like that

150
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:27,599
they you know uh they make sure that

151
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:29,698
what they're submitting is is hopefully

152
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,580
not going to do that right not just

153
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:35,160
grabbing random handfuls uh if you can

154
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:37,560
find 19 out of 40 that's basically 50

155
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,479
percent yeah if you can find Visible

156
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,100
enough mold that all the judges agree it

157
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:44,219
needs to go then

158
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,840
you know uh there wasn't a very good

159
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,479
quality control for a lot of the

160
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:51,478
entrants put it that way

161
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:54,899
yeah so that's where we know we're at

162
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:56,579
with the situation now but we kind of

163
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:58,818
wanted to talk about how we got to this

164
00:06:56,579 --> 00:07:01,620
situation the the the

165
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:05,639
points of harvest cups and how they kind

166
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:09,360
of originated and on to the Amsterdam

167
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:10,860
cannabis cups and on into you know other

168
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,680
sorts of

169
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:15,780
quasi Harvest cups that maybe started

170
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,879
more traditional and legit that became

171
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:19,679
more corporate and on to where we're at

172
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:22,740
with a lot of these you know extract

173
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,060
throwdowns but to start I mean not so

174
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,800
who knows better about the early

175
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,120
cannabis Cups than my boy Nazo so let's

176
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,060
jump into this

177
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:33,180
I yeah I mean I I think there's probably

178
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:35,339
two kinds you could say you could say of

179
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:37,319
Cups there was like you mentioned there

180
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:39,899
was a lot of informal cups which are

181
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:42,598
essentially friends Gathering to share

182
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:44,818
weed right yeah and then there's like

183
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:48,300
cups that are advertised and and more

184
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:50,759
famous and uh like the um you know like

185
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,500
the High Times cannabis cups

186
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:54,660
um and the you know the emerald cup and

187
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:56,279
a lot of the different you know hashish

188
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,360
competitions or different things that

189
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:59,459
have happened where it's a little bit

190
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,259
more public and as a result of that

191
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:03,839
there's usually money and rep involved

192
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:07,139
so it brings a different it brings a

193
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:10,019
different flavor to it I think always

194
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:12,680
um and you know uh these days uh as as

195
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:15,418
evidenced by some Cowboy Cup in Oklahoma

196
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:18,598
cups are just events that anyone can

197
00:08:15,418 --> 00:08:21,598
hold and as a result there's hundreds of

198
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:23,878
Cups Across America now probably uh when

199
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:26,579
it comes down to it but in back in the

200
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:28,319
day as far as like ones that got

201
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:31,680
advertised there was pretty much one

202
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:34,918
yeah there was the High Times Cannabis

203
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,799
Cup that was in Amsterdam you know yeah

204
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:39,538
and Matt Cub had a major impact

205
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:42,958
um probably it's you know the most

206
00:08:39,538 --> 00:08:45,659
impactful one uh because that was a real

207
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:47,159
nice issue at High Times yeah uh and the

208
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:49,919
Cannabis Cup winners would have like

209
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:52,500
there'd be pages of really high quality

210
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:55,439
gloss you know for you know nice

211
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:58,320
pictures write-ups the whole bit and I

212
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,260
think it kind of drove seed sales and

213
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:05,700
desirability especially in the in the

214
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:08,580
90s yeah it was a big deal to win cups

215
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,980
don't you agree yeah I mean seed cells

216
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,540
were kind of dependent on that on these

217
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,980
cups that were going on and most of the

218
00:09:12,539 --> 00:09:17,219
people that were entering those first

219
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:20,039
cannabis cups were dealing in seed sales

220
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:23,940
I mean most people's first images that

221
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:27,778
they ever saw of any kind of AK-47 or

222
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:29,399
big bud or white widow or you know a lot

223
00:09:27,778 --> 00:09:30,778
you can name a lot of different strains

224
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:33,000
where like probably the first time you

225
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:35,338
ever saw it was pictures and High Times

226
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,399
in the Cannabis Cup well I mean the the

227
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:39,899
Cannabis Cup so prestigious in a lot of

228
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,519
people's minds like at least in the

229
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:43,980
general publics that when a lot of us

230
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,720
get into growing when we first go to buy

231
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,039
our first pack of seeds the one thing we

232
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,600
think about has it won a High Times

233
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:50,939
Cannabis Cup because most of us know

234
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,440
even with basic smoking knowledge when

235
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,000
you jump into this that there is a

236
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,320
magazine called High Times and that they

237
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,360
have an event called the Cannabis Cup

238
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,760
and that there are winners of these

239
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,800
things you know so I think that's you a

240
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:03,539
lot of people's first entrance is is who

241
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:04,919
has won the Cannabis cups when they get

242
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:06,778
into growing

243
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:08,639
and it it was kind of one of those

244
00:10:06,778 --> 00:10:10,919
things too where Amsterdam at the time

245
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:14,100
was uh one of the few places in the

246
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:18,360
world where you could gather openly uh

247
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:20,519
with a weed festival yeah um so it

248
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,800
it brought together a bunch of heads

249
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,839
from all over the place yeah I did you

250
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:26,338
know uh and there was some there was

251
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:28,080
some weird stuff about it too there was

252
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:30,660
people that thought that

253
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:33,180
people that went there were watched they

254
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:35,519
were worried about a CL of a bunch of

255
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:38,399
gathering of Growers and Seed makers and

256
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,620
Hustlers and stuff because you know it

257
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,080
was heavily under prohibition at the

258
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:45,060
time and there was big agencies in

259
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,860
Europe and America like wanting to know

260
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:48,359
what was going on

261
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,639
um so there's even a bunch of drama

262
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,579
about the cup has always had some weird

263
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:55,259
politics yeah um but from a cannabis

264
00:10:53,578 --> 00:10:58,019
perspective and certainly from like a

265
00:10:55,259 --> 00:11:01,200
younger Smoker's perspective I had

266
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:03,360
safety it's safe to say that a lot of

267
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:07,259
people would get that that issue of High

268
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:11,039
Times and drool over the multi-page

269
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:13,379
photo shoot yeah of the winners and the

270
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:15,539
entries and you know and all that type

271
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:18,419
of stuff and so

272
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:21,240
um you know uh some of the and in fact

273
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:23,699
too some of the late 80s stuff you know

274
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:26,399
it's so old now that it's reference

275
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:29,879
points for some of those early strains

276
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:32,159
and photos of those early strains

277
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:33,899
um in in the I don't think we've

278
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:38,419
mentioned it yet the first cup was held

279
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:38,419
in 1988 correct

280
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:44,700
I think it might have been 87. I think

281
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:46,740
so too because the first High Times 87

282
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,778
one was skunk one but it listed here is

283
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,519
88 but I want to say on the front cover

284
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:51,899
of high times it was the red issue and I

285
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:54,799
want to say it was 87 but I might be

286
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:54,799
wrong am I wrong

287
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:57,899
yeah

288
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:59,819
and I think we learned something

289
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:01,679
recently here about the Second Cup

290
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:04,800
winner which is the early Pearl skunk

291
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:07,078
one or lights five Haze right we did I

292
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:09,059
mean that one that one's gone through a

293
00:12:07,078 --> 00:12:12,000
a metamorphosis so when that got

294
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:14,699
released it won the 89 Cannabis Cup

295
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,980
overall right and that's what Neville

296
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:19,920
sold it at and that's what he entered it

297
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:22,980
at but then a couple years later he

298
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:26,099
changed the name to Silver Pearl by

299
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:28,560
Hayes yeah right but it was the same mix

300
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,300
he listed the mix he just changed the

301
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:33,239
name so you could still read exactly

302
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:35,578
what it was yeah and then when Sensei

303
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:38,039
bought out his company they just changed

304
00:12:35,578 --> 00:12:40,199
it to Silver Haze yes

305
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:42,360
um and they took away most of the

306
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,639
information of what was in the hybrid

307
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,860
itself it was just a name and a vague

308
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,379
description but they mentioned that it

309
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:52,919
won the 89 cup yeah

310
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:55,078
and Neville helpfully laid out what the

311
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:57,419
mix was so

312
00:12:55,078 --> 00:12:58,739
um it's just it went from uh I mean I

313
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:02,639
can't even remember how it was written

314
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:06,120
is it like EP by Skunk one by nl5 by

315
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:08,399
Hayes yeah yeah yeah so that's not a

316
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,959
very great marketing name no it's not

317
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,240
the best it's not the best marketing

318
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:14,458
name at all no so never got Neville got

319
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,220
rid of that and called it you know and

320
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:19,319
called that strain silver Pearl let's

321
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,700
see I'm gonna remove this thing so we

322
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,560
can see it I don't know if you can see

323
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,778
the uh screen here it might be too tiny

324
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,278
for you to see huh it's it's too tiny

325
00:13:24,778 --> 00:13:28,320
for me to see but you can walk me

326
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:30,000
through it okay third cup we got

327
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,160
Northern Lights five from the seed bank

328
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,259
classic

329
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:36,539
so um maybe I'll throw in a little

330
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:40,379
tidbit about that too

331
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:42,299
um there are several pictures

332
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:45,720
um from various people that Matt and I

333
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:48,240
have gathered of uh living flowering

334
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:51,778
plants well and well close to harvest

335
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:56,039
and dried flower of that exact famous

336
00:13:51,778 --> 00:13:58,200
nl5 cut yeah and so without you know

337
00:13:56,039 --> 00:14:00,778
because it won

338
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:03,060
um it got the full photo spread

339
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:05,519
and it got some pictures and it gave us

340
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:07,018
a reference point 35 years later or

341
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,480
whatever

342
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:12,060
um for what that exactly looked like but

343
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:15,539
there's more to the story like even more

344
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:17,458
because if that Neville's if that in all

345
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:19,919
five that won the cup wasn't the same

346
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:21,619
nl5 that was shipped over

347
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:23,819
in that little

348
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:25,019
terrarium whatever terrarium type

349
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:28,160
situation

350
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:32,519
then referencing the the

351
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:35,159
Seattle nl5 seed line to that specific

352
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:37,799
cut would be a little confusing

353
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:40,919
yeah I mean there's it's one of those

354
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:42,479
things where Matt and I you think you

355
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:44,879
have something like that figured out and

356
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:48,720
Nuance comes in

357
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:50,939
um so I I mean they um

358
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,920
I'm not even exactly sure what to say

359
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,959
that one but this that different people

360
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:56,099
have different perspectives and remember

361
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:58,439
things

362
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:00,480
you know and yeah even today like the

363
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,060
history history is uh

364
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,879
gets it gets altered perhaps is the best

365
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:07,919
way to put it it can be fluid it can be

366
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:09,419
fluid it can be fluid well you know you

367
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:11,639
think you understand something and then

368
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:13,620
something comes along that that kind of

369
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:16,079
flips that on its head and so Matt and I

370
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:19,379
recently got some Credence that like

371
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:21,838
maybe you know um we had heard a long

372
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:24,659
time ago that one of the NLS might have

373
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:27,800
been NL Steve Murphy's Afghan mixed with

374
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:31,319
uh a Neville Afghan yeah

375
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:33,599
and um and Seattle Greg in a post a long

376
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,639
time ago even sort of confirmed it

377
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,379
but then all the other evidence came out

378
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:39,240
against it and it kind of dropped and we

379
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:42,419
never heard it again well recently we

380
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:44,459
heard that that was probably true yeah

381
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:46,319
that it's a pretty it's a decent

382
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:47,819
reliable source that wouldn't it's

383
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,680
definitely a close end and reliable

384
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,778
source so

385
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:53,458
um you know it's it's kind of a lot of a

386
00:15:51,778 --> 00:15:56,039
lot of this old oral history you have to

387
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:57,958
lean into what you believe

388
00:15:56,039 --> 00:16:00,539
um but what Matt was referencing is that

389
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:03,899
we believe that there was two Famous nl5

390
00:16:00,539 --> 00:16:05,819
Cuts there was one uh that was a little

391
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:08,039
bit more sativa that was passed around

392
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:10,620
the the Pacific Northwest and Seattle

393
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:13,860
Greg's crew and there was one that

394
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:17,759
Neville found out of nl5 labeled seed

395
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:20,039
yeah that Greg sent him that he thought

396
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:23,278
was a total Afghan throwback and

397
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:25,799
exhibited no sativa influence that he

398
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:28,980
could discern whatsoever yeah and

399
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:31,500
supposedly this one mother cut became

400
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:33,360
the winner of all that uh and went on to

401
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,620
become famous and got bred to all kinds

402
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,079
of things

403
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:40,019
supposedly I think I think the story is

404
00:16:37,078 --> 00:16:40,919
that he crossed that to that in all five

405
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:43,980
cut

406
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:45,479
to either Afghani one or that Mazar you

407
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,740
know and then that something was

408
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,440
selected from that and that became the

409
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:51,899
nl5 cut that won the cup

410
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,880
indeed yeah so that's that's something

411
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:55,860
to clarify like if we ever speak

412
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:58,379
misspeak on anything and we get you know

413
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:00,000
any future info we'll always uh update

414
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:01,799
it as best we can without throwing

415
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,078
anyone under the bus or doing anything

416
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:06,240
crazy but we like to to make sure that

417
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:08,459
we uh get everything as accurate as

418
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,259
possible no matter what even if it is uh

419
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:12,720
us being wrong at one point it's

420
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:18,318
important one next

421
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,318
so we are at let's see here

422
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:24,298
we are at uh skunk from free City so I

423
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:27,019
assume it's like a skunk one maybe I

424
00:17:24,298 --> 00:17:30,000
don't know who free city is

425
00:17:27,019 --> 00:17:33,359
then we have um hey skunk one from

426
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,000
homegrown fantasies or homegrown fantasy

427
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:37,918
which became homegrown fantasy fancies

428
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,980
later yeah and then it says uh High

429
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,559
Times Cannabis Cup winner Master Kush I

430
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:46,380
don't know why it says that beside it

431
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:49,440
Hindu kushek across the skunk one

432
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:52,260
which I wonder if that was uh I wonder

433
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,000
if that was pot of gold

434
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:57,179
hmm

435
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,400
I do I wonder

436
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:01,640
did it did it say

437
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,200
did what did it say again

438
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:06,360
it says Hey skunk one from homegrown

439
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,160
fantasy then in parentheses it says Hi

440
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:10,439
Times Canvas Cup winner Master Kush

441
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:13,320
equals Hindu Kush X skunk one but then

442
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,700
below it it says Haze uh the 1993 is

443
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:16,259
haze Northern Lights five from Tennessee

444
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,000
bank and then it says the same thing

445
00:18:16,259 --> 00:18:19,859
next to that High Times Cannabis Cup

446
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,900
winner Master Kush equals Hindu Kush

447
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:23,099
cross the skunk one so I don't know why

448
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,679
they're putting all right that's

449
00:18:23,099 --> 00:18:28,319
confusing let's move on so yeah once

450
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,780
again once you get to 30 or 94 you get

451
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:35,519
to Jack Herer that's 95 they're wrong

452
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:38,279
right no widow's 95. no so I uh I went

453
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:40,319
to that cup when I was when I was my huh

454
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:41,399
which cup was it the 94 cup for Jack

455
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,798
Herer

456
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:46,919
yes

457
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:49,798
because because what they did is

458
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:51,600
um that cup uh that was that was one of

459
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:54,000
the first times I went out to uh get

460
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:56,219
seeds I'd gone that summer previously

461
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,099
but I went back and fall

462
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:01,620
um and they uh

463
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:04,199
they wanted to dedicate that whole the

464
00:19:01,619 --> 00:19:07,019
whole theme of the Cannabis Cup was

465
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,759
around Jack Herer and his

466
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:11,099
um and his contributions to cannabis

467
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:13,019
yeah right they had speeches by various

468
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:15,359
people and all kinds of stuff special

469
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:17,599
limited edition posters too I still have

470
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:20,939
a few yeah one of them one of them

471
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:22,319
I promised one away already so they

472
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,480
really they really tried to ramp up

473
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:26,279
marketing then right and so they wanted

474
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,620
to release something that was named

475
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:31,019
after him for that cup and Neville had

476
00:19:28,619 --> 00:19:34,139
been working on this uh

477
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:35,279
nl5 Haze by Skunk Haze project but he

478
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:38,280
didn't really feel like it was ready

479
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:39,599
yeah but the dronkers convinced him to

480
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:42,119
release it

481
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:43,918
um and they released it at the cup

482
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:46,619
um and it was called Jack Herer after

483
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:49,020
the theme of the cup yeah

484
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:50,579
um and then and then Neville kept

485
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:53,579
working that line and three or four

486
00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:55,379
years later he re-released it uh and

487
00:19:53,579 --> 00:19:57,538
proved as he thought as super silver

488
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:58,980
haze yeah

489
00:19:57,538 --> 00:20:02,160
so

490
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:05,400
yeah I was at that that cup

491
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:08,460
um one thing I'll say about the the uh

492
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:11,700
the these cups is from a personal level

493
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:13,679
right I went to like three of them

494
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,500
and it was definitely my least favorite

495
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,298
time of being in Amsterdam

496
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,919
um because late it was usually in late

497
00:20:18,298 --> 00:20:21,720
November

498
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,500
um and Amsterdam's cold that time of

499
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:26,038
year

500
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:28,200
right so it could be sleeting or icy

501
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:31,140
rain or it's freezing and then you're in

502
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,600
these coffee shops and like and they're

503
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:35,460
super crowded and most of the best weed

504
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,619
is being hoarded for all of the

505
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,360
dignitaries and like famous people and

506
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:42,178
various folks coming in to smoke weed

507
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:46,259
for the Cannabis Cup yeah uh so for a

508
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:47,940
normal person it was like crowded cold

509
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:50,700
um and it was harder to find good wheat

510
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:53,460
yeah but it was still cool to see and

511
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:55,620
they did just like at they did we were

512
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:58,500
just describing they did usually draw

513
00:20:55,619 --> 00:21:00,119
big name seed drops

514
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,859
um at the Cup itself

515
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:03,959
yeah

516
00:21:01,859 --> 00:21:07,199
um because it got a lot of free press

517
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:09,900
yeah and everybody was there you know I

518
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,000
did find recently in an old article it

519
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:13,980
was the the year bubblegum won the

520
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,660
Cannabis Cup and it was in an old

521
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,400
article in High Times They were

522
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,840
interviewing Tony from Sager Matha and

523
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,798
he was the one who entered it in for the

524
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:21,899
gray area and it was actually

525
00:21:19,798 --> 00:21:24,779
bubbleberry that he entered in his

526
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:26,640
bubble gum so yeah I saw that and that I

527
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:30,599
was like what I didn't even know that so

528
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:33,659
apparently sometimes what is entered in

529
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:36,178
and named isn't necessarily what it is

530
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:38,220
we need to oh yeah that should be

531
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:41,038
clarified too I mean people

532
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:43,140
you know there's uh Neville would say

533
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:47,400
that you know the same cut that he had

534
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:48,780
of you know got went of nl5 skunk Hayes

535
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,419
got like four or five different names

536
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:53,099
yeah and we've seen that out west a

537
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:56,520
bunch too fast forward a bunch of years

538
00:21:53,099 --> 00:21:59,158
but what happened I think is by the by

539
00:21:56,519 --> 00:22:03,179
the early to mid 90s the Cannabis Cup

540
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:05,280
became a big vehicle for selling seats

541
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:07,500
yeah and so Matt was about to talk about

542
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:11,279
what is it 95 like the year after it's

543
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:14,640
wooden White Widow one yeah so it looks

544
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:16,440
like by 1995 greenhouse seeds started

545
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,799
smashing the butthole out of the

546
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:22,380
Cannabis Cup we have 95 white uh White

547
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:26,579
Widow 96.

548
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:28,500
White Russian yep 97 was Peacemaker yep

549
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:33,058
we got 98

550
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:36,179
SSH super Hayes 99. we got super silver

551
00:22:33,058 --> 00:22:37,798
haze again three times yeah and then 2

552
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:39,298
000 all of a sudden all of a sudden

553
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:41,879
something weird happens and we have

554
00:22:39,298 --> 00:22:44,158
blueberry winning a cup as it should as

555
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,440
it should always win every cup and don't

556
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,600
you forget it but that that's that was a

557
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:52,140
departure from the normal right so what

558
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:55,619
should be mentioned is that at the time

559
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:58,259
um White Widow White Rhino Peacemaker

560
00:22:55,619 --> 00:23:00,298
which is a great white shark

561
00:22:58,259 --> 00:23:01,558
um and Super Silver Haze all came out of

562
00:23:00,298 --> 00:23:04,918
the same shop

563
00:23:01,558 --> 00:23:06,418
yeah um it was all out of greenhouse uh

564
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:09,419
the white family was stuff getting

565
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:11,220
released by Shanti Baba and the haze was

566
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:12,179
stuff getting released by Neville

567
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:15,120
yeah

568
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:17,519
um so Greenhouse I think they swept I

569
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:19,739
think they placed top for

570
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:21,359
five six years in a row yeah it got

571
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,859
pretty ridiculous

572
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:26,279
you know

573
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:28,259
um and for different things too yeah

574
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:31,678
yeah there were lots of accusations

575
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:33,538
during that time of purchased cups and

576
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,340
whatnot and of course there were heavy

577
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:37,980
arguments that it was only done on Merit

578
00:23:35,339 --> 00:23:40,500
during those years I mean um and to be

579
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:42,779
real they had some of the most

580
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:45,779
accomplished breeders in history working

581
00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:48,178
for them at the time so they didn't

582
00:23:45,779 --> 00:23:50,359
necessarily have to buy cups to win most

583
00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:53,100
of the people around them were using

584
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:55,379
f2s or you know different filial

585
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:56,519
Generations or hybrids thereof the work

586
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,740
established by the people who are

587
00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:00,538
winning the cups so by that point I

588
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,279
don't know that it was necessarily

589
00:24:00,538 --> 00:24:05,339
something we can go aha it was already

590
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:07,500
corrupt it was well I mean with the

591
00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:09,240
white family the sort of the proof is in

592
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,339
the pudding in the sense that

593
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,359
it started winning the cups in the mid

594
00:24:11,339 --> 00:24:13,859
90s

595
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:17,099
and it was one of the most common

596
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:18,839
breeding tools for the next decade yeah

597
00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:21,000
the amount of people that bred with

598
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:23,699
white widow or white white rhino or

599
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,460
great white shark or any of those white

600
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:28,200
family things I mean I think that

601
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,880
um you know I've mentioned before that

602
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,519
like when I first went to like some of

603
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,679
Ron's Harvest parties and stuff

604
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:38,099
um things by White Widow were one of the

605
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:39,960
most common things you would find yeah

606
00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:40,980
um it was just it just became a huge

607
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,380
family

608
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:45,538
so in that regard I don't you know in

609
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:48,419
super silver haze did the same thing so

610
00:24:45,538 --> 00:24:50,099
I do think there was politics but I

611
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:52,799
think there was a crew there that had

612
00:24:50,099 --> 00:24:55,019
significantly better weed yeah I would

613
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:57,720
agree and they just sort and honestly

614
00:24:55,019 --> 00:24:59,339
Neville you know I mean Shanti came in

615
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:02,640
with the white family late but Neville

616
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:05,279
pretty much dominated the 90s yeah to a

617
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:08,520
large degree yeah yeah absolutely I mean

618
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:13,859
yeah everything except uh

619
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:16,019
88 with skunk one and uh 91 up until the

620
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:17,939
White Widow in 95 was Neville everything

621
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:19,679
else is Neville so it was like Neville

622
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:21,600
had this had this big run and then

623
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,740
Neville and Shanti joined forces and

624
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:25,678
then the stuff they released together

625
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:28,140
under Greenhouse had a big run

626
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,179
um and I also think too that like I mean

627
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:31,860
because it did for me

628
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:33,538
um you know you'd go to you'd go to

629
00:25:31,859 --> 00:25:36,000
Holland and you'd try to buy those seats

630
00:25:33,538 --> 00:25:40,019
yeah

631
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:43,079
so by after the the year that blueberry

632
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:46,319
won the cup we have a new entrant for

633
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:49,980
the the the king of the crown which is

634
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:51,359
Derry from Barney's farm with Sweet

635
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:54,538
Tooth

636
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:57,418
um you remember the Sweet Tooth oh yeah

637
00:25:54,538 --> 00:26:00,538
yeah that's some breeder Steve work yeah

638
00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:02,278
the Sweet Tooth it was a blueberry sweet

639
00:26:00,538 --> 00:26:05,579
pink grapefruit if I remember correctly

640
00:26:02,278 --> 00:26:07,798
no no no yeah yeah yeah yeah

641
00:26:05,579 --> 00:26:10,500
and you know there was this there was a

642
00:26:07,798 --> 00:26:12,359
Fino suite two three

643
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,278
um there was a lot of seed there was a

644
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:15,479
lot of people I would say in that in

645
00:26:14,278 --> 00:26:18,659
that era

646
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:21,120
probably the three or four most common

647
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:23,039
breeders as far as like new school was

648
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:28,199
like there was the white family from

649
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:31,259
Shanti there was the blue family from DJ

650
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,940
um you know there was uh

651
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:34,259
um there was stuff from spice of life

652
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,700
which is we were just talking about

653
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:39,058
there was a lot of work being put out

654
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:41,460
right then by breeder Steve you know his

655
00:26:39,058 --> 00:26:44,158
his Louis Legends ultimate Indica his

656
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:47,579
Blockhead his sweet tooth

657
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:52,080
um and probably uh probably even the

658
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:54,000
first the the first edition of uh of uh

659
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:55,740
Brothers Grimm was right around that era

660
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,720
too I want to give props to the real

661
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:00,359
breeder of Legends ultimate indica and

662
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,860

interview with him and Chimera ways back

665
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,679
a few of them it was I mean there's

666
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:09,178
always been a there's always been a

667
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,860
difference sometimes the person that

668
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:13,080
releases the seed line is the actual

669
00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:15,839
breeder yeah yeah of course many times

670
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:17,158
they're the aggregator yeah and they're

671
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:18,599
the person that was willing to take

672
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:21,360
seeds from someone else and go public

673
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:23,339
with them in some fashion yeah you know

674
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:24,479
and a lot of breeders are a mix of the

675
00:27:23,339 --> 00:27:26,579
two

676
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,960
they made some things themselves and

677
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:29,819
they got some things from other people

678
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:33,480
and you know and they went that way that

679
00:27:29,819 --> 00:27:35,278
route but I would say that uh yeah I

680
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:40,500
mean it was one it became one of the

681
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:42,839
biggest drivers of uh of sales of seeds

682
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,579
and popularity it was like kind of an

683
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:46,379
event thing even if you didn't buy High

684
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:48,658
Times every month if you were a stoner

685
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:51,539
you probably bought the High Times

686
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:54,720
Cannabis Cup issue yeah

687
00:27:51,538 --> 00:27:56,819
I would say in that era and there during

688
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,500
this time when blueberry started winning

689
00:27:56,819 --> 00:28:00,418
because for two years it was blueberry

690
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,700
stuff that won

691
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:05,520
um there was some alleged alleged maybe

692
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:07,860
we should say alleged

693
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:10,918
people getting caught and banned from

694
00:28:07,859 --> 00:28:14,099
participating in the cup for a few years

695
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:16,500
after Shanti and Neville disappeared uh

696
00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:20,219
maybe our young our little buddy this

697
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:22,019
guy so yeah I mean they uh

698
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:24,919
that's that's kind of an interesting

699
00:28:22,019 --> 00:28:28,379
story in the sense that greenhouse seeds

700
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:32,220
is uh was a partnership between uh

701
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:34,799
Neville Shanti and and Arjun right and

702
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:37,200
it was several very cool coffee shops to

703
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:40,200
visit in Amsterdam

704
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:43,140
um you know and they sold some of the

705
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:45,840
best flower in the in the spot and they

706
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:48,299
had they were the exclusive spot to get

707
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:51,720
uh Neville and Shanti work after Neville

708
00:28:48,298 --> 00:28:53,099
left Scentsy yeah so for five or six

709
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:56,400
years there they kind of rolled the

710
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:58,918
roost and I think eventually Shanti and

711
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:01,740
Neville chafed under

712
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:03,480
um sort of being like the back end but

713
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:06,058
still had to be in the shadows a bit

714
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,038
while Arjun was the face

715
00:29:06,058 --> 00:29:10,619
um and they decided to break off and do

716
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:13,879
their own thing uh as Shanti first and

717
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:17,519
then never a year later and after

718
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:19,320
Neville's experiences at Scentsy uh when

719
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:23,460
he partnered at Greenhouse he did not

720
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:26,759
let any seeds or breeding stock or

721
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:28,319
anything like that be controlled by uh

722
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:29,819
Greenhouse they kept that in-house

723
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:31,500
themselves

724
00:29:29,819 --> 00:29:34,079
um so when they so they provided

725
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:36,538
Greenhouse with a bunch of flour and a

726
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:39,418
bunch of seeds to sell

727
00:29:36,538 --> 00:29:41,278
well when they left that left Greenhouse

728
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:43,320
a real issue because it was the biggest

729
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:45,538
seed bank at the you know Seed Company

730
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:47,639
at the time it had been winning awards

731
00:29:45,538 --> 00:29:49,379
for five or six years in a row it had

732
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,419
all these unique lines it was crushing

733
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:54,240
the competition and all of a sudden it

734
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:57,659
didn't have any breeding stock

735
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:59,099
um or any uh or any in-house breeders

736
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:01,740
yeah

737
00:29:59,099 --> 00:30:02,939
and I believe that's when uh Franco got

738
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,159
hired

739
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:06,899
yeah I have no idea when Franco came in

740
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:09,419
that was I believe he came in after

741
00:30:06,898 --> 00:30:11,579
Neville and Shanti left yeah he wouldn't

742
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:14,940
have been there when they were there and

743
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:18,178
he and he and then and then he worked

744
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:20,340
for greenhouse and they ended up using a

745
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:22,860
bunch of greenhouse seed that they had

746
00:30:20,339 --> 00:30:25,678
to do Fino hunts and they started making

747
00:30:22,859 --> 00:30:27,479
a bunch of Origins Haze one arjun's

748
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:30,559
haste Super Lemon Haze all these

749
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:33,298
different things yeah um but we believe

750
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:35,099
that they actually got banned from

751
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:38,220
competition for a year

752
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:40,500
for trying to tilt the scales in their

753
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:42,058
favor I think it was a few years fan

754
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,038
actually it might have been a few it

755
00:30:42,058 --> 00:30:47,099
might it was at least one yeah at least

756
00:30:44,038 --> 00:30:51,839
one at least one but it went to show

757
00:30:47,099 --> 00:30:54,538
that what he really wanted obviously was

758
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:57,720
he really wanted to win some cups after

759
00:30:54,538 --> 00:31:00,200
his Stars left yeah

760
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:03,679
it was a big Financial thing you know

761
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:07,259
so from 2001

762
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:09,960
to freaking 2 000 I'm trying to watch my

763
00:31:07,259 --> 00:31:14,819
language so freaking 2000

764
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:17,940
12. it is a head-to-head show and this

765
00:31:14,819 --> 00:31:20,639
is a long time between Barney's Daria

766
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:22,860
Barney's and Greenhouse and we are

767
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,659
basically having Cannabis Cup winners

768
00:31:22,859 --> 00:31:27,298
with Morning Glory whatever the hell

769
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:28,679
that is a Hawaiian snow which was

770
00:31:27,298 --> 00:31:30,960
whatever they were selling that month

771
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:32,519
this Hawaiian snow we have amnesia Haze

772
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,679
we're all familiar with that we have

773
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:37,079
Willie Nelson not made by Derry from

774
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:40,980
Barney's Farm our John's Ultra Haze

775
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:43,199
number one God knows we have G13 Haze I

776
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:45,538
believe from um who made that was level

777
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,940
two Neville originally maybe yeah yeah

778
00:31:45,538 --> 00:31:51,298
but I think he gave it I think he gave

779
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:54,240
some of the Soma and so many so uh

780
00:31:51,298 --> 00:31:57,480
someone did yes yeah but I think that

781
00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:00,899
goes to show right there that

782
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:03,720
um there was probably a 15-year 18-year

783
00:32:00,898 --> 00:32:06,619
period where the Cannabis cups and High

784
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:10,679
Times in Holland were the epicenter yeah

785
00:32:06,619 --> 00:32:12,359
and then the epicenter shifts yeah and

786
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:15,559
you're talking right around that time

787
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:19,439
you're talking early 2000s right yep

788
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:21,240
2001 to 2012. well now we start getting

789
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,038
some of the early Emerald cups in

790
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,538
California

791
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:27,480
um now we start getting some more

792
00:32:24,538 --> 00:32:29,819
activity the forums and things had

793
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:32,220
changed things a whole bunch so people

794
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:34,259
were communicating in different ways you

795
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:36,120
could you could buy and trade seeds on

796
00:32:34,259 --> 00:32:38,940
the internet

797
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:41,639

00:33:42,538 --> 00:33:49,019
so and those are all for the most part

827
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:52,679
non-uh non they're not Holland based

828
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:55,740
situations exactly about that time Joey

829
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:59,038
weed thank you um I I had just I think

830
00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:02,640
about that time I had been hipped to the

831
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:04,019
whole Market by about 2007 2008 I had

832
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,880
already been hip to the whole fact that

833
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:07,500
the market had been moved that

834
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:11,220
everything that the Dutch were selling

835
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:12,719
was probably made in Spain and not

836
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:15,239
exactly what they would have been

837
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:18,299
selling say even

838
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:20,338
10 years prior you know although so it's

839
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:24,179
fair it's also fair to mention that in

840
00:34:20,338 --> 00:34:25,858
1999 or so maybe it was 2000 and they

841
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:28,619
changed the laws in the Netherlands

842
00:34:25,858 --> 00:34:31,440
where before you were allowed to legally

843
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:34,079
grow cannabis to make seed

844
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,898
um and then they changed it and they

845
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:39,779
closed that loophole uh and around that

846
00:34:36,898 --> 00:34:43,259
time a lot of the traditional seed seed

847
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:45,659
companies in Holland got raided yeah and

848
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:47,520
genetics were lost and and no everyone's

849
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:50,220
been very tight-lipped about that era

850
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:52,918
but we know since he got visited we know

851
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:55,799
serious seeds got visited we know Tony

852
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:59,219
from sag Martha got busted so bad he

853
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:01,019
shut down for 15 years yep um it kind of

854
00:34:59,219 --> 00:35:04,139
rolled through so some Nuance of all

855
00:35:01,019 --> 00:35:07,199
that stuff moving to Spain uh or and and

856
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:11,219
or Switzerland is all of a sudden

857
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:13,679
Holland became unfriendly yeah and sadly

858
00:35:11,219 --> 00:35:16,319
people lost some stock some mother stock

859
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:18,539
and some father stock and you know and

860
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,579
things got mixed up and there was great

861
00:35:18,539 --> 00:35:22,800
financial pressure to not admit what

862
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:24,000
you'd lost yeah

863
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,859
right

864
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,400
I mean it's kind of like we kind of

865
00:35:25,858 --> 00:35:31,019
trust Scentsy in the 90s and

866
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,220
increasingly not as the 2000s went down

867
00:35:31,019 --> 00:35:35,759
right

868
00:35:32,219 --> 00:35:38,759
is as as Neville had less less to do

869
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:41,400
with greenhouse and Scentsy I think

870
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:43,380
I think a lot changed and it became very

871
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:45,539
obvious and it was mostly because I mean

872
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:47,160
there's only so many people that really

873
00:35:45,539 --> 00:35:49,079
take everything so serious when it comes

874
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:50,759
to genetics and being that anal about

875
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:52,260
getting everything right the way it's

876
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,300
supposed to be there's there's only a

877
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:56,460
few that have ever existed in my opinion

878
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:59,880
so then you could probably say that

879
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:02,820
sometime in the in the early 2000s

880
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:04,980
um the uh High Times Cannabis Cup after

881
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:07,980
sort of like a 15-year run of dominance

882
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:11,099
really started losing Pizzazz and like

883
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:14,639
the capturing the imagination of stars

884
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:18,300
yeah it changed

885
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:19,980
um and you know we you know 215 and in

886
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,599
Colorado and there was different things

887
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,740
that were going on in America at the

888
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,140
time where things were starting to

889
00:36:22,739 --> 00:36:27,118
loosen and open up more and more

890
00:36:25,139 --> 00:36:28,379
um so the epicenter of Interest shifted

891
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,079
yeah

892
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:34,380
I want to say the first Emerald cup was

893
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:35,720
probably in the early 2003 or four let's

894
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:38,280
see

895
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:40,618
if I had to if I had to guess I would

896
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:43,380
say within a year or two of that and it

897
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:45,838
started in area 101 in Mendo

898
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:48,059
um which is a little bit little ways

899
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:48,599
north of Laytonville

900
00:36:48,059 --> 00:36:51,960
um

901
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:54,059
and uh that's a property Tim Blake owns

902
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,960
and uh he threw events there for a long

903
00:36:54,059 --> 00:36:57,179
time

904
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,220
uh I can't remember exactly when it when

905
00:36:57,179 --> 00:37:02,039
it grew but but that's kind of like what

906
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:04,919
shift it is is cups sort of went through

907
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:06,539
a lull of not being all that important

908
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:08,220
yeah and then I think they probably had

909
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:11,940
a resurgence

910
00:37:08,219 --> 00:37:15,179
when the West Coast Medical cops started

911
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:16,200
growing in popularity yeah the emerald

912
00:37:15,179 --> 00:37:17,879
cup

913
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:19,919
um when the emerald cup especially got

914
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:22,260
bigger High Times started throwing

915
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,659
instead of having one cup a year they

916
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:27,720
started having how many man oh my god

917
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:29,879
well at first they were doing like

918
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:31,799
um like a High Times cup California and

919
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,599
then they would do High Times California

920
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,039
and I remember the first year Denver had

921
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:38,640
it and then it became like High Times

922
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:40,679
you'd have California one once or twice

923
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:41,879
a year it'd be California once or twice

924
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:43,858
a year would be Denver and then you'd

925
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:46,858
also start adding in Michigan and then

926
00:37:43,858 --> 00:37:48,539
it became like three times each you know

927
00:37:46,858 --> 00:37:51,119
each day each year and then it just

928
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:52,440
became a [ __ ] show of you know however

929
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,660
many a year I couldn't even keep count

930
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:56,820
anymore well that so that thing

931
00:37:54,659 --> 00:37:59,699
dramatically changed it from like going

932
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:02,039
from sort of like a once a year event

933
00:37:59,699 --> 00:38:04,919
yeah right that was fairly short to

934
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:07,679
turning it into sort of like a circuit

935
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:10,680
yeah right it was a circuit and so that

936
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:12,299
being that it was a circuit it morphed

937
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:14,098
from instead of it just being sort of

938
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:17,519
like a collection of people Gathering

939
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:21,059
and a competition yeah it it grew this

940
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:23,159
little economy all around it as well so

941
00:38:21,059 --> 00:38:25,019
a lot of these cups it would be a gray

942
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:26,460
area in these states where you could go

943
00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:28,679
and you could see a bunch of Growers

944
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:31,380
flower and you could buy directly from

945
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:34,559
small breeders right

946
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:37,740
um and so it became a way for industry

947
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:40,259
people to see each other yeah and uh

948
00:38:37,739 --> 00:38:43,139
that was for sure that that really was

949
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:44,640
what it became to be it for a while I

950
00:38:43,139 --> 00:38:45,719
think it was pretty special and I think

951
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:47,940
a lot of people thought it was pretty

952
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:49,739
special like not just not just on the

953
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:51,240
the business level like a lot of us

954
00:38:49,739 --> 00:38:53,338
would make most of our money for the

955
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:56,819
year at Emerald cup

956
00:38:53,338 --> 00:38:58,078
um but on a level where you get to see a

957
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:01,260
lot of the people that you grew up

958
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:02,760
looking up to in this business and and a

959
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:05,040
lot of times you'd get to have dinner

960
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,599
with them and you'd end up finding a

961
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:09,000
pier as opposed to someone you just look

962
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:10,559
up to it was it was a wild time it was

963
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,719
it was definitely different

964
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:14,279
so then it became multi-layered in the

965
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:15,539
sense that you could kind of turn some

966
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,700
of those events into what you wanted

967
00:39:15,539 --> 00:39:19,259
them to be if you were super into the

968
00:39:17,699 --> 00:39:21,719
competition you could stay in those

969
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:23,339
areas and focus on that yeah

970
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:24,419
um you know if you wanted to stay in the

971
00:39:23,338 --> 00:39:26,039
area where you were going to meet a

972
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:28,260
bunch of breeders and Growers and

973
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:30,300
Industry types and various people that

974
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:32,579
would gather you could just kind of use

975
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:35,820
it to rub shoulders and network and chat

976
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:39,180
and see people in person yeah it's where

977
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:41,099
a lot of of clandestine people decided

978
00:39:39,179 --> 00:39:44,639
to start showing their faces

979
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:46,260
yeah that's true too you know so it's

980
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:49,219
where you could go and decide I'm gonna

981
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:52,140
punch Matt Riot yeah yeah

982
00:39:49,219 --> 00:39:53,519
that is a popular choice too yeah I'm

983
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:56,159
gonna go to Emerald cup and I'm gonna

984
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:57,900
punch Matt right in the face one thing I

985
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:59,639
don't want to forget it is for some of

986
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:01,019
the old-timers the nugs and jugs stuff

987
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:03,179
like that if you want to talk about some

988
00:40:01,019 --> 00:40:04,679
of that real quick did we did we cover

989
00:40:03,179 --> 00:40:07,319
it no we haven't we haven't mentioned it

990
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:09,838
at all we kind of honestly we just

991
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:12,960
started talking about like the lack of

992
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:14,699
of cultural impact that the can the

993
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,099
Cannabis cups from High Times had hit by

994
00:40:14,699 --> 00:40:18,659
the early 2000s yeah and then we just

995
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:20,180
started riffing on their Replacements

996
00:40:18,659 --> 00:40:23,279
but we really didn't go into depth

997
00:40:20,179 --> 00:40:25,139
beyond that okay let's hit let's hit

998
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,880
nugs and jugs because I think I think

999
00:40:25,139 --> 00:40:28,319
that's one of those special small events

1000
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,599
that not a lot of people know about that

1001
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:33,920
existed and why don't you chat on it for

1002
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:36,359
a minute I wasn't around for that

1003
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,820
yeah you go ahead

1004
00:40:36,358 --> 00:40:40,980
I mean some of them some of them we've

1005
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:43,740
almost done like uh halfway whole

1006
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:45,420
episodes on WE you know like Ron's yeah

1007
00:40:43,739 --> 00:40:48,239
you know those would be those would be

1008
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:49,680
considered like uh like Harvest parties

1009
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:52,259
or whatever but

1010
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:53,879
um there was a lot you know separate

1011
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:56,700
from like the emerald cups and the stuff

1012
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:59,760
that was was was so blatant there's

1013
00:40:56,699 --> 00:41:01,858
invite-only cups yeah you know there was

1014
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,140
invite-only Gatherings that had no cup

1015
00:41:01,858 --> 00:41:06,900
it was just the way for you know dozens

1016
00:41:04,139 --> 00:41:09,299
of of characters from our world to

1017
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:13,260
safely meet up and swap stories and

1018
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:15,180
seeds and plants and clones and weed you

1019
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:16,560
know uh it was where a lot of like

1020
00:41:15,179 --> 00:41:18,179
little people's private interests

1021
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:20,759
started blending

1022
00:41:18,179 --> 00:41:22,980
um and it was an ERA too before

1023
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:24,960
it was before anyone was worried about

1024
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:26,820
personal rep because that was so

1025
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,139
fleeting and it was still dangerous so

1026
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,640
yeah it was the kind of thing where I'd

1027
00:41:28,139 --> 00:41:32,098
go to a Harvest Festival and this dude

1028
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:35,098
would give me you know a hundred seeds

1029
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:36,720
of blue widow by by sweet two three and

1030
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:38,640
this person would give me 50th people

1031
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:42,358
were just excited to sh that you wanted

1032
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:44,759
to take seeds of their work

1033
00:41:42,358 --> 00:41:46,679
you know so there was a lot of trading

1034
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,540
that went on amongst amateurs and

1035
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:50,699
enthusiasts and stuff like that but they

1036
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:53,699
were all the stuff we mentioned before

1037
00:41:50,699 --> 00:41:55,199
there was a new wave of breeders that

1038
00:41:53,699 --> 00:41:57,539
had followings

1039
00:41:55,199 --> 00:42:01,379
yeah you know people were all excited

1040
00:41:57,539 --> 00:42:04,019
about breeder Steve and uh and you know

1041
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:05,880
Brothers Grimm and

1042
00:42:04,019 --> 00:42:07,259
um you know DJ Short with all the

1043
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,480
blueberry stuff right there was

1044
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:11,880
exploding and you know all the white

1045
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:13,740
stuff was popular because it added Frost

1046
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:16,740
and density to almost anything you added

1047
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:18,419
it to uh and so you know and there was

1048
00:42:16,739 --> 00:42:20,699
people going over to Switzerland and

1049
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:22,980
seeing breeder Steve or seeing Shanti so

1050
00:42:20,699 --> 00:42:26,159
nothing like a little in-person chat to

1051
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:27,960
make a fan base right yeah uh because

1052
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:30,719
that's what some of the cups became too

1053
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:34,800
right it was you could go and meet your

1054
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:37,078
breeder and talk to them in person yeah

1055
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:39,119
and there would be lines I mean you

1056
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:42,599
remember this is kind of late in the

1057
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:45,960
emerald cup but uh our buddy uh uh Bodhi

1058
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:48,000
uh was famous for not being there yeah

1059
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:50,699
yeah being there and not being there

1060
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,219
yeah and the first year that he had an

1061
00:42:50,699 --> 00:42:56,098
actual booth I mean it was there was

1062
00:42:53,219 --> 00:42:57,719
like a 75-yard line for a day and a half

1063
00:42:56,099 --> 00:42:59,400
yeah

1064
00:42:57,719 --> 00:43:01,739
do you remember what he was doing that

1065
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:03,720
day like the first time he showed up he

1066
00:43:01,739 --> 00:43:05,639
was yeah he was he was like getting in

1067
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:06,959
costumes and getting in his own line and

1068
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:08,519
like standing next to people and like

1069
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,480
talking to them about his own stuff and

1070
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:10,980
they didn't even know they were talking

1071
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,358
to him and then like walked up and sell

1072
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:15,318
them seeds real fast and they'd freak

1073
00:43:12,358 --> 00:43:17,460
out yeah he would and he yeah

1074
00:43:15,318 --> 00:43:19,079
I don't know if it was that year the

1075
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:21,980
next year but he brought he got this a

1076
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:25,440
hold of this enormous stack of original

1077
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:27,960
1985 Neville seed bank catalogs yeah

1078
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,940
that came from Clyde and it came from

1079
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:32,519
Clyde yeah yeah I just remember he

1080
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:34,800
walked around he had this big pack you

1081
00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:36,900
know this big side bag and he just all

1082
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:39,420
the all every good friend got a couple

1083
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:40,980
of copies of Neville's first catalog

1084
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:42,659
that he put Santa Claus did it was

1085
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:44,460
amazing yeah Santa Claus did and

1086
00:43:42,659 --> 00:43:47,879
probably some like weird tobacco seeds

1087
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:50,099
and some some crazy Indian sativas that

1088
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:52,980
he had gathered or whatever perfumes

1089
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:54,300
there was perfumes yeah so that's just

1090
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:56,219
the kind of neat thing that you can do

1091
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:58,980
because it was like it's it's almost

1092
00:43:56,219 --> 00:44:01,679
weird in the sense that um all day long

1093
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:03,659
uh you know customers and fans get to

1094
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:06,059
hang out and get to go meet the people

1095
00:44:03,659 --> 00:44:07,618
and ask questions and buy seeds direct

1096
00:44:06,059 --> 00:44:10,019
from that person and know you're not

1097
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:11,760
getting scammed yeah and then after all

1098
00:44:10,019 --> 00:44:13,079
that and between all that at night like

1099
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,460
a bunch of the friends that are doing

1100
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:17,339
all that kind of stuff get to actually

1101
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:18,539
see one another in person yeah and I

1102
00:44:17,338 --> 00:44:20,460
mean that's kind of what our party's

1103
00:44:18,539 --> 00:44:22,920
formed out of was like

1104
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:25,980
we would all be at the emerald cup we'd

1105
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:27,900
all be like headed there anyways and we

1106
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:29,760
would try to like make time for each

1107
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:32,519
other during the day when we're doing

1108
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,960
these transactions but we would get so

1109
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:35,460
bogged down especially in the later

1110
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,740
years that we didn't have time to even

1111
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:39,659
talk to each other and we just we'd just

1112
00:44:37,739 --> 00:44:41,818
be like all right next year you'll catch

1113
00:44:39,659 --> 00:44:42,960
it you know whatever but so at the end

1114
00:44:41,818 --> 00:44:44,699
we were just like [ __ ] it we're just

1115
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,740
gonna have to set aside a full night for

1116
00:44:44,699 --> 00:44:49,618
partying after where we can all hang out

1117
00:44:46,739 --> 00:44:51,419
away from everyone and just chill and I

1118
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:52,920
you know like it it just naturally

1119
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:54,960
evolves sometimes that way and it's

1120
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,940
really fun you know it was kind of like

1121
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,079
one of those old Harvest Harvest parties

1122
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:59,700
of old

1123
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:01,680
yeah you know where a bunch of people

1124
00:44:59,699 --> 00:45:03,419
bring a lot of nice weed and they set it

1125
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:05,159
on the table and it's a bunch of

1126
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:07,079
chatting and eating and smoking and

1127
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:08,940
hanging out and

1128
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:11,400
um you know there's there's cool Parts

1129
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:14,940
about that obviously like with the

1130
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:16,079
emerald cup and uh the high times and a

1131
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:18,900
lot of the stuff that started happening

1132
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:20,460
on the west coast it became again like

1133
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:23,220
it was in the beginning with the High

1134
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:25,260
Times festivals in Amsterdam it became

1135
00:45:23,219 --> 00:45:28,439
again like a Prestige money making

1136
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:30,359
important thing yes yeah and people

1137
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:33,240
would put a lot of effort into winning

1138
00:45:30,358 --> 00:45:35,519
because they wanted to advertise that

1139
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:37,858
they had won you know and all the

1140
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:40,679
shadiness came in like there was there

1141
00:45:37,858 --> 00:45:43,799
was uh they'll remain nameless but there

1142
00:45:40,679 --> 00:45:46,139
was some clubs that would just hold back

1143
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:48,960
the nicest weed and hash they bought all

1144
00:45:46,139 --> 00:45:50,219
year yeah and then enter it under their

1145
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,559
own label

1146
00:45:50,219 --> 00:45:53,818
yeah of course I mean that's that's a

1147
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:55,380
move like how are you gonna prove it

1148
00:45:53,818 --> 00:45:57,000
wasn't your own bike but then you walk

1149
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:58,380
into their thing and they've got all

1150
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,579
these Medals of all the [ __ ] that

1151
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,800
they've won look at all the good weed

1152
00:45:59,579 --> 00:46:03,420
that's been in our store look at this

1153
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:06,480
yeah we've got all these different

1154
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:08,280
Metals you know and uh and you know

1155
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,980
hashmakers winning a bunch of metals

1156
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:13,019
flower makers it's like it's it's free

1157
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:14,579
Hardware it like makes you maybe it

1158
00:46:13,019 --> 00:46:16,318
makes it easier to sell in dispensaries

1159
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:19,200
maybe it gets people asking about your

1160
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:20,940
seeds maybe at this and that

1161
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:23,219
um and so as a result of that it went

1162
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:25,380
from you know Harvest festivals that

1163
00:46:23,219 --> 00:46:27,299
like they're totally non-economic way or

1164
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:30,180
just a way of for a bunch of weed nerds

1165
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:33,000
to conduct business make friends and

1166
00:46:30,179 --> 00:46:34,858
exchange yeah but then there's also this

1167
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,719
Commerce aspect where it's like winning

1168
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:39,179
is a big deal

1169
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:40,799
yeah you know and so that's where the

1170
00:46:39,179 --> 00:46:42,659
that's where some [ __ ] comes in and

1171
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:44,579
that's where room and you know we people

1172
00:46:42,659 --> 00:46:46,259
aren't the most like you know there's

1173
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:48,960
plenty of non-ethics that goes into

1174
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:50,579
something that's like unregulated

1175
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,559
um and so there's lots of rumors about

1176
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:55,500
how real or how not certain Cups have

1177
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:57,299
been over time sure yeah I mean that's

1178
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:59,519
gonna happen

1179
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:01,619
you know people that win want to tout

1180
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:03,659
their [ __ ] people that don't win want to

1181
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:05,640
be like it was [ __ ] rigged this

1182
00:47:03,659 --> 00:47:08,118
person's friends or family are related

1183
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:10,379
or this is happening or

1184
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:12,380
they paid for it or there was money

1185
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:15,900
exchanged or you don't know how it works

1186
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:18,420
and you know there's uh there's probably

1187
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:19,619
some fire there with the smoke

1188
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:21,180
um there's no point in talking about

1189
00:47:19,619 --> 00:47:22,500
individual aspects but there were so

1190
00:47:21,179 --> 00:47:24,838
many of them and there was so much money

1191
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:26,219
at stake it seems silly to think that

1192
00:47:24,838 --> 00:47:28,318
there wasn't some

1193
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:30,959
you know it wasn't just purely

1194
00:47:28,318 --> 00:47:33,779
altruistic double-blind studies

1195
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:36,300
dispassionately deciding uh which weed

1196
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:38,339
is best absolutely yeah

1197
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:40,680
definitely not double blinded any of

1198
00:47:38,338 --> 00:47:42,420
these events even when you try and I

1199
00:47:40,679 --> 00:47:43,799
told you about this earlier I won't say

1200
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:46,139
which event it was but there was an

1201
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,700
event me and another person

1202
00:47:46,139 --> 00:47:49,199
um spent making it was originally going

1203
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:50,460
to be called the Breeders Cup and we

1204
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:53,098
were just gonna invite breeders and the

1205
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:55,139
idea was breeders had to enter in their

1206
00:47:53,099 --> 00:47:56,640
own weed that they grew but it was still

1207
00:47:55,139 --> 00:47:59,159
there's still an honor principle

1208
00:47:56,639 --> 00:48:01,679
involved with that right like they just

1209
00:47:59,159 --> 00:48:04,559
had to present it you know

1210
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:07,078
um that that idea was expanded on and

1211
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:08,699
taken for another cup and I went to that

1212
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:10,680
event and it seemed cool and everything

1213
00:48:08,699 --> 00:48:12,779
you know everybody was chilling and

1214
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:15,539
there was one thing nobody accounted for

1215
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:18,619
with all these rules that we thought

1216
00:48:15,539 --> 00:48:20,639
we had accounted for everything someone

1217
00:48:18,619 --> 00:48:24,480
brought a green

1218
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:26,639
jar that was Green Glass and clear

1219
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:28,559
and anytime that jar was going around to

1220
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:30,779
the different tables they always knew

1221
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:32,940
where it was and it was supposed to be

1222
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:35,940
double blind so nobody knew whose weed

1223
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:38,280
was which right like supposedly or

1224
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:40,260
nobody had a green jar exactly and when

1225
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:42,060
it came by your when your own weed came

1226
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:43,619
by and you knew it was your own weed you

1227
00:48:42,059 --> 00:48:46,039
had the honor System saying hey this is

1228
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:48,960
mine I'm not going to vote on it however

1229
00:48:46,039 --> 00:48:51,480
suppliers of green jars voted on green

1230
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,740
jar you know it it was a lot of [ __ ]

1231
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:54,179
like that so even when there's things

1232
00:48:52,739 --> 00:48:55,618
you can't account for and I don't think

1233
00:48:54,179 --> 00:48:58,078
that they brought the green jar there

1234
00:48:55,619 --> 00:49:00,119
just to like purposely do that it just

1235
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:01,560
is something that that organically

1236
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:03,539
happened and it was like wait wait a

1237
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:05,519
minute we have an advantage here we know

1238
00:49:03,539 --> 00:49:06,300
which one's ours and green jar won the

1239
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:08,818
cup

1240
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:10,260
I mean there was one there was a lot of

1241
00:49:08,818 --> 00:49:12,539
money to be made in that era I remember

1242
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:14,040
like the the whole like DNA Crockett

1243
00:49:12,539 --> 00:49:15,599
partnership

1244
00:49:14,039 --> 00:49:17,759
um there were certain years of emerald

1245
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:20,160
Cup on Friday and Saturday where they

1246
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,200
would have like a four-way Booth yeah

1247
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:24,719
they would just have a line spidering

1248
00:49:22,199 --> 00:49:26,578
off it in every direction yeah and

1249
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:28,919
everybody was after Tangy and double

1250
00:49:26,579 --> 00:49:31,440
banana Tangy and this and that and

1251
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:32,700
everything else and you know but I mean

1252
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,740
it was like you know there were certain

1253
00:49:32,699 --> 00:49:37,919
if you were a hot

1254
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:41,098
Seed Company leading into that show

1255
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:42,780
yeah uh it could be a huge windfall I

1256
00:49:41,099 --> 00:49:45,119
mean for example like with what you're

1257
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:47,700
saying right now during those years the

1258
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:50,579
DNA and Crockett entered that stuff I

1259
00:49:47,699 --> 00:49:53,219
was laying out tons of Calio and banana

1260
00:49:50,579 --> 00:49:55,019
OG stuff in fact banana OG was the basis

1261
00:49:53,219 --> 00:49:59,098
for most of my breeding program during

1262
00:49:55,019 --> 00:50:01,019
that time and it didn't matter because I

1263
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:02,519
I didn't have the prestige I didn't have

1264
00:50:01,019 --> 00:50:04,139
any of that like Crockett nobody knew

1265
00:50:02,519 --> 00:50:06,239
who the hell Crockett was before they

1266
00:50:04,139 --> 00:50:07,500
popped up nobody but the second DNA

1267
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:09,118
picked them up

1268
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,858
to the top because it was in all the

1269
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:12,599
High Times magazines and all of a sudden

1270
00:50:10,858 --> 00:50:15,480
they were saying well we have this

1271
00:50:12,599 --> 00:50:17,099
banana oh it's in high times and it just

1272
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:19,019
flew and you're not even kidding like

1273
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:20,880
there were lines out it had always been

1274
00:50:19,019 --> 00:50:22,800
available ever since Oregon kid had put

1275
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:25,079
it out someone was releasing banana OG

1276
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,760
something ever since that point but it

1277
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:28,500
was as if it had never existed before

1278
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:31,319
the second entered High Times and the

1279
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:33,000
hype had struck well I also think to tie

1280
00:50:31,318 --> 00:50:35,699
into like the marketing and the push

1281
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:38,579
aspect of things I do think they were

1282
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:40,259
smart in the sense that they in the 215

1283
00:50:38,579 --> 00:50:42,839
era they grew green they grew some

1284
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:44,819
greenhouses of their work yeah and then

1285
00:50:42,838 --> 00:50:47,099
they got professional photographers to

1286
00:50:44,818 --> 00:50:50,159
come in and just take absolutely

1287
00:50:47,099 --> 00:50:51,660
gorgeous shots of their wheat yeah you

1288
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:54,058
know and and some of their weed was very

1289
00:50:51,659 --> 00:50:55,379
photogenic you know

1290
00:50:54,059 --> 00:50:56,700
um and you couldn't tell if it was going

1291
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:59,818
to get you high obviously or anything

1292
00:50:56,699 --> 00:51:02,578
like that but like Instagram yeah they

1293
00:50:59,818 --> 00:51:06,119
they but they drove sales with a lot of

1294
00:51:02,579 --> 00:51:07,440
AD copy and I mean Instagram you know uh

1295
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:10,440
weed people weren't ready to be marked

1296
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:12,720
marketed to yeah a lot of the popularity

1297
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:14,220
in weed used to happen organically in in

1298
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:17,879
small groups and spreading from there

1299
00:51:14,219 --> 00:51:18,899
yeah we talk about this ad nauseam every

1300
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:21,599
yeah but it's like that's another

1301
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:23,400
example of it right is that is that you

1302
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:26,760
know I mean when I'll give another

1303
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:28,559
example uh you know when uh when

1304
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:30,480
Skittles was hard to get

1305
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:31,800
right and so the vast majority of people

1306
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,139
that was going to get after it could

1307
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:36,359
only get hybrids you know you take a

1308
00:51:34,139 --> 00:51:38,639
somebody that had it like uh Dying Breed

1309
00:51:36,358 --> 00:51:40,318
seeds at the time or something and they

1310
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:43,078
would they would have a huge line for

1311
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:46,500
that first two days of emerald cup uh

1312
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:48,839
all selling 300 to 500 packs mostly 500

1313
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:51,119
of red seeds yep out the door just like

1314
00:51:48,838 --> 00:51:52,380
bam crazy because people were after it

1315
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:55,140
so

1316
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:57,720
um like Matt mentioned uh you know if if

1317
00:51:55,139 --> 00:51:59,338
you marketed your stuff the right way a

1318
00:51:57,719 --> 00:52:01,679
few of those events could take care of

1319
00:51:59,338 --> 00:52:05,219
you for the whole year yeah definitely

1320
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:07,919
it was big and it was so it became so

1321
00:52:05,219 --> 00:52:09,899
much more than a like the the winning of

1322
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,940
the cups was important

1323
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:13,740
for sort of bragging rights and a

1324
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:15,420
different way to Market but the other

1325
00:52:13,739 --> 00:52:19,318
part of it was just sort of this gray

1326
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:21,659
area seed swap every kind of act all you

1327
00:52:19,318 --> 00:52:25,619
had to do was buy a booth and have a few

1328
00:52:21,659 --> 00:52:27,000
permits and you could do uh all kinds of

1329
00:52:25,619 --> 00:52:30,838
crazy sales

1330
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:33,059
now you have to since 2018 you have to

1331
00:52:30,838 --> 00:52:35,880
be licensed it has to be through dispos

1332
00:52:33,059 --> 00:52:38,160
it's far more regulated and controlled

1333
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:40,858
but in the era that Matt is remember

1334
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:42,779
talking about fondly it literally was

1335
00:52:40,858 --> 00:52:45,779
sort of like a weed swap meet

1336
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:48,180
open air Cowboy Market it was fun

1337
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:50,519
sharing you know here's a joint here's a

1338
00:52:48,179 --> 00:52:52,199
dab talk about this oh I've got six

1339
00:52:50,519 --> 00:52:53,759
different eight different jars of my

1340
00:52:52,199 --> 00:52:56,338
different strains you want to smell the

1341
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,960
line I'm selling I just grab them all by

1342
00:52:56,338 --> 00:53:00,239
their [ __ ] jacket and drag them

1343
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:04,858
across the floor nobody gives a [ __ ]

1344
00:53:00,239 --> 00:53:06,598
yeah wow wow we used to uh I mean Matt

1345
00:53:04,858 --> 00:53:09,239
and I actually used to joke that we

1346
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:11,220
could have like a charity boxing matches

1347
00:53:09,239 --> 00:53:14,279
at Emerald at Emerald cup where everyone

1348
00:53:11,219 --> 00:53:16,739
could settle all their beefs or not or

1349
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:19,140
make up you know yeah oh you just

1350
00:53:16,739 --> 00:53:22,259
disappeared can you hear me still I can

1351
00:53:19,139 --> 00:53:25,379
hear you your picture went kaput

1352
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:27,540
yeah I don't know why it went cupboards

1353
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:28,680
so the right camera selected blah blah

1354
00:53:27,539 --> 00:53:30,000
blah let me see what's going on that's

1355
00:53:28,679 --> 00:53:31,139
all right go ahead and keep going but

1356
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,780
yeah anyway

1357
00:53:31,139 --> 00:53:35,279
um so Emerald cup and those and and some

1358
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:37,140
of those High Times especially in

1359
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,839
Southern California for Crews down there

1360
00:53:37,139 --> 00:53:40,739
it became a place to regularly see other

1361
00:53:39,838 --> 00:53:43,440
people

1362
00:53:40,739 --> 00:53:46,139
it became a place where Growers and Seed

1363
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:47,700
makers and various industry people could

1364
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:49,799
meet up

1365
00:53:47,699 --> 00:53:50,939
um now it's like I'm split no you're

1366
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:54,720
right good

1367
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:57,300
um anyway they in my opinion

1368
00:53:54,719 --> 00:53:59,039
um you know a lot of people went and it

1369
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:02,700
was sort of totally irrelevant that

1370
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:05,039
there was a competition going on

1371
00:54:02,699 --> 00:54:06,598
uh you know they they went to just uh

1372
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:08,519
they went to get seeds so they went to

1373
00:54:06,599 --> 00:54:09,960
meet certain people or they went to CNB

1374
00:54:08,519 --> 00:54:11,579
scene

1375
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:13,500
um or just you know be able to walk

1376
00:54:11,579 --> 00:54:15,599
around and and see what who was

1377
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:18,358
developing there he's back there we go

1378
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:20,099
booths all kinds of stuff and so there

1379
00:54:18,358 --> 00:54:22,858
was a very cool

1380
00:54:20,099 --> 00:54:26,338
I would say like raw capitalistic

1381
00:54:22,858 --> 00:54:28,139
freedom to it yeah it was um it was

1382
00:54:26,338 --> 00:54:29,940
something special and that era is not

1383
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:31,558
here anymore but also you know what what

1384
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:34,858
else is interesting is we could bring

1385
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:38,040
something up that I find kind of cool is

1386
00:54:34,858 --> 00:54:39,480
that the first all the first cups uh

1387
00:54:38,039 --> 00:54:42,900
when we first started getting like real

1388
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:45,000
testing imperfect as it may be I

1389
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:49,139
remember there was only four or five

1390
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:51,719
strains that tested in the high 20s okay

1391
00:54:49,139 --> 00:54:54,480
right like literally it was like there

1392
00:54:51,719 --> 00:54:57,558
was a couple examples of chem 91 there

1393
00:54:54,480 --> 00:55:00,420
was a Strawberry Cough

1394
00:54:57,559 --> 00:55:01,800
there was a Scentsy star Scentsy star in

1395
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:04,139
a headband and that was basically it

1396
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:05,940
yeah right for the first five or six

1397
00:55:04,139 --> 00:55:07,980
years that there was testing with cups

1398
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:11,159
yeah and then

1399
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:12,960
we started to see test creep

1400
00:55:11,159 --> 00:55:14,818
where all these numbers and all these

1401
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,159
terpenes and all these THC percentages

1402
00:55:14,818 --> 00:55:19,139
started climbing and we used to joke

1403
00:55:17,159 --> 00:55:21,299
that you know there was one or two

1404
00:55:19,139 --> 00:55:24,358
things in the 30 Club

1405
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:26,460
yeah and then fast forward five years

1406
00:55:24,358 --> 00:55:28,739
and there's dozens of things in the 30

1407
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:30,960
Club yeah

1408
00:55:28,739 --> 00:55:32,818
and you know and people started breeding

1409
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,500
by numbers

1410
00:55:32,818 --> 00:55:36,000
because they wanted to show high numbers

1411
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:37,460
in the dispensary and they wanted to

1412
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:40,440
show high numbers in the competition

1413
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:42,300
yeah I watched someone claim 50 the

1414
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:43,858
other day on the reg so it's still

1415
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:45,720
happening

1416
00:55:43,858 --> 00:55:47,460
I mean I would even say I I don't know

1417
00:55:45,719 --> 00:55:51,118
about people listening or whatever but

1418
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:53,099
for my strangely for me I would say that

1419
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:54,838
the not all of it but the vast majority

1420
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:58,079
of my favorite weed tends to come in

1421
00:55:54,838 --> 00:56:00,179
between 18 and 25 percent yeah

1422
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:03,780
I don't know why there's some exceptions

1423
00:56:00,179 --> 00:56:06,779
but it a lot of it falls in that range

1424
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:09,839
um yeah and well I find a lot of the 30

1425
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:12,359
Club to have boring and not very long

1426
00:56:09,838 --> 00:56:14,460
lasting highs yeah

1427
00:56:12,358 --> 00:56:15,838
You know despite I mean I mean maybe

1428
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:18,119
they're potent in the sense or maybe

1429
00:56:15,838 --> 00:56:21,119
they wash well you know and they yield

1430
00:56:18,119 --> 00:56:22,440
well but I don't find that like you know

1431
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:25,500
I don't think that all these 30

1432
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:27,480
percenters plus uh are revolutionizing

1433
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:30,358
cannabis and making these older lower

1434
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:33,240
weaker things irrelevant it just reminds

1435
00:56:30,358 --> 00:56:35,400
me of the the old article from 1982 and

1436
00:56:33,239 --> 00:56:37,019
I want to say it was are The Connoisseur

1437
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:38,579
who I think is someone I'm not going to

1438
00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:41,639
say who because he's never publicly said

1439
00:56:38,579 --> 00:56:44,880
who he is but um he was referring to in

1440
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:47,519
1982 to ban the Indica he felt that the

1441
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:50,579
Indica was going to ruin cannabis and

1442
00:56:47,519 --> 00:56:52,519
that it was going to dumb down good weed

1443
00:56:50,579 --> 00:56:55,859
and indica

1444
00:56:52,519 --> 00:57:00,179
afghanis pakistanis tend to be what shot

1445
00:56:55,858 --> 00:57:02,639
that that that percentage Spike up so

1446
00:57:00,179 --> 00:57:06,118
I mean maybe they were just Nostradamus

1447
00:57:02,639 --> 00:57:08,818
you know well I I think it's interesting

1448
00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:10,140
we we've chatted about that before too

1449
00:57:08,818 --> 00:57:12,358
but yeah

1450
00:57:10,139 --> 00:57:16,799
um most of the sativas they were smoking

1451
00:57:12,358 --> 00:57:21,558
were bred for smoking flour yeah and

1452
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:24,240
indicas were bred for harvesting resin

1453
00:57:21,559 --> 00:57:26,579
and you know and the and and the two

1454
00:57:24,239 --> 00:57:28,618
things are very different you know they

1455
00:57:26,579 --> 00:57:30,960
didn't care about burnability with with

1456
00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:32,818
you know Afghani or Pakistani they

1457
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:35,099
didn't care about like any they cared

1458
00:57:32,818 --> 00:57:37,858
about the hatch yeah the flower was just

1459
00:57:35,099 --> 00:57:39,900
a carrier and so I think a lot of I

1460
00:57:37,858 --> 00:57:41,400
think a lot of that stuff got worked

1461
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:44,220
into weed

1462
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:47,099
um due to you know police pressure yeah

1463
00:57:44,219 --> 00:57:49,558
flowering times indoors and it does seem

1464
00:57:47,099 --> 00:57:55,500
there was a lot of 70s and early 80s

1465
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:57,480
heads that did not like the effects that

1466
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:59,818
the indicas were bringing to the game

1467
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:01,920
yeah they appreciated the earlier

1468
00:57:59,818 --> 00:58:03,719
flowering times and the chunkiness and

1469
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:06,300
the frostiness but as far as the point

1470
00:58:03,719 --> 00:58:08,699
of smoking weed how they enjoyed smoking

1471
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:10,440
it in joints yeah a lot of them felt

1472
00:58:08,699 --> 00:58:12,858
like it was kind of inferior

1473
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:15,599
I I think a lot of those dudes like

1474
00:58:12,858 --> 00:58:17,639
nowadays smoking a thing like cookies

1475
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:19,859
would just be that you know if you took

1476
00:58:17,639 --> 00:58:21,480
that to them in that time and brought it

1477
00:58:19,858 --> 00:58:23,818
to them they'd be like what the told you

1478
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:25,199
[ __ ] you know I really do think

1479
00:58:23,818 --> 00:58:28,199
they would think that because now we

1480
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:31,618
have a heavily inbred Kush style plant

1481
00:58:28,199 --> 00:58:34,139
that is you know very very narrow in the

1482
00:58:31,619 --> 00:58:36,960
type of high in my opinion that it gives

1483
00:58:34,139 --> 00:58:39,420
yeah I I mean everybody responds a bit

1484
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:41,818
differently but uh you know people know

1485
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:44,099
that I I don't I I don't reach for

1486
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:46,619
cookie jars too often as far as like my

1487
00:58:44,099 --> 00:58:47,880
go-to's as far as what affects me pretty

1488
00:58:46,619 --> 00:58:49,858
well

1489
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:51,539
um but I also say that you know I grew

1490
00:58:49,858 --> 00:58:54,358
up uh

1491
00:58:51,539 --> 00:58:56,699
and I'm not that young anymore I grew up

1492
00:58:54,358 --> 00:58:59,400
in an era where like the pure sativa era

1493
00:58:56,699 --> 00:59:01,858
was long gone yeah we were well into the

1494
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:04,079
mixed hybrids era

1495
00:59:01,858 --> 00:59:07,500
um and uh there's a lot of tempting

1496
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:09,420
things about Afghan yeah you know uh you

1497
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:11,338
know the it's it's you're trying to keep

1498
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:12,960
you know a lot of times a lot of those

1499
00:59:11,338 --> 00:59:15,298
early breeders like Neville and stuff

1500
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:17,099
they were trying to add the structure

1501
00:59:15,298 --> 00:59:19,338
and the frost and the density from the

1502
00:59:17,099 --> 00:59:23,519
Afghan but keep the flavor

1503
00:59:19,338 --> 00:59:26,578
and the the uh I the effect from the

1504
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:28,920
sativa and in fact that's why a bunch of

1505
00:59:26,579 --> 00:59:31,740
their Afghan breeding material was Bland

1506
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:34,440
and low Terps and boring yeah

1507
00:59:31,739 --> 00:59:36,058
right yeah that's what it sounds like

1508
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:39,599
you wanted yeah they picked

1509
00:59:36,059 --> 00:59:42,119
intentionally low terpene uh plants to

1510
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:44,039
breed with sometimes yeah when they

1511
00:59:42,119 --> 00:59:45,960
wanted the terpenes and the and the

1512
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:48,599
flavors to shine from the other side of

1513
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:51,659
the hybrid through yeah

1514
00:59:48,599 --> 00:59:53,700
right so it was like a strategy

1515
00:59:51,659 --> 00:59:55,019
yeah that's what it sounded like uh I

1516
00:59:53,699 --> 00:59:57,239
don't want to expand on it yet I'll let

1517
00:59:55,019 --> 01:00:00,599
someone else expand on it

1518
00:59:57,239 --> 01:00:01,979
when we uh do that interview at some

1519
01:00:00,599 --> 01:00:04,798
later date

1520
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:06,719
but yeah I mean it it uh one thing

1521
01:00:04,798 --> 01:00:10,318
that's very cool is that

1522
01:00:06,719 --> 01:00:11,879
uh we've done whole shows on specific

1523
01:00:10,318 --> 01:00:13,500
breeders

1524
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:15,180
um mostly because in the era that they

1525
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:18,179
came out there were so few of them a lot

1526
01:00:15,179 --> 01:00:19,500
of them dominated the game yeah uh and

1527
01:00:18,179 --> 01:00:22,199
even in the era we just talked about

1528
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:23,818
with the cups there was really not that

1529
01:00:22,199 --> 01:00:26,279
many people in competition with one

1530
01:00:23,818 --> 01:00:28,199
another no not really when it came to

1531
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:30,480
who is breeding the actual stuff that

1532
01:00:28,199 --> 01:00:32,338
was supposedly winning these cups yeah

1533
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,780
you know it's like that era of the NBA

1534
01:00:32,338 --> 01:00:36,000
or whatever where it's like there was

1535
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:37,920
like you know 12 teams yeah or something

1536
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,539
you know where like there wasn't that

1537
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:41,099
much competition amongst each other but

1538
01:00:39,539 --> 01:00:45,358
the competition was more concentrated

1539
01:00:41,099 --> 01:00:47,039
and then the American cuffs really made

1540
01:00:45,358 --> 01:00:49,500
it a democracy

1541
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:53,460
yeah I don't think most people you know

1542
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:58,079
uh Matt CSI

1543
01:00:53,460 --> 01:01:00,119
um you know uh Shaw uh you know you

1544
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:02,940
could swamp boys you go through a whole

1545
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:05,338
list of people that like

1546
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:08,099
um a lot of people got introduced to

1547
01:01:05,338 --> 01:01:10,380
their stuff by walking past their

1548
01:01:08,099 --> 01:01:12,480
[ __ ] booth yeah

1549
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:14,338
excuse my French but what just literally

1550
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:16,679
just but just just you know there's a

1551
01:01:14,338 --> 01:01:19,380
banner yeah you're pushing through the

1552
01:01:16,679 --> 01:01:21,000
crowd and then oh there's Matt Riot yeah

1553
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:22,680
you know

1554
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,480
all that blueberry thing looks pretty

1555
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:25,980
yeah they usually didn't see me I was

1556
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:27,920
kind I'm kind of small so I'm usually

1557
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:30,780
tucked in behind I just look behind me

1558
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:32,400
there's 20 people and I'd be down in

1559
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:34,798
there somewhere there's Matt waving up

1560
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,420
from underneath underneath the uh yeah

1561
01:01:34,798 --> 01:01:39,780
yeah

1562
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:42,119
three apples High giving them a wave

1563
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:44,460
Matt's actually standing that that seat

1564
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:47,358
is just it's a fake back yeah it's a

1565
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:51,480
fake taxi I'm standing

01:01:47,358 --> 01:01:53,159
uh but yeah I mean it it uh it was

1567
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:55,500
you know a lot of times I wouldn't even

1568
01:01:53,159 --> 01:01:57,779
want to bug my friends who had booths

1569
01:01:55,500 --> 01:02:00,659
because people would wait all year to go

1570
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:02,819
talk to Caleb yeah

1571
01:02:00,659 --> 01:02:04,679

1572
01:02:02,818 --> 01:02:06,358
that they wanted from him and they

1573
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:09,118
wanted to ask him questions and like

I mean my favorite my favorite Emerald

1583
01:02:31,019 --> 01:02:33,900
cup story and I've told this to a bunch

1584
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:34,920
of people and you'll probably get a kick

1585
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:36,900
out of it you probably heard it a

1586
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:38,220
million times but I was at Emerald cup

1587
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:40,680
and

1588
01:02:38,219 --> 01:02:41,879
um this guy had emailed me beforehand

1589
01:02:40,679 --> 01:02:43,139
and I didn't really know him too well

1590
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,940
but we had talked back and forth through

1591
01:02:43,139 --> 01:02:46,739
the email and asked me to put aside some

1592
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:49,380
Clockwork Orange seeds for them and a

1593
01:02:46,739 --> 01:02:51,719
few other things but mostly that and

1594
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:53,880
um he came up to my booth and he he

1595
01:02:51,719 --> 01:02:56,939
handed me this notepad and said it had

1596

1609
01:03:24,838 --> 01:03:28,440
he comes back and he asked me so do you

1610
01:03:26,699 --> 01:03:30,298
want me to put the the discount in the

1611
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:31,559
fire fund or do you want it back so I

1612
01:03:30,298 --> 01:03:33,059
was like I put it in the fire fund that

1613
01:03:31,559 --> 01:03:36,240
ended up being Denali that's how I met

1614
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:38,880
Denali really yeah yeah that so I never

1615
01:03:36,239 --> 01:03:40,979
forgot from that from that experience

1616
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,660
out of meeting and those days like you

1617
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:44,338
would meet thousands of people and it

1618
01:03:42,659 --> 01:03:45,539
was really hard to have a memory but

1619
01:03:44,338 --> 01:03:47,519
that was like one of those ones that

1620
01:03:45,539 --> 01:03:49,219
stood out because someone did something

1621
01:03:47,519 --> 01:03:52,980
[ __ ] crazy

1622
01:03:49,219 --> 01:03:55,558
yeah I mean it was uh it's it was a big

1623
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:56,960
thing it was cool in that I like that

1624
01:03:55,559 --> 01:04:01,200
kind of like

1625
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:03,780
disorganized chaos capitalism yeah you

1626
01:04:01,199 --> 01:04:06,719
know I think sadly

1627
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:09,359
um legalization has uh stripped a lot of

1628
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:10,558
that like organic uh there's a lot of

1629
01:04:09,358 --> 01:04:12,358
people that can't have a booth there

1630
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:14,280
anymore I won't even attend it anymore

1631
01:04:12,358 --> 01:04:16,019
and not I don't say that other people

1632
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:20,099
shouldn't I just I don't have a purpose

1633
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:22,079
for going anymore now it I

1634
01:04:20,099 --> 01:04:23,519
I'm not involved in the same Community

1635
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:25,019
those people are involved in they're

1636
01:04:23,519 --> 01:04:28,500
going to that with their licenses and

1637
01:04:25,019 --> 01:04:30,000
that kind of [ __ ] so so yeah so

1638
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:32,400
obviously they're right there it's split

1639
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,079
the weed Community yeah a lot of people

1640
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,760
a lot of the people that you would want

1641
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:37,680
to go and see

1642
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:39,240
um you know people and you know people

1643
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:41,399
would use IG and other things and they

1644
01:04:39,239 --> 01:04:42,779
would find out oh Matt or Caleb or this

1645
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,920
person they're going to this event

1646
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:45,380
they're going to be at Emerald cup

1647
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:49,440
they're going to be at this High Times

1648
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:51,240
I'm going to plan and go see them yeah

1649
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:53,220
you know and people would come with

1650
01:04:51,239 --> 01:04:55,259
specific plans especially Emerald cup

1651
01:04:53,219 --> 01:04:57,058
because it was in December and back then

1652
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:58,799
people usually had Harvest money burning

1653
01:04:57,059 --> 01:05:01,619
in their pocket and it was in an era

1654
01:04:58,798 --> 01:05:03,599
where a lot of people grew seed outdoor

1655
01:05:01,619 --> 01:05:05,940
because they wanted individual

1656
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:08,220
good-sized plants

1657
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:11,039
um you know that drove a lot of sales

1658
01:05:08,219 --> 01:05:13,739
too yeah that was a major aspect of it

1659
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:16,500
there was a lot of 25 to 50 plant

1660
01:05:13,739 --> 01:05:17,939
Victory Gardens that they wanted to grow

1661
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:20,219
from seed because it was generally

1662
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:22,679
accepted you could get a bigger and more

1663
01:05:20,219 --> 01:05:24,659
vigorous plant from seed than clone so

1664
01:05:22,679 --> 01:05:26,098
if you were doing a limited number of

1665
01:05:24,659 --> 01:05:27,719
plants

1666
01:05:26,099 --> 01:05:30,480
um growing from seed you could probably

1667
01:05:27,719 --> 01:05:32,759
get more off that 25 than you could if

1668
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:34,740
it was a clone plant yeah

1669
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:36,720
if you pick the right strains and you

1670
01:05:34,739 --> 01:05:38,098
went in the right direction that was the

1671
01:05:36,719 --> 01:05:39,719
other cool thing about Emerald cup was

1672
01:05:38,099 --> 01:05:42,539
that it was a lot of

1673
01:05:39,719 --> 01:05:44,639
it was a good time to get a lot of

1674
01:05:42,539 --> 01:05:46,500
different samples of different things I

1675
01:05:44,639 --> 01:05:48,179
had released that past year from

1676
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:50,099
different Growers that year who had

1677
01:05:48,179 --> 01:05:52,558
grown it and they'd bring me samples so

1678
01:05:50,099 --> 01:05:54,660
I'd go home with shitloads of samples of

1679
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:56,819
my different strains grown in all these

1680
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:58,858
different environments so there was just

1681
01:05:56,818 --> 01:06:00,960
so much unique to that time and I don't

1682
01:05:58,858 --> 01:06:02,279
know with legalization if there's ever

1683
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,780
going to be a time where everybody can

1684
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:05,579
enjoy that unless they're you know

1685
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:08,400
multi-millionaires can can afford

1686
01:06:05,579 --> 01:06:11,039
licenses and all the other stuff I just

1687
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:12,480
don't happen again you know there's the

1688
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:14,219
old uh there's an old Grateful Dead

1689
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:16,500
saying like don't be sad it's gone be

1690
01:06:14,219 --> 01:06:18,179
glad you were there

1691
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:20,280
um and because

1692
01:06:18,179 --> 01:06:22,139
you know and when we were talking about

1693
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:24,660
all these first cups in the 90s and

1694
01:06:22,139 --> 01:06:27,239
stuff like having that kind of open swap

1695
01:06:24,659 --> 01:06:29,460
meet where thousands of of potheads and

1696
01:06:27,239 --> 01:06:31,139
Growers and Seed makers and hash makers

1697
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:33,960
and all that could mix and mingle and

1698
01:06:31,139 --> 01:06:36,538
talk yeah about their craft was

1699
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:39,059
Unthinkable back then yeah

1700
01:06:36,539 --> 01:06:41,339
you know it was really Unthinkable back

1701
01:06:39,059 --> 01:06:44,039
then I mean I mentioned it before there

1702
01:06:41,338 --> 01:06:46,798
are definitely people that believe that

1703
01:06:44,039 --> 01:06:48,960
there was a lot of of DEA and other

1704
01:06:46,798 --> 01:06:51,119
agencies scoping at a lot of those first

1705
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:52,500
cups I believe it and I was just

1706
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:54,900
thinking now I don't know if you could

1707
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:56,579
do it again even if you like found a way

1708
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:58,559
to run a black market one with all the

1709
01:06:56,579 --> 01:07:00,059
freaking snitches in our scene like

1710
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:01,260
they're just so abundant our scene

1711
01:07:00,059 --> 01:07:03,119
doesn't police itself for that anymore

1712
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:05,640
it's just a too different of a time to

1713
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:07,019
pull it off I really don't work I think

1714
01:07:05,639 --> 01:07:08,879
you could talk probably about like

1715
01:07:07,019 --> 01:07:10,858
certain areas of music or this or that

1716
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:13,559
or whatever where there's certain things

1717
01:07:10,858 --> 01:07:16,139
that develop organically and they're

1718
01:07:13,559 --> 01:07:18,059
only there while that persists and then

1719
01:07:16,139 --> 01:07:20,519
when you lose it it's it shifts and it's

1720
01:07:18,059 --> 01:07:22,859
not the same as it was yeah

1721
01:07:20,519 --> 01:07:26,280
um and I think you know I think in

1722
01:07:22,858 --> 01:07:28,798
addition to you know cops became really

1723
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:31,440
away for Because by the time that a lot

1724
01:07:28,798 --> 01:07:33,298
of these big cops were happening again

1725
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:34,858
um people were willing to show their

1726
01:07:33,298 --> 01:07:36,538
faces and show up

1727
01:07:34,858 --> 01:07:38,460
people were willing to associate

1728
01:07:36,539 --> 01:07:40,200
themselves with I grew this and I have

1729
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:42,179
this and I'm bringing pounds of weed

1730
01:07:40,199 --> 01:07:43,679
yeah and I'm going to keep it in my

1731
01:07:42,179 --> 01:07:46,679
booth and I'm not going to be arrested

1732
01:07:43,679 --> 01:07:48,298
yeah I remember even being sketched one

1733
01:07:46,679 --> 01:07:50,338
of the first times when they when Tim

1734
01:07:48,298 --> 01:07:53,280
first moved it because I used to go to

1735
01:07:50,338 --> 01:07:54,719
it up in uh in Mendo when it was thrown

1736
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:57,420
up there and it was much smaller and I

1737
01:07:54,719 --> 01:07:59,939
remember I got there on a Saturday the

1738
01:07:57,420 --> 01:08:01,680
the first year it was in Santa Rosa yeah

1739
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:02,880
and I was walking up to the front door

1740
01:08:01,679 --> 01:08:04,379
and there was this dude that was like

1741
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:06,358
all waddling past me and he was all

1742
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:09,559
[ __ ] happy as he was happy as can be

1743
01:08:06,358 --> 01:08:11,759
and he had like a box full of plants

1744
01:08:09,559 --> 01:08:13,019
that you know and it's like they're just

1745
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:15,539
sticking out the top and he's like

1746
01:08:13,019 --> 01:08:18,600
walking to his car and I had this moment

1747
01:08:15,539 --> 01:08:20,640
of like uh you know of just having been

1748
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:22,980
so secret for so long I was like man

1749
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:27,119
things are really changing yeah

1750
01:08:22,979 --> 01:08:29,039
yeah you know and then you walk in right

1751
01:08:27,119 --> 01:08:31,019
and all of a sudden you're like

1752
01:08:29,039 --> 01:08:32,640
especially from someone who who grew up

1753
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:35,819
in an era where like plant counts were

1754
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:38,640
very important right and you know 100

1755
01:08:35,819 --> 01:08:40,620
could be a five-year fan you know uh

1756
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:42,480
mandatory minimum federal sentence and

1757
01:08:40,619 --> 01:08:43,738
this and that then you walk into these

1758
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:45,959
things and there was an ERA where there

1759
01:08:43,738 --> 01:08:48,298
was clone sellers that had like 8 000

1760
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:52,198
cuttings for sale yeah

1761
01:08:48,298 --> 01:08:54,600
just racks racks of them racks of rooted

1762
01:08:52,198 --> 01:08:56,759
cuttings and you were like whoa

1763
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:59,640
there you know what I remember one year

1764
01:08:56,759 --> 01:09:01,560
I was at a booth with a nursery and I

1765
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:04,199
was selling seeds but everybody who

1766
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:07,319
thought that the Clones behind me were

1767
01:09:04,198 --> 01:09:09,059
my stuff and right I remember that

1768
01:09:07,319 --> 01:09:10,739
caused so much chaos because everybody's

1769
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:12,539
like yeah can I get a clone of that and

1770
01:09:10,738 --> 01:09:16,198
that it's yours right it's on this list

1771
01:09:12,539 --> 01:09:17,519
oh my God that comment you pinned you

1772
01:09:16,198 --> 01:09:19,379
know in Chicago when I lived in Chicago

1773
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:21,719
I used to make friends that had a

1774
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:24,480
totally clean lifestyle drive me to the

1775
01:09:21,719 --> 01:09:26,279
grow store yeah because of their license

1776
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:28,738
plate

1777
01:09:26,279 --> 01:09:31,319
you know yeah I knew it dude who would

1778
01:09:28,738 --> 01:09:32,939
wear [ __ ] wigs and all kinds of

1779
01:09:31,319 --> 01:09:35,160
costumes on the way to the grocery store

1780
01:09:32,939 --> 01:09:37,139
and it wasn't a few cars yeah it wasn't

1781
01:09:35,159 --> 01:09:38,818
like boxes of clones was anything weird

1782
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:40,859
or we hadn't been doing that among our

1783
01:09:38,819 --> 01:09:42,900
friends for a while it was just like you

1784
01:09:40,859 --> 01:09:45,120
were walking down the sidewalk in Santa

1785
01:09:42,899 --> 01:09:46,559
Rosa it's a big Fairground for people

1786

Fairgrounds you're just like out there

1788
01:09:48,119 --> 01:09:51,659
like right in the open in the most open

1789
01:09:49,859 --> 01:09:53,039
sidewalk and everything it's like you

1790
01:09:51,659 --> 01:09:54,659
know tons and there's cop and like

1791
01:09:53,039 --> 01:09:56,100
you're just walking all happily down the

1792
01:09:54,659 --> 01:09:58,019
street with a bunch of rooted plants and

1793
01:09:56,100 --> 01:10:02,160
I was like oh

1794
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:04,320
weird yeah you know weird yeah we don't

1795
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:05,639
expect that okay and then you go in

1796
01:10:04,319 --> 01:10:08,698
there and you're like man people have

1797
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:11,100
tons of dabs tons of tons of jars tons

1798
01:10:08,698 --> 01:10:12,659
of clones all kinds of stuff that if it

1799
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:15,840
was like in your car and you got pulled

1800
01:10:12,659 --> 01:10:17,880
over would might be a mess yeah even if

1801
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:19,679
you were fully like medical and

1802
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:21,119
legitimate and went to clubs and all

1803
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:23,819
that type of man it would still be a

1804
01:10:21,119 --> 01:10:26,698
mess but it was like an accepted gray

1805
01:10:23,819 --> 01:10:29,579
area like you were on base

1806
01:10:26,698 --> 01:10:32,759
yeah right depending on where you live

1807
01:10:29,579 --> 01:10:34,140
like I see dudes come to to my city and

1808
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:36,300
like they'll be smoking a joint on the

1809
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:37,800
street like it's nothing because they

1810
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:39,539
think it's California and you're cool

1811
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:41,760
and this is just they're still hot

1812
01:10:39,539 --> 01:10:43,380
places in California where if you do

1813
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,699
that you're gonna get nailed so fast and

1814
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:46,199
they don't give a [ __ ] if you have a

1815
01:10:44,698 --> 01:10:48,299
license or any of that they're gonna let

1816
01:10:46,198 --> 01:10:52,500
you go to court and figure it out so

1817
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:54,360
yeah you know that that I uh it was it

1818
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:57,238
is cool in the sense that there was like

1819
01:10:54,359 --> 01:10:59,639
an equilibrium at that time so

1820
01:10:57,238 --> 01:11:00,539
anytime you could feel free and open and

1821
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:03,000
safe

1822
01:11:00,539 --> 01:11:05,039
in our community is a blessing yeah

1823
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:07,800
that's for sure because it wasn't like

1824
01:11:05,039 --> 01:11:10,079
that for a long time and so I think

1825
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:13,860
um I would say that the emerald Cup

1826
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:15,719
itself probably turned into part

1827
01:11:13,859 --> 01:11:20,219
um part business

1828
01:11:15,719 --> 01:11:22,800
part economic part award uh and then a

1829
01:11:20,219 --> 01:11:24,600
big family gathering yeah

1830
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:26,159
where all these people would come in

1831
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:28,980
from all over the place from Colorado

1832
01:11:26,158 --> 01:11:33,479
from Washington from Humboldt from Mendo

1833
01:11:28,979 --> 01:11:34,979
from the Bay from LA and mingle yeah

1834
01:11:33,479 --> 01:11:37,319
you know

1835
01:11:34,979 --> 01:11:38,698
um and all that and you know cannabis

1836
01:11:37,319 --> 01:11:40,738
has not really been able to have

1837
01:11:38,698 --> 01:11:43,919
conventions

1838
01:11:40,738 --> 01:11:46,379
no well I mean not not at that point no

1839
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:49,619
no so it sort of doubled it it sort of

1840
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:50,940
like did all these different duties

1841
01:11:49,619 --> 01:11:52,500
you know

1842
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:54,359
um and then it changed too because most

1843
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:55,859
of the time the [ __ ] that was winning it

1844
01:11:54,359 --> 01:11:57,779
wasn't even that easy to go out and get

1845
01:11:55,859 --> 01:12:00,779
those and figure out like it wasn't the

1846
01:11:57,779 --> 01:12:03,119
same like it was from Greenhouse no

1847
01:12:00,779 --> 01:12:04,979
you know it was like oh this person won

1848
01:12:03,119 --> 01:12:07,260
with sugary from some spot in

1849
01:12:04,979 --> 01:12:09,419
Laytonville yeah I don't know how to get

1850
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:11,039
that weed yeah a lot of the times it was

1851
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:13,380
like that early on

1852
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:16,019
um it I think over time it did turn into

1853
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:18,300
more of uh only things winning that you

1854
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:21,000
could buy seeds of because that is where

1855
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:22,380
the money came you know was directed it

1856
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,439
definitely got more like that at the end

1857
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:27,779
of the cups yeah I mean everything you

1858
01:12:25,439 --> 01:12:30,899
know everything that's wild and free and

1859
01:12:27,779 --> 01:12:33,539
unregulated eventually loses some of the

1860
01:12:30,899 --> 01:12:36,599
wildness and and and they start acting

1861
01:12:33,539 --> 01:12:39,479
rationally in terms of money and and it

1862
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:41,699
morphs into different things

1863
01:12:39,479 --> 01:12:44,759
um and then it you know it becomes what

1864
01:12:41,698 --> 01:12:47,639
the regulations and the rules allow yeah

1865
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:50,400
now it's sort of like a cooler image

1866
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:52,980
it's like a it's like an industry meet

1867
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:54,479
yeah much more so than like a gathering

1868
01:12:52,979 --> 01:12:56,639
like a bunch of important people don't

1869
01:12:54,479 --> 01:12:58,919
even go anymore to me I think it's more

1870
01:12:56,640 --> 01:13:01,079
like MJ bizcon and I don't see a lot of

1871
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:02,760
difference like I mean maybe they still

1872
01:13:01,079 --> 01:13:05,279
do Awards I think they have a separate

1873
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:07,140
Awards event they moved it to La too

1874
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:08,579
which is even funnier because

1875
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:10,679
one of the things that was cool about

1876
01:13:08,579 --> 01:13:12,359
Emerald cup was that it started in Mendo

1877
01:13:10,679 --> 01:13:14,940
so it was done by people from the

1878
01:13:12,359 --> 01:13:16,380
triangle and old Growers from the

1879
01:13:14,939 --> 01:13:18,539
triangle and it was a big family

1880
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:21,060
gathering and then even when it moved to

1881
01:13:18,539 --> 01:13:23,819
Santa Rosa it was still NorCal Sonoma

1882
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:27,539
County is is very much still you know

1883
01:13:23,819 --> 01:13:30,059
the the very southern tip of that bubble

1884
01:13:27,539 --> 01:13:31,679
you know uh but once it's in LA and it's

1885
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:33,840
in a theater and it's Awards I mean I

1886
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:35,460
get it they're they're moving with the

1887
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:37,980
industry Trends it's not going to be

1888
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:39,239
what it was so is this Emerald cup that

1889
01:13:37,979 --> 01:13:42,599
everybody's talking about going to going

1890
01:13:39,238 --> 01:13:45,000
to be in LA or Santa Rosa it's now

1891
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:48,420
is it going right now last weekend right

1892
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:50,039
now yeah right now in L.A in Santa Rosa

1893
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:51,420
okay that's why I didn't they call it

1894
01:13:50,039 --> 01:13:53,640
they call it I believe it's like they

1895
01:13:51,420 --> 01:13:55,800
call it the emerald ball now

1896
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:58,320
I got some [ __ ] Emerald balls for

1897
01:13:55,800 --> 01:14:01,320
them you know and then I do believe they

1898
01:13:58,319 --> 01:14:03,179
have like a separate ceremony in La yeah

1899
01:14:01,319 --> 01:14:05,698
but it got a little convoluted with

1900
01:14:03,179 --> 01:14:07,319
covid for a few years there and not

1901
01:14:05,698 --> 01:14:08,879
being able to have those kind of events

1902
01:14:07,319 --> 01:14:10,859
and then they did a separate event in La

1903
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:12,840
last year so I don't know exactly how

1904
01:14:10,859 --> 01:14:14,579
they're going to shake it all out yeah

1905
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:16,440
but for a minute it seemed like they

1906
01:14:14,579 --> 01:14:18,960
were going to abandon NorCal for La

1907
01:14:16,439 --> 01:14:21,000
which was going to be kind of shitty

1908
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:23,640
um but it does appear that they're still

1909
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:26,279
throwing a party up there how weird is

1910
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:29,100
it and I'll leave names out that the

1911
01:14:26,279 --> 01:14:32,219
owner of emerald cup was giving awards

1912
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:34,860
to his daughter soon to be husband

1913
01:14:32,219 --> 01:14:36,658
and smashing all the cups with it was

1914
01:14:34,859 --> 01:14:37,979
did was that ever heavily debated or

1915
01:14:36,658 --> 01:14:40,979
talked about

1916
01:14:37,979 --> 01:14:43,799
I mean there's not uh as we talked about

1917
01:14:40,979 --> 01:14:45,899
in the beginning we were trying to avoid

1918
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:47,219
specific instances because you know you

1919
01:14:45,899 --> 01:14:49,619
don't want to battle over a certain

1920
01:14:47,219 --> 01:14:51,960
ground but certainly

1921
01:14:49,619 --> 01:14:55,439
um there's whenever there's money and

1922
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:58,439
Prestige right and all that stuff on the

1923
01:14:55,439 --> 01:14:59,819
lot reputation on the line uh economics

1924
01:14:58,439 --> 01:15:02,039
on the line

1925
01:14:59,819 --> 01:15:04,319
um that's why people debate whether how

1926
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:05,460
legitimate any cup could be and then

1927
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:07,500
there's people that get a little bit of

1928
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:09,179
inside information and decide that seems

1929
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:11,579
kind of sketchy

1930
01:15:09,179 --> 01:15:14,399
um in lots of awards uh family members

1931
01:15:11,579 --> 01:15:15,960
and close friends can't participate yeah

1932
01:15:14,399 --> 01:15:18,599
um but that's not true of cannabis

1933
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:22,560
Awards apparently not it is definitely

1934
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:24,480
enough yeah you know and um you know and

1935
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:27,120
so you know doesn't it does you know

1936
01:15:24,479 --> 01:15:29,339
there's nepotistic things that occur

1937
01:15:27,119 --> 01:15:31,260
certainly and there's friendships and

1938
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:33,539
there's beefs and there's in crowds and

1939
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:35,219
out crowds and weed and

1940
01:15:33,539 --> 01:15:37,560
um you know I don't even know how blind

1941
01:15:35,219 --> 01:15:39,480
some of the blind stuff is yeah and then

1942
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:41,280
if it is blind you have a group of

1943
01:15:39,479 --> 01:15:44,339
people and it's just their expression of

1944
01:15:41,279 --> 01:15:46,139
prejudices yeah and even even with all

1945
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:47,880
that you're you're it's still the honor

1946
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:50,039
System saying this is this strain I'm

1947
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:51,480
presenting you I mean I'm I'm pretty

1948
01:15:50,039 --> 01:15:53,100
sure without I'm not going to get into

1949
01:15:51,479 --> 01:15:56,039
specifics but I'm pretty sure there was

1950
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:57,780
at times some some weed that that was

1951
01:15:56,039 --> 01:16:00,539
winning quite a bit that was not very

1952
01:15:57,779 --> 01:16:02,039
pretty uh that was entered into the sun

1953
01:16:00,539 --> 01:16:04,560
grown categories and stuff like that

1954
01:16:02,039 --> 01:16:06,719
that was grown underneath uh multiple

1955
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:08,820
nice uh indoor lighting like

1956
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:10,079
supplemental indoor lighting yeah like

1957
01:16:08,819 --> 01:16:11,279
you have a little section that you're

1958
01:16:10,079 --> 01:16:13,140
growing your stuff you're going to enter

1959
01:16:11,279 --> 01:16:15,000
and it's in the greenhouse and it's got

1960
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:17,219
the Sun hitting it but it's also got

1961
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,300
Ceramics and some LEDs and some of this

1962
01:16:17,219 --> 01:16:21,000
and some of that and it gets extra

1963
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:22,560
special sauce and yeah it's Sun grown

1964
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,840
and then it comes out looking like crazy

1965
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:25,620
and all of a sudden it's winning and you

1966
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:28,140
know

1967
01:16:25,619 --> 01:16:30,960
um because people we come from a culture

1968
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:33,360
that bends or ignores rules yeah I mean

1969
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:36,179
there people will do anything to win

1970
01:16:33,359 --> 01:16:37,619
yeah especially when maybe if you win

1971
01:16:36,179 --> 01:16:40,140
you know

1972
01:16:37,619 --> 01:16:41,760
um that that next year uh you find it

1973
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:43,320
way easier to move a lot of your

1974
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:45,719
products for higher pricing and

1975
01:16:43,319 --> 01:16:47,579
dispensaries then and then that next

1976
01:16:45,719 --> 01:16:48,960
year because you won and all your stuff

1977
01:16:47,579 --> 01:16:51,300
was in dispensaries and a bunch of

1978
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:54,600
people smoked it you have a crazy line

1979
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:57,420
out your booth for your hybrids yep

1980
01:16:54,600 --> 01:17:00,179
so there was multiple there was multiple

1981
01:16:57,420 --> 01:17:02,100
arcs like that where people won and then

1982
01:17:00,179 --> 01:17:03,658
the economic interest was great for them

1983
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:06,179
for two or three years after that there

1984
01:17:03,658 --> 01:17:08,279
was reverberations

1985
01:17:06,179 --> 01:17:11,640
so of course there's going to be that

1986
01:17:08,279 --> 01:17:13,679
kind of stuff always always you know

1987
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:15,780
that's just I just don't think people

1988
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:17,158
know you know that's a thing like

1989
01:17:15,779 --> 01:17:19,198
there's a

1990
01:17:17,158 --> 01:17:21,359
there's always the the announcements

1991
01:17:19,198 --> 01:17:22,919
there's always you know like stuff

1992
01:17:21,359 --> 01:17:24,299
that's surface level and then there's

1993
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:25,980
the stuff that like people behind the

1994
01:17:24,300 --> 01:17:28,380
scenes know and then there's stuff that

1995
01:17:25,979 --> 01:17:30,059
people in certain groups that you know

1996
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:31,260
or family friends of certain people are

1997
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:34,320
like

1998
01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:36,360
how did that fly I mean [ __ ] I guess you

1999
01:17:34,319 --> 01:17:38,460
know it just does and it's it's not just

2000
01:17:36,359 --> 01:17:39,779
one specific cup it's a lot of them it's

2001
01:17:38,460 --> 01:17:41,579
all of them and like I said even with

2002
01:17:39,779 --> 01:17:42,719
the one that I helped organize and I

2003
01:17:41,579 --> 01:17:44,279
helped plan the rules for it there were

2004
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:47,158
things that we couldn't even possibly

2005
01:17:44,279 --> 01:17:49,319
conceive of a grain jar like

2006
01:17:47,158 --> 01:17:51,839
we really thought we had it all nailed

2007
01:17:49,319 --> 01:17:53,340
out but there's always ways yeah we've

2008
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:55,260
had friends we've had friends that have

2009
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:56,460
that have judged various things and

2010
01:17:55,260 --> 01:17:59,219
they've seen things that they didn't

2011
01:17:56,460 --> 01:18:01,140
think were the greatest you know uh

2012
01:17:59,219 --> 01:18:03,359
behind the scenes

2013
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:04,860
um and you know there's uh there's a lot

2014
01:18:03,359 --> 01:18:07,198
of pressure now I think

2015
01:18:04,859 --> 01:18:09,119
I think a lot of those cups they were

2016
01:18:07,198 --> 01:18:11,339
making so much money renting out

2017
01:18:09,119 --> 01:18:13,439
expensive small amounts of Booth space

2018
01:18:11,340 --> 01:18:16,020
to all of you guys yeah

2019
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:18,000
um that just just throwing them was

2020
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:19,560
highly profitable for them they were

2021
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:22,738
making millions up just the booth space

2022
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:24,480
it's ridiculous yeah um so you know

2023
01:18:22,738 --> 01:18:26,099
there was there was that there was a

2024
01:18:24,479 --> 01:18:28,379
desire to throw more and more and more

2025
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:30,120
of them right

2026
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:32,159
um and now with all the rules and

2027
01:18:30,119 --> 01:18:34,559
regulations and all that other types of

2028
01:18:32,158 --> 01:18:36,420
stuff it's taken a lot of the soul out

2029
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:38,219
of it

2030
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:40,619
and it's also just the competition of

2031
01:18:38,219 --> 01:18:42,119
people that can afford licenses yeah and

2032
01:18:40,619 --> 01:18:44,099
there's one more thing I want to talk

2033
01:18:42,119 --> 01:18:46,140
about before we I mean we're getting

2034
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:46,920
okay

2035
01:18:46,140 --> 01:18:50,039
um

2036
01:18:46,920 --> 01:18:52,140
is judging and you know I talked about

2037
01:18:50,039 --> 01:18:53,158
it briefly in the gangier part you know

2038
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:56,640
when they were talking about how they

2039
01:18:53,158 --> 01:18:59,219
select their judges or whatnot I noticed

2040
01:18:56,640 --> 01:19:01,159
that a lot of times at even some of

2041
01:18:59,219 --> 01:19:04,619
these prestigious events

2042
01:19:01,158 --> 01:19:05,759
judging isn't necessarily based on the

2043
01:19:04,619 --> 01:19:08,039
most

2044
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:11,100
skilled people in the room at assessing

2045
01:19:08,039 --> 01:19:14,219
cannabis in fact most often that is not

2046
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:16,199
the case when it comes to judging

2047
01:19:14,219 --> 01:19:19,859
um there A lot of times it's people

2048
01:19:16,198 --> 01:19:22,139
paying they pay for their judges pass or

2049
01:19:19,859 --> 01:19:24,119
their they pay for their judges kit

2050
01:19:22,140 --> 01:19:27,500
where they get all kinds of extracts or

2051
01:19:24,119 --> 01:19:29,760
Buds and

2052
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:32,460
it's very hard for me to understand

2053
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:36,179
someone that is new to cannabis being

2054
01:19:32,460 --> 01:19:39,539
able to have a qualified nose

2055
01:19:36,179 --> 01:19:42,000
um any of it really I mean how what are

2056
01:19:39,539 --> 01:19:44,219
you basing your whole or you know it's

2057
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:46,079
another aspect too where it's like it

2058
01:19:44,219 --> 01:19:48,420
might be just a collection of Industry

2059
01:19:46,079 --> 01:19:50,698
people and people associated with the

2060
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:52,440
people throwing the event yeah

2061
01:19:50,698 --> 01:19:54,359
you know and in some cases you're like

2062
01:19:52,439 --> 01:19:56,579
oh here's a random assortment of

2063
01:19:54,359 --> 01:19:59,819
different kinds of Stoners it's fair

2064
01:19:56,579 --> 01:20:02,039
the family buy your way in though blows

2065
01:19:59,819 --> 01:20:04,439
my mind blows my mind and that's for a

2066
01:20:02,039 --> 01:20:07,260
lot of these big extracts caps too like

2067
01:20:04,439 --> 01:20:10,678
just below buy your way into judge so

2068
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:13,020
I'm gonna put something in and let some

2069
01:20:10,679 --> 01:20:15,420
random ass kid that may have smoked

2070
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:17,580
twice in his life judge it doesn't make

2071
01:20:15,420 --> 01:20:19,560
any sense that's the thing it's like

2072
01:20:17,579 --> 01:20:21,300
it's totally unregulated and there's no

2073
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:23,760
penalties and there's no outside body

2074
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:26,400
governing any of it yeah so it's all the

2075
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:27,719
honor System and like you said

2076
01:20:26,399 --> 01:20:29,399
um I mean that's part of the reason why

2077
01:20:27,719 --> 01:20:30,840
we do these shows is like because

2078
01:20:29,399 --> 01:20:33,719
there's a bunch of stuff we talk about

2079
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:35,340
all the time that isn't well known yeah

2080
01:20:33,719 --> 01:20:37,380
you know a lot of people part of the

2081
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:39,779
reason why the the cups thing works so

2082
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:41,340
well is because for the a lot of smokers

2083
01:20:39,779 --> 01:20:43,920
they're just like oh my God that must be

2084
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:45,539
some of the best [ __ ] out there yeah and

2085
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:47,760
they don't have the Nuance to it you

2086
01:20:45,539 --> 01:20:49,260
know yeah they don't know the context

2087
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,219
yeah exactly they don't have the context

2088
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:51,960
they don't they don't know the

2089
01:20:50,219 --> 01:20:53,460
characters involved personally or

2090
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:55,079
whatever you know

2091
01:20:53,460 --> 01:20:56,819
um and it's not to say that like it's

2092
01:20:55,079 --> 01:20:59,340
all corrupt or whatever all the time

2093
01:20:56,819 --> 01:21:01,198
it's just people have their belief

2094
01:20:59,340 --> 01:21:03,539
systems and they're influenced by what

2095
01:21:01,198 --> 01:21:06,899
they like and what they don't like

2096
01:21:03,539 --> 01:21:09,738
um and uh you know and and then you know

2097
01:21:06,899 --> 01:21:09,738
there's there's

2098
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:14,460
it's like in food like anything that

2099
01:21:12,899 --> 01:21:17,639
doesn't have a legal definition like

2100
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:20,100
natural yeah it doesn't actually have a

2101
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:23,640
real meaning it's an advertising meaning

2102
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:26,699
yeah I went over that one yeah so you

2103
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:28,980
know so uh so cannabis judging right now

2104
01:21:26,698 --> 01:21:31,678
is absolutely subjective

2105
01:21:28,979 --> 01:21:33,119
yeah very much so and like I said to the

2106
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:35,819
point of where

2107
01:21:33,119 --> 01:21:37,979
judge calling it judging may be a little

2108
01:21:35,819 --> 01:21:38,639
stretch and then a nice way of putting

2109
01:21:37,979 --> 01:21:40,259
it

2110
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:42,900
the other part of it is let's say that

2111
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:46,560
you're totally Advanced and that you are

2112
01:21:42,899 --> 01:21:49,859
uh uh Titan in your field and all kinds

2113
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:51,120
of people respect you you know and you

2114
01:21:49,859 --> 01:21:52,920
know let's just you know and you're

2115
01:21:51,119 --> 01:21:54,658
you're in the hash game or whatever and

2116
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:56,640
everybody loves the hash you make and

2117
01:21:54,658 --> 01:21:59,158
you're really good at it and you have a

2118
01:21:56,640 --> 01:22:00,239
fine nose for it right and you're

2119
01:21:59,158 --> 01:22:03,319
definitely one of the people that could

2120
01:22:00,238 --> 01:22:07,439
be judging sure and then you're smoking

2121
01:22:03,319 --> 01:22:10,738
20 dabs in five in in two hours yeah

2122
01:22:07,439 --> 01:22:12,779
yeah like the effect of each individual

2123
01:22:10,738 --> 01:22:14,639
dab and like what it does to you and how

2124
01:22:12,779 --> 01:22:17,279
it makes you feel or even if you're

2125
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:19,079
smoking 20 joints in the course of a few

2126
01:22:17,279 --> 01:22:21,179
hours of different weed and you're

2127
01:22:19,079 --> 01:22:23,399
layering all those effects and highs on

2128
01:22:21,179 --> 01:22:25,739
top of each other it's not like you're

2129
01:22:23,399 --> 01:22:27,299
waking up in the morning smoking a joint

2130
01:22:25,738 --> 01:22:29,218
of this

2131
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:30,659
going about your business and really

2132
01:22:29,219 --> 01:22:32,640
getting a sense for what that one thing

2133
01:22:30,658 --> 01:22:34,738
does yeah

2134
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:37,320
you know so unless there are some places

2135
01:22:34,738 --> 01:22:39,718
that give you samples ahead of time and

2136
01:22:37,319 --> 01:22:41,698
have you take a bunch of notes

2137
01:22:39,719 --> 01:22:43,439
um but there are there are there's also

2138
01:22:41,698 --> 01:22:45,960
like uh

2139
01:22:43,439 --> 01:22:47,819
um just back to back to back to back to

2140
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:50,600
back to back yeah

2141
01:22:47,819 --> 01:22:53,698
right and then how well can you judge

2142
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:55,260
typically when I smoke 10 or 15 kinds of

2143
01:22:53,698 --> 01:22:58,759
weed that I don't smoke on a daily basis

2144
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:58,760
I get ripped yeah

2145
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:03,179
yeah yeah it's just what happened you

2146
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:04,920
know I smoke a bunch of my friends weed

2147
01:23:03,179 --> 01:23:06,420
you know and it's weed that I don't I

2148
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:08,699
don't smoke very often and it's all

2149
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:09,899
rapid fire and I'm just join after joint

2150
01:23:08,698 --> 01:23:12,359
after joint

2151
01:23:09,899 --> 01:23:14,819
yeah you know I might not be the best

2152
01:23:12,359 --> 01:23:16,559
judge that day yeah

2153
01:23:14,819 --> 01:23:18,119
you know

2154
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:22,020
um I don't know if you don't like the

2155
01:23:18,119 --> 01:23:25,198
way that I matched my uh my my clothing

2156
01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:26,400
to this lovely chair behind me I think

2157
01:23:25,198 --> 01:23:28,979
it's pretty good you did a good job

2158
01:23:26,399 --> 01:23:31,639
matching it I went through you know

2159
01:23:28,979 --> 01:23:34,019
there was a huge debate in my prep team

2160
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:35,940
uh on uh

2161
01:23:34,020 --> 01:23:37,560
you know the designers that you have

2162
01:23:35,939 --> 01:23:40,319
sponsoring you I know it's a big wide

2163
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:42,300
choice in your wardrobe it's all the it

2164
01:23:40,319 --> 01:23:45,359
but it really does is it accents all my

2165
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:47,640
face makeup you know and that gives me

2166
01:23:45,359 --> 01:23:49,738
that natural tone that I'm after yeah

2167
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:52,560
it's good it's working well for you son

2168
01:23:49,738 --> 01:23:54,178
so

2169
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:56,520
so yeah I mean

2170
01:23:54,179 --> 01:23:58,440
so we're at one minute or I'm sorry one

2171
01:23:56,520 --> 01:24:01,320
hour 23 minutes we'll probably cut this

2172
01:23:58,439 --> 01:24:03,000
one a little bit short but I wanted to

2173
01:24:01,319 --> 01:24:05,460
um let everybody know we're going to be

2174
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:07,380
doing the show at a different time now I

2175
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:09,000
mentioned briefly on Instagram you're

2176
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:11,039
going to start doing the shows on

2177
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:12,719
Saturdays after this show there's the

2178
01:24:11,039 --> 01:24:17,039
last one on Fridays we're going to start

2179
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:19,439
doing it Saturdays at 1pm Pacific

2180
01:24:17,039 --> 01:24:22,019
Standard or whatever time Pacific 1pm

2181
01:24:19,439 --> 01:24:23,460
Pacific Pacific time yeah yeah so that's

2182
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:26,159
where the the show is going to be moving

2183
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:27,899
to uh we were we were kind of looking at

2184
01:24:26,158 --> 01:24:30,119
where everyone like YouTube gives you

2185
01:24:27,899 --> 01:24:31,859
those like statistics and that seems to

2186
01:24:30,119 --> 01:24:33,300
be where everybody is watching at a good

2187
01:24:31,859 --> 01:24:34,799
time and we've noticed that people say

2188
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:36,900
like they prefer to watch it on

2189
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:38,340
Saturdays in their grow room and I know

2190
01:24:36,899 --> 01:24:40,379
this is late for the east coast and

2191
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:42,360
especially for some of our um across the

2192
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:43,800
country people and not so is back and

2193
01:24:42,359 --> 01:24:46,079
forth across the country all the time

2194
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:48,360
now and he's he's he's getting old he's

2195
01:24:46,079 --> 01:24:50,039
getting a little old in his age we worry

2196
01:24:48,359 --> 01:24:52,799
about him we worry about him staying up

2197
01:24:50,039 --> 01:24:56,039
too late so yeah is there anything else

2198
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:58,739
you wanted to get in on the this topic I

2199
01:24:56,039 --> 01:25:02,039
mean I uh I think you could just simply

2200
01:24:58,738 --> 01:25:04,079
say that uh you know cups are a little

2201
01:25:02,039 --> 01:25:05,880
bit of humanity you know there's

2202
01:25:04,079 --> 01:25:08,100
Community

2203
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:10,380
um there's meeting with people of of

2204
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:12,179
similar interests there's bringing

2205
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:13,800
different groups together that might not

2206
01:25:12,179 --> 01:25:16,319
be that might not have been friends or

2207
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:19,320
met before there was a lot of positives

2208
01:25:16,319 --> 01:25:21,059
to the different eras of the cups yeah

2209
01:25:19,319 --> 01:25:23,219
um and then obviously but you get rep

2210
01:25:21,060 --> 01:25:25,380
and you get money and you get

2211
01:25:23,219 --> 01:25:28,020
um economics involved and then you get

2212
01:25:25,380 --> 01:25:30,060
all the shadiness and the backhanded

2213
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:31,679
deals and like the how can I lock in

2214
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:33,239
money for me

2215
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:36,119
um and those kind of things go hand in

2216
01:25:33,238 --> 01:25:39,479
hand so when you hear us talking about

2217
01:25:36,119 --> 01:25:42,359
all of the ways that we fall short on a

2218
01:25:39,479 --> 01:25:44,698
perfectly ideal cup it doesn't mean that

2219
01:25:42,359 --> 01:25:48,299
uh there's not value

2220
01:25:44,698 --> 01:25:50,158
to going and seeing folks and and doing

2221
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:53,039
all that type of thing

2222
01:25:50,158 --> 01:25:56,399
um it just changes uh you know people's

2223
01:25:53,039 --> 01:25:58,800
reasons for going change yeah you know

2224
01:25:56,399 --> 01:26:00,539
and over the years they've the the whole

2225
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:02,639
existence and reason for them existing

2226
01:26:00,539 --> 01:26:04,139
have changed yeah and I mean I think

2227
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:06,480
some because they've happened for long

2228
01:26:04,139 --> 01:26:08,400
enough now some of the excitement of

2229
01:26:06,479 --> 01:26:11,099
just being able to go and meet a bunch

2230
01:26:08,399 --> 01:26:12,599
of people and put faces to names yeah

2231
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:15,060
you know that might just be an internet

2232
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:16,620
handle there might just be a someone you

2233
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:18,539
knew from IG or whatever but then you

2234
01:26:16,619 --> 01:26:20,579
get to spend a few hours with them and

2235
01:26:18,539 --> 01:26:21,899
and break bread or whatever

2236
01:26:20,579 --> 01:26:24,600
um because you met at the cup and get

2237
01:26:21,899 --> 01:26:26,460
baked and exchanged some cool [ __ ] yeah

2238
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:28,980
um that was a neat aspect for a while

2239
01:26:26,460 --> 01:26:30,480
it's become more common now so it's not

2240
01:26:28,979 --> 01:26:32,399
as exciting

2241
01:26:30,479 --> 01:26:34,738
um but in the beginning

2242
01:26:32,399 --> 01:26:37,319
um it was it felt pretty special for a

2243
01:26:34,738 --> 01:26:39,658
good long time it did and you got to

2244
01:26:37,319 --> 01:26:41,399
meet some of the most amazing people

2245
01:26:39,658 --> 01:26:42,599
that you could meet in the industry at

2246
01:26:41,399 --> 01:26:45,179
one point

2247
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:48,000
so for all those reasons I have mostly

2248
01:26:45,179 --> 01:26:49,859
positive memories of it yeah I will say

2249
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,479
something funny though and this isn't

2250
01:26:49,859 --> 01:26:52,799
going to knock anybody but I remember

2251
01:26:51,479 --> 01:26:55,500
going to the cup

2252
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:57,060
and I thought to myself especially when

2253
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:59,399
it was in Santa Rosa I'm like we are the

2254
01:26:57,060 --> 01:27:03,060
worst dressed group of people there is

2255
01:26:59,399 --> 01:27:05,939
this dude and he looks like he went to

2256
01:27:03,060 --> 01:27:07,920
go transplant you know in his car hearts

2257
01:27:05,939 --> 01:27:09,599
in his ripped shirt that day and then

2258
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:12,179
sweated and then rolled down the dirt

2259
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:15,000
Hill and then drove to the cup yeah but

2260
01:27:12,179 --> 01:27:17,158
in his hand he's got like a fifteen

2261
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:19,380
thousand dollar dab rate yeah right

2262
01:27:17,158 --> 01:27:20,759
right and a really nice fanny pack you

2263
01:27:19,380 --> 01:27:23,279
know and so you think oh that person

2264
01:27:20,760 --> 01:27:25,079
looks homeless except for their carrying

2265
01:27:23,279 --> 01:27:27,179
around this like foot tall piece of

2266
01:27:25,079 --> 01:27:29,179
glass that's like worth a small car yeah

2267
01:27:27,179 --> 01:27:31,679
